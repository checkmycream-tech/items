            <li>Love this perfume soooo much</li>
            <li>Smells so good that my teenage daughter keeps borrowing it.</li>
            <li>It is very feminine and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, ITS SMELLS LIKE SUGAR AND LAST FOR A GOOD TIME</li>
            <li>To me it smells like sweet grapefruit, but not in a \\&quot;too</li>
            <li>My new favorite perfume..is light and fresh smelling</li>
            <li>I love the of this perfume actually I would order more...</li>
            <li>because i Naver heard of it before i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money on something that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it smell good</li>
            <li>Got shipped right away and the smell was the same as in you get it at the mall :) will have to buy another one I love the smell</li>
            <li>This was MUCH more reasonable and just as good as my other bottle.</li>
            <li>sure enough it was on here for much cheaper and got here very quickly!</li>
            <li>At first you think it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li>This was the right price for us.</li>
            <li>right now it still is</li>
            <li>i love the scent and it is the first perfume that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in a rash, as i am extremely sensitive to scents, fragrances, and dyes.</li>
            <li>will diffenitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>its my first time to used it</li>
            <li>And it was so much cheaper than what they were trying to sell me at the mall!</li>
            <li>Came on the first day that it was said to.come in on.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>If you like a &amp;#34;fruitier&amp;#34; scent then you will most likely like this perfume.  </li>
            <li>it is the same perfume I bough at the &amp;#34;perfume outlet&amp;#34; for more than 3 times what I paid here.</li>
            <li>only thing that i love is the design.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t gonna order it at first</li>
            <li>and I have got so many compliments from a lot of different people.</li>
            <li>so pretty y just spray some on to&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li>that pretty</li>
            <li>ever and the smell last all day without it being overwhelming</li>
            <li>For as much as I paid, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied until i smelled Pure Pink...</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than the Pure Couture (baby pink bottle).</li>
            <li>I USE THIS PERFUME WAY TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>For the price I guess I couldn&#x27;t really expect originality.</li>
            <li>It was not really what I thought but ok.</li>
            <li>i cant really describe it...</li>
            <li>I found this product on amazon for a much lower price than I could in the malls or stores.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, my daughter thinks it smells like Cotton Candy.</li>
            <li>REALLY have that fruit smell.</li>
            <li>but it cost way too much, like $30 for the bottle</li>
            <li>it has a cute/classy scent, very girlie</li>
            <li>i dont ues it that much</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique and last all day.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give my husband a headache like most other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle again because my husband kept saying my new perfume was not as appealing to him as the PINK.  </li>
            <li>Will keep buying as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I get compliments regularly and my teenage daughter steals a spray or two more often that  I probably catch her.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other fragrances from Karen Low I, myself like to be able to sample the fragrances before purchasing because everything doesn&#x27;t smell right on everybody.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and sweet smelling but not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and will be purchasing another soon.</li>
            <li>Fresh daily wearable smell.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for tho</li>
            <li>I have miss dior cherie, vancleefs feerie, amor amor, trishmcevoy 9, givency harvest collector perfumes,victoria secret heavenly forevr and all of thier good ones.....</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet and long lasting parfum.</li>
            <li>we bought that parfum for my little sis (13 years old), great smell for little ladies.</li>
            <li>:) unfortunately we bought it at our local mall and paid more than 50 dollar for it.</li>
            <li>This perfume never gets old!</li>
            <li>but I pair $50.00 for the exact same amount and type of product.</li>
            <li>I have worn Pink Sugar a sweet feminine fragrance since it&#x27;s introduction into the market.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t strong and overtaking even if sprayed on heavily.  </li>
            <li>The price unreal under $16 for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Not too young for me</li>
            <li>I had been using this perfume for years, then i moved away from home and one day dropped the bottle and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me</li>
            <li>I am gladly surprised by the perfume as well for its price.</li>
            <li>Not all cheap things are a waste of money.</li>
            <li>It is my husbands favorite parfume on me and my other one was almost empty!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get a new one when this one finishes...</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same as the other one I had</li>
            <li>/&gt;Karen Low Pure Pink Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce</li>
            <li>The smells is sweeter and less chemical smelling than the Pure Couture.</li>
            <li>Now seeing it online less than a year later really pisses me off.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, ITS SMELLS LIKE SUGAR AND LAST FOR A GOOD TIME</li>
            <li> To me it smells like sweet grapefruit, but not in a \\&quot;too</li>

            <li> I love the of this perfume actually I would order more...</li>
            <li> because i Naver heard of it before i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money on something that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it smell good</li>
            <li> Got shipped right away and the smell was the same as in you get it at the mall :) will have to buy another one I love the smell</li>
            <li> This was MUCH more reasonable and just as good as my other bottle.</li>
            <li> sure enough it was on here for much cheaper and got here very quickly!</li>
            <li> At first you think it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li> This was the right price for us.</li>
            <li> right now it still is</li>
            <li> i love the scent and it is the first perfume that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in a rash, as i am extremely sensitive to scents, fragrances, and dyes.</li>
            <li> will diffenitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> its my first time to used it</li>
            <li> And it was so much cheaper than what they were trying to sell me at the mall!</li>
            <li> Came on the first day that it was said to.come in on.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> If you like a &amp;#34;fruitier&amp;#34; scent then you will most likely like this perfume.  </li>
            <li> it is the same perfume I bough at the &amp;#34;perfume outlet&amp;#34; for more than 3 times what I paid here.</li>
            <li> only thing that i love is the design.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t gonna order it at first</li>
            <li> and I have got so many compliments from a lot of different people.</li>
            <li> so pretty y just spray some on to&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> that pretty</li>
            <li> ever and the smell last all day without it being overwhelming</li>
            <li> For as much as I paid, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> and it is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied until i smelled Pure Pink...</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better than the Pure Couture (baby pink bottle).</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PERFUME WAY TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li> For the price I guess I couldn&#x27;t really expect originality.</li>
            <li> It was not really what I thought but ok.</li>
            <li> i cant really describe it...</li>
            <li> I found this product on amazon for a much lower price than I could in the malls or stores.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, my daughter thinks it smells like Cotton Candy.</li>
            <li> REALLY have that fruit smell.</li>
            <li> but it cost way too much, like $30 for the bottle</li>
            <li> it has a cute/classy scent, very girlie</li>
            <li> i dont ues it that much</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unique and last all day.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give my husband a headache like most other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle again because my husband kept saying my new perfume was not as appealing to him as the PINK.  </li>
            <li> Will keep buying as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I get compliments regularly and my teenage daughter steals a spray or two more often that  I probably catch her.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other fragrances from Karen Low I, myself like to be able to sample the fragrances before purchasing because everything doesn&#x27;t smell right on everybody.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and sweet smelling but not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and will be purchasing another soon.</li>
            <li> Fresh daily wearable smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for tho</li>
            <li> I have miss dior cherie, vancleefs feerie, amor amor, trishmcevoy 9, givency harvest collector perfumes,victoria secret heavenly forevr and all of thier good ones.....</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and long lasting parfum.</li>
            <li> we bought that parfum for my little sis (13 years old), great smell for little ladies.</li>
            <li> :) unfortunately we bought it at our local mall and paid more than 50 dollar for it.</li>
            <li> This perfume never gets old!</li>
            <li> but I pair $50.00 for the exact same amount and type of product.</li>
            <li> I have worn Pink Sugar a sweet feminine fragrance since it&#x27;s introduction into the market.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t strong and overtaking even if sprayed on heavily.  </li>
            <li> The price unreal under $16 for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Not too young for me</li>
            <li> I had been using this perfume for years, then i moved away from home and one day dropped the bottle and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me</li>
            <li> I am gladly surprised by the perfume as well for its price.</li>
            <li> Not all cheap things are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is my husbands favorite parfume on me and my other one was almost empty!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get a new one when this one finishes...</li>
            <li> It is exactly the same as the other one I had</li>
            <li> /&gt;Karen Low Pure Pink Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce</li>
            <li> The smells is sweeter and less chemical smelling than the Pure Couture.</li>
            <li> Now seeing it online less than a year later really pisses me off.</li>
            <li> Soft enough to wear as an everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> but this one makes me want to smell my wrist all day long.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t stay that long.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of PINK by Karen Lowe.</li>
            <li> It took to long to receive it though.</li>
            <li> could kick my butt (I mean husband) for spending that much on it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about perfumes and get sick of scents quickly</li>
            <li> and i still have a little bit left and looking forward to buying another one from amazon.</li>
            <li> purchasin.its realy not much to write about 10 dollars bottle</li>
            <li> My order arrived only a few days after ordering it.</li>
            <li> spent $30 buying it and wanted one for myself after getting home.</li>
            <li> initially smells flowery but smell improves after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I wasnt wrong when ordering Pure Pink.</li>
            <li> The package look legit but the scent is a water down version.</li>
            <li> but then it settles down</li>
            <li> .. compare to the previous one I had, this is like alcohol in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It seems like I use less as well of this bottle.</li>
            <li> thankfully, Amazon carries it for HALF the price.</li>
            <li> Just wished it was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste your money and go to a department store or nearby shopping mall.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle floral scent and is extremely inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is ordinary nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually hope this fragrance remains a secret!</li>
            <li> Seems a little weak to me.</li>
            <li> so i was worried it was discontinued, but then i remembered Amazon always has those hard to find things and</li>
            <li> I get this perfume at least twice a year for my daughter</li>
            <li> I hate to wear the same fragrance as everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im afraid one day itll be bought up</li>
            <li> But for $14 isn&#x27;t a bad price for it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :-[</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this perfume and bought it at the mall for the first time. When I saw it here I just HAD to buy it. It came in what it seemed to be an original packaging, BUT it leaks every time I spray it. It smells good, but I believe it is not the original perfume, because it has an &amp;#34;after-smell&amp;#34;, which smells cheap. I was very disappointed and I cannot wear this!! For the price I guess I couldn&#x27;t really expect originality. I would not recommend this to anyone, and I will have to buy it at the mall next time.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume as a present for my best friend and also bought myself some.  If you like a &amp;#34;fruitier&amp;#34; scent then you will most likely like this perfume.  Isn&#x27;t strong and overtaking even if sprayed on heavily.  I will continue to buy because I get compliments on it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I like it, however it didn&#x27;t match my body chemistry. Gave it to my friend&#x27;s daughter. She likes the smell.</li>

            <li> Smells so good that my teenage daughter keeps borrowing it.</li>
            <li> I love this one! I like it a lot better than the Pure Couture (baby pink bottle). The smells is sweeter and less chemical smelling than the Pure Couture.

            <li> I love this perfume!! It smells so sweet and at a great price too! Arrived quickly, great packaging, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this smell of this! I saw it in the mall but it cost way too much, like $30 for the bottle I think it was. I got this and another bottle for the same price! Love them both.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is very feminine and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Soft enough to wear as an everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and long lasting parfum. Bought it as a Christmas gift and she, who received it, has fallen in love of the scent. I will definitely get a new one when this one finishes...</li>

            <li> BEST FRAGANCE EVER. I BUY THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER, ITS SMELLS LIKE SUGAR AND LAST FOR A GOOD TIME</li>
            <li> Smells amazing def a must buy</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is ordinary nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it gift.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i love is the design.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unique and last all day. I get compliments regularly and my teenage daughter steals a spray or two more often that  I probably catch her. This was my second purchase of PINK by Karen Lowe. I bought this bottle again because my husband kept saying my new perfume was not as appealing to him as the PINK.  The price is pretty incredible too.  I actually hope this fragrance remains a secret! I hate to wear the same fragrance as everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product agian!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  To me it smells like sweet grapefruit, but not in a \\&quot;too citrus\\&quot; kind of way.  Just a lovely, unique, sweet smell.  Not too young for me (I&#x27;m in my 30s).  A new favorite!  My boyfriend loves it on me too :)</li>
            <li> My order arrived only a few days after ordering it. And I absolutely love the smell of this perfume. I have girls from work wanting to know where I got it.....:)</li>
            <li> we bought that parfum for my little sis (13 years old), great smell for little ladies. :) unfortunately we bought it at our local mall and paid more than 50 dollar for it. could kick my butt (I mean husband) for spending that much on it.</li>
            <li> Took a risk and bought it for my wife who is a bit picky with perfumes and it turns out I knocked it out of the park! She absolutely loved it! She was very surprised by how good it smells and she&#x27;s been getting compliments on it. Very fresh and sweet smelling but not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I found this at a perfume outlet in Vegas when looking for Escada Tropical Punch and loved it. spent $30 buying it and wanted one for myself after getting home. thankfully, Amazon carries it for HALF the price. it is my go to fragrance. I receive many compliments and inquiries about it. it&#x27;s a fruity floral smell that I absolutely love! for $15, you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> This perfume is 1 of the best i ever brought!I purchased this item last year around this time and i still have a little bit left and looking forward to buying another one from amazon.I originally seen this item at the mall &amp; loved the smell but it was around $30 so i looked on amazon &amp; found it have that price.I received plenty of compliments on the perfume its not strong, it has kind of a fruity smell, &amp; perfect for the spring/summer time!...you&#x27;ll love it like I do!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS... This is the 1st time I&#x27;m ever close to being done a perfume bottle this size and i will use every drop of it!!</li>
            <li> Handled in perfect, short time. Just what I&#x27;ve asked for. Great service</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance,  the package was well wrapped and came on time. I haven&#x27;t tried any other fragrances from Karen Low I, myself like to be able to sample the fragrances before purchasing because everything doesn&#x27;t smell right on everybody.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It stays on for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I love the of this perfume actually I would order more...</li>
            <li> This perfume never gets old! I had been using this perfume for years, then i moved away from home and one day dropped the bottle and it broke and couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me so i was worried it was discontinued, but then i remembered Amazon always has those hard to find things and sure enough it was on here for much cheaper and got here very quickly! Im so happy because I missed this perfume for the longest time! Its more of a fruity sweet scent than a floral smell, just amazing.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great value</li>
            <li> i just i recevied my bottle of this perfume and it smells  wonderful it has a fresh garden sent that&#x27;s fulled with beautiful flowers along with a sweet and sexy! smell  all in one and it last awhile to i wasn&#x27;t gonna order it at first because i Naver heard of it before i didn&#x27;t wanna waste my money on something that i wasn&#x27;t sure if it smell good are not like i did in the pass with another perfume because just like this perfume it had alot of good comments on it but just wasn&#x27;t my taste so i gave it to my mom but i thought what the heck i&#x27;m gonna give karen low a try and it was worth it:) and good price to!!</li>
            <li> My girl was trying to buy this inside the store... until I showed her it on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Karen Low Pure Pink Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Ounce</li>
            <li> this is my second time buying this. i love the scent and it is the first perfume that hasn&#x27;t made me break out in a rash, as i am extremely sensitive to scents, fragrances, and dyes. it has a cute/classy scent, very girlie</li>
            <li> Great smell and last for a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> very good my sister very happy</li>
            <li> Fresh daily wearable smell. Only downfall is it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> most amazing fragrance everrrr</li>
            <li> I bought this product and compared it with one bought from the shopping Mall. The package look legit but the scent is a water down version. So don&#x27;t waste your money and go to a department store or nearby shopping mall.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so wonderful and I have got so many compliments from a lot of different people. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> i love this sweet, not too strong pretty scent, good buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume because I have had it before but I pair $50.00 for the exact same amount and type of product. This was MUCH more reasonable and just as good as my other bottle. Shipping took about a week and was not in any way damaged. Great product.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance. initially smells flowery but smell improves after a few seconds. have worn it for 7 hours and the smell still lingers even after washing my hands several times.</li>
            <li> out of all the karen lows i own this is the&lt;br /&gt;best one its sweet not sickly sweet&lt;br /&gt;its strong last all day the best part&lt;br /&gt;its so pretty y just spray some on to&lt;br /&gt;smell y its that pretty im getting more&lt;br /&gt;befor the price goes up&lt;br /&gt;trust me this is her best to me out&lt;br /&gt;of all 4 i have tryed a 10 for sure&lt;br /&gt;great shipping too</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
            <li> One of my favourite perfumes. It has a subtle floral scent and is extremely inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and the price!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me last valentines day at the mall and paid $70 for the same bottle! It is the best perfume ever and the smell last all day without it being overwhelming I always order 3 at the time</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume based in the good reviews on Amazon. I was looking for some fresh, sweet fragance and good thing I wasnt wrong when ordering Pure Pink. It smells so delicious, the bottle is cute and last long in my skin. I am gladly surprised by the perfume as well for its price. Not all cheap things are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received what I order on the time frame I was supposed to.  Pretty satisfied! I love this perfume and can&#x27;t find it somewhere else. Ty!!</li>
            <li> At first you think it&#x27;s too sweet but then it settles down and you walk around smelling yourself all day. The price unreal under $16 for such a large bottle. Deals!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped for tho</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume, but I made the mistake and bought it at a perfume place in the mall. It was $114.... Now seeing it online less than a year later really pisses me off. For as much as I paid, it wasn&#x27;t worth it. But for $14 isn&#x27;t a bad price for it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and price. Not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t give my husband a headache like most other perfumes. Will keep buying as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it. and it is not expensive. I like it. It took to long to receive it though.</li>
            <li> mines i got it like at 7:30pm n when i opend it it was like if it was open it was licking n right now it still is n i dont ues it that much n its almost gone n i just had it for like 3 weeks or so..</li>
