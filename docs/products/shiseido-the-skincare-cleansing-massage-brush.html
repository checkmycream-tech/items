            <li>This brush is perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is the best brush on the market, bar none.</li>
            <li>A wonderful face brush.</li>
            <li>What a great purchase!</li>
            <li>Very good quality product.</li>
            <li>That made me lol, and it&#x27;s the best part of using this brush!  </li>
            <li>great price for a very good product.</li>
            <li>So i decided to try this brush after the great reviews.</li>
            <li>but I am really happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>Had to buy it and it made a great addition to my tools.</li>
            <li>It is a very effective tool.</li>
            <li>They are great and have always helped me keep my skin looking good.</li>
            <li>good product, good quality</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I happened across this brush!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much more dirt and makeup comes off with the use of this brush vs just your hands.</li>
            <li>Btw, if you want an awesome super clean complexion and glowingly smooth skin--use TOOTHPASTE of all things!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Much better</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product 20 years ago when I worked for Shiseido.</li>
            <li>The bristle tips are rounded, unlike most cleansing brushes, so there is no abrasive feel (or effect) on the skin.</li>
            <li>Seller was excellent and I received the brush shortly after ordering.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing massage brush by Shiseido.</li>
            <li>I use Shiseido foaming cleanser with it and have never had better skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE TO USE THIS BRUSH WITH  MY SHISHEIDO CLEANSING FOAM.  </li>
            <li>For me, bristles should be shorter for better control</li>
            <li>The rounded bristles and subtantial handle make using it very easy, and easy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush is wonderful for getting my face clean and making my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate by face and my face feels so clean after using it!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that easy to find cleansing brushes otc.  </li>
            <li>This was just the brush to fit me.  </li>
            <li>My face is free of pimples and acne scars after two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but effective for exfoliating face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and feels soft on your skin</li>
            <li>this is far better for your skin and all makeup and cleanser residue rinses away from the bristles easily making it ultra-hygenic too :).</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>Somehow this addition seemed not to clean as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>even the bristles are specially tapered/rounded and feel heavenly on your face (no scratching).  </li>
            <li>Great purchase for anyone who must be careful what they use on their face.  </li>
            <li>Using the Shieseido face brush around the eyes with a gentle face cleanser is quite safe, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just as good as I remember it or even better because of the little rubber bristles.  </li>
            <li>After trying the older model brush again, I like it better.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and its breaking up the oils and dirt leaving my skin more clear.</li>
            <li>Im sure this would work on someone who has SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The abrasiveness is just right to clean the skin and exfoliate--better than any facial scrub I have ever tried...and I have spent plenty of $$$ on brands to find the best.  </li>
            <li>THE BRUSH DOES A GREAT JOB WHILE BEING SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLEL TO USE WITHOUT ANY DISCOMFORT OR IRRITATION.  </li>
            <li>However, the brush helps to thoroughly clean, gently exfoliate, and massages the skin.</li>
            <li>The holder is a much-needed addition that makes the brush soo much easier to store and keep clean.</li>
            <li>I first liked it at a salon (Shiseido) during a facial.</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin, but I&#x27;m just not sure it does anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this could easily last many many years since I had mine for nearly 2</li>
            <li>Small investment with great results...</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is chalk in toothpaste that is the abrasive, and this fine grit will gently remove dead skin cells quite effectively.  </li>
            <li>This ability to produce more suds probably maximizes the dirt/residual makeup-removing potential of your cleanser (versus using your fingertips), and that&#x27;s what makes this puppy valuable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>
            <li>the first being lost in a move.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very high quality, soft rounded bristles so they don&#x27;t tear the fine pores of your face.  </li>
            <li>The overall effect is clean, smooth, and vibrant.</li>
            <li>With super sensitive skin, I was looking for a cleansing brush that would remove my makeup without making my face burn.  </li>
            <li>I would buy another one, but don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;ll need to.</li>
            <li>This works just as well for gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush on my face in the morning and night with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>gentle, and be realistic about what this brush is all about.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li>but&#x27; I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for one.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>and it still looked as brand new as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased mine 25 years ago and it still looks like new.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your face well, but is very gentle at the same time.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is cleaner after using it daily and it&#x27;s so very gentle even for sensitive skin as mine.</li>
            <li>normal face sponges and exfoliating scrubs leave my skin very irritated; but when I don&#x27;t exfoliate my skin gets very bumpy and rough.</li>
            <li>It seems too soft, but when used often it definitely exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I forgot to review this beauty.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>I agree with others on the design and how it gently exfoliates, especially on my problem nose and around my mouth..  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin:</li>
            <li>Use one without the mint flavor, as any pores that may have opened from use of hot water or steam will result in the paste feeling hot on your skin for a few moments.  </li>
            <li>too soft as for me, generally quality is exellent</li>
            <li>Or spend a little more (and buy little</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had several periods where I stopped using the brush regularly and later regretted it, going back to my gentle daily scrub.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its my skin thats so used so a more powerful cleansr with a clarisonic, but i hated how my skin felt after using this for a week straight.</li>
            <li>I bought this Cleansing Massage Brush a few years ago at my local Sephora store after reading tons of positive reviews for it (I think on Makeupalley).  </li>
            <li>The little pink rubber massage nubbys are oh so soft and gentle -</li>

            <li> I bought this Cleansing Massage Brush a few years ago at my local Sephora store after reading tons of positive reviews for it (I think on Makeupalley).  </li>
            <li> The little pink rubber massage nubbys are oh so soft and gentle -</li>
            <li> price seems a little steep at first, but consider that I&#x27;ve owned and used mine for a VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> There is really no need for the more expensive motorized cleansers.  </li>
            <li> It is soft on the complexion but firm enough to remove all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the clarisonic</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sad that my face doesn&#x27;t feel anymore clean than it does without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times when I was searching for an alternative to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no change in my complexion or softness.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My pores started to feel clogged and this brush was not strong enough to do a sufficient job.</li>
            <li> You might think something called a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; brush would turn on and vibrate and lift all the impurities away like other massage brushes do.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have owned in the past 20 years...</li>
            <li> There is no gunk built up between the bristles like other less quality brushes I have gotten.</li>
            <li> I mean maybe $10) and get an actual electric brush that works.</li>
            <li> This newer brush from Shiseido has little balls distributed throughout the brush.  </li>
            <li> Forget the gimmicky clarisonic brush and toss the washcloths -</li>
            <li> The rubber fingers amongst the bristles prevent you from scrubbing so hard you mash the bristles outward permanently, like other face brushes do, if you are an aggressive scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to replace my brush twice in those 20 years, so though they&#x27;re expensive, they&#x27;re also long-lasting.</li>
            <li> around the eyes, as the tissue there is quite delicate.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I lost mine at my gym&#x27;s locker room one day and it was never to be seen again.  </li>
            <li> I also agree that the design doesn&#x27;t allow for soap or bacteria build-up at the base of the bristles, as long as you rinse well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be unrealistic and claim this brush dramatically improves my complexion.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy one</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been using it for over 10 years, even when i received the clearsonic for christmas.  Much better</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much! I had it for years and it was finally time to replace it.  I was thrilled to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times when I was searching for an alternative to the Clarisonic. It feels great on your skin, but I&#x27;m just not sure it does anything for my skin. There was absolutely no change in my complexion or softness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I forgot to review this beauty.  I bought this Cleansing Massage Brush a few years ago at my local Sephora store after reading tons of positive reviews for it (I think on Makeupalley).  It is all that and a bag of chips.  Use it in place of a washcloth for your face.  The little pink rubber massage nubbys are oh so soft and gentle - even the bristles are specially tapered/rounded and feel heavenly on your face (no scratching).  I think this could easily last many many years since I had mine for nearly 2 and it still looked as brand new as the day I bought it.  Alas, I lost mine at my gym&#x27;s locker room one day and it was never to be seen again.  I&#x27;ve since moved on to a non-foaming facial cleanser by MyChelle and haven&#x27;t had a need for this brush &#x27;but&#x27; I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for one.  Forget the gimmicky clarisonic brush and toss the washcloths - this is far better for your skin and all makeup and cleanser residue rinses away from the bristles easily making it ultra-hygenic too :).</li>
            <li> good product, good quality</li>
            <li> I have owned and used his facial brush (yes, the same one), for 8 years now.  ...wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be unrealistic and claim this brush dramatically improves my complexion.  Because it doesn&#x27;t.  Nor does it claim to.  However, it DOES produce the results listed in the official description, namely, \\&quot;heightening the benefit of foaming cleansers.\\&quot;  An earlier reviewer said that this brush turns any cleanser into a foam party.  That made me lol, and it&#x27;s the best part of using this brush!  Note that \\&quot;foaming cleanser\\&quot; can be a bar of soap.  This ability to produce more suds probably maximizes the dirt/residual makeup-removing potential of your cleanser (versus using your fingertips), and that&#x27;s what makes this puppy valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems a little steep at first, but consider that I&#x27;ve owned and used mine for a VERY long time.  8 YEARS.  It has not shed a bristle, and has no gunk build-up.  Pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle, and be realistic about what this brush is all about.  I would buy another one, but don&#x27;t really think I&#x27;ll need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of the clarisonic but im always in search for cheaper beauty items that give the same results. So i decided to try this brush after the great reviews. Maybe its my skin thats so used so a more powerful cleansr with a clarisonic, but i hated how my skin felt after using this for a week straight. My pores started to feel clogged and this brush was not strong enough to do a sufficient job. Im sure this would work on someone who has SUPER sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that easy to find cleansing brushes otc.  I was skeptical to buy one online but I am really happy with this brush. It cleans your face well, but is very gentle at the same time.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product 20 years ago when I worked for Shiseido. The bristle tips are rounded, unlike most cleansing brushes, so there is no abrasive feel (or effect) on the skin. However, the brush helps to thoroughly clean, gently exfoliate, and massages the skin. The overall effect is clean, smooth, and vibrant. I&#x27;ve only had to replace my brush twice in those 20 years, so though they&#x27;re expensive, they&#x27;re also long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it the bristles are too soft. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s scurbing my face.</li>
            <li> You might think something called a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; brush would turn on and vibrate and lift all the impurities away like other massage brushes do. Nope. It just means a scrub brush that has rubber prongs in the brush head that \\&quot;massage\\&quot; your face. Save your money, and go to a beauty supply store and buy something comparable for $3 - $6. Or spend a little more (and buy little I mean maybe $10) and get an actual electric brush that works. Would return if I could, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> when looking for a complexion/cleansing brush, I did not want to spend a fortune.  This was just the brush to fit me.  Did not want a battery operated brush.  The simplicity is perfect--use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes since I was 17. They are great and have always helped me keep my skin looking good. It&#x27;s amazing how much more dirt and makeup comes off with the use of this brush vs just your hands. I have since moved to the Clarsonic but I still take this with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I bought mine after a salon facial and have been using it ever since.  I agree with others on the design and how it gently exfoliates, especially on my problem nose and around my mouth..  My face looks and feels healthier and I&#x27;ve had several periods where I stopped using the brush regularly and later regretted it, going back to my gentle daily scrub.  I also agree that the design doesn&#x27;t allow for soap or bacteria build-up at the base of the bristles, as long as you rinse well. Someone mentioned the expense. . . well, I&#x27;ve had close to 10,000 facial washings over the years - I think it&#x27;s paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister.  When we were both teenagers we had this brush by Shiseido and we didn&#x27;t know it was still sold.  It is just as good as I remember it or even better because of the little rubber bristles.  There is really no need for the more expensive motorized cleansers.  This works just as well for gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I happened across this brush! It seems too soft, but when used often it definitely exfoliates very well. I use it every time I wash my face (I wash with Shiseido Pureness facial cleanser). I have extremely sensitive skin: normal face sponges and exfoliating scrubs leave my skin very irritated; but when I don&#x27;t exfoliate my skin gets very bumpy and rough. This brush is perfect! Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This newer brush from Shiseido has little balls distributed throughout the brush.  Somehow this addition seemed not to clean as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize I had another brush (without thee massaging balls) purchased from Shiseido years ago.  After trying the older model brush again, I like it better.</li>
            <li> The rounded bristles and subtantial handle make using it very easy, and easy on my skin.  It is a very effective tool.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush on my face in the morning and night with a gentle cleanser. It does not irritate by face and my face feels so clean after using it!</li>
            <li> great price for a very good product.Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> With super sensitive skin, I was looking for a cleansing brush that would remove my makeup without making my face burn.  This brush is perfect.  It is soft on the complexion but firm enough to remove all traces of makeup.  Great purchase for anyone who must be careful what they use on their face.  Seller was excellent and I received the brush shortly after ordering.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing massage brush by Shiseido. Very good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I have owned in the past 20 years...the first being lost in a move. The brush is wonderful for getting my face clean and making my skin feel soft. The holder is a much-needed addition that makes the brush soo much easier to store and keep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and feels soft on your skin but I&#x27;m sad that my face doesn&#x27;t feel anymore clean than it does without it. I was hoping for a deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Purchased mine 25 years ago and it still looks like new.  Yes, I use it nearly daily.  There is no gunk built up between the bristles like other less quality brushes I have gotten. The rubber fingers amongst the bristles prevent you from scrubbing so hard you mash the bristles outward permanently, like other face brushes do, if you are an aggressive scrubber.  The bristles are very high quality, soft rounded bristles so they don&#x27;t tear the fine pores of your face.  Btw, if you want an awesome super clean complexion and glowingly smooth skin--use TOOTHPASTE of all things!  The abrasiveness is just right to clean the skin and exfoliate--better than any facial scrub I have ever tried...and I have spent plenty of $$$ on brands to find the best.  Use one without the mint flavor, as any pores that may have opened from use of hot water or steam will result in the paste feeling hot on your skin for a few moments.  It is chalk in toothpaste that is the abrasive, and this fine grit will gently remove dead skin cells quite effectively.  Avoid using the t.p. around the eyes, as the tissue there is quite delicate.  Using the Shieseido face brush around the eyes with a gentle face cleanser is quite safe, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best brush on the market, bar none.</li>
            <li> too soft as for me, generally quality is exellent</li>
            <li> A wonderful face brush. I first liked it at a salon (Shiseido) during a facial. Had to buy it and it made a great addition to my tools.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My face feels clean and its breaking up the oils and dirt leaving my skin more clear. My face is free of pimples and acne scars after two weeks of use.  What a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this little brush. My skin is cleaner after using it daily and it&#x27;s so very gentle even for sensitive skin as mine. Small investment with great results...</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective for exfoliating face. Perfect for sensitive skin. I use Shiseido foaming cleanser with it and have never had better skin.</li>
            <li> i had my last one for years!</li>
            <li> LOVE TO USE THIS BRUSH WITH  MY SHISHEIDO CLEANSING FOAM.  THE BRUSH DOES A GREAT JOB WHILE BEING SOFT ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLEL TO USE WITHOUT ANY DISCOMFORT OR IRRITATION.  WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCE ALONG WITH THEIR TONER</li>
            <li> Very soft. For me, bristles should be shorter for better control</li>
