            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>Nice smell and hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>Made my head tingle, my GF loved the smell and my hair felt super clean, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Does the good very well</li>
            <li>Nice, tingly and fresh</li>
            <li>It smells &#x27;cool&#x27; and makes the hair feel very smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works fine.  </li>
            <li>It is a very refreshing scent, and a very literal cool and tingly feeling, once the menthol kicks</li>
            <li>It does make a great body wash that leaves a nice linger, but not overpowering scent behind for me to enjoy for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp do feel clean after using this, which is not something I can say after using some others.</li>
            <li>Left my husband&#x27;s hair soft and smelling super good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, doesn&#x27;t require very much, smells very good and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out at all, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and the right price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to get the grease and dirt out of my hair leaving it very soft and easy to comb</li>
            <li>Excellent mint essence, the problem is the conditioner is extremely pour, leaves your hair dry, you must  use another conditioner after this product</li>
            <li>Product comes in a great scent (fresh with masculine notes of pine or some other outdoor-like scent).</li>
            <li>The price is still better than the local stores.</li>
            <li>This was the first time he tried this shampoo</li>
            <li>It is a pain when it gets low as you can&#x27;t easily store it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks ...</li>
            <li>Great product, poorly shipped by Amazon.</li>
            <li>really useful especially it can change and reuse save a lot of money and energy.</li>
            <li>Does the job of cleaning hair and leaving it feeling decently soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very wavey thick hair and this product leaves my hair shiney and clean.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I saw this same exact bottle at H-E-B for alot cheaper.</li>
            <li>Was thrown into a large box with other items and not secured.</li>
            <li>I generally have to press it against the wall of my shower to get enough leverage to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>He is quite picky and not very product loyal, but this product is one of the few that he will let me replace after it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Hard to find in stores right now bit found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaked and got over the bottle and several other items.</li>
            <li> I thought because it had face wash would osmething not really thier</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit more painful than the average soap-in-eye experience.</li>
            <li> Check my other Dove men care reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is operator error, but it does seem to be messier than other products by leaving a soap ring after it is used.</li>
            <li> As for the product, I have used sauve mens 2 in 1 shampoo before and it left my hair dull and limp.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that usual &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but it may be weird to some.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find shampoo specifically for oily hair without having to pay outrageous prices.</li>

            <li> I love the subscribe and save program. I will get all my toiletries and consumable items from amazon. Quick shipping and the right price. As for the product, I have used sauve mens 2 in 1 shampoo before and it left my hair dull and limp. Dove has the perfect blend for me. i wont go back to using suave unless its an emergency.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and had it on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; but it was removed. The price is still better than the local stores. Nice smell and hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
            <li> Product comes in a great scent (fresh with masculine notes of pine or some other outdoor-like scent). Does the job of cleaning hair and leaving it feeling decently soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a bit of a tingle on the scalp (I assume because of the menthol) which feels great but it may be weird to some. As such, if it gets in your eyes it&#x27;s a bit more painful than the average soap-in-eye experience.</li>
            <li> Nice I like it really useful especially it can change and reuse save a lot of money and energy. ha</li>
            <li> Great Packaging! Use this method all the time for all my deliveries! Don&#x27;t change a thing on this type of packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different types of shampoos for my hair and scalp. My hair and scalp do feel clean after using this, which is not something I can say after using some others. I find this to be better than Head and Shoulders. Definitely worth trying. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> its ok just too pricey</li>
            <li> This hair soap is the best one that I have tried yet! It smells very good and it keeps my hair fresh and clean. I would recommend trying the shampoo out!</li>
            <li> I have very wavey thick hair and this product leaves my hair shiney and clean. The scent is refreshing and lathers well.Check my other Dove men care reviews.</li>
            <li> Does the good very well and I prefer it over head and shoulders. Would recommend this to anyone because it works well.</li>
            <li> This stuff will wake you up and feels good.  Great smell too!  It was at a great price and came quickly in good shape!</li>
            <li> Excellent mint essence, the problem is the conditioner is extremely pour, leaves your hair dry, you must  use another conditioner after this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now, doesn&#x27;t require very much, smells very good and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out at all, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would argue there is no 2 in 1 about this, but my household is quite picky about cleansers of all types. It does make a great body wash that leaves a nice linger, but not overpowering scent behind for me to enjoy for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t get rejected by my husband when placed into the shower. He is quite picky and not very product loyal, but this product is one of the few that he will let me replace after it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is operator error, but it does seem to be messier than other products by leaving a soap ring after it is used. It is a pain when it gets low as you can&#x27;t easily store it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very close to a 5 star!</li>
            <li> This product seemed to get the grease and dirt out of my hair leaving it very soft and easy to comb</li>
            <li> I have no idea why someone decided to put menthol in shampoo... but they did. Whatever you do... Don&#x27;t get this stuff on your man parts...  I am going to use this bottle up, but I would not order it again.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair. It is difficult to find shampoo specifically for oily hair without having to pay outrageous prices. This is a great shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well, nice scent and seems to be good for my hair. wish it came in more scents!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice shampoo.  Makes my husbands hair feel great. This was the first time he tried this shampoo and we will order it again.</li>
            <li> Tried this while ataying at a friends house. Made my head tingle, my GF loved the smell and my hair felt super clean, not greasy. Hard to find in stores right now bit found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice, tingly and fresh</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for my husband.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo but didn&#x27;t like the price. Even with prime, it&#x27;s still cheaper at Target by $3.</li>
            <li> Great product, poorly shipped by Amazon. Was thrown into a large box with other items and not secured. The shampoo leaked and got over the bottle and several other items.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works fine.  However its a pain to squeeze with one hand.  I generally have to press it against the wall of my shower to get enough leverage to get the product out.  Will likely not buy again</li>
            <li> Left my husband&#x27;s hair soft and smelling super good! It&#x27;s a manly scent but it&#x27;s not that usual &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34; scent most men&#x27;s products have.</li>
            <li> It is a very refreshing scent, and a very literal cool and tingly feeling, once the menthol kicks in.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price, and in 25 ounces, a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is great for him---and her! My husband had a sample of this shampoo in the shower and I used it one time and fell in love with it. It smells &#x27;cool&#x27; and makes the hair feel very smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I thought because it had face wash would osmething not really thier but is awesome and really good. love the product</li>
            <li> Great shampoo/conditioner arrived fairly quick</li>
            <li> Best quality shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I saw this same exact bottle at H-E-B for alot cheaper.</li>
