            <li>The results are pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I dont have the kind of time to re-do my hair 20</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>use string it would work better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these any more in the store but they are my favorite hair ties.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought probably 15 cards of these and will continue to buy more as I need them...</li>
            <li>That is when I decided to look on Amazon! :)</li>
            <li>I decided to check out the picture and details from my laptop to get a better view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forget about it fitting on my wrist or twice around my pony.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to twist it twice when making a ponytail.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that I never had one break on me. :)</li>
            <li>they were the right type! :)</li>
            <li>almost** as good as new.</li>
            <li>almost** as good as new.</li>
            <li>and these are the best quality if you tie your hair tight.</li>
            <li>i thought these were the flat,thick, dent free elastics I have bought before</li>
            <li>These are PERFECT for long-enough hair that is mostly on the thin side.</li>
            <li>These are the *best* elastic bands for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>but I like them so much so!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need!</li>
            <li>and they are my favorite and wear two at a time, so I can put it up easily in a bun, especially for swimming and exercising.</li>
            <li>gets discontinued right quick.)</li>
            <li>Most hair ties loose elasticity or break easily</li>
            <li>hair is more like a mane (exactly like Troy Polamalu&#x27;s) and most elastics end up breaking after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I try to always find ingenious uses for different items.</li>
            <li>The 12-pack that I ordered here was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive one purchase of these</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these hair ties in stores for a long time.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly strong, and the only hair ties that I&#x27;ve found that have no &amp;#34;weak point&amp;#34; or seam where the band can start to break after repeated use.</li>
            <li>They stay in my hair all day without slipping, yet they also don&#x27;t damage or break the hair strands, nor do they pull my hair so they&#x27;re very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I really like these hair bands.</li>
            <li>very skinny elastic..</li>
            <li>I really like these, work well and don&#x27;t pull my hair out.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed that there were different quantities available.</li>
            <li>These things are like an elasticized bit of cloth that do not snag your hair (quite so much) and seem to have an agreeable mouth feel for felines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking for something to hold your hair, they should work, but I cant really speak to that.</li>
            <li>To be specific, I was looking for the ones that were made of a stretchy fabric, were kind of flat, did not have any &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; at all and were one continuous circle.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most other hair elastics, these don&#x27;t have a seam that always ends up snapping.</li>
            <li>I even tried the version that has the grippy stuff on it, but because of how you twist them when you put them in your hair, the grippy stuff apparently doesn&#x27;t wind up touching my hair enough to keep them in.</li>

            <li>The only hair bands I use for my super thick/long hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is safe to say that they are little a-holes.</li>
            <li>These things also work well for using as an alternative to a key ring for the kind of car keys with the built in door openers, because they allow the key to flex and will not break the plastic like a metal key ring would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping one of these on the middle &amp; ring finger of my right hand for some time now.</li>
            <li>those of us that feel like we can&#x27;t live without these, this is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>They are still a little more stretched out than the brand new version, but after washing and drying them, they are still WAY better than any of the other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are still a little more stretched out than the brand new version, but after washing and drying them, they are still WAY better than any of the other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my first pack several years ago and have never had one break!</li>
            <li>These are the best hidden secret for those with long hair.</li>
            <li>They are becoming super difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li>When you first take one out, it&#x27;s pretty small and tight in circumference and won&#x27;t fit around your wrist</li>
            <li>but I threw them in with my laundry and they were back to normal.</li>
            <li>Recently, I started to get low on these and went to the usual stores to get more.</li>
            <li>I thought they were the large variety which I can wear like a bracelet around my wrist to carry around, but they are only about 1.5&amp;#34; long side to side.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that you cannot comfortably wear them on your wrist unless you are a small child - I tend to wear them wrapped around a finger instead.</li>
            <li>They are ok, not great.</li>
            <li>As far as the reviews, many of the negative reviews are for the other type of elastic and the primary complaint seems to be that they break at the seam.</li>
            <li>They hold thick hair very well and very tightly without being bulky like most others.</li>
            <li>I find it more difficult to stretch and control when wrapping because it&#x27;s smaller and stretches less, so the resistance is higher on your fingers.</li>
            <li>I was looking for, but still better than the ordinary round one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was able to use these for well over a year before either one of my cats stole it or I just plain lost it, usually at the hairdresser&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say that the 12 piece item listing and reviews should be separate from the other 2 quantities offered here as these are not really the same type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these in my hair for 20+ years ONE used to last 2-3 MONTHS before it stretched out and needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have always had long hair and these are the only rubber bands that you will ever wear.</li>
            <li> These are the ones that you can sort of unroll into a flat circle piece of fabric.</li>
            <li> (would be ok for little girl with thin hair)</li>
            <li> For someone like me who has super thin hair, these didn&#x27;t do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude who has long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use hair ties for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> They are also wider than some no-damage bands I&#x27;ve encountered, and though they hold the hair firmly (when doubled-over), the grip is not uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a new pack 1-2 times a year to replace those that get lost.</li>
            <li> Thought these were supposed to be slightly bigger slightly thicker fabric ones</li>
            <li> almost overlooked the 12 piece listing here because it was hard to tell if they were the right type from the small image I was looking at on the app on my phone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them tight enough because of their size, and they just seem too slippery.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them tight enough because of their size, and they just seem too slippery.</li>
            <li> They work better than any other hair band I&#x27;ve used, though they have become very difficult to find at Wal-mart &amp; Walgreens.</li>
            <li> These were a little different than the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They do stretch a little so that over time, you may have to loop them around an extra time.  </li>
            <li> I went through the house and found a few to last a little longer hoping they were just out of stock for a short time.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived exactly as expected and was prompt and on time.</li>
            <li> have seen a few people complain that the ONLY downside to these is that they stretch out over time.</li>
            <li> I used to get irritated by that too, but then I accidentally washed and dried a couple that I left in a pocket.</li>

            <li> I used to get irritated by that too, but then I accidentally washed and dried a couple that I left in a pocket.</li>
            <li> Not very stretchy either.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money-</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stretch out the way other rubber bands do and they make my hair stay in place when working out.</li>
            <li> The band was either too loose on two twists or too tight on three.</li>
            <li> So now, when I have some that start to get stretched out, I gather them up and wash and dry them in one of those mesh, zipper pouches for delicate laundry.</li>

            <li> Hard to find but the only ones I use.</li>
            <li> I hope I can find somebody to give it to because it is not worth returning</li>
            <li> When you have really thick, long hair, the other types of holders just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> When you have really thick, long hair, the other types of holders just don&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> They were not the elastics wrapped in black material and glued at the seam.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the non-metal elastic bands that you typically wrap around your hair 3 times.</li>
            <li> but they are a thin piece of fabric that can barely stretch over my ponytail once!</li>
            <li> I have extraordinarily thick  long hair.  </li>
            <li> When I did manage to get a ponytail pulled together, it was so tight that I doubt the &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have used this type of pony tail holder ONLY for at least the past 10-12 years.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend these to anyone with *thick* hair!</li>
            <li> But they are not the endless roll up ones that don&#x27;t break !!</li>
            <li> I have some trouble finding them still in stores</li>
            <li> After using them for a few months, they seemed to stretch out</li>
            <li> And it was not particularly easy to find online.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I think the reviews here are a little misleading, or confusing at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do tend to stretch out, though, but my hair is very thick and that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> these hair bands could hold a small amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> These are too small.  </li>
            <li> These are too small.</li>
            <li> This type of hair tie are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t come complaining to me that these things are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair</li>
            <li> the bands don&#x27;t even wrap around my hair twice...and my hair isn&#x27;t THAT thick.</li>
            <li> TOOOOO SMALL!</li>
            <li> Very small, so no comfy &amp;#34;around-the-wrist&amp;#34; wearing for these things.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to find pony tail holders that work as well as these!</li>
            <li> These are real small.</li>
            <li> These are frustrating.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t work if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use because they&#x27;re too small to twist &amp; wrap around hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only job is to hold hair and it fails miserably.</li>
            <li> It is totally useless to me.</li>
            <li> I immediately just assumed they were the wrong type.</li>

            <li> Just the best hair elastics. No pulling, excellent hold. I love these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to these I&#x27;ve been using these in my hair for 20+ years ONE used to last 2-3 MONTHS before it stretched out and needed to be replaced. Now not only do they not hold my hair, and I end up with a FLOPPY pony tail they BREAK after 1-2 uses, there is no stretch in them and they don&#x27;t hold my hair at all, use string it would work better. It&#x27;s only job is to hold hair and it fails miserably. These are frustrating. I dont have the kind of time to re-do my hair 20+ times a day to keep if off my face.</li>
            <li> these hair bands could hold a small amount of hair.  I thought they would be bigger.</li>
            <li> These are tiny.  I thought they were the large variety which I can wear like a bracelet around my wrist to carry around, but they are only about 1.5&amp;#34; long side to side.  Very difficult to use because they&#x27;re too small to twist &amp; wrap around hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude who has long hair. I&#x27;ve been keeping one of these on the middle &amp; ring finger of my right hand for some time now. They work better than any other hair band I&#x27;ve used, though they have become very difficult to find at Wal-mart &amp; Walgreens. These things also work well for using as an alternative to a key ring for the kind of car keys with the built in door openers, because they allow the key to flex and will not break the plastic like a metal key ring would. Yeah, I try to always find ingenious uses for different items.</li>
            <li> These are the *best* elastic bands for my thick hair. They are incredibly strong, and the only hair ties that I&#x27;ve found that have no &amp;#34;weak point&amp;#34; or seam where the band can start to break after repeated use. I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they never seem to lose elasticity! If I could just manage to stop losing them I&#x27;m positive one purchase of these would last me a lifetime. I don&#x27;t know how these aren&#x27;t more popular! They are becoming super difficult to find in stores so I&#x27;m glad to have found them here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve paid anywhere from $3.99-$5.24 for the 12 piece set. The shipment arrived exactly as expected and was prompt and on time. The only downside is that you cannot comfortably wear them on your wrist unless you are a small child - I tend to wear them wrapped around a finger instead. Would definitely recommend these to anyone with *thick* hair!</li>
            <li> I really like these hair bands. They don&#x27;t rip out your hair when removing them. I wear them putting my hair up for motorcycle rides.</li>
            <li> Thought it was thicker...very skinny elastic.. :/</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these any more in the store but they are my favorite hair ties. I don&#x27;t like that price compared to what they use to be but I like them so much so!!</li>
            <li> The only hair bands I use for my super thick/long hair.  Doesn&#x27;t tug or break your hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found these again! I used to use these exclusively years ago and then they stopped selling them in stores for some reason. The material they&#x27;re made out of is similar to pantyhose but thicker. Unlike most other hair elastics, these don&#x27;t have a seam that always ends up snapping. They hold thick hair very well and very tightly without being bulky like most others. When you first take one out, it&#x27;s pretty small and tight in circumference and won&#x27;t fit around your wrist but they stretch eventually without losing their ability to hold your hair. They&#x27;re perfect for keeping your hair up during a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please hit &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; below:</li>
            <li> These are PERFECT for long-enough hair that is mostly on the thin side. They stay in my hair all day without slipping, yet they also don&#x27;t damage or break the hair strands, nor do they pull my hair so they&#x27;re very comfortable to wear. I&#x27;ve bought probably 15 cards of these and will continue to buy more as I need them... provided they aren&#x27;t discontinued (the story of my life: everything I like and use gets discontinued right quick.)</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and use hair ties for as long as I can remember. Most hair ties loose elasticity or break easily and these are the best quality if you tie your hair tight. This type of hair tie are hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Thought these were supposed to be slightly bigger slightly thicker fabric ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. These are real small. They are ok, not great.</li>
            <li> I have some trouble finding them still in stores and they are my favorite and wear two at a time, so I can put it up easily in a bun, especially for swimming and exercising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair and it&#x27;s hard for me to find pony tail holders that work as well as these! They seem to be made out of pantyhose type material and keep my hair in place. After using them for a few months, they seemed to stretch out but I threw them in with my laundry and they were back to normal. I really like these, work well and don&#x27;t pull my hair out.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair ties!</li>
            <li> I have always had long hair and these are the only rubber bands that you will ever wear. I bought my first pack several years ago and have never had one break! They don&#x27;t stretch out the way other rubber bands do and they make my hair stay in place when working out. These are the best hidden secret for those with long hair.</li>
            <li> These were a little different than the one&#x27;s I was looking for, but still better than the ordinary round one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t stay well in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to find but the only ones I use.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t work if you have thin hair. It is totally useless to me. I hope I can find somebody to give it to because it is not worth returning</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair.</li>
            <li> These are too small.  Very difficult to stretch out so I can make a ponytail.  Should be repackaged for girls.  When I did manage to get a ponytail pulled together, it was so tight that I doubt the &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these hair ties in stores for a long time. I was so happy to find them online since they hold my hair without pulling hair out. I especially like that they have no rubber elastic or metal on them. I have been using them for years and they are the only hair tie I use on a daily basis. I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> best elastics ever IMO</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say that the 12 piece item listing and reviews should be separate from the other 2 quantities offered here as these are not really the same type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12 piece listing is for the fabric type of elastic that does NOT have a seam in it. These are the ones that you can sort of unroll into a flat circle piece of fabric. (I added a photo of an &amp;#34;inside-out view of these so you can see what I&#x27;m talking about.) There is no seam or glue that will break after a couple of uses. As far as the reviews, many of the negative reviews are for the other type of elastic and the primary complaint seems to be that they break at the seam. For that reason, I think the reviews here are a little misleading, or confusing at the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have used this type of pony tail holder ONLY for at least the past 10-12 years. I usually buy a new pack 1-2 times a year to replace those that get lost. I have NEVER had one of these break. Recently, I started to get low on these and went to the usual stores to get more. I was extremely disappointed that I did not find them in any store where I looked. I went through the house and found a few to last a little longer hoping they were just out of stock for a short time. It has now been about 6 months, and I still can&#x27;t find them. That is when I decided to look on Amazon! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost overlooked the 12 piece listing here because it was hard to tell if they were the right type from the small image I was looking at on the app on my phone. I decided to read the reviews here, and I saw all the complaints about breaking. I immediately just assumed they were the wrong type. Then I noticed that there were different quantities available. I decided to check out the picture and details from my laptop to get a better view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I just stocked up on these as soon as I figured out they were the right type! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us that feel like we can&#x27;t live without these, this is a lifesaver. When you have really thick, long hair, the other types of holders just don&#x27;t do the job. This is the type that you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a few people complain that the ONLY downside to these is that they stretch out over time. I used to get irritated by that too, but then I accidentally washed and dried a couple that I left in a pocket. They came out of the drier **almost** as good as new. So now, when I have some that start to get stretched out, I gather them up and wash and dry them in one of those mesh, zipper pouches for delicate laundry. The results are pretty awesome. They are still a little more stretched out than the brand new version, but after washing and drying them, they are still WAY better than any of the other options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, it seems that these started to disappear from stores about the same time as I started seeing those ribbon-type of elastics that are knotted together at the ends. They are advertised as pony tail holders or something for girls to wear around their wrists. Those stay in my hair for all of about 5 seconds before coming out. I can&#x27;t get them tight enough because of their size, and they just seem too slippery. I even tried the version that has the grippy stuff on it, but because of how you twist them when you put them in your hair, the grippy stuff apparently doesn&#x27;t wind up touching my hair enough to keep them in. - I just added that here in case anyone else looking for this type might try the tied-type and have the same problem. Now I need to go review those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, SCUNCI, please don&#x27;t stop making these!!ese, this is a lifesaver.

            <li> My girlfriend loves these!</li>
            <li> As stated, they cause no damage.  I have extraordinarily thick  long hair.  I can always count on these!</li>
            <li> i thought these were the flat,thick, dent free elastics I have bought before but they are a thin piece of fabric that can barely stretch over my ponytail once! Forget about it fitting on my wrist or twice around my pony.</li>
            <li> Best cat toy ever!. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my two cats has learned how to play fetch with hair ties. Because she is a cat she will only play fetch with these specific hair ties. I will not delve into the psychology of cats but it is safe to say that they are little a-holes. She picked the only hair tie that I can no longer find in any store, anywhere. And it was not particularly easy to find online. These things are like an elasticized bit of cloth that do not snag your hair (quite so much) and seem to have an agreeable mouth feel for felines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to hold your hair, they should work, but I cant really speak to that. If you want to teach your cat how to play fetch, then by all means give it a go. Just don&#x27;t come complaining to me that these things are hard to find.</li>
            <li> These are the fabric elastics that do not have any glue on them or a metal connecting piece.  Each elastic is a solid piece of fabric.  They do stretch a little so that over time, you may have to loop them around an extra time.  They are my favorite.  They do not break and they don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> These are too small. Should be sold as a kids size. I wasn&#x27;t able to twist it twice when making a ponytail. Not very stretchy either.</li>
            <li> GREAT they don&#x27;t pull your hair,     But they are not the endless roll up ones that don&#x27;t break !!</li>
            <li> I had been looking all over for these after losing my package of them (that  I had had for years) in a move.  To be specific, I was looking for the ones that were made of a stretchy fabric, were kind of flat, did not have any &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; at all and were one continuous circle.  They were not the elastics wrapped in black material and glued at the seam.  The 12-pack that I ordered here was exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is more like a mane (exactly like Troy Polamalu&#x27;s) and most elastics end up breaking after a few uses.  The ones that were glued usually don&#x27;t last two or three days.  I was able to use these for well over a year before either one of my cats stole it or I just plain lost it, usually at the hairdresser&#x27;s.  Never did one ever break.  These are the only ones I will use now and I am stocking up on them since I could not find them in any stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do tend to stretch out, though, but my hair is very thick and that is to be expected.  The most important thing is that I never had one break on me. :)</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money- the bands don&#x27;t even wrap around my hair twice...and my hair isn&#x27;t THAT thick. TOOOOO SMALL! &#x3D;( (would be ok for little girl with thin hair)</li>
            <li> For someone like me who has super thin hair, these didn&#x27;t do the trick.  The band was either too loose on two twists or too tight on three.</li>
            <li> These bands do not have any metal fasteners to chew your hair to bits. They are also wider than some no-damage bands I&#x27;ve encountered, and though they hold the hair firmly (when doubled-over), the grip is not uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> Very small, so no comfy &amp;#34;around-the-wrist&amp;#34; wearing for these things. But they&#x27;re functional!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the non-metal elastic bands that you typically wrap around your hair 3 times. This one you only have to wrap twice because it&#x27;s smaller. I find it more difficult to stretch and control when wrapping because it&#x27;s smaller and stretches less, so the resistance is higher on your fingers. Maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
