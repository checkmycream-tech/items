    <ol>
            <li>my husband says the best ever</li>
            <li>Best of the 4 of these products I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li>Works great in the nose.</li>
            <li>Worked great before turning into plastic stick that does nothing.</li>
            <li>I looked at many and selected this one as the best.  </li>
            <li>Good sturdy trimmer.</li>
            <li>Does a really good job on ears and nose.</li>
            <li>The good news, works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Supply your own AA battery.</li>
            <li>I rinsed the head each time, but I wasn&#x27;t removing it (to be honest</li>
            <li>It is cleaned using running water - very easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Such a great price too.</li>
            <li>Very handy, simple, well priced tool.</li>
            <li>Below is my original posting:    </li>
            <li>Would have been OK if it had worked consistently.</li>
            <li>And I just run it under the faucet to clean.</li>
            <li>Not impossible though.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of hard to get the hairs at the very top of my nose.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this machine.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it worked well when it did work, and I trust that with my changing how I clean the unit that the new unit will work well consistently.    </li>
            <li>Stopped working after first use, no luck changing batteries.</li>
            <li>First trimmer of this type for me.</li>
            <li>Never worked very well.</li>
            <li>very well.</li>
            <li>I want clean above my &#x27;stache (under my nose)</li>
            <li>Cons; no cover and battery release is right there next to the on switch.</li>
            <li>That review was responded to by Remington and they are sending me a new unit.</li>
            <li>okay, but not much better than that</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT waste your money on this product</li>
            <li>New battery actually caused the device to overheat.</li>
            <li>It must be easy to use because I have not seen any &amp;#34;stray&amp;#34; hairs since giving this to my husband as a not so subtle &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Works, only trims hair short but at least it&#x27;s not sticking out of your nose.</li>

            <li> Works great in the nose. Seems well made. Supply your own AA battery.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this machine. It works well for nose hairs but pretty useless for trimming around the eye brows.</li>
            <li> This device is so weak and pathetic I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Works, only trims hair short but at least it&#x27;s not sticking out of your nose. Cons; no cover and battery release is right there next to the on switch.</li>
            <li> Very handy, simple, well priced tool.</li>
            <li> This product is bad. Used it twice and it quit. Threw it in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> okay, but not much better than that</li>
            <li> This is an update to my previous 1 star review. That review was responded to by Remington and they are sending me a new unit. It is possible that some of my issues were customer error, maybe their instructions need to be clearer? Anyway, my issue of having a difficult time getting the unit to work was likely related to not removing the head after each use and rinsing it out. I rinsed the head each time, but I wasn&#x27;t removing it (to be honest, I didn&#x27;t realize it could come off). Anyway, it worked well when it did work, and I trust that with my changing how I clean the unit that the new unit will work well consistently.    Below is my original posting:    Never worked very well. Always had to fiddle with it to get it to turn on. Finally today no fiddling worked at all. And I&#x27;m two weeks past the return date. Would have been OK if it had worked consistently.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after three weeks</li>
            <li> I looked at many and selected this one as the best.  It is cleaned using running water - very easy</li>
            <li> I use this as a nose hair trimmer. It works but it&#x27;s kind of hard to get the hairs at the very top of my nose. Not impossible though.</li>
            <li> used one time.......tried to turn on 2nd time and did not work..changed battery and still does not work.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> Stopped working after first use, no luck changing batteries. Returning!</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of my husband&#x27;s Christmas gifts. The trimmer died within a month of using it. We replaced the battery so that wasn&#x27;t the issue. What a lousy product. Never again!</li>
            <li> Good sturdy trimmer. I just wish there was a cover.</li>
            <li> I like this as it doesn&#x27;t tend to occasionally pull hairs like some others.  I do wish it cut a little closer.</li>
            <li> Does a really good job on ears and nose.</li>
            <li> First trimmer of this type for me. I like it. It trims the hair in my ears, nose and the bit I want clean above my &#x27;stache (under my nose) very well. And I just run it under the faucet to clean.</li>
            <li> This item was used four times and failed...it just quit, new battery, still dead</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  Just what my husband was looking for, and he loves it. Such a great price too. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Junk... Did not work at all..Defective..</li>
            <li> Love it.  Every man should have one.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 tries don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
            <li> It must be easy to use because I have not seen any &amp;#34;stray&amp;#34; hairs since giving this to my husband as a not so subtle &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A waste of money. Quit after 2 months. New battery actually caused the device to overheat. Dangerous. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Died within a month and about three uses.  Worked great before turning into plastic stick that does nothing.</li>
            <li> my husband says the best ever</li>
            <li> Best of the 4 of these products I have bought over the years.</li>
            <li> It would have rated 5 stars if it had not died in a week.</li>
            <li> It worked two or three times and then quit.</li>
            <li> The good news, works like a charm. The bad news, it broke after a week. The Battery contact blew out.</li>
