            <li> Didn&#x27;t foam enough and didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, packaging and dispensing of soap, however was disappointed with the lack of a soapy lather.  </li>
            <li> I seriously can barely smell anything and what i do smell is a bit of a medicine smell, it does later well though.</li>
            <li> once received, this is a huge disappointment, the soap smells like dish soaps, there&#x27;s no way it smells mandarin or grapefruit</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worse than any soft soap products.</li>
            <li> Scent not very strong at all....</li>
            <li> If it did, I wouldn&#x27;t find it cloying and slightly nauseating.</li>
            <li> it is take a couples of dabs to produce little foam and the fragrance it is not much friendly for gel soap</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is fake or a few years old.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell and it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> thus no better than any ole off the counter soap.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how this fits in for a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing - has hardly any scent and doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> However, when I reordered the handsoap recently I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Failed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE the scent of this soap!  It&#x27;s light and refreshing without being tangy!  It lathers nicely as well as leaves you feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not bad,  but no lather or nice smell... so marginal.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine at a local TJ Maxx for around $6 but I&#x27;m in love with it.  The smell is so fresh and clean, not girly but a soap that you would find in a luxury hotel. Absolutely love it, if I can&#x27;t find it at TJ Maxx again I&#x27;ll likely buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, packaging and dispensing of soap, however was disappointed with the lack of a soapy lather.  If you prefer a soap that doesn&#x27;t lather, this is a good choice.</li>

            <li> Nice light scent. Use it in my kitchen. Seems to do the job just fine, but I&#x27;m now shifting toward more environmentally friendly products so I&#x27;m not sure how this fits in for a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> it is take a couples of dabs to produce little foam and the fragrance it is not much friendly for gel soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing - has hardly any scent and doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be a cheaper substitute for Molton and Brown.  I was very disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t smell and it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> For the price, seriously good stuff. Has the look, feel and smell of products costing much more. Great for guest bathrooms. Looks expensive, feels nice and is a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this soap has a more masculine scent than the usual ones. I&#x27;ve been ordering this type from a British brand, Moulton Brown, but it&#x27;s hard to get and this one seems to be just as good. Seems to be just soap, not loaded with the greasy hand creams that women like. I just want to get my hands clean.</li>
            <li> Normally, I like this brand, but this one smells nothing like mandarin or grapefruit. If it did, I wouldn&#x27;t find it cloying and slightly nauseating. BLEH.</li>
            <li> Just as nice as other fancier soaps and so affordable!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this soap for years- this is Not the correct product. I don&#x27;t know if it is fake or a few years old. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t foam enough and didn&#x27;t last that long. Did a decent job. The fragrance was very mild but pleasing.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks a mimic of Molton Brown, but much cheaper , that&#x27;s why I bought it , hoping it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to my favorite handsoap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once received, this is a huge disappointment, the soap smells like dish soaps, there&#x27;s no way it smells mandarin or grapefruit and it&#x27;s worse than any soft soap products. Returned immediately.</li>
            <li> Baylis &amp; Harding Mandarin/grapefruit hand wash. I have always used premium hand soaps this is my first time trying this one.  I seriously can barely smell anything and what i do smell is a bit of a medicine smell, it does later well though. I was expecting a lot more smell.</li>
            <li> I was given this handsoap and lotion as a housewarming gift about a year ago and I loved it.  However, when I reordered the handsoap recently I was very disappointed.  The soap has hardly any scent, and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as my original bottle!  What is going on?</li>
            <li> Makes handwashing enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores any longer so I turned to Amazon. Of course I found it there and ordered it.  It was delivered when said.  All in all I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
