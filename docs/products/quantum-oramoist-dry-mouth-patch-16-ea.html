            <li>An incredible improvement in my life!!</li>
            <li>It is the best product out there.  </li>
            <li>These are the best of the &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; tablets on the market I think.  </li>
            <li>Had hoped it would be wonderful -</li>
            <li>When using them during the day, they are great because no one even knows you have anything in your mouth...</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, excellent price and works great!</li>
            <li>Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and easy to use</li>
            <li>this by far is the best product.  </li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I think I may be getting more used to it now as I type</li>
            <li>But I sure do recommend them.</li>
            <li>The XliMelts work much better for me</li>
            <li>This works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Most things I tried didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Recently I stumbled across these OraMoist tabs – they are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have tried of several.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident it will help.</li>
            <li>They definitely have the best taste.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything else on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work great for awhile, but after a month or two, I found myself drinking from the water glass by the bed much more frequently.  </li>
            <li>OraMoist Patches are one of the best products available for dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to buy them in my local area so glad to find them on Amazon - at a good price.  </li>
            <li>After having problems with mouth dryness for years, I am so glad to find a product that is easy to use and really does work!</li>
            <li>I use it at night to prevent me from waking up with a mouth full of &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>toothbrush works the best, no toothpaste necessary btw)- after only having it on for 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely review consumer products, but this one is special.</li>
            <li>All of these products have improved my mouth so much I am able to now eat normally.</li>
            <li>although not totally a solution for me, Ora Moist is the best product I have found to produce some moisture in my dry mouth during sleep at night.</li>
            <li>This product is better by far than others manufactured for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>tried other brands but like OraMoist best as they last much longer.  </li>
            <li>My husband went through radiation treatment on his face and neck and these were amazingly helpful in reducing the dry mouth/throat problems.  </li>
            <li>is chewing sugar free gum, which must be changed very frequently.</li>
            <li>effective use was limited to 2 to 3 hours which may be overcome by use of 2 tablets...</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth from some medication and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for not waking up with dry mouth in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li>It keeps my dry mouth more moist but the resdue is tricky to remove in the morning</li>
            <li>I am on 10 medications per day and most have the dry mouth side effect.  </li>
            <li>It is better than using dry mouth spray every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I take medication that makes my mouth very dry and sticky.</li>
            <li>It works great to fight overnight dry mouth for whatever reason; medicines or any other reason.  </li>
            <li>Was really struggling with eating and drinking anything but water.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>One or two gets me through the whole night.  </li>
            <li>The thing I really like is that they are made to stick to the roof of your mouth or on the side on a molar.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works, my mouth stays moist for hours.</li>
            <li>This works very well to keep mouth moist during the night.</li>
            <li>I much prefer OraMoist and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE A FULL UPPER DENTURE</li>
            <li>They adhere better in my mouth and are a bigger size than competing brands, meaning that they last longer.  </li>
            <li>The little tablet sticks to the roof of your mouth and keeps your mouth moist for many hours as it dissolves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using OraMoist for about 6 months; they are easy to use, work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Seemed to calm dry mouth</li>
            <li>Works well....placed in the mouth  near the cheek.  </li>
            <li>They mostly all help, but only for a few minutes, when the effect wears off.</li>
            <li>This product at first did not appeal to me, but as I fought night time dry mouth, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way it dissolves in clumps, and this took a while to get used to, but at least the taste isn&#x27;t that strong and not too sweet, which is a problem with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It really helped my dry mouth.</li>
            <li>OraMoist is very convenient to use and provides hours of dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li>They are competitor dry mouth patches with higher ratings on Amazon, but after trying different kinds, my money goes to these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other flavoured products, but much prefer the neutral taste of OraMoist.</li>
            <li>I have run the whole gamut of gum, sugarless candies, and other xylitol-based products such as Biotene mouthwash/spray/lozenges.</li>
            <li>I got used to the flavor after the first patch which is a real plus because I am easily nauseated by anything that taste like medicine.</li>
            <li>Really good but wish they were less expensive</li>
            <li>Very dry mouth and highly sensitive.</li>

            <li> I have extreme dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It is hard to adhere, becomes too tacky on your finger; (2) It becomes a big &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; in the roof of your mouth-when you finally get it to stick; and (3)</li>
            <li> The lozenges last a few minutes longer but conflict with conversation, etc.</li>
            <li> But it becomes very stringy or at other-times leaves a small disk that is hard to scrape off the roof of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give any extra salivation and it was gritty not a good taste.</li>

            <li> 12/30/14 .This doesn&#x27;t play out to consumers whose serious dry mouth conditions are critical and can result in increased tooth cavities.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome for the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Average duration for me: 6-8 hours, not kidding</li>
            <li> I want to praise these little tablets as they have worked wonders for me.  </li>

            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe your&lt;br /&gt;product would help someone with less extreme dry mouth, but sorry to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> A complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have a dry cough that badly interrupts my sleep.  </li>
            <li> as everyone else with a 3 star review or below states, it is incredibly annoying getting odd textured clumps in your mouth as it dissolves.</li>
            <li> It sticks to the roof of the mouth like a sea anemone clings to a rock and is just as difficult to pry off.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>

            <li> Put in my mouth at bedtime. Seemed to calm dry mouth OK. Woke up 4 hours later to find it in pieces, still stuck to the roof of my mouth. Had to remove it bit by bit with my fingernail. Water did not help. Very difficult to remove and my mouth was dry as a bone.</li>
            <li> They are competitor dry mouth patches with higher ratings on Amazon, but after trying different kinds, my money goes to these.  They adhere better in my mouth and are a bigger size than competing brands, meaning that they last longer.  Average duration for me: 6-8 hours, not kidding</li>
            <li> although not totally a solution for me, Ora Moist is the best product I have found to produce some moisture in my dry mouth during sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from some medication and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for not waking up with dry mouth in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li> Quantum Ora Moist Dry Mouth Patch Tablets were dried out and extremely fragile causing them to break apart when removing from the package .My impression was they were either defectively formulated or repackaged because of the over due coupon expiration date .&lt;br /&gt;The  effective use was limited to 2 to 3 hours which may be overcome by use of 2 tablets...one upon going to sleep and the a second  one some time during the night to supplement he first.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the product line was sold to another company perhaps Dentek in No Carolina.I will follow up because the discont coupons in each of the 4 purchased packages had expired...12/30/14 .This doesn&#x27;t play out to consumers whose serious dry mouth conditions are critical and can result in increased tooth cavities.The appropriate governmental departments  ill be notified .as a health hazard.&lt;br /&gt;No  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> There must be a better product than this, please!!!!  Dont waste your money like i did.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product (not supposed to mention name) that adheres to gums.  It works, but I wanted to try something different.  This is supposed to adhere to the roof of the mouth.  Here&#x27;s my experience: (1) It is hard to adhere, becomes too tacky on your finger; (2) It becomes a big &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; in the roof of your mouth-when you finally get it to stick; and (3) The taste is absolutely awful.  I tried it for two nights, and then threw the rest of the package away.  I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> OraMoist Patches are one of the best products available for dry mouth relief. They have been extremely helpful in reducing the pain of having dry mouth issues. The order &amp; delivery of this product through Amazon has always been done in a timely manner &amp; I have found it helpful to order in advance rather than waiting until the last minute. I will continue to use Amazon for this product.</li>
            <li> My husband went through radiation treatment on his face and neck and these were amazingly helpful in reducing the dry mouth/throat problems.  He lived on these for months.</li>

I still have another 25 of the things to find out (sigh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that considered, I still choose this product over tooth-decay and/or sitting with water in your mouth 24/7. I think I may be getting more used to it now as I type this.&lt;br /&gt;(placebo effect?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using OraMoist for about 6 months; they are easy to use, work well and last a long time. I&#x27;ve not been able to buy them in my local area so glad to find them on Amazon - at a good price.  I&#x27;ve tried other flavoured products, but much prefer the neutral taste of OraMoist.</li>
            <li> This product at first did not appeal to me, but as I fought night time dry mouth, I decided to give it a try. It worked well, keeping my mouth moist for 8 hours, just as I needed. Later I learned that a ceiling fan was the culprit drying out my mouth, so I don&#x27;t need the OraMoist Patches as often. But I sure do recommend them.</li>
            <li> I rarely review consumer products, but this one is special. I have suffered from Burning Tongue Syndrome for two years. One symptom is an unbearable sensation of dryness on the tongue and palate. I have run the whole gamut of gum, sugarless candies, and other xylitol-based products such as Biotene mouthwash/spray/lozenges. They mostly all help, but only for a few minutes, when the effect wears off. The lozenges last a few minutes longer but conflict with conversation, etc. Oramoist dramatically (for me) solves both problems ... It is slow-release AND doesn&#x27;t require effort to keep in one&#x27;s mouth. It works for 3 to 4 hours, relieving the sensation of dryness, and after a while I forget that it is there. An incredible improvement in my life!!</li>
            <li> Works well....placed in the mouth  near the cheek.  It will keep mouth moist all night.  It sticks in place and protects moiuh from drying out when using CPAP machines.</li>
            <li> After having problems with mouth dryness for years, I am so glad to find a product that is easy to use and really does work!</li>
            <li> As a bone marrow transplant patient I have chronic graft versus host disease of the mouth. Very dry mouth and highly sensitive. Was really struggling with eating and drinking anything but water. And then there is concern of how it will effect the health of your teeth and gums. The Biotene mouthwash along with their toothpaste and mouth gel have worked immensely well. I have also purchased and used Ora moist dry mouth patch. These I use to keep my mouth moist all night while I sleep. All of these products have improved my mouth so much I am able to now eat normally. Do not hesitate to buy because they do work. Just wish someone would have told me months ago.</li>
            <li> These things turn into glue without relieving my dry mouth and I think they taste like glue also. The XliMelts work much better for me</li>
            <li> It really helped my dry mouth. It is the best product out there.  It lasted longer than others.</li>
            <li> Lozenge lasts about an hour.  I would rate it 5 stars if lozenge lasted longer. Pleasant taste and easy to use</li>
            <li> This works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Did not help me at all.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I was surprise.  Most things I tried didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This product is better by far than others manufactured for this purpose.  I have dental implants and other hardware.  Other moisture products have not produced results.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work great for awhile, but after a month or two, I found myself drinking from the water glass by the bed much more frequently.  I think it quit working for me.</li>
            <li> This does the job for keeping your mouth moist.  I use it at night to prevent me from waking up with a mouth full of &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I want to praise these little tablets as they have worked wonders for me.  I have a dry cough that badly interrupts my sleep.  My doctors say it is related to sinus/polyps issues and the treatments have either not worked or only worked for a few weeks (polyps grow back whether treated with surgery or steroids).  So for the last 10-15 years I have had to sleep with lozenges in my mouth all night.  Of course, there is a danger of aspiration but it was the only way to get sleep.  Recently I stumbled across these OraMoist tabs – they are wonderful.  The little tablet sticks to the roof of your mouth and keeps your mouth moist for many hours as it dissolves.  One or two gets me through the whole night.  I just love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried other brands but like OraMoist best as they last much longer.  Also some of the others do not stick on the roof of your mouth but on a tooth (yuck!) or the side of the mouth.  I much prefer OraMoist and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use this product at bedtime.  It keeps my dry mouth more moist but the resdue is tricky to remove in the morning</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome for the past 30 years.  I tried this product twice at bedtime.  It did provide almost enough moisture however I could not scrape it off my mouth in the morning.  In fact the disc became enlarged and disgusting in taste and consistency. I cannot bring myself to continue this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with chronic dry mouth due to medication for years.  I have tried EVERYTHING on the market and this by far is the best product.  It is long lasting and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Really good but wish they were less expensive</li>
            <li> The meds I take give me a dry mouth.  This is the best product I have tried of several.  I don&#x27;t like the way it dissolves in clumps, and this took a while to get used to, but at least the taste isn&#x27;t that strong and not too sweet, which is a problem with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought oramoist on the advice of my dentist, who has probably not used it personally.  The oramoist disc is nasty.  It is much more uncomfortable than the dry mouth condition it is supposed to alleviate.  It sticks to the roof of the mouth like a sea anemone clings to a rock and is just as difficult to pry off.  I prefer other dry mouth remedies.</li>
            <li> I have used xylimelts and thought this would be a comparable product. I was so wrong. It has a horrible taste and became stringy as it dissolved. A complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> Goodbye dry mouth!  This works for me almost all night.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the AM yet but I&#x27;m confident it will help.</li>
            <li> The product is tasteless and the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; is vile.  I only tried this product when I ran out of another brand I use regularly and I found this locally.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for close to one year on a daily basis.  I am on 10 medications per day and most have the dry mouth side effect.  OraMoist is very convenient to use and provides hours of dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li> I have taken meds that dry my mouth and I have tried ALL of the dry mouth products that are on the market This product is such a blessing... I wear a bite plate at night and the dry mouth was madding.  Now I can sleep all night</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT EFECTIVELY DO THE JOB.  AS INSTRUCED, PRODUCT STUCK IN THE UPPER PART OF GUM. BUT OT DID NOT REDUCEEDJC BAD BREATH</li>
            <li> These are the best of the &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; tablets on the market I think.  They definitely have the best taste.  The thing I really like is that they are made to stick to the roof of your mouth or on the side on a molar.  They stay put all night.  When using them during the day, they are great because no one even knows you have anything in your mouth...unlike the losenges (sp?) you suck on.  I give them a big thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of patches, sprays, etc for my existing dry mouth.  This patch is to go in the roof of the mouth.  It gradually melts until it is gone.  The patch irritates my mouth.  I suppose that is why they are still on my desk and not being used.</li>
            <li> Sorry but it just did not work for me. My dry mouth is extreme, and I have not as of yet found anything that works. The only&lt;br /&gt;relief I can find, for a brief period of time is chewing sugar free gum, which must be changed very frequently. Maybe your&lt;br /&gt;product would help someone with less extreme dry mouth, but sorry to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I take medication that makes my mouth very dry and sticky.I have tried other products to no avail.This stuff really works, my mouth stays moist for hours.Better than anything else on the market in my opinion.I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, excellent price and works great!</li>
            <li> This is one if the if I could give it no stars I would. After 3-4 mints I finally got one to stick. It was worthless. Didn&#x27;t give any extra salivation and it was gritty not a good taste. Save your moolah.</li>
            <li> This does moisten for a while as it does stick to the roof of your mouth.  But it becomes very stringy or at other-times leaves a small disk that is hard to scrape off the roof of your mouth.  Haven&#x27;t finished the one and only box I purchased.  Had hoped it would be wonderful - but instead it was terrible.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to me. I have extreme dry mouth. I found that it takes a bit of getting used to having the tablet in the roof of your mouth but it definitely does help.</li>
            <li> Works great. I suffer from dry mouth at night. Put one one these on a back molar and it lasts all night. Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Use a cpap machine @ night and mouth gets very dry.  This works very well to keep mouth moist during the night.</li>
            <li> It works great to fight overnight dry mouth for whatever reason; medicines or any other reason.  It is better than using dry mouth spray every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS IS YOU HAVE A FULL UPPER DENTURE</li>
