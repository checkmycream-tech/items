            <li>it&#x27;s really wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and you get a great result!</li>
            <li>it is very good, and I use it as an alternative to the force vector line to prevent product build up.</li>
            <li>great smells good AND does the job!!</li>
            <li>Great product and seller...</li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>This shampoo is made by L&#x27;Oreal, and while its not as great as the Force Vector</li>
            <li>The appearance and feel of my hair is greatly improved with its use.</li>
            <li>It is a good choice to meet the needs of all types of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic conditioner and smells so good!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite quick conditioner, easily as good as products that need to remain on you hair longer.</li>
            <li>It causes more hair loss.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I should note that it had been several months since I had conditioned my hair before using Kerastase, so it wasn&#x27;t in the best of shape to begin with.</li>
            <li>First, this smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Kerastase is a fine product, sold in only the best quality salons in my city.</li>
            <li>Fragrance smell is too strong, wish you would come out with a fragrance free or very lightly scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells great though but many cheaper ones will do the same.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I needed to keep adding more product to my hair to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>This is a light product but works well.  </li>
            <li>It came with plastic wrap around the opening and the original seal was removed.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed more watery then normal.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Is not a heavy product and has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair that gets easily weighed down by</li>
            <li>I use it with the matching shampoo &amp; my hair is super soft &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Maybe the company should consider to make a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I have used Kerastase products for over 5 years now but this is the first time for this particular product.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to be doing nothing, like my hair was absorbing it straight away</li>
            <li>In addition, the products felt much nicer - richer, silkier - and the Bain Satin #1 shampoo lathered much easier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lait Vital for years!!</li>
            <li>I really love the conditioner, however i believe the size of it is too small.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>leaves hair so soft, so shiney.</li>
            <li>This one is really \\&quot;too light\\&quot; to have any effect after having it on your hair even on daily basis.</li>
            <li>Sensitive to perfume</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this phenomenon took place, but I suspect that my hair was just really dry and damaged that first time I used it.</li>
            <li>worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>So, the next day when I used my new shampoo and conditioner, I was surprised to find that I needed FAR less of each product to adequately do the job.</li>
            <li>I color my hair with semi-permanent color and this shampoo is gentle and makes my color last a long time.  </li>
            <li>but I have ordered directly from the company site and they have Chinese letters on their product, too.</li>
            <li>That said, once I rinsed and dried my hair, I was amazed at how soft, shiny, well-conditioned and light it felt - not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li>while this may seem pricey, it&#x27;s far more expensive in stores.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this conditioner in the shower, I have to say that I was a little worried.</li>

            <li> It only takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> you can tell the difference after a few washings.</li>
            <li> that is too heavy.</li>
            <li> Whatever the reason, I am hooked on the stuff despite the ridiculous price!</li>
            <li> the crazy expensive salon!&lt;br /&gt;awesome</li>
            <li> Despite raving celebrity reviews of this product, I was sorely disappointed after I began using it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and seller...thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product and you can tell the difference after a few washings. Is not a heavy product and has a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser says he can tell the difference I used this product.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo  also.  I like things that work together.  This is a light product but works well.  Once or twice a week I will also use the balm.  It also is awesome.  My hair is getting stronger and split ends are going away.  Try this product and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I think this product may have been watered down. It came with plastic wrap around the opening and the original seal was removed. The shampoo seemed more watery then normal.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lait Vital for years!! It is my favorite quick conditioner, easily as good as products that need to remain on you hair longer.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product for me.  I have fine curly hair that gets easily weighed down by&lt;br /&gt;product that is too heavy.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smell is too strong, wish you would come out with a fragrance free or very lightly scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It causes more hair loss. It makes hair soft. However it causes hair loss for my family. I do not like this product.</li>
            <li> vb sent this product overnight, sealed. I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase since about 2003 and I love this product. leaves hair so soft, so shiney. it&#x27;s really wonderful product. I color my hair with semi-permanent color and this shampoo is gentle and makes my color last a long time.  while this may seem pricey, it&#x27;s far more expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> I use this with the mutritive bain satin shampoo.  It only takes a very small amount - I use about a dime size.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic conditioner and smells so good! You only need a medium size amount (for longer hair) for nourishment. Works SO well and you get a great result!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but it&#x27;s so pricey. I do think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this conditioner in the shower, I have to say that I was a little worried. It seemed to be doing nothing, like my hair was absorbing it straight away and I felt like I needed to keep adding more product to my hair to get adequate coverage. That said, once I rinsed and dried my hair, I was amazed at how soft, shiny, well-conditioned and light it felt - not weighed down at all. I should note that it had been several months since I had conditioned my hair before using Kerastase, so it wasn&#x27;t in the best of shape to begin with. So, the next day when I used my new shampoo and conditioner, I was surprised to find that I needed FAR less of each product to adequately do the job. In addition, the products felt much nicer - richer, silkier - and the Bain Satin #1 shampoo lathered much easier. I don&#x27;t know why this phenomenon took place, but I suspect that my hair was just really dry and damaged that first time I used it. Whatever the reason, I am hooked on the stuff despite the ridiculous price! It is truly unlike anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Why put a conditioner when it does not serve the purpose. It smells great though but many cheaper ones will do the same. This one is really \\&quot;too light\\&quot; to have any effect after having it on your hair even on daily basis. Hair feels same before application and does not conditions, soften nor smoothen the hair as the purpose of one. Please get a proper conditioner if you want to apply them after each shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase conditioner for years - always #1.  When this bottle arrived I questioned its authenticity because there was no number on the bottle and just a blank spot where the number usually is.  The picture has the number 1.  Have used it, smells and feels the same, but I do question where it came from, and where they get the bottles?</li>
            <li> I really love the conditioner, however i believe the size of it is too small.  Maybe the company should consider to make a large bottle.</li>
            <li> First, this smells amazing! Second, while its not super thick, it&#x27;s super moisturizing! I use it with the matching shampoo &amp; my hair is super soft &amp; shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money spent! You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin, straight and long. This shampoo is made by L&#x27;Oreal, and while its not as great as the Force Vector it is very good, and I use it as an alternative to the force vector line to prevent product build up.</li>
            <li> Spend the money on this and don&#x27;t go to the crazy expensive salon!&lt;br /&gt;awesome great smells good AND does the job!!</li>
            <li> Kerastase is a fine product, sold in only the best quality salons in my city. The appearance and feel of my hair is greatly improved with its use. Buying it through Amazon saves me over a dozen dollars per unit. I highly recommend its use.</li>
            <li> I have used Kerastase products for over 5 years now but this is the first time for this particular product.  It is a good choice to meet the needs of all types of hair.  I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Some people have said thy a worry about the Chinese writing you get on some of the L&#x27;Oreal labels from Amazon but I have ordered directly from the company site and they have Chinese letters on their product, too. Sensitive to perfume but this smells okay.</li>
            <li> Despite raving celebrity reviews of this product, I was sorely disappointed after I began using it.  Not only did it not moisturize my hair, after several uses it actually made the condition of my hair worse.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received a knock-off (the writing on the bottle was not English), but in any case, I would not recommend this product.  #Majorfail</li>
