            <li>I love this airbrush nail art kit</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Purchasing the kit is better than buying separate.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to use the aibrush kit lt weekend</li>
            <li>Airbrush worked great, stencils were ok bt wish there were some for a french tip of some kind.</li>
            <li>Wish it came with better detailed instructions and better decription of how to use.</li>
            <li>But loved the colors, very vibrant.</li>
            <li>It could come with a more detailed manual for us beginners.</li>
            <li>The colors are awesome, and there is an almost endless supply of designs to chose from.</li>
            <li>we opened it and made sure it was clean just like the instruction said to and put the polish in.</li>
            <li>i love this compressor and airbrush very easy to use and very convienient for nail art</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set up, use and clean.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried since, I honestly don&#x27;t want to, so I boxed it up and shoved it under my bed to collect dust because that&#x27;s the only thing its good for right now.</li>
            <li>She mainly doss designs by hand, but keeps this in her shop for the more exotic style designs.</li>
            <li>We are familiar with how to use airbrushes so it was not a matter of not being familiar withthe product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product so I could do my daughters toes myself, she was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I wish it would of had more information on how to use it , and more designs such as ones for the holidays , I been trying to look on the internet to see if I can find some information showing ways to use this machine, I think I should of bought the machine that is for beginners with the video, have not use it yet,</li>
            <li>love this product, just really hard to do my own nails with this, but still love it</li>
            <li>This airbrush kit is so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>I love the complete airbrush art kit.</li>
            <li>I started to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I really like using it, and is art worthy.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for my kit</li>
            <li>The compress power is not as strong as expected, the machine does not work good , for starts nit for regular use</li>
            <li>Stopped spraying during first use.</li>
            <li>exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Brought this product in February and after the first three uses the motor started making a rumbling noise.</li>
            <li>It came fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The compressor and the paints are better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The stencil make personalized nail designs so much easier.</li>
            <li>Despite that works very well.</li>
            <li>witb school Thanks</li>
            <li>She really likes it but says its a bit tricky to get used to using.</li>
            <li>all ready thinned</li>
            <li>The price was indeed reasonable for the set though.</li>
            <li>The stencils were a great addition, however i wasnt pleased with the gun and compressor as the pressure is very low, while the paint is low pigment and pretty thin.</li>
            <li>The stencils are very cool and could be used for other miniature craft projects.  </li>
            <li>Since I am only doing pedicures every now and then, it was worth the money I save going to the nail salons, but I wouldnt purchase it again now</li>
            <li>Overall it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Needless to say the new one works great</li>
            <li>However I wrote the seller and a new one was immediately sent.</li>
            <li>The compressor is very loud and vibrates all over the place, had to set it on the floor and hold it between my feet.</li>
            <li>Maybe for a beginner but not recommended for a professional.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great deal, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried because it took a moment to learn how to use, so I Googled how to use it and after a few several tries..</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it gets HOT really fast, you can smell the motor working hard.</li>
            <li>is a good kit to paint, compressor feels sturdy but the plastic coating seems a little weak.</li>
            <li>i cant use it professionally as its of such a low quality.</li>
            <li>It seems to clog a little even when paint is thinned but fast shipping</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The air compressor on the other hand was all dinged up and clearly used.</li>
            <li> However, it really did not come with directions and if I had not used my husbands compressor, I am not sure I would of figured it out😞</li>
            <li> Hope it works for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is still new in the box and no more attempt were made to use it.</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to figure it out because the instruction manual is very basic.</li>
            <li> A little unsure how to use properly.  </li>
            <li> My airbrush gun doesn&#x27;t work no ink sprays on the nail and the gun looks jammed I need to call the manufacturer</li>
            <li> The delivery on the kit and paints were faster than expected....</li>
            <li> this product is not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I had a serious compressor problem and because i live out of the US it would have taken a long time to get back there and very difficult to return.</li>
            <li> The lever for air and paint was very loose and seems to be broken.</li>
            <li> The air compressor sucks.</li>
            <li> Sucks don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I hate this product, my compressor stopped working two months after I purchased it and the trigger on my airbrush broke aswell.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I ever bought !!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The airbrush is a very fine quality. The compressor and the paints are better than I expected. The stencil make personalized nail designs so much easier.</li>
            <li> I wish it would of had more information on how to use it , and more designs such as ones for the holidays , I been trying to look on the internet to see if I can find some information showing ways to use this machine, I think I should of bought the machine that is for beginners with the video, have not use it yet, but when I do I will put another review up.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this set for me and i love it. I had a serious compressor problem and because i live out of the US it would have taken a long time to get back there and very difficult to return. However I wrote the seller and a new one was immediately sent. Needless to say the new one works great and i would recommend it</li>
            <li> This airbrush kit is so much fun to use. It took me a little bit to figure it out because the instruction manual is very basic. It could come with a more detailed manual for us beginners. But it works great after you play with it, and learn how to use it. I will be using this thing a lot!! The colors are awesome, and there is an almost endless supply of designs to chose from. Hope it works for a long time.  Charlene T.</li>
            <li> The air brush, paints, air hose, and stencils are great. The air compressor on the other hand was all dinged up and clearly used. Not to mention that it gets HOT really fast, you can smell the motor working hard. Since I am only doing pedicures every now and then, it was worth the money I save going to the nail salons, but I wouldnt purchase it again now that I know what I woujld be getting.</li>
            <li> The air compressor sucks. Does not push the paint through the air gun. Had to buy adapters for a big air compressor.</li>
            <li> I Love the colors and stencils and could not wait to use this product. But after I got every thing all set to use the air brush did not work at all. The lever for air and paint was very loose and seems to be broken.</li>
            <li> loved it , great gift my niece was in love . thank you !</li>
            <li> There seems to be some problem as the technician has not used it and said there is a smell, but we need to check it out further.  It is still new in the box and no more attempt were made to use it.</li>
            <li> Stopped spraying during first use.</li>
            <li> is a good kit to paint, compressor feels sturdy but the plastic coating seems a little weak. Despite that works very well.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great deal, but I was wrong! I used it one time then cleaned just like they said in the instruction manual then it did not work again! I tried calling them all that happened was that I was put on HOLD. I then tried to e-mail then 2x&#x27;s NO RESPONSE. All I want is a replacement gun, I think that is fair because I followed their instructions.</li>
            <li> I gave this a medium rating not because I do not like the airbrush. I really like using it, and is art worthy. However, it really did not come with directions and if I had not used my husbands compressor, I am not sure I would of figured it out😞</li>
            <li> I Love it I been practicing on myself and Hope to use more when I get done witb school Thanks</li>
            <li> My airbrush gun doesn&#x27;t work no ink sprays on the nail and the gun looks jammed I need to call the manufacturer</li>
            <li> My machine does not work... at all. I had it in the box for 3 days took it out and went to use it and no color comes out at all.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried because it took a moment to learn how to use, so I Googled how to use it and after a few several tries.. It worked!! I was so happy! After that its all downhill from there. Practice is the key as with ANYTHING! Good luck and just have fun!</li>
            <li> My sister loved it for her birthday :)</li>
            <li> After using the gun once and cleaning the way the instructions said, it no longer works. Air comes out and paint will come out only when you let go of the trigger, and then it just puffs out a tiny amount. The compressor is very loud and vibrates all over the place, had to set it on the floor and hold it between my feet. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for my kit everything was there shipping perfect and price very affordable.I&#x27;m very excited and very satisfied. Thank you will look forward to doing business with you again.</li>
            <li> Great product! One problem.....cuts off if ran for over 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great It is good I got it on time so good . I may buy more depends on how others goes,</li>
            <li> Airbrush worked great, stencils were ok bt wish there were some for a french tip of some kind. But loved the colors, very vibrant. Overall it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The gun did not work...We are familiar with how to use airbrushes so it was not a matter of not being familiar withthe product.</li>
            <li> I love this airbrush nail art kit</li>
            <li> Love it!! I started to use it right away. I have three daughters so this will save me a lot of money</li>
            <li> The delivery on the kit and paints were faster than expected....However, just like everyone else, I used it once and the compressor died on me. even after waiting a day I couldn&#x27;t get it to start back up again. Haven&#x27;t tried since, I honestly don&#x27;t want to, so I boxed it up and shoved it under my bed to collect dust because that&#x27;s the only thing its good for right now.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother in law. She just finished school for nail tech. She really likes it but says its a bit tricky to get used to using. She mainly doss designs by hand, but keeps this in her shop for the more exotic style designs.</li>
            <li> Great buy but didn&#x27;t come with paint all ready thinned so I clogged the sprayer and what a pain that was!! It seems to clog a little even when paint is thinned but fast shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so I could do my daughters toes myself, she was so excited when it arrived. we opened it and made sure it was clean just like the instruction said to and put the polish in. We could feel the air blowing out of it but no polish!!! The company sent me an email saying if I had any problems I could call but every time I call all I get is an answering machine and no they haven&#x27;t called me back. Worst thing I ever bought !!!</li>
            <li> The compress power is not as strong as expected, the machine does not work good , for starts nit for regular use</li>
            <li> love this product, just really hard to do my own nails with this, but still love it</li>
            <li> The stencils were a great addition, however i wasnt pleased with the gun and compressor as the pressure is very low, while the paint is low pigment and pretty thin. i cant use it professionally as its of such a low quality. Maybe for a beginner but not recommended for a professional. I may have to purchase another compressor. The price was indeed reasonable for the set though.</li>
            <li> Its a great value but i wasnt thrilled with the ease of use.  Wish it came with better detailed instructions and better decription of how to use.</li>
            <li> Love it! It works really good. They should start giving out instructions about they paint that comes with it. It doesn&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s a product that needs to be thinned or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Sucks don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
            <li> Love it. It is just what I had hoped for.It came fast and was exactly as described.I was surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertised in a timely fashion and in good condition.  The stencils are very cool and could be used for other miniature craft projects.  Airbrush and compressor work well, but the compressor is a bit noisy, not intolerable.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the kit. Wish there was a starter video. A little unsure how to use properly.  Wonder if we need to wear a mask.</li>
            <li> I love the complete airbrush art kit. It&#x27;s easy to set up, use and clean. Purchasing the kit is better than buying separate.</li>
            <li> I hate this product, my compressor stopped working two months after I purchased it and the trigger on my airbrush broke aswell. this product is not worth buying. I do not recommend anyone else to buy this product..</li>
            <li> exactly what i ordered. i love this compressor and airbrush very easy to use and very convienient for nail art</li>
            <li> Brought this product in February and after the first three uses the motor started making a rumbling noise. After a month it stopped working all together. Would never ever purchase another one. Do not recommend anyone purchase this.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to use the aibrush kit lt weekend my husband bought it for me for my birthday and i love it!!! very easy to use and the art turns out very nice!!</li>
