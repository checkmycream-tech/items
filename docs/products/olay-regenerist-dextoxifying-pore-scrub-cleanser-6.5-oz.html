            <li>I do not need to follow with a moisturizer, and that&#x27;s great for me because moisturizers are what seem to do me in.  </li>
            <li>As for what I have experienced so far-&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>What I liked the best is it did not leave the feeling that I have oil or lotion on after I</li>

            <li>This product strikes a very nice balance.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the pore scrub and brush is very effective in removing makeup, opening up clogged pores and cleansing the face without drying it out.</li>
            <li>However, it is a great cleanser and has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love to have beautiful skin, but not at the price of killing fish and endangering everything that eats them - including people!</li>
            <li>I love this Olay Scrub, it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>So if you are looking at the Regenerist products this might be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is also quite good considering you get two tubes.</li>
            <li>I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>and it was good by itself</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good as a cleanser and as an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I smells really good</li>
            <li>, Works good on your face and neck.</li>
            <li>and I loved it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good post-menopause acne cleanser that smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good scrub.</li>
            <li>It feels really good.  </li>
            <li>But, I still think its a good product.  </li>
            <li>it just smells good.</li>
            <li>This scrub is simply excellent as a mild exfoliating/moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the way this makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>This wash also has a great smell, which I personally love.</li>
            <li>Great product love it.</li>
            <li>Plus, the scrub smells really good and feels nice to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to detoxify and clean your face with!</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have an oily t-zone and using this cleanser, the refreshing toner and the intensive refining sulfur mask has made my skin look amazing!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels so much better!</li>
            <li>I absolutly love this product!</li>
            <li>Has done a great job minimizing the pores and gving my face a smooth polished look.  </li>
            <li>But the product its self is amazing.</li>
            <li>The way it makes your skin feel just after one use is amazing.</li>
            <li>Added bonus is the tube dispenser - extremely handy because i use this in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It smells good &amp; I&#x27;m sure detoxifies the skin but doesn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of the pores, as it claims.  </li>
            <li>I leave this on for about 10 minutes then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Id rather pick my own perfume to spray on my body not my face.  </li>
            <li>I bought this scrub because of the nice reviews here, thinking it would suit me well and help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soap that even my husband likes to use.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>Love this product line and this is a good deal</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether the scrub or the brush is doing the most good</li>
            <li>This makes a nice exfoliating scrub, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to visibly improve your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Kind of wish I had stayed in Florida (where I lived in my childhood) with the humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I can honestly say that ALL of my reservations are GONE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably very good if you need something very gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very strong fragrance, so maybe that exacerbated the problem.</li>
            <li>use to have near perfect skin and never had to try to take care of it all</li>
            <li>Girlfriend liked it more than I did.</li>
            <li>Been using this so far good!!, does not bother my eyes....</li>
            <li>The Olay scrub does a pretty good job and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I got this to try the brand the first time, I usually am happy with Neutrogena scrubs.</li>
            <li>another great product, thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>I just got this today in a gift set with the cream I am a 35 year old with very good skin</li>
            <li>See a huge difference on my face!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a healthy glow, and keeps gnarly blackheads at bay.  </li>
            <li>At any age, this product is magic.</li>
            <li>It seems to be better at pushing the impurities to the surface of my skin as well.</li>
            <li>Am very much Satisfied with these product....</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for x-mas gift to go with the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System; my wife loves both!</li>
            <li>but when summer comes and the face is as oily as i comes it take more then once to get the oils off.</li>
            <li>I have always had oily skin &amp; love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>I love Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>I have tried several Olay cleansing products and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>She seems to love it along with the Pro-x Cleaning System I bought for her as well...</li>
            <li>To learn more about this problem go to beatthemicrobead.org.  </li>
            <li>Love the way that this feels.</li>
            <li>I love Olay product, you can count on them being just what they advertise them to be.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Refreshing scrub, results just seem to improve with continued use.</li>
            <li>The face feels nice and smooth afterward, I&#x27;ve had no problems with outbreaks or anything after about 4 uses, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love this wash, I also use the Olay X-Pro.</li>
            <li>, I must say, I love both products.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be real gritty and works best with Olay&#x27;s ProX power scrubber.</li>
            <li>I love that it came in a set of two.</li>
            <li>Love my skin</li>

            <li>It has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>Need some more time to evaulate.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Been through so many cleansers I can&#x27;t say I had a lot of hope</li>
            <li>My skin is looking and feeling better than it has in ...</li>
            <li>My skin glows and just LOOKS healthy all the time.</li>
            <li>This scrub keeps me pimple and blackhead free!  </li>
            <li>I use and love the Regenerist night cream and serum so decided to try this product also.</li>
            <li>an glad</li>
            <li>This Olay Detox pore scrub feels good and used in tiny amount on a warm shower makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>But when there are no active pimples, its very good.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, leaves skin feeling much smoother, feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>leave skin nice and clean....</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel very clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Face feels and looks very clean.  </li>
            <li>Included one for my mom in a care package and she loved it so much she is using it as well!</li>
            <li>Am trying this product for the first time and there is some good result in the skin texture.  </li>
            <li>Rinses so clean!  </li>
            <li>So I decided to opt for specialized cream for fine lines and wrinkles. :-)</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after use!</li>
            <li>make sure you moisturize after you wash your face, most people don&#x27;t realize but that is a huge huge part of your skin care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li>Leaves face really smooth. :)</li>
            <li>My husband told me that i should buy this along with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz and am glad that i did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great skin cleaner and leaves my skin feelin so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle cleansing scrub that is good for your pores.  </li>
            <li>DOes clean the face better than soap.</li>
            <li>well and ihas a very mild scrubbing effect.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed a change and very mild scrub.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>it feeling squeaky clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>The adding of the name was easy to do, with address for deliveries too..</li>
            <li>; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong smelling.</li>
            <li>scent is not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>and I cannot use it again because the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li>This product is much better and takes off all the makeup and leaves your face clean and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I do have a some fine lines but thay are gone with this .</li>
            <li>would recommend these products for anyone with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel soft and fresh and smells great.</li>
            <li>Olay make a nice face scrub but it has way too much perfume for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and to anyone that struggles to keep their skin blemish free.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is nice cleanser with a gentle scent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>The feel of the microbeads on your face makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>I do use a light moisturizer in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was just unscented or lightly scented, or just had that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell rather than a perfumed, flowery smell.  </li>
            <li>It works great &amp; it&#x27;s not only for woman men can use it as well.</li>
            <li>, I went and got the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Fragrance Free (and have since used the frangranced one as well, which is not offensive in smell) and this product (Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub) came with it for 1/2 off or free or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>, is gentle and smells nice.</li>
            <li>So happy that you don&#x27;t have to by ONLY the ProX cleanser for the machine.  </li>
            <li>but I was purchasing the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of years now and my facial routine has been very successful and pores have certainly improved in appearance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal for consumers whose skin is classfied in the oily type of category and need frequent clean ups without really damaging the skin.</li>
            <li>Also, purchasing this 2-pack is very economical.  </li>
            <li>This makes you face fell so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>but this product is super gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>The fine crystals give good exfoliation and I can see and feel a vast difference.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling and looking clean.  </li>
            <li>my skin felt realy clean</li>
            <li>Rinses off clean too.</li>
            <li>My skin feels \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The best facial scrub I have found so far</li>
            <li>Works well and keeps my pores clean.</li>
            <li>It doesnt do anything special...</li>
            <li>works great the first time i used it i could tell my face was softer &amp; looked younger.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for sure, thanks</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed and has a mild scent that seems gender-neutral to me.</li>
            <li>My pores do look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>Not harsh and does an effective job of cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I used regular soap and loved the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling from that.  </li>
            <li>I orderd the facial cleanser after reading all the good reviews for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing action is mild, but effective.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve washed it off, my skin feels very soft and smooth, and the texture appears more even.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve tried has worked well, but this particular scrub is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and it goes away rather quickly.     </li>
            <li>I hope Amazon can continue to sell it, because it is my favorite facial scrub!! :)</li>
            <li>The scrub itself is mild</li>
            <li>One of the best plusses about this Olay product is that it&#x27;s replacing a similar high-end facial wash I was using for which I paid 4 times the price of this.</li>
            <li>the best thing is that it&#x27;s cheap, the products have excellent reviews and quality assurance testimonials from consumer reports mad other comsumer review type of sites.</li>
            <li>: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li>: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, and leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 43 with great skin but slightly enlarged pores with age.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks great not to mention my achy is a lot less problematic.</li>
            <li>Then wash it away and boom, clean smooth skin with a visibly more even tone 5 minutes later!  </li>
            <li>Its alright, skin feels clean and smooth as it should after using a decent scrub.</li>
            <li>The particles of the scrub are small, but not the tiniest I&#x27;ve seen, nor the most abrasive; they do a good job for a more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not dry my face out like other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I guess my skin must have changed and not been okay with my old stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li>Well worth trying.</li>
            <li>bubbles each time; could be fun, but a bit cumbersome too.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is just about right for my skin which can become irritated if the exfoliant is too aggressive.  </li>
            <li>the products I had been using just weren&#x27;t right for my skin</li>
            <li>It really does seem to help clean out my pores...</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very fine product</li>
            <li>Love this wash,micro beads yet gentle on my close to 60 year old face.</li>
            <li>Olay products are great, constant use is the key</li>
            <li>Does not over dry and has a nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I previously used this face wash and loved it</li>
            <li>But overall I love this facewash and it was well worth the price</li>
            <li>I love this product because it makes my skin feel rejuvenated and also does not dry it</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking smooth and young!</li>
            <li>I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li>I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-drying and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li>Try it u will love it, Will definitely recommend it to a friend.....</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>After washing my face for the first time with the scrub, I was overpowered by the scent.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first night.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I figured out I should use lotion or better facial soaps.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines became \\&quot;finer\\&quot; (less visable) and I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>i gave it only 4 out of 5 stars because i think it should have a bit more scrub in it.</li>
            <li>The srub particles are effective and yet not too rough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too harsh and it cleans the skin really good.</li>
            <li>I used to wash my face with Bath and Body works products and it would get sooo dry and flaky , since I use this product my face is more clear, looks healthier and cleans my face easily even when I have make-up on.  </li>
            <li>I notice a significant difference (dullness, more blackheads on my T-Zone, less softness) when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good facial scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned that the scent was similar to an old lady&#x27;s perfume -- and that is an apt description.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice it at first</li>
            <li>Also, seems more economical than other Olay products.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay Regenerist for the past two years and the compliments I have received on my facial complexion is incredible.  </li>
            <li>(Though apparently I don&#x27;t look my age at all; people peg me at around 25, believe it or not, but I think it is also important how one feels about oneself even if they&#x27;re the only ones that see the fine lines!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It certainly scrubs with no allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li>Everytime I use scrubs, the first night of use was always amazing to the skin but on the second night, red spots would appear which means my skin doesnt like it and</li>
            <li>Now I am 37, and relatively recently I&#x27;ve been getting those fine lines</li>
            <li>Highly recommended over higher priced units.</li>
            <li>The only face wash I have used since it was made available.</li>
            <li>This also contains aloe which is very soothing.</li>
            <li>: I really like the wash.</li>
            <li>It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li>This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li>really like Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I really like Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll finish the 2 tubes as a cleanser, but I need a separate scrub to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li>My face felt instantly refreshed, toned, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I have very oily skin</li>

            <li>Still, it cleanses my skin well and my face feels much softer.</li>
            <li>, well now I have very oily skin, and it came out of no where.</li>
            <li>but it really really does improve your skin, not just acne, but tone and everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scrub was too gentle for my skin but cleansed well.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle, and it works.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is gentle and yet cleared up my problem areas.</li>
            <li>It also has a very pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Use it every day and would recommend to anyone looking for something gentle, yet thorough.</li>
            <li>I have very oil skin and this cleanser really works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a real issue.  </li>

            <li>was received in a fast timely matter.</li>
            <li>i really like this scrub.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Smaller, more clear pores.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonably and you only need a squirt of this detoxifying scrub to clean your face.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Olay products and love them.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products that give a much more noticable anti aging effect.</li>
            <li>i got so excited i bought 2 each last winter...</li>
            <li>This scrub does a fine job without leaving the skin dry.  </li>
            <li>I love this gentle facial scrub for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless products over the years, and facials, which only make me break out more.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this daily, mixed in with the Microdermabrasion peel kit twice a week, and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I have a classic T-Zone, though my T-Zone is getting narrower as I age.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize I was messing up my skin and making it older faster.  </li>
            <li>I think this is my first real review I&#x27;ve left, but I really wanted to share with people what I&#x27;ve thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried using it in the morning, too, and found this too much for my skin (fair, a little sensitive, sometimes red).  </li>
            <li>It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest using the cleansing system if you have oily skin, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps me from using the product more frequently and makes me wonder if it is gentle enough on my skin, having such an overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My pores used to be fairly large but are now much smaller which gives my face an overall smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li>My skin has always been sensitive to scrubs, no matter how gentle it is...</li>
            <li>It cleans squeaky clean, but doesnt feel dry after.  </li>
            <li>It took a few more weeks to notice a difference on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>leave skin fresh and vibrate I will recommend for used as a one a week facial treatment!!</li>
            <li>but I finally have a skin care routine down to where it&#x27;s keeping my skin nice again.</li>
            <li>Target actually sells their own brand for half the price and works just as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old and always thought regenerist was for older women....</li>
            <li>not much of a scrub, more like a soapy facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s dry and flaky areas are gone, my oily areas are well controlled and my mild acne breakouts are all clearing up.</li>
            <li>Ok scrub, but can&#x27;t get past the scent, which is very masculine.  </li>
            <li>My pores definitely look smaller and my face is almost completely clear and free of any blocked pores.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li>After first use I began using it daily</li>
            <li>she looks younger ;-) will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Even though its an exfoliating scrub it is not harsh and you get two bottles!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s patronize the manufacturers who make all natural products!</li>
            <li>As others have said on here, the perfume is a little strong.</li>
            <li>, it gives me a deep clean and has actually helped minimize pores.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week to deep clean my face after I use my facial cleansing oil from InstaNatural, followed by InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner.</li>
            <li>I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li>This has become my usual evening face wash for the past 4months, my skin feels to fresh and soft afterwards, it is kind to the skin and eyes, the beads are very light although for me they still do the job, you don&#x27;t want it too harsh on your skin anyways.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well but does not dry.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy in fact that all of the 4 subscribed went from the status of shipping soon ,to shipped within a few days...</li>
            <li>It must have surely gone down deep into my pores and gotten all the makeup and impurities out.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li>I have minor acne and this seems to clear it right up.  </li>
            <li>It dissolves the make-up right off my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed with slight exfoliation properties.  </li>
            <li>I have clear skin...</li>
            <li>Since I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and have wrestled with acne as an adult.  </li>
            <li>Its only like $20...) to really work it into your skin.</li>
            <li>The two pack was really convenient, left one in the shower and one on the sink.  </li>
            <li>As far as the cleansing products cant say anymore as I cant get beyond the smell anymore.</li>
            <li>some scrubs are very coarse but this one doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Your face is so soft and youthfully looking.</li>
            <li>My face still feels soft in the morning after using these both.  </li>
            <li>and it has immediate results (skin soft, looks healthier, and makes skin look like it has a makeup primer on it</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I received two tube and completely used both as directed.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for sensitive skin&#x27;</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and with a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li>I am over 40 and have been getting breakouts more frequently lately.  </li>
            <li>I still recommend it, but if you have a sensitive sense of smell like I do, take that into account.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had to surrender to the fact that my skin is changing and</li>
            <li>I find this scrub gentle enough to use once a day, at night.  </li>
            <li>I do not have any problems with my face as far as zip or oiliness</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have used this product repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This product keeps me looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li>Thank you Olay for a product that actually produces real results.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products , but a few you just go back too</li>
            <li>( I mean huge! )</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 64) and this is just so gritty that it makes my face raw if I use it more often than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>I also use either 100% pure shea butter or the antioxidant recovery cream for mature skin after I use the peel and both works wonders to elevate the dry tightness you experience after a peel.</li>
            <li>Skin felt clean, polished, and slightly firmer but not dry.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try something new.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and soft after using this daily in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble with my skin while I was pregnant</li>
            <li>It is like a gel with small beads which help clean.  </li>
            <li>The scrubbing granules are very small and more like tiny beads.</li>
            <li>I do not find the light fragrance the least bit offensive.</li>
            <li>One 6.5 ounce tube last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my skin is really clear.  </li>
            <li>Also you only need a dab if it cause it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but then I started pairing it with their pro-x cleaning system and has completely turned my skin around, I only use the cleansing system at night though.</li>
            <li>They have changed the formula and I am allergic apparently..</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and have seen a marked improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I just use this in the shower, the third time I used it my acne is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchase this hoping it would help, but I think my skin got worse and the breakouts were more severe.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal to dry skin, you may want to follow the instructions and limit it to once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Works way better then other things I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li>I am using several other regenerist products and its not my imagination, my skin looks and feels much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper to buy a 2 pack of this than any other facial cleansing product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line).</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin stays clear now and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin do not rub hard, just use gentle circular motions.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great delivery time.  </li>
            <li> I do like this product and price was great for two.</li>
            <li> This product strikes a very nice balance.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the pore scrub and brush is very effective in removing makeup, opening up clogged pores and cleansing the face without drying it out.</li>
            <li> However, it is a great cleanser and has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love to have beautiful skin, but not at the price of killing fish and endangering everything that eats them - including people!</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Scrub, it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> So if you are looking at the Regenerist products this might be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is also quite good considering you get two tubes.</li>
            <li> I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> and it was good by itself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a cleanser and as an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I smells really good</li>
            <li> , Works good on your face and neck.</li>
            <li> and I loved it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good post-menopause acne cleanser that smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> It feels really good.  </li>
            <li> But, I still think its a good product.  </li>
            <li> it just smells good.</li>
            <li> This scrub is simply excellent as a mild exfoliating/moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the way this makes my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> This wash also has a great smell, which I personally love.</li>
            <li> Great product love it.</li>
            <li> Plus, the scrub smells really good and feels nice to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to detoxify and clean your face with!</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone and using this cleanser, the refreshing toner and the intensive refining sulfur mask has made my skin look amazing!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels so much better!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product!</li>
            <li> Has done a great job minimizing the pores and gving my face a smooth polished look.  </li>
            <li> But the product its self is amazing.</li>
            <li> The way it makes your skin feel just after one use is amazing.</li>
            <li> Added bonus is the tube dispenser - extremely handy because i use this in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It smells good &amp; I&#x27;m sure detoxifies the skin but doesn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of the pores, as it claims.  </li>
            <li> I leave this on for about 10 minutes then wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Id rather pick my own perfume to spray on my body not my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this scrub because of the nice reviews here, thinking it would suit me well and help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soap that even my husband likes to use.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> Love this product line and this is a good deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the scrub or the brush is doing the most good</li>
            <li> This makes a nice exfoliating scrub, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to visibly improve your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I had stayed in Florida (where I lived in my childhood) with the humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I can honestly say that ALL of my reservations are GONE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably very good if you need something very gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very strong fragrance, so maybe that exacerbated the problem.</li>
            <li> use to have near perfect skin and never had to try to take care of it all</li>
            <li> Girlfriend liked it more than I did.</li>
            <li> Been using this so far good!!, does not bother my eyes....</li>
            <li> The Olay scrub does a pretty good job and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I got this to try the brand the first time, I usually am happy with Neutrogena scrubs.</li>
            <li> another great product, thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> I just got this today in a gift set with the cream I am a 35 year old with very good skin</li>
            <li> See a huge difference on my face!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a healthy glow, and keeps gnarly blackheads at bay.  </li>
            <li> At any age, this product is magic.</li>
            <li> It seems to be better at pushing the impurities to the surface of my skin as well.</li>
            <li> Am very much Satisfied with these product....</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for x-mas gift to go with the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System; my wife loves both!</li>
            <li> but when summer comes and the face is as oily as i comes it take more then once to get the oils off.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin &amp; love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this one.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Olay cleansing products and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> She seems to love it along with the Pro-x Cleaning System I bought for her as well...</li>
            <li> To learn more about this problem go to beatthemicrobead.org.  </li>
            <li> Love the way that this feels.</li>
            <li> I love Olay product, you can count on them being just what they advertise them to be.</li>
            <li> I also use the Age defining shower wash, love that too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scrub, results just seem to improve with continued use.</li>
            <li> The face feels nice and smooth afterward, I&#x27;ve had no problems with outbreaks or anything after about 4 uses, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this wash, I also use the Olay X-Pro.</li>
            <li> , I must say, I love both products.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be real gritty and works best with Olay&#x27;s ProX power scrubber.</li>
            <li> I love that it came in a set of two.</li>
            <li> Love my skin</li>
            <li> I love using this</li>
            <li> I love the Pore Scrub it self.</li>
            <li> AND REALLY FIND IT TO BE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND</li>
            <li> It has been fantastic!</li>
            <li> Need some more time to evaulate.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Been through so many cleansers I can&#x27;t say I had a lot of hope</li>
            <li> My skin is looking and feeling better than it has in ...</li>
            <li> My skin glows and just LOOKS healthy all the time.</li>
            <li> This scrub keeps me pimple and blackhead free!  </li>
            <li> I use and love the Regenerist night cream and serum so decided to try this product also.</li>
            <li> an glad</li>
            <li> This Olay Detox pore scrub feels good and used in tiny amount on a warm shower makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> But when there are no active pimples, its very good.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, leaves skin feeling much smoother, feels very clean.  </li>
            <li> leave skin nice and clean....</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel very clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Face feels and looks very clean.  </li>
            <li> Included one for my mom in a care package and she loved it so much she is using it as well!</li>
            <li> Am trying this product for the first time and there is some good result in the skin texture.  </li>
            <li> Rinses so clean!  </li>
            <li> So I decided to opt for specialized cream for fine lines and wrinkles. :-)</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after use!</li>
            <li> make sure you moisturize after you wash your face, most people don&#x27;t realize but that is a huge huge part of your skin care routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves face really smooth. :)</li>
            <li> My husband told me that i should buy this along with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz and am glad that i did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great skin cleaner and leaves my skin feelin so soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleansing scrub that is good for your pores.  </li>
            <li> DOes clean the face better than soap.</li>
            <li> well and ihas a very mild scrubbing effect.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a change and very mild scrub.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> it feeling squeaky clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> The adding of the name was easy to do, with address for deliveries too..</li>
            <li> ; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong smelling.</li>
            <li> scent is not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> and I cannot use it again because the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li> This product is much better and takes off all the makeup and leaves your face clean and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I do have a some fine lines but thay are gone with this .</li>
            <li> would recommend these products for anyone with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel soft and fresh and smells great.</li>
            <li> Olay make a nice face scrub but it has way too much perfume for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and to anyone that struggles to keep their skin blemish free.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is nice cleanser with a gentle scent.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> The feel of the microbeads on your face makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> I do use a light moisturizer in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was just unscented or lightly scented, or just had that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell rather than a perfumed, flowery smell.  </li>
            <li> It works great &amp; it&#x27;s not only for woman men can use it as well.</li>
            <li> , I went and got the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Fragrance Free (and have since used the frangranced one as well, which is not offensive in smell) and this product (Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub) came with it for 1/2 off or free or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> , is gentle and smells nice.</li>
            <li> So happy that you don&#x27;t have to by ONLY the ProX cleanser for the machine.  </li>
            <li> but I was purchasing the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and my facial routine has been very successful and pores have certainly improved in appearance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ideal for consumers whose skin is classfied in the oily type of category and need frequent clean ups without really damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, purchasing this 2-pack is very economical.  </li>
            <li> This makes you face fell so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> but this product is super gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> The fine crystals give good exfoliation and I can see and feel a vast difference.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling and looking clean.  </li>
            <li> my skin felt realy clean</li>
            <li> Rinses off clean too.</li>
            <li> My skin feels \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The best facial scrub I have found so far</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps my pores clean.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do anything special...</li>
            <li> works great the first time i used it i could tell my face was softer &amp; looked younger.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for sure, thanks</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed and has a mild scent that seems gender-neutral to me.</li>
            <li> My pores do look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Not harsh and does an effective job of cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I used regular soap and loved the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling from that.  </li>
            <li> I orderd the facial cleanser after reading all the good reviews for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing action is mild, but effective.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve washed it off, my skin feels very soft and smooth, and the texture appears more even.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried has worked well, but this particular scrub is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and it goes away rather quickly.     </li>
            <li> I hope Amazon can continue to sell it, because it is my favorite facial scrub!! :)</li>
            <li> The scrub itself is mild</li>
            <li> One of the best plusses about this Olay product is that it&#x27;s replacing a similar high-end facial wash I was using for which I paid 4 times the price of this.</li>
            <li> the best thing is that it&#x27;s cheap, the products have excellent reviews and quality assurance testimonials from consumer reports mad other comsumer review type of sites.</li>
            <li> : I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li> : I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, and leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 43 with great skin but slightly enlarged pores with age.  </li>
            <li> My face feels and looks great not to mention my achy is a lot less problematic.</li>
            <li> Then wash it away and boom, clean smooth skin with a visibly more even tone 5 minutes later!  </li>
            <li> Its alright, skin feels clean and smooth as it should after using a decent scrub.</li>
            <li> The particles of the scrub are small, but not the tiniest I&#x27;ve seen, nor the most abrasive; they do a good job for a more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not dry my face out like other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I guess my skin must have changed and not been okay with my old stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne</li>
            <li> Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> bubbles each time; could be fun, but a bit cumbersome too.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is just about right for my skin which can become irritated if the exfoliant is too aggressive.  </li>
            <li> the products I had been using just weren&#x27;t right for my skin</li>
            <li> It really does seem to help clean out my pores...</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very fine product</li>
            <li> Love this wash,micro beads yet gentle on my close to 60 year old face.</li>
            <li> Olay products are great, constant use is the key</li>
            <li> Does not over dry and has a nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I previously used this face wash and loved it</li>
            <li> But overall I love this facewash and it was well worth the price</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin feel rejuvenated and also does not dry it</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking smooth and young!</li>
            <li> I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li> I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-drying and leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li> Try it u will love it, Will definitely recommend it to a friend.....</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> After washing my face for the first time with the scrub, I was overpowered by the scent.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first night.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I figured out I should use lotion or better facial soaps.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines became \\&quot;finer\\&quot; (less visable) and I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> i gave it only 4 out of 5 stars because i think it should have a bit more scrub in it.</li>
            <li> The srub particles are effective and yet not too rough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh and it cleans the skin really good.</li>
            <li> I used to wash my face with Bath and Body works products and it would get sooo dry and flaky , since I use this product my face is more clear, looks healthier and cleans my face easily even when I have make-up on.  </li>
            <li> I notice a significant difference (dullness, more blackheads on my T-Zone, less softness) when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good facial scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned that the scent was similar to an old lady&#x27;s perfume -- and that is an apt description.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it at first</li>
            <li> Also, seems more economical than other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Regenerist for the past two years and the compliments I have received on my facial complexion is incredible.  </li>
            <li> (Though apparently I don&#x27;t look my age at all; people peg me at around 25, believe it or not, but I think it is also important how one feels about oneself even if they&#x27;re the only ones that see the fine lines!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It certainly scrubs with no allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use scrubs, the first night of use was always amazing to the skin but on the second night, red spots would appear which means my skin doesnt like it and</li>
            <li> Now I am 37, and relatively recently I&#x27;ve been getting those fine lines</li>
            <li> Highly recommended over higher priced units.</li>
            <li> The only face wash I have used since it was made available.</li>
            <li> This also contains aloe which is very soothing.</li>
            <li> : I really like the wash.</li>
            <li> It does have a very noticeable scent -</li>
            <li> This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic.</li>
            <li> really like Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I really like Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish the 2 tubes as a cleanser, but I need a separate scrub to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li> My face felt instantly refreshed, toned, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle, and it works.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is gentle and yet cleared up my problem areas.</li>

            <li> Smaller, more clear pores.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonably and you only need a squirt of this detoxifying scrub to clean your face.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products and love them.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that give a much more noticable anti aging effect.</li>
            <li> i got so excited i bought 2 each last winter...</li>
            <li> This scrub does a fine job without leaving the skin dry.  </li>
            <li> I love this gentle facial scrub for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products over the years, and facials, which only make me break out more.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this daily, mixed in with the Microdermabrasion peel kit twice a week, and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I have a classic T-Zone, though my T-Zone is getting narrower as I age.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I was messing up my skin and making it older faster.  </li>
            <li> I think this is my first real review I&#x27;ve left, but I really wanted to share with people what I&#x27;ve thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried using it in the morning, too, and found this too much for my skin (fair, a little sensitive, sometimes red).  </li>
            <li> It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest using the cleansing system if you have oily skin, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps me from using the product more frequently and makes me wonder if it is gentle enough on my skin, having such an overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My pores used to be fairly large but are now much smaller which gives my face an overall smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive to scrubs, no matter how gentle it is...</li>
            <li> It cleans squeaky clean, but doesnt feel dry after.  </li>
            <li> It took a few more weeks to notice a difference on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> leave skin fresh and vibrate I will recommend for used as a one a week facial treatment!!</li>
            <li> but I finally have a skin care routine down to where it&#x27;s keeping my skin nice again.</li>
            <li> Target actually sells their own brand for half the price and works just as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and always thought regenerist was for older women....</li>
            <li> not much of a scrub, more like a soapy facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s dry and flaky areas are gone, my oily areas are well controlled and my mild acne breakouts are all clearing up.</li>
            <li> Ok scrub, but can&#x27;t get past the scent, which is very masculine.  </li>
            <li> My pores definitely look smaller and my face is almost completely clear and free of any blocked pores.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on.</li>
            <li> After first use I began using it daily</li>
            <li> she looks younger ;-) will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Even though its an exfoliating scrub it is not harsh and you get two bottles!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s patronize the manufacturers who make all natural products!</li>
            <li> As others have said on here, the perfume is a little strong.</li>
            <li> , it gives me a deep clean and has actually helped minimize pores.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week to deep clean my face after I use my facial cleansing oil from InstaNatural, followed by InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner.</li>
            <li> I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible.</li>
            <li> This has become my usual evening face wash for the past 4months, my skin feels to fresh and soft afterwards, it is kind to the skin and eyes, the beads are very light although for me they still do the job, you don&#x27;t want it too harsh on your skin anyways.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well but does not dry.  </li>
            <li> It was so easy in fact that all of the 4 subscribed went from the status of shipping soon ,to shipped within a few days...</li>
            <li> It must have surely gone down deep into my pores and gotten all the makeup and impurities out.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps.</li>
            <li> I have minor acne and this seems to clear it right up.  </li>
            <li> It dissolves the make-up right off my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refreshed with slight exfoliation properties.  </li>
            <li> I have clear skin...</li>
            <li> Since I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and have wrestled with acne as an adult.  </li>
            <li> Its only like $20...) to really work it into your skin.</li>
            <li> The two pack was really convenient, left one in the shower and one on the sink.  </li>
            <li> As far as the cleansing products cant say anymore as I cant get beyond the smell anymore.</li>
            <li> some scrubs are very coarse but this one doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Your face is so soft and youthfully looking.</li>
            <li> My face still feels soft in the morning after using these both.  </li>
            <li> and it has immediate results (skin soft, looks healthier, and makes skin look like it has a makeup primer on it</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I received two tube and completely used both as directed.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for sensitive skin&#x27;</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and with a bit of a glow.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and have been getting breakouts more frequently lately.  </li>
            <li> I still recommend it, but if you have a sensitive sense of smell like I do, take that into account.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had to surrender to the fact that my skin is changing and</li>
            <li> I find this scrub gentle enough to use once a day, at night.  </li>
            <li> I do not have any problems with my face as far as zip or oiliness</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have used this product repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me looking and feeling young.</li>
            <li> Thank you Olay for a product that actually produces real results.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products , but a few you just go back too</li>
            <li> ( I mean huge! )</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 64) and this is just so gritty that it makes my face raw if I use it more often than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> I also use either 100% pure shea butter or the antioxidant recovery cream for mature skin after I use the peel and both works wonders to elevate the dry tightness you experience after a peel.</li>
            <li> Skin felt clean, polished, and slightly firmer but not dry.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try something new.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and soft after using this daily in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin while I was pregnant</li>
            <li> It is like a gel with small beads which help clean.  </li>
            <li> The scrubbing granules are very small and more like tiny beads.</li>
            <li> I do not find the light fragrance the least bit offensive.</li>
            <li> One 6.5 ounce tube last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my skin is really clear.  </li>
            <li> Also you only need a dab if it cause it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but then I started pairing it with their pro-x cleaning system and has completely turned my skin around, I only use the cleansing system at night though.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula and I am allergic apparently..</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and have seen a marked improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just use this in the shower, the third time I used it my acne is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchase this hoping it would help, but I think my skin got worse and the breakouts were more severe.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal to dry skin, you may want to follow the instructions and limit it to once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Works way better then other things I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li> I am using several other regenerist products and its not my imagination, my skin looks and feels much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper to buy a 2 pack of this than any other facial cleansing product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line).</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin stays clear now and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin do not rub hard, just use gentle circular motions.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this scrub even if you only have a slight case of worrying  over your skin...</li>
            <li> Due to mature skin, can only use once a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to combine anti-aging with exfoliation, but this product does not do it very well.  </li>
            <li> long story short....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone.</li>
            <li> It does the job just fine, but is expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other scrubs and couldn&#x27;t believe how different this one left my face feeling.</li>
            <li> I can be a little sensitive to products</li>
            <li> Actually I have never developed a rash after using any face products, so there must be something different and harsh in this specific product.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have pimples because the last thing you want to do is spread the bacteria around your face with the exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and have found the regime I&#x27;ll be with for a long time.</li>
            <li> You definitely get plenty of it, it&#x27;ll probably last half a year in my case.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I chose to start using it only at night due to</li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> my teens, I never had acne, however, I lived in Los Angeles (and now Utah, both dry climates)</li>
            <li> and my skin was/is/gets dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried proactive, which worked well for the acne, but bleached my skin, leaving me with an uneven skin tone (African American).</li>
            <li> I use it every single morning followed by Olay Regenerist Moisturizer and that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Washing off is a bit weird because it is extremely soapy - trying to rinse my face and getting huge</li>
            <li> reviewers in the past found the scent overpowering, but it wasn&#x27;t at all in my opinion (and I have a sensitive nose).</li>
            <li> sad yes, but true.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s very little \\&quot;grit\\&quot; and IMO its too little to do much.  </li>
            <li> I notice them less and they appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging.</li>
            <li> The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it very often as my skin is thin and dry</li>
            <li> It is not harsh and does not irritate my skin like some other brands of microscrubs I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> and you only have to use a little dab at a time.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep my face free of dirty pores.  </li>
            <li> It foams and washes my face, but does not really exfoliate that well.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this locally</li>
            <li> just what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ve switched to Clearasil products {Clearasil Daily Face Wash &amp;&amp; Clearasil Acne + Marks: Wash &amp;&amp; Mask} which is helping to prevent them and dried them up altogether</li>
            <li> The con was that I can not personally use it everyday because it started drying my face.</li>
            <li> This is only after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> its really not as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as i was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing beads are very small and don’t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I now prefer the softer, less dry feeling and have no complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so well is due to the ingredient: Salicylic Acid.</li>
            <li> I use the peel every other day.</li>
            <li> i was worried when i could not find the other Olay scrub I used.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products</li>
            <li> still searching for a scrub that my skin would love :(</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;micro beads\\&quot; aren&#x27;t too scratchy or overabundant, an issue I have run into with other scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other &#x27;organic&#x27; products and they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My skin feels cleaner than with any other product I have used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating scrubs that felt like I was using sandpaper on my face</li>
            <li> I washed my face again with a different product, but unfortunately I had gotten some of the scrub in my hair and had to take a complete shower to get the scent off me.</li>
            <li> when I don&#x27;t have any active pimples, I will use it until it runs out.  </li>
            <li> applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way).</li>
            <li> My nose, chin and center of forehead are trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with dullness and dry patches on my cheeks before using this, and those issues haven&#x27;t returned since.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with other Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I do notice a slight reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Olay products in the past but was disappointed to learn that some of their ingredients are harmful to humans and the environment.</li>
            <li> Substantially less expensive that high end scrubs, but work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cleanser that happens to have a little exfoliation to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with little knowledge of skin-care products, but I bought this scrub from Amazon on a whim.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smoth with just a little sand to it .</li>
            <li> a with a little baking soda,</li>
            <li> I used to have little bumps under my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this scrub everyday.</li>
            <li> I will post before and after pics in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But im always relieved coz the spots would disappear in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I dont want to waste the 2 packs..</li>
            <li> I like that this has the microbeads for exfoliating, but is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Non-drying and not too harsh.</li>
            <li> so I added this to a few of the subscribe and save items already picked out by her...</li>
            <li> So for me, this is not good during active pimples.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, ever.</li>
            <li> but I usually end up purchasing a set with items I don&#x27;t need or use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few others and have really been disappointed in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 1.5 weeks and all my blackheads on my nose are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it is after a few months!</li>
            <li> it smelled like really strong nasty perfume.  </li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this that I have a little conniption if I forget this at home during one of my trips...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and started using Regenerist products as a preventive measure.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least 4 times a week.  </li>
            <li> but its not really good scrub</li>
            <li> - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily.</li>
            <li> I then use a thin layer of the pumpkin face mask spa treat</li>
            <li> Also, I have now broken out in an itchy rash all over my neck and face.</li>
            <li> Just wait, you&#x27;ll get addicted and find out for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regnerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub for approximately 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t do worse than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have sen dramatic reduction in the size of the pores and the blaxk heads on my face.</li>
            <li> Went to walgreens and decided on this one because you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay.  </li>
            <li> and im wrong...</li>
            <li> Ill be buying this again and agian,</li>
            <li> No matter how dirty or oily my face feels this scrub leaves</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it is a pungent sort of aroma that can be overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive !!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only face wash I have used since it was made available. I have used Olay products for 20 years, beats big store brands, and home &amp;#34;agent&amp;#34; products. I can replenish when I want and not have to contact a dealer. Love this wash,micro beads yet gentle on my close to 60 year old face. Delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> Olay make a nice face scrub but it has way too much perfume for my taste.  I like the way it leaves my skin; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so strong smelling. If it had a lighter scent it would be a great product!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with my skin while I was pregnant and then still after I had the baby, when I switched to this my skin cleared up.  I guess my skin must have changed and not been okay with my old stuff.  I feel like my skin stays clear now and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I can be a little sensitive to products but this didn&#x27;t make my skin itchy or rashy.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub everyday. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective, and leaves my skin clean and soft. Added bonus is the tube dispenser - extremely handy because i use this in the shower.  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> After using the OLAY Regenerist detoxifying pore scrub for about two weeks I started to notice my skin having a renewed clarity. My pores definitely look smaller and my face is almost completely clear and free of any blocked pores. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and to anyone that struggles to keep their skin blemish free. The scrubbing granules are very small and more like tiny beads. Since I also have sensitive skin I noticed that it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I think the reason this works so well is due to the ingredient: Salicylic Acid. This also contains aloe which is very soothing. So if you are looking at the Regenerist products this might be a good place to start. Next I&#x27;m going to try the [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 OLAY Regenerist - Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel Kit]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and have wrestled with acne as an adult.  I&#x27;ve tried countless products over the years, and facials, which only make me break out more.  I finally decided to try the Regenerist line and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Everything I&#x27;ve tried has worked well, but this particular scrub is my favorite.  It&#x27;s excellent.  It cleans very well but does not dry.  I do not need to follow with a moisturizer, and that&#x27;s great for me because moisturizers are what seem to do me in.  That was always the problem with the facials...layer upon layer of creams and the next day I&#x27;d be covered in blackheads.  Definitely give this a try!  Especially if you have oily skin.  Amazon&#x27;s price is also quite good considering you get two tubes.</li>
            <li> It smells good &amp; I&#x27;m sure detoxifies the skin but doesn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of the pores, as it claims.  Would buy again just for the detoxification.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Regenerist for the past two years and the compliments I have received on my facial complexion is incredible.  This product is much better and takes off all the makeup and leaves your face clean and smooth to the touch.  Olay products are great, constant use is the key</li>
            <li> Let me begin by describing my skin, issues, and desired effects and what I have experienced so far. I am 44 years of age with fair skin that would be classified as combination which is both sensitive and adult acne prone (I take an antibiotic twice a day to keep it under control). I am experiencing menopause with extreme hot-flashes which has only compounded my oily T-zone. I am told by people that \\&quot;I look good for my age\\&quot; (30&#x27;s rather than 40&#x27;s) but I notice small wrinkles around my eyes (crows feet) and what I would call creases around my mouth (laugh lines?) and a line that goes across my forehead (an expression line). I would like to have the crows feet disappear (especially since they are very light as is) and have the  lines around my mouth and forehead become less visible. As for what I have experienced so far-&lt;br /&gt;1. Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub: I really like the wash. It is a gel type wash not creamy. It is a very light scrub; without harsh scrubbing particles. It does have a very noticeable scent - I like that it isn&#x27;t medicinal but almost perfume like. After washing my face felt squeaky clean but not dry or tight. What I liked the best is it did not leave the feeling that I have oil or lotion on after I wash.&lt;br /&gt;2. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream: This is the product I was very nervous about trying since it said nothing about being Non-Comedogenic. I have been using it sparingly and only at night. I chose to start using it only at night due to it being a cream - I was afraid it may be heavy and cause me to become oily. Neither has been the case. It goes on smooth and applying sparingly is all you need to do (a small amount goes a long way). I can&#x27;t say I have seen any results with my wrinkles as of yet (I have only used it 3 nights) but I have noticed a change in the softness of my skin and appearance of brightness; It felt wonderful on my skin from the first moment I applied it. It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. The first night I used it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on. The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging. I have noticed my skin is a bit raw/sensitive feeling (I notice it mostly during exercising/sweating) or if I use a wash cloth across my face in the morning, but I hope this will cease with continued use. There isn&#x27;t any redness or visible signs of irritation. I can&#x27;t be sure as of yet but I think my complexion is clearing...I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts and the few I had have gone. It too has a noticeable fragrance, but again I rather like the scent and it goes away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum: I was most excited to try this product since it says \\&quot;Dermatologically  Tested, Non Comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), Fast- Absorbing and Non Greasy. Suitable for everyday use for normal, dry, and combination skin\\&quot;. Plus it boasts results in just \\&quot;after 5 days\\&quot;. I could just copy and paste what I wrote above with the exception - I have been using this product during the day. As I mentioned above - I get very nervous using new products and start in baby steps. I plan to begin using as the directions instruct and apply these 2 products together; first applying the serum and topping off with the cream. The serum also leaves your skin feeling silky with no oily feeling at all. These products soak in instantly and you feel the results the moment you apply it. Now, lets hope to see results with the lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give it a month - and I&#x27;ll let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub. My face feels clean but not dry. I will continue to purchase this wash/scrub and would recommend it to those with sensative/acne prone skin.it I felt quite a bit of stinging on my face, but I left it on. The second night, the sensation was less and last night I felt little to no stinging.

            <li> This scrub is simply excellent as a mild exfoliating/moisturizing cream.  Lather it into your face for a minute or so, then use the Pro-X cleaning machine if you have one (if you don&#x27;t, get one!  Its only like $20...) to really work it into your skin. Otherwise use a washcloth. Then wash it away and boom, clean smooth skin with a visibly more even tone 5 minutes later!  I have been using this daily, mixed in with the Microdermabrasion peel kit twice a week, and my skin has never looked better.  I will post before and after pics in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and started using Regenerist products as a preventive measure.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now and I can&#x27;t get over how wonderful it makes my skin look and feel.  I happen to have dry/combination skin, but I can use this daily without irritation or over drying.  It gives my skin a healthy glow, and keeps gnarly blackheads at bay.  I notice a significant difference (dullness, more blackheads on my T-Zone, less softness) when I don&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ve had issues in the past with dullness and dry patches on my cheeks before using this, and those issues haven&#x27;t returned since.  At any age, this product is magic.</li>
            <li> This is nice cleanser with a gentle scent. However I bought this thinking it was a scrub. It&#x27;s a cleanser that happens to have a little exfoliation to it. I didn&#x27;t notice smaller pores.  I&#x27;ll finish the 2 tubes as a cleanser, but I need a separate scrub to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible to combine anti-aging with exfoliation, but this product does not do it very well.  It foams and washes my face, but does not really exfoliate that well.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 4 times a week.  Does not leave my skin feeling dry. www.being40plus.com</li>
            <li> Bought this when there was a coupon.  The two pack was really convenient, left one in the shower and one on the sink.  The scrubbing action is mild, but effective.  I would purchase again.  Substantially less expensive that high end scrubs, but work as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and meets its promises - skin looks great, well scrubbed and hydrated.  I keep two bottles, one in the bathroom and one in the shower.  Recommend it in combination with the deep hydration regenerating creme and the purple regenerist night cream.</li>
            <li> After using for a couple of days my face cleared up a lot. Plus, the scrub smells really good and feels nice to use. No problems with delivery and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim, and I am very happy with the results.  My face felt instantly refreshed, toned, and smooth. It is not harsh and does not irritate my skin like some other brands of microscrubs I have tried in the past.  Very impressed. I am planning to try the rest of the olay regenerist products.</li>
            <li> Does what it says!  Pores are minimized!  Rinses so clean!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this for the exfoliating aspect alone- there&#x27;s very little \\&quot;grit\\&quot; and IMO its too little to do much.  However, it is a great cleanser and has a pleasant fragrance.  I&#x27;ll keep purchasing this one.  It&#x27;s non-drying and leaves your face soft and smooth. I use it daily and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and I&#x27;ve tried every possible facial cleanser system I could possibly find. I tried proactive, which worked well for the acne, but bleached my skin, leaving me with an uneven skin tone (African American). I stopped using proactive for this reason and the acne is back. I was researching reviews on different facial regimes, based on my skin type (oily) to see if I can pin point what will actually work for me instead of following the hype. I found my answers here on amazon.com. My daily facial regime is microdermabrasion crystals (grit 120) coupled with olay regenerist detoxifying pore scrub. I then use a thin layer of the pumpkin face mask spa treat aha 12%. I leave this on for about 10 minutes then wash off with warm water. I use the peel every other day. Keep in mind, I have very oily skin so I can get away with this. If you have normal to dry skin, you may want to follow the instructions and limit it to once or twice a week. I also use either 100% pure shea butter or the antioxidant recovery cream for mature skin after I use the peel and both works wonders to elevate the dry tightness you experience after a peel. Finally, a facial regime that works for me!</li>
            <li> This actually has been minimizing the size of my pores! It seems to be better at pushing the impurities to the surface of my skin as well. I know I&#x27;m not supposed to, but sometimes I&#x27;ll extract the impurities. It seems like they come out easier than it used to with prolonged use of this product.</li>
            <li> i was worried when i could not find the other Olay scrub I used. i tried this product and am thankful I did works great and i have acne prone oily skin</li>
            <li> DOes clean the face better than soap. No adverse reactions such as itching, redness. Price is reasonable for its detoxifying</li>
            <li> I have used other Olay products and love them.  This holds up with the others.  Has done a great job minimizing the pores and gving my face a smooth polished look.  Well worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a month and am seeing an improvement in my skin. Highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I used to use some oil of olay products. Bought this for my daughter and I tried some.  The formula has changed oil of olay now believes in having their products smell like a bottle of perfume. YUCK.  MI had to wash my face it smelled like really strong nasty perfume.  Had the same issue with a cream regenerist product.  Why not just leave the extra fragrance out. Id rather pick my own perfume to spray on my body not my face.  As far as the cleansing products cant say anymore as I cant get beyond the smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I have combination dry/normal skin. I&#x27;ve been using this scrub nightly for about two weeks and am happy with the results. It is gentle..some scrubs are very coarse but this one doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot;. Still, it cleanses my skin well and my face feels much softer. I also can see a difference in the size of my pores.  I wonder if Olay has changed their formula on the fragrance....reviewers in the past found the scent overpowering, but it wasn&#x27;t at all in my opinion (and I have a sensitive nose). I follow with Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. Would definitely recommend both products!</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, ever. I think this is my first real review I&#x27;ve left, but I really wanted to share with people what I&#x27;ve thought of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to have near perfect skin and never had to try to take care of it all, well now I have very oily skin, and it came out of no where. I have literally tried EVERYTHING. I have tried all the acne cleansers, I have tried toners and astringents. I even tried the cerave foaming cleanser that everyone raves about on here (didn&#x27;t work for me) It&#x27;s taken me a while but I finally have a skin care routine down to where it&#x27;s keeping my skin nice again. I&#x27;m 22 years old and always thought regenerist was for older women.... One of my friends was using it so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;m not joking, I&#x27;m hooked!!!! It is the best cleanser I have used yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now. I needed the scrub for oily skin and it was good by itself but then I started pairing it with their pro-x cleaning system and has completely turned my skin around, I only use the cleansing system at night though. I didn&#x27;t really notice it at first but it really really does improve your skin, not just acne, but tone and everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: make sure you moisturize after you wash your face, most people don&#x27;t realize but that is a huge huge part of your skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long story short.... It&#x27;s works for me 100%. I highly suggest using the cleansing system if you have oily skin, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I buy it at target since it&#x27;s only 8 bucks!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this. The feel of the microbeads on your face makes it smooth. I&#x27;ve used others but nothing compares to Olay and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Scrub was too gentle for my skin but cleansed well. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend use when sunburned. Girlfriend liked it more than I did.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time this weekend. As others have said on here, the perfume is a little strong. Also, I have now broken out in an itchy rash all over my neck and face. I have never had any trouble with other Oil of Olay products. Actually I have never developed a rash after using any face products, so there must be something different and harsh in this specific product.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and must admit I like these Olay products.  It makes your face feel very clean, and refreshed.  I would recommend for sure, thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with little knowledge of skin-care products, but I bought this scrub from Amazon on a whim. It&#x27;s good as a cleanser and as an exfoliant. It leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed and has a mild scent that seems gender-neutral to me. Best of all is the price.</li>
            <li> https://www.facebook.com/5gyres/videos/10153031062208920/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for sometime.  I have tried other products but I always come back to this one.  It leaves my face feeling and looking clean.  Does not over dry and has a nice scent to it.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Leaves face really smooth. :)</li>
            <li> I used to wash my face with Bath and Body works products and it would get sooo dry and flaky , since I use this product my face is more clear, looks healthier and cleans my face easily even when I have make-up on.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.  It dissolves the make-up right off my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Am very much Satisfied with these product.... Try it u will love it, Will definitely recommend it to a friend.....</li>
            <li> I got  pack of two bottles. I smells really good, Works good on your face and neck.Doesnt leave a sticky feeling</li>
            <li> It is not the same..They have changed the formula and I am allergic apparently..I had to stop  using it...My skin became chapped like it was the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive to scrubs, no matter how gentle it is... In my 28 yrs, I can only use cream cleansers.. Everytime I use scrubs, the first night of use was always amazing to the skin but on the second night, red spots would appear which means my skin doesnt like it and this scrub is not an exception. But im always relieved coz the spots would disappear in a few hours. I bought this scrub because of the nice reviews here, thinking it would suit me well and help even out my skin tone. I guess its not for me, maybe I&#x27;ll just use it on my neck coz I dont want to waste the 2 packs.. still searching for a scrub that my skin would love :(</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very fine product but I can&#x27;t use it very often as my skin is thin and dry (I&#x27;m 64) and this is just so gritty that it makes my face raw if I use it more often than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s great. My pores do look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning your face</li>
            <li> If you are an Olay fan then the Detoxifying pore scrub is wonderful. Your face is so soft and youthfully looking.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleansing scrub that is good for your pores.  It is like a gel with small beads which help clean.  I love the scent.  I use it at night to help remove the make-up.  I follow it up with a moisturizer such as Olay&#x27;s regenerating night recovery cream.  My face still feels soft in the morning after using these both.  The price is reasonably and you only need a squirt of this detoxifying scrub to clean your face.  I feel I am treating my skin well using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soap that even my husband likes to use. It smells nice, it&#x27;s gentle, and it works. What else can you ask for.</li>
            <li> After first use I began using it daily and it has immediate results (skin soft, looks healthier, and makes skin look like it has a makeup primer on it (meaning treatment has the same effect) but the best thing is that it&#x27;s cheap, the products have excellent reviews and quality assurance testimonials from consumer reports mad other comsumer review type of sites.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Works great. wife loves it. she looks younger ;-) will buy it again. I started using it too.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning. So far, I like it. It&#x27;s not too harsh and it cleans the skin really good.</li>
            <li> I just got this today in a gift set with the cream I am a 35 year old with very good skin and I loved it . it&#x27;s smoth with just a little sand to it . my skin felt realy clean I wont have to use a astringent with this . I do have a some fine lines but thay are gone with this . I don&#x27;t think im going to use the cream that came with it thowe I think it would be over kill .</li>
            <li> Purchased this for x-mas gift to go with the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System; my wife loves both! Highly recommended over higher priced units.</li>
            <li> I previously used this face wash and loved it but when summer comes and the face is as oily as i comes it take more then once to get the oils off. But overall I love this facewash and it was well worth the price</li>
            <li> this excellent face cleaner is very good and helps with the impurities and fat face, 100% recommended and  best  price.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin &amp; love this product.  It dries my skin just enuf &amp; minimizes pores as well.  I do use a light moisturizer in the morning.  I am 71 &amp; still have oily skin!!</li>
            <li> FINALLY!! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good post-menopause acne cleanser that smells good and does the job. This cleanser is gentle and yet cleared up my problem areas. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning.  Makes pores much smaller.  Gives my skin a polished look and feel.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon because it was cheaper.  I received two tube and completely used both as directed. My pores appear larges and I would break out from this product.  I would not recommend for sensitive skin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement to a cleanser I purchase on hsn ..it wasn&#x27;t the highest but I usually end up purchasing a set with items I don&#x27;t need or use.  Went to walgreens and decided on this one because you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay.  I am 43 with great skin but slightly enlarged pores with age.  Used this once ans saw and felt a noticeable difference.  Removed makeup well and ihas a very mild scrubbing effect.  Skin felt clean, polished, and slightly firmer but not dry.  Love this one.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft but I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin difference. I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay. It keeps my skin looking smooth and young! Gentle enough to use every day. Definitely a great buy on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Olay has another winner here.  This scrub does a fine job without leaving the skin dry.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a good facial scrubbing.  Rinses off clean too.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Olay cleansing products and I like this one the best.  It really does seem to help clean out my pores...I notice them less and they appear smaller.  I have oily skin, and wear mineral powder makeup, so I&#x27;m happy to have a product that works so well in clearing out the pores.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> Been using this so far good!!, does not bother my eyes....leave skin nice and clean....scent is not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle facial scrub for daily use.  Not harsh and does an effective job of cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is just about right for my skin which can become irritated if the exfoliant is too aggressive.  This product strikes a very nice balance.  My skin feels \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean with no irritation.  I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try something new.  It also has a very pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like that this has the microbeads for exfoliating, but is not too harsh. Also, seems more economical than other Olay products.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price and it comes in only a couple of days. Even though its an exfoliating scrub it is not harsh and you get two bottles!</li>
            <li> She seems to love it along with the Pro-x Cleaning System I bought for her as well...very satisfied...Thanks...BTW: I got the best price I could find along with great service !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the way this makes my skin look and feel.  I use this daily to wash my face, morning and night.</li>
            <li> Goes well with the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System. Non-drying and not too harsh. Use it every day and would recommend to anyone looking for something gentle, yet thorough.</li>
            <li> I have very oil skin and this cleanser really works well for me.  It cleans squeaky clean, but doesnt feel dry after.  The fine crystals give good exfoliation and I can see and feel a vast difference.  I am using several other regenerist products and its not my imagination, my skin looks and feels much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend especially for oily skin.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a change and very mild scrub. I prefer the apricot scrubs.</li>
            <li> Love this product line and this is a good deal</li>
            <li> I purchased Olay Regenerist detoxifying pore scrub to use with the Olay Pro X  brush.  The combination of the pore scrub and brush is very effective in removing makeup, opening up clogged pores and cleansing the face without drying it out. The scrubbing beads are very small and don’t irritate my sensitive skin.  After using the scrub and the brush twice a day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that some of the clogged pores were opening up.  As I continued using the products, my skin became smoother and clearer. After 3 months my enlarged pores definitely look smaller. I don&#x27;t know whether the scrub or the brush is doing the most good but the combination definitely works well for me. I do not find the light fragrance the least bit offensive. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you have clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Regenerist Microscultping Cream as a night time moisturizer and Olay Total Effects 7 in One moisturizer with sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that this otherwise appealing product contains microbeads that are ruining our environment, so I will not be using it anymore.  I love to have beautiful skin, but not at the price of killing fish and endangering everything that eats them - including people! To learn more about this problem go to beatthemicrobead.org.  This is a real issue.  Let&#x27;s patronize the manufacturers who make all natural products!</li>
            <li> The best facial scrub I have found so far</li>
            <li> Love the way that this feels. I use it with the olay pro-x exfoliater and it feels great!  The pack of two was an excellent price. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and my facial routine has been very successful and pores have certainly improved in appearance</li>
            <li> This Olay Detox pore scrub feels good and used in tiny amount on a warm shower makes you feel good. It certainly scrubs with no allergic reactions or side effects. The quantity is plentiful and will come for months.</li>
            <li> This makes you face fell so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Scrub, it is amazing!!! I hope Amazon can continue to sell it, because it is my favorite facial scrub!! :)</li>
            <li> cleans the neck and face well. keeps the blackheads out. Suggest buying the rotary spin brush for cleaning</li>
            <li> I love Olay product, you can count on them being just what they advertise them to be. My face feels and looks great not to mention my achy is a lot less problematic. I also use the Age defining shower wash, love that too.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for 6 months now along with the Olay ProX and I am so happy. My skin is glowing and the product lasts a long time. Totally suggest!</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every morning. It leaves my skin soft and with a bit of a glow. Perfect for use before you apply your makeup. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and have seen a marked improvement in my skin. One 6.5 ounce tube last a long time because you don&#x27;t have to use much. I especially like it when I have been wearing makeup, it gives me a deep clean and has actually helped minimize pores. It does what it says it will do. I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and soft after using this daily in the shower. Can&#x27;t beat the price when buying three at a time. Included one for my mom in a care package and she loved it so much she is using it as well!</li>
            <li> Very nice, leaves skin feeling much smoother, feels very clean.  Refreshing scrub, results just seem to improve with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and have been getting breakouts more frequently lately.  I purchase this hoping it would help, but I think my skin got worse and the breakouts were more severe.  It&#x27;s got a very strong fragrance, so maybe that exacerbated the problem.</li>
            <li> I got this to try the brand the first time, I usually am happy with Neutrogena scrubs. You definitely get plenty of it, it&#x27;ll probably last half a year in my case. The particles of the scrub are small, but not the tiniest I&#x27;ve seen, nor the most abrasive; they do a good job for a more sensitive skin. Washing off is a bit weird because it is extremely soapy - trying to rinse my face and getting huge ( I mean huge! ) bubbles each time; could be fun, but a bit cumbersome too.  The face feels nice and smooth afterward, I&#x27;ve had no problems with outbreaks or anything after about 4 uses, so I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this face wash a couple times each week as an exfoliating wash.  The \\&quot;micro beads\\&quot; aren&#x27;t too scratchy or overabundant, an issue I have run into with other scrubs.  The only thing I dislike about this cleanser is the smell.  It isn&#x27;t necessarily bad, but it is a pungent sort of aroma that can be overbearing.  I would describe the fragrance as being like an elderly woman&#x27;s perfume, mixed with cough syrup.  I wish it was just unscented or lightly scented, or just had that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell rather than a perfumed, flowery smell.  It keeps me from using the product more frequently and makes me wonder if it is gentle enough on my skin, having such an overpowering fragrance.  I still recommend it, but if you have a sensitive sense of smell like I do, take that into account.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I use it in conjunction with the Pro-X cleansing system. I am very satisfied, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This makes a nice exfoliating scrub, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to visibly improve your skin. I have used other products that give a much more noticable anti aging effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once and I cannot use it again because the scent was too strong. After washing my face for the first time with the scrub, I was overpowered by the scent.  I washed my face again with a different product, but unfortunately I had gotten some of the scrub in my hair and had to take a complete shower to get the scent off me. Another reviewer mentioned that the scent was similar to an old lady&#x27;s perfume -- and that is an apt description. I will not use this product again, nor would I purchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally as I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had to surrender to the fact that my skin is changing and the products I had been using just weren&#x27;t right for my skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Enlarged pores have always been a problem.  I have a classic T-Zone, though my T-Zone is getting narrower as I age.  My nose, chin and center of forehead are trouble areas.  I was impressed with how effective this product has been in those areas.  I noticed a difference after the first night.  I awoke the next morning and noticed a difference on my nose.  A week later, my chin.  It took a few more weeks to notice a difference on my forehead.  Smaller, more clear pores.  And smoother skin all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with the results of this product that I added it to my Subscriptions through Amazon.  It&#x27;s now become a product I use every day.  I find this scrub gentle enough to use once a day, at night.  I tried using it in the morning, too, and found this too much for my skin (fair, a little sensitive, sometimes red).  As with any scrub, moderation is key.  It does a great job cleaning pores and refining skin texture.  And the price is great, it&#x27;s a savings over what I paid locally.</li>
            <li> I love this wash, I also use the Olay X-Pro. I just use this in the shower, the third time I used it my acne is almost completely cleared up. This wash also has a great smell, which I personally love. Works way better then other things I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mom and she loves it! She in fact asked me to get this again after initial use.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product at a reasonable price. It makes my face feel so soft and smooth. I hope it will make me look younger to.</li>
            <li> love this product! Improves skin texture and clarity!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and will but it again. great product for anyone!</li>
            <li> This has become my usual evening face wash for the past 4months, my skin feels to fresh and soft afterwards, it is kind to the skin and eyes, the beads are very light although for me they still do the job, you don&#x27;t want it too harsh on your skin anyways. I love it! In terms of service, it arrived on time. Will purchase from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Due to mature skin, can only use once a week or it&#x27;s to drying.</li>
            <li> My husband told me that i should buy this along with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz and am glad that i did. it&#x27;s so easy to use. works great the first time i used it i could tell my face was softer &amp; looked younger. It works great &amp; it&#x27;s not only for woman men can use it as well. I do not have any problems with my face as far as zip or oiliness but this product works for me anyways. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This product is great as it cleans the skin without drying or irritating. I have sensitive skin and have used this product repeatedly. I have tried other &#x27;organic&#x27; products and they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it makes my skin feel rejuvenated and also does not dry it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my teens, I never had acne, however, I lived in Los Angeles (and now Utah, both dry climates) and my skin was/is/gets dry.  No one taught me about face washes, lotions, etc.  I used regular soap and loved the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; or \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling from that.  I didn&#x27;t realize I was messing up my skin and making it older faster.  Sigh. Kind of wish I had stayed in Florida (where I lived in my childhood) with the humidity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, later in my years (mid 30&#x27;s) I figured out I should use lotion or better facial soaps.  Now I am 37, and relatively recently I&#x27;ve been getting those fine lines and I started to worry...  So I decided to opt for specialized cream for fine lines and wrinkles. :-) (Though apparently I don&#x27;t look my age at all; people peg me at around 25, believe it or not, but I think it is also important how one feels about oneself even if they&#x27;re the only ones that see the fine lines!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I went and got the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Fragrance Free (and have since used the frangranced one as well, which is not offensive in smell) and this product (Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub) came with it for 1/2 off or free or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I must say, I love both products.  I saw a difference a week to 8 days after I started using it.  My fine lines became \\&quot;finer\\&quot; (less visable) and I love the way my skin feels.  I now prefer the softer, less dry feeling and have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these products for anyone with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years and I absolutely love it.  No matter how dirty or oily my face feels this scrub leaves it feeling squeaky clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Its alright, skin feels clean and smooth as it should after using a decent scrub. not much of a scrub, more like a soapy facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the clarity of my skin when I used this product on my face.  It must have surely gone down deep into my pores and gotten all the makeup and impurities out.  If you have sensitive skin do not rub hard, just use gentle circular motions.  Really affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well and keeps my pores clean. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be real gritty and works best with Olay&#x27;s ProX power scrubber.</li>
            <li> This was purchased through my Amazon Prime , { you can add up to 4 people to Prime account } so I added this to a few of the subscribe and save items already picked out by her...The adding of the name was easy to do, with address for deliveries too..It was so easy in fact that all of the 4 subscribed went from the status of shipping soon ,to shipped within a few days...I would highly recommend this scrub even if you only have a slight case of worrying  over your skin...I have tried so many products , but a few you just go back too, this is one of those..~!~</li>
            <li> The effect was almost immediate; softer skin.</li>
            <li> Regenerist anything is great.  It scrubs well, is gentle and smells nice. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> This is great face wash and at a great price.  I love that it came in a set of two.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refreshed with slight exfoliation properties.  I do notice a slight reduction in the size of my pores. Love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling so soft and refreshed. My skin feels cleaner than with any other product I have used</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  I have minor acne and this seems to clear it right up.  I have tried a few others and have really been disappointed in comparison.</li>
            <li> It feels really good.  It exfoliates without making you feel as though you are rubbing sandpaper on your face.  I have an oily t-zone and using this cleanser, the refreshing toner and the intensive refining sulfur mask has made my skin look amazing!  My pores are smaller and my skin is really clear.  I get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Every day lovin for my face. I am so addicted to this that I have a little conniption if I forget this at home during one of my trips... sad yes, but true. Just wait, you&#x27;ll get addicted and find out for yourself.</li>
            <li> My pores do look smaller and my face softer It does help Will buy again- but its not really good scrub I mix mine a with a little baking soda,</li>
            <li> This pore scrub works great. I will buy it again. An excellent value too Olay makes wonderful products at affordable prices.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this locally so I was very happy to be able to purchase it at Amazon!  It&#x27;s a great skin cleaner and leaves my skin feelin so soft.  I highly recommend it if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li> just what I wanted and expected.  will last a while, too. works great.  feels great after using. you will like it.</li>
            <li> I realized that the beads were popping any pimples which caused them to spread further.  So for me, this is not good during active pimples.  But when there are no active pimples, its very good.  I still have some so when I don&#x27;t have any active pimples, I will use it until it runs out.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve switched to Clearasil products {Clearasil Daily Face Wash &amp;&amp; Clearasil Acne + Marks: Wash &amp;&amp; Mask} which is helping to prevent them and dried them up altogether and they also all have the same function except the exfoliating beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be repurchasing though because I have no need for it. But, I still think its a good product.  Just be careful if you have pimples because the last thing you want to do is spread the bacteria around your face with the exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Regnerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub for approximately 6 months.  It has made a huge difference in my complexion.  I used to have little bumps under my skin.  They have all disappeared.  My pores used to be fairly large but are now much smaller which gives my face an overall smooth appearance.  I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it.  Also, purchasing this 2-pack is very economical.  Received my package in the mail in record time.  I will definitely re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and it does wonders for my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> I found what works for me. I have radiant skin and owe it all to the olay line of products, I am a woman of color. Love my skin</li>
            <li> I love using this and it helps to keep my face free of dirty pores.  Just what I was looking for when I purchased these.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to detoxify and clean your face with! Works great with any scrubber system or just a wash cloth! I recommend you buy this.</li>
            <li> See a huge difference on my face! Will definitely continue using this product. It was also reasonably priced. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the Pore Scrub it self. I use it once a week to deep clean my face after I use my facial cleansing oil from InstaNatural, followed by InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner. Since I have been using this combination my face no longer has breakouts.  Now the reasoning for the 3 stars is because I only received 1 bottle of Pore Scrub and not 2 as advertise. But the product its self is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who has an issue with blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this product.  Cleans pores very well.  Face feels and looks very clean.  I follow this with Olay Serum.  Great delivery time.  Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> The stuff really works. The best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used it for the past 1.5 weeks and all my blackheads on my nose are gone.</li>
            <li> FOUND IT ON SOME APPROVAL LIST TRYED IT AND REALLY FIND IT TO BE A GREAT PRODUCT, AND WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> The Olay scrub does a pretty good job and it smells good. The price was unbeatable for a twin pack.</li>
            <li> I orderd the facial cleanser after reading all the good reviews for it on Amazon. It has been fantastic! My face feels so clean after use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other exfoliating scrubs that felt like I was using sandpaper on my face but this product is super gentle and effective. I do wear a bit of make-up during the day and will use this scrub and it will remove even my waterproof mascara. The best part is that it does not dry my face out like other products I&#x27;ve used and you only have to use a little dab at a time. One bottle will last forever! I would definitely recommend this for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and price was great for two. The con was that I can not personally use it everyday because it started drying my face. It is winter so maybe that helped. I just use it twice a week with the cleaning system. Also you only need a dab if it cause it really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So happy that you don&#x27;t have to by ONLY the ProX cleanser for the machine.  This produce works wonders and just as well.  It was so much cheaper to buy a 2 pack of this than any other facial cleansing product I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m definitely hooked...another great product, thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Olay products in the past but was disappointed to learn that some of their ingredients are harmful to humans and the environment. I hope they improve their products with these things in mind.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me looking and feeling young. My skin is so clean and smooth. I have difficulty buying this product locally. With Amazon I have choices and the company that provides the product in a timely manner has my back. Thanks for a job well done.</li>
            <li> This scrub really cleanse my face remove blackheads and oil leave skin fresh and vibrate I will recommend for used as a one a week facial treatment!!</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent face cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Olay brush.</li>
            <li> Am trying this product for the first time and there is some good result in the skin texture.  Need some more time to evaulate.</li>
            <li> i love this product. was received in a fast timely matter. does what it advertised it would. would recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> It does the job just fine, but is expensive for what it is. Target actually sells their own brand for half the price and works just as well</li>
            <li> Cleans the face deeply, without over drying.</li>
            <li> Been through so many cleansers I can&#x27;t say I had a lot of hope but I was purchasing the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System so I figured I&#x27;d try this. It couldn&#x27;t do worse than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. Well I can honestly say that ALL of my reservations are GONE. My skin is looking and feeling better than it has in ...well just about forever! I&#x27;m hooked and have found the regime I&#x27;ll be with for a long time. My skin&#x27;s dry and flaky areas are gone, my oily areas are well controlled and my mild acne breakouts are all clearing up. My skin glows and just LOOKS healthy all the time. This is only after a few weeks. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it is after a few months! Thank you Olay for a product that actually produces real results.</li>
            <li> Great product love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial scrub for a couple of years now and swear by it.  When I run out and forget to reorder I notice a definite difference in the quality of my skin.  This scrub keeps me pimple and blackhead free!  I use it every single morning followed by Olay Regenerist Moisturizer and that&#x27;s it (I&#x27;ll also use sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun for a bit).  Works for me!</li>
            <li> i really like this scrub. it makes my skin feel soft and fresh and smells great. i gave it only 4 out of 5 stars because i think it should have a bit more scrub in it. its really not as &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; as i was hoping it would be. but still a very good face wash. Olay products are always very good.</li>
            <li> I use and love the Regenerist night cream and serum so decided to try this product also. I&#x27;ve used other scrubs and couldn&#x27;t believe how different this one left my face feeling. The scrub itself is mild so it&#x27;s not irritating at all. Once I&#x27;ve washed it off, my skin feels very soft and smooth, and the texture appears more even. I alternate this and the facial cleansing cloths for make up removal in the evening. One of the best plusses about this Olay product is that it&#x27;s replacing a similar high-end facial wash I was using for which I paid 4 times the price of this.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this cleanser and I an glad I followed her advice!  My face looks and feels so much better!</li>
            <li> bought this for my girlfriend she wanted something to minimize her pores and this made no difference it just smells good.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do anything special... I have all the products... cream, serum, cleanser, pore scrub... i got so excited i bought 2 each last winter... and im wrong... im using St Ives apricot scrub and collagen moisturizer, that when helps in reducing my blackheads... I have clear skin... Sometimes with some bumps but not pimples... so, i dont know if it will work for you... Too expensive !!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be similar to the exfoliating scrub and &#x27;detoxifying&#x27; caught my attention and thought I would give it a try.  Ok scrub, but can&#x27;t get past the scent, which is very masculine.  Not a fan....</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product! The way it makes your skin feel just after one use is amazing. I have sen dramatic reduction in the size of the pores and the blaxk heads on my face. Ill be buying this again and agian,</li>
            <li> The srub particles are effective and yet not too rough.  It&#x27;s ideal for consumers whose skin is classfied in the oily type of category and need frequent clean ups without really damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans, but not as deeply as I&#x27;d like, so I alternate it daily with another face wash. It&#x27;s probably very good if you need something very gentle.</li>
    </ol>
