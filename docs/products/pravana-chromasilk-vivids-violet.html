            <li>it is wonderful not to be invisible.  </li>

            <li>All in all, the colour is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It did &amp; now it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>

            <li>Great staying power for a semipermanent dye.</li>
            <li>I have to wash my hair every day, so this color stays in for a good 3 weeks, before I have to redye again, but even then the &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34; violet still looks good!</li>

            <li>Great product, my favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright in the sun, and darker indoors.</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t too bright for work.</li>
            <li>and it is incredibly bright and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>, I redye mine every 2-3 weeks and even when it starts washing out it still looks good.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- smells good</li>
            <li>and I put a fair amount of product in</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color and the consistency</li>
            <li>It looked good so whatever.</li>

            <li>Loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still a gorgeous purple tone.</li>
            <li>Good product,  </li>
            <li>The color is absolutely gorgeous for about a week then starts fading to a magenta/lavender color.</li>

            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve first applied it</li>
            <li>and I was about to give up, until I found this lovely product!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to in order to achieve the violet hair I love with this product!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this color!</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>Best dye color and super healthy  for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>But it is an amazing dye.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  </li>
            <li>As you can tell,  I am enthusiastic about Violet Vivids.  </li>
            <li>Seriously intense and very awesome color..</li>
            <li>It does bleed out in the wash quite a bit, so keep the bleach cleaner handy for your tub.  </li>
            <li>me tell you something: I&#x27;m really fracking impressed.</li>
            <li>, the color lasts a good month or more before it starts to fade, my hair basilcy grew out before the color faded.</li>
            <li>So glad to get this for a good price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fade to any nice color like some others will.</li>
            <li>Not as great as special effects.</li>
            <li>Also, very easy to apply,  just wash &amp; then put on Stain hair</li>
            <li>If you want to try the &amp;#34;funky colors&amp;#34;, then this is by and far best color on the market.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best purple dye I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>But PRIVANA is amazing :)</li>
            <li>This is the best color I have used so far</li>
            <li>so I am so far happy with it!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good idea to find a good sunscreen product to protect the color, much like you would a tattoo.</li>
            <li>LOVE,  LOVE,  LOVE this  hair color - -</li>
            <li>Wait appropriate time &amp; wash out.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely OUTSTANDING color.  </li>
            <li>Love this color</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on the color.</li>
            <li>it :)</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye,  it&#x27;s been a month and ths color hasn&#x27;t faded at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>be sure to use some petroleum jelly, conditioner, or something on the skin around the hairline.</li>
            <li>As I was colouring, I was making sure I was wiping off any colour that got on my skin.</li>
            <li>After using a magic eraser and just some scrubbing bubbles cleaner on the shower, it took it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many Purple dyes</li>
            <li>I love this color...</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>As the color faded, it became an even more prominent purple.</li>
            <li>I love this color and how it turned out</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Hoping it stays better than manic panic</li>
            <li>I love Pravana colors.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of Pravana&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li>it is a hair ink more than a hair</li>
            <li>People seemed to love it, including myself.</li>
            <li>I could not be anymore in love with how it turned out.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks on my hair</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, I immediately saw the color and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye (I have ordered it before)</li>
            <li>lasted better then Manic Panic and Kiss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok semi permanent dye.</li>
            <li>Aside from keeping me warm, the tub being partially filled prevents the color from staining the floor</li>
            <li>Have gotten many compliments on the color I used.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I now have violet hair and love it.</li>
            <li>Love love love this hair color.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use gloves for washing your hair afterwards also.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE COLOR</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MORE OF A PLUM COLOR</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The longer the better.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this color, it turned out a lot more of a pink like tone than the blue-purple</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li>Did not hold in my hair for more than 2 weeks...</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars because of the amazing colors that come out of it, but the variability makes it less than perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- mixes well with wild orchid to make a beautiful purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best dye ive had in a long time</li>
            <li>A hair stylist recommended it for at-home use, and it&#x27;s really pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Smells delightful, but don&#x27;t leave on too long!</li>
            <li>The rich color lasts for a while!</li>
            <li>My cousin, who is licensed, recommended pravana violet because it was vivid and had a great color.</li>
            <li>Pravana colors are the best on the market for brilliant long lasting color.</li>
            <li>They are brilliant, long lasting, easy to use, and they smell great!</li>
            <li>I used a bit of sulfate free shampoo that has color shield to make sure I got it all out.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple tries to get the perfect color.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery good price.</li>
            <li>AND IT WASHED RIGHT OUT OF MY HAIR!!</li>
            <li>So amazing Love it the color mix with orchid just a nice combination.ordering more but you can measure the colors that you need and going to use if not save it for next time...</li>
            <li>Take it from me, it&#x27;s worth buying! :)</li>
            <li>Longest lasting color Purple and at a good price!</li>
            <li>Other than that, its really awesome!</li>
            <li>Wonderful color, stays in my hair way longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Color is bright and vibrant, though.</li>
            <li>so it was easy for this color to take.</li>
            <li>But because it needs no developer you can touch it up easily.</li>
            <li>It is worth all the work to get this beautiful colour that seems almost fade proof so far!</li>
            <li>Hands down, best purple there ever is.</li>
            <li>I either just wash my hands and use a nail brush to get it from under my nails, or use one of those wipes to get makeup off your face, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>Its bright and fades slowly and beautifully.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, but you kind of have to play with it a little if you haven&#x27;t had experience with it.</li>
            <li>and all, it&#x27;s a great dye and I will definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li>This looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>This dye is fantastic.</li>
            <li>great hair color, the only downside is that it stains.</li>
            <li>Before I applied this dye, my hair was a light brown.</li>
            <li>Fantastic color.</li>
            <li>Color comes out a lot in the shower, but if you use a sulfate free shampoo or like me, I use Wen..</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair.</li>
            <li>It seemed to rinse much more quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Love how much pigmented the violet is, you can also dilute it with conditioner and make a more lighter pastel color.</li>
            <li>But note: really stains everything!!!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li>First, I made sure I put something on my skin to protect it from getting colour all around my hair line.</li>
            <li>For better results, try to lighten your hair color first before applying any of Pravana&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my pravana vivids violet hair dye until I got it</li>
            <li>I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Since I like a deeper purple, I combine this with Special Effects Pimpin Purple at a 1:5 ratio, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bleach my hair, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more than that.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about Pravana, so I decided to give it one last go.  </li>
            <li>true to color, washes all out, rubs off on everything</li>
            <li>This color is true to its shade as pictured online, shows up ultra-rich even in non-lightened hair.</li>
            <li>stains everything and man, is that true.</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, just not violet.</li>
            <li>So I used less &amp; it was beautiful, but my roots didn&#x27;t take at all.</li>
            <li>Seriously, color me impressed.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly though &amp; as promised.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading reviews of its awesomeness because the purple dye I was using at the time seemed to be fading too quickly.</li>
            <li>5 stars for the seller - item arrived quickly and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the lighter you bleach your hair, the more vibrant it will be.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great</li>
            <li>yet I still have A LOT left to play with which is SO nice to be able to have a ready to use product</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about that is that you can leave this in for as long as you want.  </li>
            <li>And it stained me purple the first couple washes, even my legs!</li>
            <li>[mixed dye with conditioner], to get pastel color, first time it didn&#x27;t work out well, but I redyed my hair the next day - PERFECT!</li>
            <li>but recommend for people that are willing to bleach there hair or blondes, my roots did not take but my bleached hair did!</li>
            <li>It came out exactly how i wanted it !</li>
            <li>It went on fine,  definitely very  highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The original color is beautiful,  and mixing with other colors is great but it fades quickly and turns into a strange pastel blue color in the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was a medium to light brown and this color came out very vibrant.</li>
            <li>Same great quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Pravana when purchased from the professional beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li>and even when dye gets on something, if you take care of it as soon as possible, everything&#x27;s going to be fine : )</li>
            <li>Completely full coverage, no color variances, just very very saturated in  color.</li>
            <li>Greys ( white hairs ) are covered nicely &amp; add to highlights.  </li>
            <li>But in my opinion, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I put this over one week old Mahogany Violet hair dye done at a salon and LOVE how it turned out.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it is powerful stuff</li>
            <li>LOVE this color - stays better than any of the other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying some magic erasers and rubbing alcohol though if you are as obsessed with having a perfectly spotless bathroom like I am.</li>
            <li>Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li>color looks good with blondes,  brunettes and other funky colors,  </li>
            <li>I had much better results with special effects and will go back to using that.</li>
            <li>For places that did stain my skin i used a makeup remover wipe and it took it right off.</li>
            <li>so bleach/scrub it right away</li>
            <li>The two mixed together made a really beautiful purple, but it only shows up in the sun.</li>
            <li>After trying several brands over the years I&#x27;ve had purple tresses, this is by far the best lasting.  </li>
            <li>But having gorgeous purple hair is worth a few smudged pillow cases and collars.</li>
            <li>Other than having super dark hair, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It very much stains the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dyes that fell so short of my expectations</li>
            <li>It stained everything it touched until I shampooed for the first time.</li>
            <li>I ordered this dye off of a recommendation of a coworker, and was keeping my expectations low just to be safe.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I really like this dye!</li>
            <li>I have never used a hair colour that stained this much, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>All I would want in the future was a better product description.</li>
            <li>everyone&#x27;s going to have a different experience with hair color because there are so many variables:</li>
            <li>But for me, all things being the same, I like the Paul Mitchell better.</li>
            <li>I seriously love how it left my hair.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>being said, I love this product and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s left the most stains on towels, tubs, skin and clothes.</li>
            <li>the first week I colored my hair</li>
            <li>I plan on dying all of my hair this color because it&#x27;s just that pretty.</li>
            <li>So be aware when you use this product.</li>
            <li>5-STARS for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>But yes, this color is awesome, as long as you don&#x27;t mind your shower looking like where barney was murdered for a few days.</li>
            <li>So then I did a root retouch with it &amp; left it on for about 45 mins to make sure the roots would absorb it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest doing that for the first 2-3 shampoos after coloring with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try the other colors in the future :) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came out a really pretty purple.</li>
            <li>but in the sun it looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>The color in the picture is exactly what you get on bleached out hair.</li>
            <li>I just got my hair redone with the Joico, and after the first shampoo, nothing rubs off or continues to stain.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so powerful it really sticks, so</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had more than enough to color.</li>
            <li>Besides that I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>I mix half and half with the Pravana &amp;#34;wild orchid&amp;#34; and it comes out a gorgeous shade of warm purple.</li>
            <li>I cannot leave the house without at least  one,  usually more, person telling me that they !!</li>
            <li>other than that, hands down one of the best purple colors I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant, but pretty temporary</li>
            <li>I have found the products that &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; the most last the longest, which is ironic.  </li>
            <li>This is a stain not a dye, you dont use developer from what the box says, the tubes are pretty large..</li>
            <li>The violet and blue that I used covered pretty well, and were easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but the water ran clear pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much to get a pretty color.</li>
            <li>This time I mixed it with normal sulfate-free conditioner and it was WAY more pigmented than the first time.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with purple hair for years, but couldn&#x27;t achieve it for a long time.</li>
            <li>First off -- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting the tube of color straight onto your hair.</li>
            <li>(it cleans up very easily compared to come other color brands i&#x27;ve used )</li>
            <li>The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  </li>
            <li>It fades to a new exciting color every time I was it.</li>
            <li>Dye leaves  my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>And I think it was that easy to lift because I mixed the violet with conditioner</li>
            <li>It did in certain spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty flexible and am always willing to try new things with my hair, so thats why I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant!</li>
            <li>and the color is still as vibrant today as the first day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had special effects that had faded and left it on my hair about 20 minutes per directions.</li>
            <li>The first shampoo was another blue murder in my shower (which was problematic because I live in a dorm and if I can&#x27;t get the stains out by the end of  the semester I&#x27;ll have to pay a fine)  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I thought the color was going to stay in my hair a lot longer because it didn&#x27;t wash out as much as the Punky Color, yet the color faded a lot faster still yet.</li>
            <li>The color (Violet) took very well to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It made my son&#x27;s hair a bluish purple so shiny and intense</li>
            <li>The color is still very saturated, didn&#x27;t fade at all.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely, not broken or leaking or anything.</li>
            <li>color washes off more than I expected.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it does fade really fast on my hair.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use as much from the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I then tried this which I should of in the first place and my hair came out so beautiful it did get dark like a dark plum</li>
            <li>so it looks really rad.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Costed service is also as fast to help or.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Make sure you completely cover the space where you&#x27;ll be doing the actual dyeing.</li>
            <li>So far, of the Pravana colors I&#x27;ve tried (blue, magenta and this), this one runs the most.</li>
            <li>I mixed wild orchid and violet to put on top of highlights.</li>
            <li>It looks like my natural dark hair,  only better, AND then, the color Surprise; in the light,  or Sun, etc,  my hair radiates w/ purple highlights &amp; halos,  very pretty &amp; compliments my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>REALLY vivid!!</li>
            <li>Also make sure you rinse your hair very well after and don&#x27;t worry about the color coming out like with other brands.  </li>
            <li>I mean it is amazing how bright and deep this color is, aside from the fact that its obviously not natural,  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had ANY bleeding like most of the other reviewers</li>
            <li>I mixed the violet with some conditioner (just cheap conditioner) to tone it down, but also make a bit more volume</li>
            <li>This smells like men&#x27;s body wash (the chemical extra clean smell), and the smell lingers for two weeks in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its an eggplant dark shade of purple but in the sun and different lightings it is bright purple.  </li>
            <li>This DOES stain your shower temporarily during the first few washes and will stain bedding and fingertips until it settles (as with most unnatural colors).  </li>
            <li>After that, it fades to blue (which is also pretty), then green (not so pretty, but kind of cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Special Effects Deep purple for about a year until it was sold out everywhere</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent and will look black if you exceed a reasonable processing time.</li>
            <li>Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week.</li>
            <li>but I figured I&#x27;d try it on my natural hair the first time and go from there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So when my first tube came in I was surprised at how pinkish the color looked.</li>
            <li>The only difference between Violet and Wild Orchard, is that Violet is more of a purple-blue toned tint and the Wild Orchard is a purple-pink toned tint.</li>
            <li>It is true to color and tends to last longer than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and love touches of purple.</li>
            <li>almost black, I knew I was taking my chances that it wouldn&#x27;t show because most things don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It worked ok on the previously colored hair - got basically 2 weeks out of it - hence the 2 stars rather than 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely better and less maintenance than Manic Panic or Directions.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments as my hair is ombre black on top and violet the lower half.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still vibrant.</li>
            <li>Looks better with every wash and two months later I&#x27;m still getting multiple compliments every day</li>
            <li>The only drawback is how quickly it fades, even using color-protecting shampoo.</li>
            <li>This stays vibrant for MONTHS,</li>
            <li>Outdoors my hair is this vibrant purple</li>
            <li>be sure to wear gloves for the application as well as first few shampoos!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>Works really well, make sure your hair is at least light blonde or it will come out a brown/grey color.</li>
            <li>and I have recived a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>its easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t stain everything at all, like other viewers said.</li>
            <li>You pay a bit extra for Pravana, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color, seems to stay in very well too.</li>
            <li>but I threw them away like a normal person because they were exploded.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Messy to apply, but worth the effort if you can make the color last.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one</li>
            <li>I also wanted to see how my skin reacted because I have very sensitive skin, to the point</li>
            <li>so wear old clothes and gloves!</li>
            <li>Such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I was thinking using a lighter Vivid shade</li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t rinse well enough  the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep purple,  and while I get some bleed the first week or so when washing,  it doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>vivid</li>
            <li>and I decided to try the Chromasilk Vivid violet dye and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting, vivid color, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It gave me pretty, deep purple locs with no damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Extremely vivid.</li>
            <li>Wish someone would make a permanent hair dye in these vivid colors.</li>
            <li>I had used some other brand originally an it faded in one week.</li>
            <li>I can see the blonde from having to bleach my hair before coloring it the first time.</li>
            <li>It fades pretty fast so I would suggest buying extra for touch-ups later on.</li>
            <li>Its a really rich, dark purple but will lighten up eventually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, and after the blue dye I&#x27;d been using kept fading rather quickly, my sister (who has a cosmetology license but isn&#x27;t currently working at a salon)</li>
            <li>I am very sure that it faded because I had put another color over it, because my roots were still pinkish, and the parts of my hair which saw less sunlight were also less faded.</li>
            <li>the water was COMPLETELY clear.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t put a clear gloss over it either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is a CLEAR winner.</li>
            <li>So that was my only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that my skin had no reaction to it</li>
            <li>I cut it with an all natural conditioner</li>
            <li>I touched up the roots of my previously few month old highlighted hair hoping this time it would have a much more lasting effect.</li>
            <li>: The Wild Orchid did nothing, which i predicted as soon as it was out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>As is I have to find something else until my old dye figures out the supply issue.</li>
            <li>The resulting color was not violet, but a VERY saturated cobalt blue.</li>
            <li>Pravana is the only way to go if you&#x27;re doing an unusual color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also suggest sleeping with an old pillow case over your pillow or a towel, at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes the hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I mix it wirh pravana&#x27;s wild orchid and conditioner (4-6 parts conditioner to 1 part wild orchid and 2 parts violet) and leave it in overnight.</li>
            <li>Second it was very watery.</li>
            <li>because I know it&#x27;s gonna fade completely.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell or anything.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long, almost to my waist, so I used two tubes.</li>
            <li>I use this and the Wild Orchid color to create an ombre in my hair.  </li>
            <li>You will have colour under and around your nails for a day or two after the first initial wash, but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li>My blonde was about a level 9, &amp; the purple came out so vibrant</li>
            <li>I meant it certainly did not stay violet long</li>
            <li>I had blonde hair with darker roots, I mixed with conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want it super dark, but I used too much conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair with some left over highlights and it colored it as a tint over the dark areas and the purple showed up nicely in the lighter areas.</li>
            <li>First I expected the bottle that says silk &amp;  keratin on it.</li>
            <li>You need to bleach dark hair to get the biggest bang out of this color, but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li>though it did slowly lighten, it lasted close to six full weeks of vibrant color.</li>
            <li>I even wore a cobalt blue shirt today (thinking that when placed next to actual blue the violet would be more obvious) but it totally blended</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair if that&#x27;s of any help.</li>
            <li>If you are super picky about exactly the shade you&#x27;re going for, it might take a few tries with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Splat, Manic Panic, Raw, and Special Effects.</li>
            <li>I came out looking really dark &amp; the color looked more like it was black than purple.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the color is going to be very dark at first, but it is worth it, as least for me, since I avoid having to reapply it often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely noticeable in the sun but under normal lighting you can barely see it, which is good for me because I can&#x27;t have crazy colored hair at work 😄</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found one other hair color line I can use (Naturaltint) without irritation but their line isn&#x27;t nearly as fun.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this color as a lowlight (so not an all over color) just for fun, I have VERY dark brown hair,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Special Effects in Deep Purple, but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted (two weeks).</li>
            <li>so when I washed it out my sink turned purple and nothing worked until I poured on some stuff from Dollar General called \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dark brown hair</li>
            <li>that in mind, I mixed one container with one bottle of the Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in Wild Orchid.</li>
            <li>Even though the dye was diluted, it&#x27;s barely faded from my hair a month</li>
            <li>I used Violet, Blue, and Wild Orchid.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get nearly the same run-off in the shower or staining of my hands, pillow cases, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scent sensitive, and my prior dye didn&#x27;t have anything added to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that makes it harder to bleach out when you&#x27;re ready for a change.</li>
            <li>After 3 previous attempts over several weeks to find the right dye for my dream hair, I&#x27;ve found my knight in a shining tube.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get as much use/coverage out of this as I do other dyes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Love it, I only did a small section and it has lasted longer than two weeks!!</li>
            <li>VERY dark purple at first.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, I could get the remnants off of my skin (Dish soap and a loofa  works wonders), the color is even and SO bright.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I shampooed, not only did it lighten significantly,  I got this weird blue streak in the front.</li>
            <li>When I went to go wash the dye out, I washed it out with my bare hands and it left my nails and palms purple.</li>
            <li>and if you go to bed with a wet hair, be warned it will stain your pillow case for the next few days so avoid white or any light color pillow case or clothing if your hair is wet,within the first few days after dying it.</li>
            <li>The purple really stands out against black hair.</li>
            <li>Has odd texture that I didn&#x27;t find spread very well.</li>
            <li>Since purple dyes are hit and miss, and, at least for me, I&#x27;ve had limited success keeping a lasting and vibrant purple over the last month, I was giving Pravana a chance to prove to me that I could have the color I wanted without the hassle of having to constantly touch up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I, personally, didn&#x27;t care about that, but if you do I would definitely take some extra precautions--maybe wash your hair the first few times with some rubber gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(vasilene would work, I used a very thick body lotion actually, and it worked fine)  </li>
            <li>and it still came out quite dark and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>But the purple even heavily diluted gave out a very vibrant purple pigment</li>
            <li>But within a week or so it fades to a really vibrant purple, so that&#x27;s really no problem in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money buying the Pastel Lavender Pravana when you can just use a few drops of this in a huge blob of conditioner to get the same Lavender results at a fraction of the cost!</li>

            <li> Great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> Great staying power for a semipermanent dye.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair every day, so this color stays in for a good 3 weeks, before I have to redye again, but even then the &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34; violet still looks good!</li>

            <li> Great product, my favorite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bright in the sun, and darker indoors.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t too bright for work.</li>
            <li> and it is incredibly bright and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> , I redye mine every 2-3 weeks and even when it starts washing out it still looks good.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- smells good</li>
            <li> and I put a fair amount of product in</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved the color and the consistency</li>
            <li> It looked good so whatever.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still a gorgeous purple tone.</li>
            <li> Good product,  </li>
            <li> The color is absolutely gorgeous for about a week then starts fading to a magenta/lavender color.</li>

            <li> I heard so many great things about Pravana Violet</li>
            <li> Great product, love the color it provides.</li>

            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve first applied it</li>
            <li> and I was about to give up, until I found this lovely product!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to in order to achieve the violet hair I love with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this color!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  </li>
            <li> Best dye color and super healthy  for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> But it is an amazing dye.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  </li>
            <li> As you can tell,  I am enthusiastic about Violet Vivids.  </li>
            <li> Seriously intense and very awesome color..</li>
            <li> It does bleed out in the wash quite a bit, so keep the bleach cleaner handy for your tub.  </li>
            <li> me tell you something: I&#x27;m really fracking impressed.</li>
            <li> , the color lasts a good month or more before it starts to fade, my hair basilcy grew out before the color faded.</li>
            <li> So glad to get this for a good price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fade to any nice color like some others will.</li>
            <li> Not as great as special effects.</li>
            <li> Also, very easy to apply,  just wash &amp; then put on Stain hair</li>
            <li> If you want to try the &amp;#34;funky colors&amp;#34;, then this is by and far best color on the market.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best purple dye I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> But PRIVANA is amazing :)</li>
            <li> This is the best color I have used so far</li>
            <li> so I am so far happy with it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good idea to find a good sunscreen product to protect the color, much like you would a tattoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE,  LOVE,  LOVE this  hair color - -</li>
            <li> Wait appropriate time &amp; wash out.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely OUTSTANDING color.  </li>
            <li> Love this color</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> it :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye,  it&#x27;s been a month and ths color hasn&#x27;t faded at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> be sure to use some petroleum jelly, conditioner, or something on the skin around the hairline.</li>
            <li> As I was colouring, I was making sure I was wiping off any colour that got on my skin.</li>
            <li> After using a magic eraser and just some scrubbing bubbles cleaner on the shower, it took it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many Purple dyes</li>
            <li> I love this color...</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> As the color faded, it became an even more prominent purple.</li>
            <li> I love this color and how it turned out</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> Hoping it stays better than manic panic</li>
            <li> I love Pravana colors.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of Pravana&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li> it is a hair ink more than a hair</li>
            <li> People seemed to love it, including myself.</li>
            <li> I could not be anymore in love with how it turned out.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it looks on my hair</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, I immediately saw the color and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye (I have ordered it before)</li>
            <li> lasted better then Manic Panic and Kiss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok semi permanent dye.</li>
            <li> Aside from keeping me warm, the tub being partially filled prevents the color from staining the floor</li>
            <li> Have gotten many compliments on the color I used.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I now have violet hair and love it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this hair color.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use gloves for washing your hair afterwards also.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLOR</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MORE OF A PLUM COLOR</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The longer the better.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this color, it turned out a lot more of a pink like tone than the blue-purple</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li> Did not hold in my hair for more than 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars because of the amazing colors that come out of it, but the variability makes it less than perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- mixes well with wild orchid to make a beautiful purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> best dye ive had in a long time</li>
            <li> A hair stylist recommended it for at-home use, and it&#x27;s really pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Smells delightful, but don&#x27;t leave on too long!</li>
            <li> The rich color lasts for a while!</li>
            <li> My cousin, who is licensed, recommended pravana violet because it was vivid and had a great color.</li>
            <li> Pravana colors are the best on the market for brilliant long lasting color.</li>
            <li> They are brilliant, long lasting, easy to use, and they smell great!</li>
            <li> I used a bit of sulfate free shampoo that has color shield to make sure I got it all out.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to get the perfect color.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery good price.</li>
            <li> AND IT WASHED RIGHT OUT OF MY HAIR!!</li>
            <li> So amazing Love it the color mix with orchid just a nice combination.ordering more but you can measure the colors that you need and going to use if not save it for next time...</li>
            <li> Take it from me, it&#x27;s worth buying! :)</li>
            <li> Longest lasting color Purple and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Other than that, its really awesome!</li>
            <li> Wonderful color, stays in my hair way longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Color is bright and vibrant, though.</li>
            <li> so it was easy for this color to take.</li>
            <li> But because it needs no developer you can touch it up easily.</li>
            <li> It is worth all the work to get this beautiful colour that seems almost fade proof so far!</li>
            <li> Hands down, best purple there ever is.</li>
            <li> I either just wash my hands and use a nail brush to get it from under my nails, or use one of those wipes to get makeup off your face, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> Its bright and fades slowly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but you kind of have to play with it a little if you haven&#x27;t had experience with it.</li>
            <li> and all, it&#x27;s a great dye and I will definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li> This looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> This dye is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great hair color, the only downside is that it stains.</li>
            <li> Before I applied this dye, my hair was a light brown.</li>
            <li> Fantastic color.</li>
            <li> Color comes out a lot in the shower, but if you use a sulfate free shampoo or like me, I use Wen..</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed to rinse much more quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Love how much pigmented the violet is, you can also dilute it with conditioner and make a more lighter pastel color.</li>
            <li> But note: really stains everything!!!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> First, I made sure I put something on my skin to protect it from getting colour all around my hair line.</li>
            <li> For better results, try to lighten your hair color first before applying any of Pravana&#x27;s colors.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my pravana vivids violet hair dye until I got it</li>
            <li> I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Since I like a deeper purple, I combine this with Special Effects Pimpin Purple at a 1:5 ratio, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bleach my hair, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more than that.</li>
            <li> I had heard good things about Pravana, so I decided to give it one last go.  </li>
            <li> true to color, washes all out, rubs off on everything</li>
            <li> This color is true to its shade as pictured online, shows up ultra-rich even in non-lightened hair.</li>
            <li> stains everything and man, is that true.</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, just not violet.</li>
            <li> So I used less &amp; it was beautiful, but my roots didn&#x27;t take at all.</li>
            <li> Seriously, color me impressed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly though &amp; as promised.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews of its awesomeness because the purple dye I was using at the time seemed to be fading too quickly.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the seller - item arrived quickly and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the lighter you bleach your hair, the more vibrant it will be.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great</li>
            <li> yet I still have A LOT left to play with which is SO nice to be able to have a ready to use product</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good about that is that you can leave this in for as long as you want.  </li>
            <li> And it stained me purple the first couple washes, even my legs!</li>
            <li> [mixed dye with conditioner], to get pastel color, first time it didn&#x27;t work out well, but I redyed my hair the next day - PERFECT!</li>
            <li> but recommend for people that are willing to bleach there hair or blondes, my roots did not take but my bleached hair did!</li>
            <li> It came out exactly how i wanted it !</li>
            <li> It went on fine,  definitely very  highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The original color is beautiful,  and mixing with other colors is great but it fades quickly and turns into a strange pastel blue color in the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was a medium to light brown and this color came out very vibrant.</li>
            <li> Same great quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Pravana when purchased from the professional beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li> and even when dye gets on something, if you take care of it as soon as possible, everything&#x27;s going to be fine : )</li>
            <li> Completely full coverage, no color variances, just very very saturated in  color.</li>
            <li> Greys ( white hairs ) are covered nicely &amp; add to highlights.  </li>
            <li> But in my opinion, it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I put this over one week old Mahogany Violet hair dye done at a salon and LOVE how it turned out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it is powerful stuff</li>
            <li> LOVE this color - stays better than any of the other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying some magic erasers and rubbing alcohol though if you are as obsessed with having a perfectly spotless bathroom like I am.</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li> color looks good with blondes,  brunettes and other funky colors,  </li>
            <li> I had much better results with special effects and will go back to using that.</li>
            <li> For places that did stain my skin i used a makeup remover wipe and it took it right off.</li>
            <li> so bleach/scrub it right away</li>
            <li> The two mixed together made a really beautiful purple, but it only shows up in the sun.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands over the years I&#x27;ve had purple tresses, this is by far the best lasting.  </li>
            <li> But having gorgeous purple hair is worth a few smudged pillow cases and collars.</li>
            <li> Other than having super dark hair, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It very much stains the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dyes that fell so short of my expectations</li>
            <li> It stained everything it touched until I shampooed for the first time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dye off of a recommendation of a coworker, and was keeping my expectations low just to be safe.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I really like this dye!</li>
            <li> I have never used a hair colour that stained this much, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> All I would want in the future was a better product description.</li>
            <li> everyone&#x27;s going to have a different experience with hair color because there are so many variables:</li>
            <li> But for me, all things being the same, I like the Paul Mitchell better.</li>
            <li> I seriously love how it left my hair.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> being said, I love this product and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s left the most stains on towels, tubs, skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> the first week I colored my hair</li>
            <li> I plan on dying all of my hair this color because it&#x27;s just that pretty.</li>
            <li> So be aware when you use this product.</li>
            <li> 5-STARS for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> But yes, this color is awesome, as long as you don&#x27;t mind your shower looking like where barney was murdered for a few days.</li>
            <li> So then I did a root retouch with it &amp; left it on for about 45 mins to make sure the roots would absorb it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest doing that for the first 2-3 shampoos after coloring with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try the other colors in the future :) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came out a really pretty purple.</li>
            <li> but in the sun it looks so pretty.</li>
            <li> The color in the picture is exactly what you get on bleached out hair.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair redone with the Joico, and after the first shampoo, nothing rubs off or continues to stain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so powerful it really sticks, so</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had more than enough to color.</li>
            <li> Besides that I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I mix half and half with the Pravana &amp;#34;wild orchid&amp;#34; and it comes out a gorgeous shade of warm purple.</li>
            <li> I cannot leave the house without at least  one,  usually more, person telling me that they !!</li>
            <li> other than that, hands down one of the best purple colors I&#x27;ve used on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant, but pretty temporary</li>
            <li> I have found the products that &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; the most last the longest, which is ironic.  </li>
            <li> This is a stain not a dye, you dont use developer from what the box says, the tubes are pretty large..</li>
            <li> The violet and blue that I used covered pretty well, and were easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but the water ran clear pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much to get a pretty color.</li>
            <li> This time I mixed it with normal sulfate-free conditioner and it was WAY more pigmented than the first time.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with purple hair for years, but couldn&#x27;t achieve it for a long time.</li>
            <li> First off -- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting the tube of color straight onto your hair.</li>
            <li> (it cleans up very easily compared to come other color brands i&#x27;ve used )</li>
            <li> The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  </li>
            <li> It fades to a new exciting color every time I was it.</li>
            <li> Dye leaves  my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> And I think it was that easy to lift because I mixed the violet with conditioner</li>
            <li> It did in certain spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty flexible and am always willing to try new things with my hair, so thats why I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so vibrant!</li>
            <li> and the color is still as vibrant today as the first day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had special effects that had faded and left it on my hair about 20 minutes per directions.</li>
            <li> The first shampoo was another blue murder in my shower (which was problematic because I live in a dorm and if I can&#x27;t get the stains out by the end of  the semester I&#x27;ll have to pay a fine)  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , I thought the color was going to stay in my hair a lot longer because it didn&#x27;t wash out as much as the Punky Color, yet the color faded a lot faster still yet.</li>
            <li> The color (Violet) took very well to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my son&#x27;s hair a bluish purple so shiny and intense</li>
            <li> The color is still very saturated, didn&#x27;t fade at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely, not broken or leaking or anything.</li>
            <li> color washes off more than I expected.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it does fade really fast on my hair.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t use as much from the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I then tried this which I should of in the first place and my hair came out so beautiful it did get dark like a dark plum</li>
            <li> so it looks really rad.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Costed service is also as fast to help or.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Make sure you completely cover the space where you&#x27;ll be doing the actual dyeing.</li>
            <li> So far, of the Pravana colors I&#x27;ve tried (blue, magenta and this), this one runs the most.</li>
            <li> I mixed wild orchid and violet to put on top of highlights.</li>
            <li> It looks like my natural dark hair,  only better, AND then, the color Surprise; in the light,  or Sun, etc,  my hair radiates w/ purple highlights &amp; halos,  very pretty &amp; compliments my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> REALLY vivid!!</li>
            <li> Also make sure you rinse your hair very well after and don&#x27;t worry about the color coming out like with other brands.  </li>
            <li> I mean it is amazing how bright and deep this color is, aside from the fact that its obviously not natural,  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had ANY bleeding like most of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I mixed the violet with some conditioner (just cheap conditioner) to tone it down, but also make a bit more volume</li>
            <li> This smells like men&#x27;s body wash (the chemical extra clean smell), and the smell lingers for two weeks in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its an eggplant dark shade of purple but in the sun and different lightings it is bright purple.  </li>
            <li> This DOES stain your shower temporarily during the first few washes and will stain bedding and fingertips until it settles (as with most unnatural colors).  </li>
            <li> After that, it fades to blue (which is also pretty), then green (not so pretty, but kind of cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Special Effects Deep purple for about a year until it was sold out everywhere</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent and will look black if you exceed a reasonable processing time.</li>
            <li> Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week.</li>
            <li> but I figured I&#x27;d try it on my natural hair the first time and go from there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So when my first tube came in I was surprised at how pinkish the color looked.</li>
            <li> The only difference between Violet and Wild Orchard, is that Violet is more of a purple-blue toned tint and the Wild Orchard is a purple-pink toned tint.</li>
            <li> It is true to color and tends to last longer than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and love touches of purple.</li>
            <li> almost black, I knew I was taking my chances that it wouldn&#x27;t show because most things don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It worked ok on the previously colored hair - got basically 2 weeks out of it - hence the 2 stars rather than 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely better and less maintenance than Manic Panic or Directions.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments as my hair is ombre black on top and violet the lower half.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still vibrant.</li>
            <li> Looks better with every wash and two months later I&#x27;m still getting multiple compliments every day</li>
            <li> The only drawback is how quickly it fades, even using color-protecting shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stays vibrant for MONTHS,</li>
            <li> Outdoors my hair is this vibrant purple</li>
            <li> be sure to wear gloves for the application as well as first few shampoos!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> Works really well, make sure your hair is at least light blonde or it will come out a brown/grey color.</li>
            <li> and I have recived a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> its easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t stain everything at all, like other viewers said.</li>
            <li> You pay a bit extra for Pravana, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color, seems to stay in very well too.</li>
            <li> but I threw them away like a normal person because they were exploded.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Messy to apply, but worth the effort if you can make the color last.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one</li>
            <li> I also wanted to see how my skin reacted because I have very sensitive skin, to the point</li>
            <li> so wear old clothes and gloves!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I was thinking using a lighter Vivid shade</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t rinse well enough  the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep purple,  and while I get some bleed the first week or so when washing,  it doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> vivid</li>
            <li> and I decided to try the Chromasilk Vivid violet dye and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting, vivid color, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It gave me pretty, deep purple locs with no damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely vivid.</li>
            <li> Wish someone would make a permanent hair dye in these vivid colors.</li>
            <li> I had used some other brand originally an it faded in one week.</li>
            <li> I can see the blonde from having to bleach my hair before coloring it the first time.</li>
            <li> It fades pretty fast so I would suggest buying extra for touch-ups later on.</li>
            <li> Its a really rich, dark purple but will lighten up eventually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, and after the blue dye I&#x27;d been using kept fading rather quickly, my sister (who has a cosmetology license but isn&#x27;t currently working at a salon)</li>
            <li> I am very sure that it faded because I had put another color over it, because my roots were still pinkish, and the parts of my hair which saw less sunlight were also less faded.</li>
            <li> the water was COMPLETELY clear.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t put a clear gloss over it either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is a CLEAR winner.</li>
            <li> So that was my only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that my skin had no reaction to it</li>
            <li> I cut it with an all natural conditioner</li>
            <li> I touched up the roots of my previously few month old highlighted hair hoping this time it would have a much more lasting effect.</li>
            <li> : The Wild Orchid did nothing, which i predicted as soon as it was out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> As is I have to find something else until my old dye figures out the supply issue.</li>
            <li> The resulting color was not violet, but a VERY saturated cobalt blue.</li>
            <li> Pravana is the only way to go if you&#x27;re doing an unusual color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also suggest sleeping with an old pillow case over your pillow or a towel, at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes the hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I mix it wirh pravana&#x27;s wild orchid and conditioner (4-6 parts conditioner to 1 part wild orchid and 2 parts violet) and leave it in overnight.</li>
            <li> Second it was very watery.</li>
            <li> because I know it&#x27;s gonna fade completely.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell or anything.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long, almost to my waist, so I used two tubes.</li>
            <li> I use this and the Wild Orchid color to create an ombre in my hair.  </li>
            <li> You will have colour under and around your nails for a day or two after the first initial wash, but it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> My blonde was about a level 9, &amp; the purple came out so vibrant</li>
            <li> I meant it certainly did not stay violet long</li>
            <li> I had blonde hair with darker roots, I mixed with conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want it super dark, but I used too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with some left over highlights and it colored it as a tint over the dark areas and the purple showed up nicely in the lighter areas.</li>
            <li> First I expected the bottle that says silk &amp;  keratin on it.</li>
            <li> You need to bleach dark hair to get the biggest bang out of this color, but the end result is worth it.</li>
            <li> though it did slowly lighten, it lasted close to six full weeks of vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I even wore a cobalt blue shirt today (thinking that when placed next to actual blue the violet would be more obvious) but it totally blended</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair if that&#x27;s of any help.</li>
            <li> If you are super picky about exactly the shade you&#x27;re going for, it might take a few tries with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Splat, Manic Panic, Raw, and Special Effects.</li>
            <li> I came out looking really dark &amp; the color looked more like it was black than purple.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the color is going to be very dark at first, but it is worth it, as least for me, since I avoid having to reapply it often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely noticeable in the sun but under normal lighting you can barely see it, which is good for me because I can&#x27;t have crazy colored hair at work 😄</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found one other hair color line I can use (Naturaltint) without irritation but their line isn&#x27;t nearly as fun.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this color as a lowlight (so not an all over color) just for fun, I have VERY dark brown hair,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Special Effects in Deep Purple, but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted (two weeks).</li>
            <li> so when I washed it out my sink turned purple and nothing worked until I poured on some stuff from Dollar General called \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dark brown hair</li>
            <li> that in mind, I mixed one container with one bottle of the Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in Wild Orchid.</li>
            <li> Even though the dye was diluted, it&#x27;s barely faded from my hair a month</li>
            <li> I used Violet, Blue, and Wild Orchid.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get nearly the same run-off in the shower or staining of my hands, pillow cases, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scent sensitive, and my prior dye didn&#x27;t have anything added to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that makes it harder to bleach out when you&#x27;re ready for a change.</li>
            <li> After 3 previous attempts over several weeks to find the right dye for my dream hair, I&#x27;ve found my knight in a shining tube.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get as much use/coverage out of this as I do other dyes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Love it, I only did a small section and it has lasted longer than two weeks!!</li>
            <li> VERY dark purple at first.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, I could get the remnants off of my skin (Dish soap and a loofa  works wonders), the color is even and SO bright.</li>
            <li> However, the first time I shampooed, not only did it lighten significantly,  I got this weird blue streak in the front.</li>
            <li> When I went to go wash the dye out, I washed it out with my bare hands and it left my nails and palms purple.</li>
            <li> and if you go to bed with a wet hair, be warned it will stain your pillow case for the next few days so avoid white or any light color pillow case or clothing if your hair is wet,within the first few days after dying it.</li>
            <li> The purple really stands out against black hair.</li>
            <li> Has odd texture that I didn&#x27;t find spread very well.</li>
            <li> Since purple dyes are hit and miss, and, at least for me, I&#x27;ve had limited success keeping a lasting and vibrant purple over the last month, I was giving Pravana a chance to prove to me that I could have the color I wanted without the hassle of having to constantly touch up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I, personally, didn&#x27;t care about that, but if you do I would definitely take some extra precautions--maybe wash your hair the first few times with some rubber gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (vasilene would work, I used a very thick body lotion actually, and it worked fine)  </li>
            <li> and it still came out quite dark and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> But the purple even heavily diluted gave out a very vibrant purple pigment</li>
            <li> But within a week or so it fades to a really vibrant purple, so that&#x27;s really no problem in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying the Pastel Lavender Pravana when you can just use a few drops of this in a huge blob of conditioner to get the same Lavender results at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Wear double gloves, because if it gets through to your skin, you&#x27;ll have purple fingertips for days (ruins the fun a little).</li>
            <li> I used this on both newly bleached hair and over previously purple dyed hair.</li>
            <li> should mention that, freshly dyed, it does start out very dark (and with a slight blue tint.)</li>
            <li> I did get the results I expected, my lowlights were only visible in the sun and even then, just barely.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair that i straighten everyday and thus dye lasted me about 5 months wiwith a vibrant purple.  </li>
            <li> I have been dying a large section of my hair purple for the past six years, I won&#x27;t be using this dye again.</li>
            <li> I partially fill the tub with hot water (just past my ankles to keep my feet warm), then wash my hair in cold water.</li>
            <li> The purple will rub off on other things the first little while after dying.</li>
            <li> When it starts to fade, I just touch up the areas that need it (and any fading black near my face, actually).</li>
            <li> SO IF YOU ARE GOING FOR THE LOUD PURPLE AND HAVE DARK HAIR</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- did not last as long as Punky Color</li>
            <li> I left it in for 4 hours, and my hair stylist said I could leave it as long as a day if I wanted.  </li>
            <li> But over all I was dissatisfied with this product after all of the hype I had heard about this dye lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color almost completely faded out from one wash with color safe products and very little sun.</li>
            <li> I bleached my roots, and the next day mixed the dye with 3 oz  of &amp;#34;color stay&amp;#34; by L&#x27;oreal conditioner I had left over from dying my hair black years ago.</li>
            <li> I used an entire tube, but next time I think I&#x27;ll only use half.</li>
            <li> It was very dark and hardly notieable at first, probably because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair all the way to the recommended level, but when it finally did start fading, (it took several weeks!)</li>
            <li> While I do have to wash my hair every day I expected this to last longer.</li>
            <li> It came out semi-translucent, and covered nothing (even my grey didn&#x27;t cover).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have long to wait.</li>
            <li> This color holds on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have not had to touch up in a month and have actually been shampooing the ends trying to get it to fade a bit into a lighter purple with not much luck.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this color and brand for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go long without washing my hair, so I think I end up washing it all out.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The dye was definitely not pinkish but it was a little too blue.</li>
            <li> It dyed deeper and brighter over the faded blue without having to touch up my bleach before applying it, and it lasted longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve used -</li>
            <li> It sucks, but its cheap and works for a couple weeks at least.</li>
            <li> It is a dark purple and subtle indoors, but outside it is so vibrant!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried using the platinum blonde in the Naturaltint line, it didn&#x27;t lift my hair at ALL, it&#x27;s just not strong enough...</li>
            <li> Washing this time was a complete mess, dark blue-purple everywhere.</li>
            <li> Only down side is it literally washes out, what seems like a lot each time you wash.</li>
            <li> it got all over my pillows when I slept, all down my back when I was out in the sun, and all over the shoulders of whatever clothes I was wearing.</li>
            <li> I had to cover my pillow with a black shirt/towel and wear dark clothes for at least a week, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I even washed my hair less to about every two days (vs everyday/every other day that I did with the Punky Color), but the color barely lasted 2 weeks even under those conditions.</li>
            <li> However today slightly a week later it has faded to lilac.</li>
            <li> I have the blocking pattern of the purple (with a splash of blue...makes it look electric in the sun) mixed in with black hair.</li>
            <li> Its in a half gallon jug and a yellow liquid</li>
            <li> for the product, I have only tried to colour a strand over my already dark hair and it washed out immediately, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> since I read the reviews prior, I bought some dye removal for my face and the counter that I got a little bit on.</li>
            <li> With punky color it shows up well in artificial light too, but with Pravana, my hair didn&#x27;t do that as well.  </li>
            <li> does not show at all on darker hair colors when in artificial light</li>
            <li> I am planning on doing the emerald green next.</li>
            <li> I left it on  for a few hours and when I went to rinse it</li>
            <li> it  would lighten and a few more random streaks would appear, some of them even closer to aqua and green.</li>
            <li> But do be careful, it WILL stain your sink/tub/shower/life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came with in the time it was expected.</li>
            <li> It stains anything it touches, including counters, bathtubs, and even steel sinks.</li>
            <li> I was really careful during dyeing my hair.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I plan on switiching to emerald in the next few months and can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair just gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t bleed.  </li>
            <li> Being an Asian with almost jet black hair, yet curly, my hair is pretty difficult to color.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WEIRD right?</li>
            <li> On the newly bleached hair, it faded to the expected ashy lavender color in less than two weeks with washing hair every 2-3 days while I got at least 3 weeks out of the Paul Mitchell dye.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I generally leave my color on for at least 6-12 hours.</li>
            <li> but  it just isn&#x27;t worth it for me since it doesn&#x27;t last long at all :(</li>
            <li> with this as the other.  </li>
            <li> I have to redye due to my hair growing out,  </li>
            <li> never yet due to color fade.  </li>
            <li> Pravana before, for one reason or the other.</li>
            <li> It blends well with other PRAVANA colors if you&#x27;re looking for mulit colored hair.</li>
            <li> When I was not pleased with the color I had put some ultra violet manic panic (that I had already had) over my hair that I had just dyed the night prior with this dye</li>
            <li> in all, I would never choose any other dye to color my hair purple.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all and hope that others don&#x27;t go through the stress I have endured due to my hair.</li>
            <li> maintained the color for a while by mixing small amounts of the dye with white conditioner and using that while in the shower, letting the conditioner sit while I did my shaving and other washing.</li>
            <li> The longevity is hard to gauge because part of my head didn&#x27;t really dye, but I feel like it wore off in 3-4 weeks, compared to at least 6 with my other dye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in the wild orchid, which I only got as a blue-based red substitute, I was looking for a blood red but opted for this over the copper-red that Pravana</li>
            <li> I hit it with the hairdryer for a few minutes to dry it out a bit, then go about my business.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair a little stiff but nothing deep conditioning can&#x27;t help with!</li>
            <li> Also, my hair color is a dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark dark brown hair with redish undertons.</li>
            <li> word of caution though: Get dark pillowcases for sleeping or wear your hair up when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS DARK BROWN</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair you will want to bleach it.</li>
            <li> It is a dark purple</li>
            <li> Color is really dark..</li>
            <li> so I watered this down with conditioner.</li>
            <li> And it all came out just all the  color down the drain.</li>
            <li> Will not buy anything else other than Pravana!</li>
            <li> Lasts for 1-2 months when washed in cold water with the right cleaners (on bleached hair).</li>
            <li> I used 2 tubes very carefully !</li>
            <li> less dye in water when you wash hair</li>
            <li> : Color run off is much, much less than my go-to.  </li>
            <li> and it maybe brought the color up  half a shade.</li>
            <li> Wash with non-sulfate shampoo &amp; cold water, then use a good non-sulfate conditioner and again rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> The color has lasted two and a half months and is still presentable.</li>
            <li> Previously it was ombre blond</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a typical color that you mix with developer and let sit.  </li>
            <li> it looks black unless you&#x27;re up close.</li>
            <li> The first very strange, but  neither of them was exactly bad.</li>
            <li> I think someone suggested mixing in a little conditioner to prevent it from staining your hands and whatnot after it&#x27;s been washed out...</li>
            <li> I have little experience with dying hair unnatural colors.</li>
            <li> I also get a little tint of colour on my hands when I am running my hands through it.</li>
            <li> - I was a little hesitant ordering this, per lack of photos and details.</li>
            <li> It did come off the tub with some baking soda and a little elbow grease.  </li>
            <li> and I got a little bit of patchy color (My fault).</li>
            <li> but it was nothing a little bleach couldnt handle</li>
            <li> +,  and have naturally very dark brown curly frizzy hair,  and this product brightens &amp; is shiny.  </li>
            <li> It was very dark, almost an eggplant purple.</li>
            <li> But, like the other reviews warned, this dye will turn everything it touches purple!!</li>
            <li> Rinses out in a week, waste of time and effort.</li>
            <li> I received this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of that fading a bit, I used the Pravana.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much trouble to touch it up every now and then, though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use pillow cases or wear shirts you care about until you&#x27;ve shampooed a couple of times - the color takes a few days to stop rubbing off.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is messy and it will fade out.</li>
            <li> so I think it is not as messy as an all over color job would be.</li>
            <li> makes a mess!</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> Ive tried manic panic, ion I think it is?, and raw</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed very little fading.</li>
            <li> So after a recommendation from some random girl on a train who also had purple hair and a customer at work two days later, I felt compelled to try out Pravana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just leave it in, depending on what I have  to do, usually about 2 hours, to get maximum color deposit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very messy.</li>
            <li> Stains everything way worse than other dyes do, but doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair as well.</li>
            <li> Even after several washes, it does slightly stain my fingers after styling my hair in the mornings and it does run off on to my skin if I am working out and get sweaty, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> Cold water rinse is key.</li>
            <li> So I was expecting a concord grape color at least.</li>
            <li> Color fades within 2-3 weeks, and I would have to re-paint my hair at least once per month.</li>
            <li> It is about 2 weeks late.</li>
            <li> This dye is crazy saturated and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> and this gave me the prettiest subtle purple.</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> I was totally amazed, it seemed impossible, but I chalked it up to the conditioner I had used and made no complaints.  </li>
            <li> but it became a varied blue and green with a bleached-white base.</li>
            <li> Seriously,  like at all.  </li>
            <li> I didnt use hair bleach or stripper on my hair to begin with though i prefer a subtle  color</li>
            <li> Also, seriously cover everything around where you&#x27;ll be coloring, and expect that your bathtub WILL be purple.</li>
            <li> and it took the purple stains off everything with hardly any scrubbing!</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about it is that it literally stains everything.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the process for purple hair</li>
            <li> and it was poorly packaged and exploded inside the package so when I opened it I got hair dye every</li>
            <li> my hair was not a beautiful purple at all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair &#x27;weird&#x27; colors for about a decade now, and I&#x27;ve used every dye brand you can think of.</li>
            <li> I think mine is expired or something is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> but the shipping cost was so expensive 😞&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair texture was horrible and it took years to have it back.</li>
            <li> They are impermanent, so it washes out of clothes and even the worst staining (bathtubs, sinks, linoleum, etc.)</li>
            <li> I tried some lame brand from sallys to get a plum and turn a ugly red color which faded nasty.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3 days or so, use cold water when washing it out, and use shampoo and conditioner that is meant for coloured hair.</li>
            <li> cold water.</li>
            <li> Wash hair in cold water: I use the shower in my tub.</li>
            <li> I hear that it lasts longer if you can stretch the time between shampoos and use cold water, neither of which I can</li>
            <li> Drove me crazy..</li>
            <li> I was so mad.</li>
            <li> I am still mad.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;It made me so sad</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> my head touched the pillow and faded badly in those places, leaving me with unattractive bleached out areas on the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> later!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying all kinds of crazy Pravana Chromasilk Vivids colors!</li>
            <li> so i was extremely disappointed when it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> worst though for me is the smell.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I had to bleach my hair before I used any of these products and it was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a tray, gloves and dye brush as well. I brushed on the color and got all the way to my roots, I also left it on for about 30 or 40 minutes. The dye does stain everything.- since I read the reviews prior, I bought some dye removal for my face and the counter that I got a little bit on. I love the color! I have dark brown hair with some left over highlights and it colored it as a tint over the dark areas and the purple showed up nicely in the lighter areas.</li>
            <li> I did an apple cider vinegar and water rinse after using pravana and had no problem with the color bleeding.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;unnaturally colored&amp;#34; hair dye you could find. I bleached the ends of my hair and put the purple on and it is incredibly bright and gorgeous. Like any hair dye, you are going to have to touch it up, I redye mine every 2-3 weeks and even when it starts washing out it still looks good. Ive tried manic panic, ion I think it is?, and raw and they all just fall off my hair. Even when youre putting it on your hair the texture just feels like it will stick. And, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, which is always a plus. I cannot recommend it enough. Way better/cheaper than going to the salon. I am planning on doing the emerald green next. DEFINITELY give this a shot!</li>
            <li> everything I own is now purple BEWARE! lol</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  But note: really stains everything!!! Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, very happy customer! I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years and have tried everything. Pravana is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark brown hair and this gave me the prettiest subtle purple. It&#x27;s definitely noticeable in the sun but under normal lighting you can barely see it, which is good for me because I can&#x27;t have crazy colored hair at work 😄 This WILL stain just about everything so wear old clothes and gloves! I think someone suggested mixing in a little conditioner to prevent it from staining your hands and whatnot after it&#x27;s been washed out...I tried it out and it does work 😀</li>
            <li> LOVE,  LOVE,  LOVE this  hair color - - It has changed my life  ** Seriously **  I cannot leave the house without at least  one,  usually more, person telling me that they !! love  !! my hair color.  Strangers - men, women, teenagers - it is wonderful not to be invisible.  I am female  50 ++,  and have naturally very dark brown curly frizzy hair,  and this product brightens &amp; is shiny.  It looks like my natural dark hair,  only better, AND then, the color Surprise; in the light,  or Sun, etc,  my hair radiates w/ purple highlights &amp; halos,  very pretty &amp; compliments my skin tone.  Also, very easy to apply,  just wash &amp; then put on Stain hair color - yes, it&#x27;s a stain,  so Cover everything  &amp; wear gloves.  Wait appropriate time &amp; wash out.  Ta- Da - you&#x27;re beautiful.  Greys ( white hairs ) are covered nicely &amp; add to highlights.  As you can tell,  I am enthusiastic about Violet Vivids.  Try it - you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Preface: I have little experience with dying hair unnatural colors. I have only dyed my hair purple once before using Punky Color. Also, my hair color is a dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I mixed one container with one bottle of the Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in Wild Orchid. The two mixed together made a really beautiful purple, but it only shows up in the sun. With punky color it shows up well in artificial light too, but with Pravana, my hair didn&#x27;t do that as well.  I don&#x27;t bleach my hair, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much more than that. But, when it was in the sun, the color was BEAUTIFUL. &amp;#60;3 With the Pravana, I thought the color was going to stay in my hair a lot longer because it didn&#x27;t wash out as much as the Punky Color, yet the color faded a lot faster still yet. I even washed my hair less to about every two days (vs everyday/every other day that I did with the Punky Color), but the color barely lasted 2 weeks even under those conditions. So that was my only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- mixes well with wild orchid to make a beautiful purple.&lt;br /&gt;- less dye in water when you wash hair&lt;br /&gt;- smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- did not last as long as Punky Color&lt;br /&gt;- does not show at all on darker hair colors when in artificial light</li>
            <li> Seriously intense and very awesome color..definitely gonna keep buying this again. ..best dye ive had in a long time</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color. You don&#x27;t have to use much to get a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this color as a lowlight (so not an all over color) just for fun, I have VERY dark brown hair, almost black, I knew I was taking my chances that it wouldn&#x27;t show because most things don&#x27;t but I figured I&#x27;d try it on my natural hair the first time and go from there. I also wanted to see how my skin reacted because I have very sensitive skin, to the point I&#x27;ve only found one other hair color line I can use (Naturaltint) without irritation but their line isn&#x27;t nearly as fun. Of course you HAVE to keep this product off your skin as best you can because it does stain! I was pleasantly surprised that my skin had no reaction to it and I put a fair amount of product in yet I still have A LOT left to play with which is SO nice to be able to have a ready to use product and you don&#x27;t have to throw the excess away! I did get the results I expected, my lowlights were only visible in the sun and even then, just barely. I&#x27;ll have to lighten the pieces I want to tint quite a bit for them to show. I was thinking using a lighter Vivid shade but I don&#x27;t know if that will work and I&#x27;m concerned about using bleach on my hair, my skin will freak and I&#x27;ve tried using the platinum blonde in the Naturaltint line, it didn&#x27;t lift my hair at ALL, it&#x27;s just not strong enough...if anyone has suggestions I&#x27;m open to them. Other than having super dark hair, I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely OUTSTANDING color.  Loved it.  Do take care during application...stains everything.</li>
            <li> Love this color it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> The color is just what I was looking for I Love It!</li>
            <li> Best dye color and super healthy  for my hair. Dye leaves  my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!!!! I&#x27;ve tried so many dyes that fell so short of my expectations, I was starting to lose hope!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive. But in my opinion, it is well worth the price. This dye is crazy saturated and lasts a really long time. I wanted a pastel lavender color so I watered this down with conditioner. Even though the dye was diluted, it&#x27;s barely faded from my hair a month later!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying all kinds of crazy Pravana Chromasilk Vivids colors!</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever!</li>
            <li> The color (Violet) took very well to my hair.  I cut it with an all natural conditioner almost 50/50 and it still came out quite dark and vibrant.  A little goes a long way.  It does bleed out in the wash quite a bit, so keep the bleach cleaner handy for your tub.  I have had many compliments on the color.</li>
            <li> I hav tried every dye u can think of and this is the best.  I have damaged hair that i straighten everyday and thus dye lasted me about 5 months wiwith a vibrant purple.  LuLuv it :)</li>
            <li> My favorite colors, purple was so beautiful but it&#x27;s bow time for me to see the blue, it&#x27;s been well over a year I&#x27;ve used the purple</li>
            <li> Best purple hair dye EVER.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. The quality of color compared to Manic Panic......it&#x27;s not even in the same league.  It made my son&#x27;s hair a bluish purple so shiny and intense it looked electric.  I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Rinses out in a week, waste of time and effort.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this however this lasted about a week and has faded to a lilac. The first time I used it I had special effects that had faded and left it on my hair about 20 minutes per directions. The color had faded after a week. I gave it another try 2 weeks later and left it on about an hour....same results. I touched up the roots of my previously few month old highlighted hair hoping this time it would have a much more lasting effect. However today slightly a week later it has faded to lilac. I used the sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. While I do have to wash my hair every day I expected this to last longer. I had much better results with special effects and will go back to using that. I have very fine thin hair if that&#x27;s of any help. I loved the color and the consistency but  it just isn&#x27;t worth it for me since it doesn&#x27;t last long at all :(</li>
            <li> I tried Pravana when my go-to company had a supply issue.  A hair stylist recommended it for at-home use, and it&#x27;s really pretty good.  I used Violet, Blue, and Wild Orchid.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Color run off is much, much less than my go-to.  I don&#x27;t get nearly the same run-off in the shower or staining of my hands, pillow cases, etc. with this as the other.  It seemed to rinse much more quickly and cleanly. The violet and blue that I used covered pretty well, and were easy to use.  I feel like I get as much use/coverage out of this as I do other dyes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The Wild Orchid did nothing, which i predicted as soon as it was out of the tube.  It came out semi-translucent, and covered nothing (even my grey didn&#x27;t cover). The longevity is hard to gauge because part of my head didn&#x27;t really dye, but I feel like it wore off in 3-4 weeks, compared to at least 6 with my other dye.  I&#x27;m really disappointed in the wild orchid, which I only got as a blue-based red substitute, I was looking for a blood red but opted for this over the copper-red that Pravana offers.&lt;br /&gt;The worst though for me is the smell.  I&#x27;m scent sensitive, and my prior dye didn&#x27;t have anything added to it.  This smells like men&#x27;s body wash (the chemical extra clean smell), and the smell lingers for two weeks in my hair.  It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fix the smell and give me a deep, blood red that covers and I&#x27;d be a life-long convert.  As is I have to find something else until my old dye figures out the supply issue.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye,  it&#x27;s been a month and ths color hasn&#x27;t faded at all. I will definitely use this every time. But it stains everything! After a month my bath tub still gets purple after every wash. And it stained me purple the first couple washes, even my legs! But it is an amazing dye. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery good price. A++</li>
            <li> Love Pravana love this shade and love the price!!!</li>
            <li> So this I&#x27;ve bought this product twice now. Both times the tubes have said &amp;#34;Violet&amp;#34; just as I ordered, but the contents were two vastly different colors, and my experience has been completely different each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair shades of purple for almost a year, always using some shade from Splat. It sucks, but its cheap and works for a couple weeks at least. So after a recommendation from some random girl on a train who also had purple hair and a customer at work two days later, I felt compelled to try out Pravana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my first tube came in I was surprised at how pinkish the color looked. It was still a shade of purple, but a bit lighter and closer to darkish lavender than violet. I bleached my roots, and the next day mixed the dye with 3 oz  of &amp;#34;color stay&amp;#34; by L&#x27;oreal conditioner I had left over from dying my hair black years ago. It went on fine,  definitely very  highly pigmented. I left it on  for a few hours and when I went to rinse it the water was COMPLETELY clear. I was totally amazed, it seemed impossible, but I chalked it up to the conditioner I had used and made no complaints.  It did not bleed at all,  definitely the cleanest hair dye experience in history. However, the first time I shampooed, not only did it lighten significantly,  I got this weird blue streak in the front. Like I had dyed my hair sky blue only on that one strip of hair. It looked good so whatever. Every  time I shampooed it  would lighten and a few more random streaks would appear, some of them even closer to aqua and green. TOTALLY WEIRD right? But it looked great! I meant it certainly did not stay violet long but it became a varied blue and green with a bleached-white base. I have no idea why any of that happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS TIME buying again my experience was closer to expectation. The dye was definitely not pinkish but it was a little too blue. Not a bad thing, just not violet. This time I mixed it with normal sulfate-free conditioner and it was WAY more pigmented than the first time. I used about twice the conditioner and it maybe brought the color up  half a shade. Washing this time was a complete mess, dark blue-purple everywhere. The resulting color was not violet, but a VERY saturated cobalt blue. I mean it is amazing how bright and deep this color is, aside from the fact that its obviously not natural,  it almost looks that way. Completely full coverage, no color variances, just very very saturated in  color. It stained everything it touched until I shampooed for the first time. The first shampoo was another blue murder in my shower (which was problematic because I live in a dorm and if I can&#x27;t get the stains out by the end of  the semester I&#x27;ll have to pay a fine)  but the water ran clear pretty quickly.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t rinse well enough  the first time. The color is still very saturated, didn&#x27;t fade at all. It is still closer to cobalt blue. I even wore a cobalt blue shirt today (thinking that when placed next to actual blue the violet would be more obvious) but it totally blended in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion. Two very different experiences. The first very strange, but  neither of them was exactly bad. I&#x27;m pretty flexible and am always willing to try new things with my hair, so thats why I didn&#x27;t mind. If you are super picky about exactly the shade you&#x27;re going for, it might take a few tries with this stuff. You never know what you&#x27;ll get. I would give it five stars because of the amazing colors that come out of it, but the variability makes it less than perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard sooo many great reviews about this product so i was extremely disappointed when it did not work at all for me. When I washed the color out everything came off. my hair was not a beautiful purple at all. I don&#x27;t know if the dye i got was defective, but I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands over the years I&#x27;ve had purple tresses, this is by far the best lasting.  It&#x27;s a deep purple,  and while I get some bleed the first week or so when washing,  it doesn&#x27;t fade. Seriously,  like at all.  I have to redye due to my hair growing out,  never yet due to color fade.  This is my go to purple dye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair &#x27;weird&#x27; colors for about a decade now, and I&#x27;ve used every dye brand you can think of. I&#x27;ve had every color of the rainbow on my head, and I&#x27;ve figured out which brands I liked best for which tones. But I had never heard of (of tried) Pravana before, for one reason or the other. I ordered this dye off of a recommendation of a coworker, and was keeping my expectations low just to be safe. Since purple dyes are hit and miss, and, at least for me, I&#x27;ve had limited success keeping a lasting and vibrant purple over the last month, I was giving Pravana a chance to prove to me that I could have the color I wanted without the hassle of having to constantly touch up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something: I&#x27;m really fracking impressed. After 3 previous attempts over several weeks to find the right dye for my dream hair, I&#x27;ve found my knight in a shining tube. The smell wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, I could get the remnants off of my skin (Dish soap and a loofa  works wonders), the color is even and SO bright. But do be careful, it WILL stain your sink/tub/shower/life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tldr; After a decade of scouring the Earth for the perfect brand of Rainbow Bright-esque colors, I&#x27;ve found my hair&#x27;s soul mate. I will recommend this brand to everyone I know. Seriously, color me impressed.</li>
            <li> I have not used this color yet but I will be soon!! Going to do some purple highlights!! Love! Love! Love!! This color!! Fast shipping and I highly recommend!! Will be back for more!!</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Pravana is the only way to go if you&#x27;re doing an unusual color. Very bright and lasts FOREVER. If you&#x27;re going purple this is the best product you can buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this dye! I&#x27;m about 3-3 1/2 weeks in and the color is still quite pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that, freshly dyed, it does start out very dark (and with a slight blue tint.) But within a week or so it fades to a really vibrant purple, so that&#x27;s really no problem in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I should mention is how it stains. Make sure you completely cover the space where you&#x27;ll be doing the actual dyeing. I got a bit of dye in my sink and I think there&#x27;s still a purple spot.&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to use some petroleum jelly, conditioner, or something on the skin around the hairline. It very much stains the skin. When I went to go wash the dye out, I washed it out with my bare hands and it left my nails and palms purple. The purple on my palms went away in a couple of days, but my nails stayed stained for a while. I, personally, didn&#x27;t care about that, but if you do I would definitely take some extra precautions--maybe wash your hair the first few times with some rubber gloves on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also suggest sleeping with an old pillow case over your pillow or a towel, at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, it&#x27;s a great dye and I will definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later still washing out and fading</li>
            <li> I received this a few weeks ago. It was packaged nicely, not broken or leaking or anything. Came with in the time it was expected. The colour is beautiful! But I agree with all the others that have bought this product, IT WILL STAIN! I have never used a hair colour that stained this much, but it is definitely worth it. I would recommend bleaching/lighten your hair. It will not pick up on non pre-lightened hair. I bleached my hair, then had coloured it with punky colours-plum. After a few weeks of that fading a bit, I used the Pravana. First, I made sure I put something on my skin to protect it from getting colour all around my hair line. (vasilene would work, I used a very thick body lotion actually, and it worked fine)  I left it on for the 30-40 mins it said to leave it on. As I was colouring, I was making sure I was wiping off any colour that got on my skin. (as I stated, it will stain) I washed it out, and it stained my shower. After using a magic eraser and just some scrubbing bubbles cleaner on the shower, it took it off. I&#x27;ve had the colour in for about 2 weeks or so now, and I have had NO fading. I wash my hair every 3 days or so, use cold water when washing it out, and use shampoo and conditioner that is meant for coloured hair. I am still having colour wash out every time I shower. Good thing I have purple towels and purple bed sheets. lol. I also get a little tint of colour on my hands when I am running my hands through it. I either just wash my hands and use a nail brush to get it from under my nails, or use one of those wipes to get makeup off your face, and that works just fine.You will have colour under and around your nails for a day or two after the first initial wash, but it&#x27;s no big deal. All in all, the colour is beautiful. It&#x27;s so bright in the sun, and darker indoors. It is worth all the work to get this beautiful colour that seems almost fade proof so far! good luck!</li>
            <li> Pros: shipped quickly within the week, wonderfully packaged, and undamaged. I would definitely order from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I was a little hesitant ordering this, per lack of photos and details. But don&#x27;t worry, it comes just as it is and looks great! All I would want in the future was a better product description. Take it from me, it&#x27;s worth buying! :)</li>
            <li> If you want to try the &amp;#34;funky colors&amp;#34;, then this is by and far best color on the market. I have the blocking pattern of the purple (with a splash of blue...makes it look electric in the sun) mixed in with black hair. This looks fabulous. When it starts to fade, I just touch up the areas that need it (and any fading black near my face, actually). I hit it with the hairdryer for a few minutes to dry it out a bit, then go about my business. I just leave it in, depending on what I have  to do, usually about 2 hours, to get maximum color deposit. Wash with non-sulfate shampoo &amp; cold water, then use a good non-sulfate conditioner and again rinse with cold water. Cold water rinse is key. Makes the hair shiny and soft. It&#x27;s also a good idea to find a good sunscreen product to protect the color, much like you would a tattoo. Great product, great color, leaves my hair in great shape, even with the bleached bits.</li>
            <li> Wish there were instructions included on how to best use the product.  would be helpful.  Arrived quickly though &amp; as promised.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair color! I mix it wirh pravana&#x27;s wild orchid and conditioner (4-6 parts conditioner to 1 part wild orchid and 2 parts violet) and leave it in overnight. Its bright and fades slowly and beautifully. I get compliments on it almost every time I go out! Lasts for 1-2 months when washed in cold water with the right cleaners (on bleached hair). My hair falls about 3 inches below my shoulders and one tube lasts me about 6 months! Heads up though...these kinds of dyes will get on everyrhing. They are impermanent, so it washes out of clothes and even the worst staining (bathtubs, sinks, linoleum, etc.) Will eventually fade. I highly recommend buying some magic erasers and rubbing alcohol though if you are as obsessed with having a perfectly spotless bathroom like I am.</li>
            <li> Works really well, make sure your hair is at least light blonde or it will come out a brown/grey color. It fades pretty fast so I would suggest buying extra for touch-ups later on. It blends well with other PRAVANA colors if you&#x27;re looking for mulit colored hair.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best purple dye I&#x27;ve ever used!! But, like the other reviews warned, this dye will turn everything it touches purple!!</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li> I am a brunette and use it on the bleached portions of my hair. Since I like a deeper purple, I combine this with Special Effects Pimpin Purple at a 1:5 ratio, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, Chromasilk lasts about 2 weeks of good color for me (I wash my hair every two days). In order to make it stick for longer, I let is process for 40-50 minutes. Be aware that the color is going to be very dark at first, but it is worth it, as least for me, since I avoid having to reapply it often. Even after several washes, it does slightly stain my fingers after styling my hair in the mornings and it does run off on to my skin if I am working out and get sweaty, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very vivid and I have recived a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again</li>
            <li> Item was expired. But PRIVANA is amazing :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews of its awesomeness because the purple dye I was using at the time seemed to be fading too quickly. Unfortunately, I found out that this color does NOT work better than the one I was using (Paul Mitchell) - it faded even faster. I used this on both newly bleached hair and over previously purple dyed hair. On the newly bleached hair, it faded to the expected ashy lavender color in less than two weeks with washing hair every 2-3 days while I got at least 3 weeks out of the Paul Mitchell dye. It worked ok on the previously colored hair - got basically 2 weeks out of it - hence the 2 stars rather than 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, take this review with a grain of salt... everyone&#x27;s going to have a different experience with hair color because there are so many variables: hair status, bleach outcome, dye process, wash frequency, shampoo used...even one&#x27;s environment can make a difference. But for me, all things being the same, I like the Paul Mitchell better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many Purple dyes but by FAR,This product is the best purple dye I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve been using  Violet for about four years now.(using Violet in the Picture) Longest lasting color Purple and at a good price! (: The only difference between Violet and Wild Orchard, is that Violet is more of a purple-blue toned tint and the Wild Orchard is a purple-pink toned tint. Both great colors!</li>
            <li> I love this color... It&#x27;s so vibrant! Only down side is it literally washes out, what seems like a lot each time you wash.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!! Its been almost a month and it&#x27;s still vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I have ever used.  Now it will be the only hair color I ever use!</li>
            <li> I love this color. My hair was a medium to light brown and this color came out very vibrant. As the color faded, it became an even more prominent purple. The color has lasted two and a half months and is still presentable.</li>
            <li> I love this color and how it turned out</li>
            <li> Love it, I only did a small section and it has lasted longer than two weeks!!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Hoping it stays better than manic panic</li>
            <li> First I expected the bottle that says silk &amp;  keratin on it. The bottle didn&#x27;t say any of that. Second it was very watery. My mom is a hair dresser and thankfully she said don&#x27;t use it on while head. So she took a piece in the middle of my hair and started brushing. Then used foil. It says leave it for 20 I left it for 45min. I have dark dark brown hair with redish undertons. So I was expecting a concord grape color at least. I went to the kitchen sink which is metal so it won&#x27;t stain. It did in certain spots. So I rinsed my hair&lt;br /&gt;wwith cold water. And it all came out just all the  color down the drain. I used a bit of sulfate free shampoo that has color shield to make sure I got it all out. I was left with nothing the same color hair. No purple in sight except in my drain. I was so mad. I am still mad. I think mine is expired or something is wrong with it. I am going to lighten my hair and try again. If it doesn&#x27;t take then my dye is totally bogus. Will update by end of the week.</li>
            <li> I came out looking really dark &amp; the color looked more like it was black than purple.</li>
            <li> I seriously love how it left my hair. I only bleached the tips (ombre style) and used this brand. Its a really rich, dark purple but will lighten up eventually. The only thing I hate about it is that it literally stains everything. I have to wash my bathtub with bleach to wipe it off. Other than that, its really awesome! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great color.  It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love Pravana colors. They are brilliant, long lasting, easy to use, and they smell great! You pay a bit extra for Pravana, but it is well worth it. This seller ensured the delivery was prompt and it was on time. Didn&#x27;t have long to wait. I would buy this product again from this seller. Pravana colors are the best on the market for brilliant long lasting color. For better results, try to lighten your hair color first before applying any of Pravana&#x27;s colors. If you are looking for temporary color don&#x27;t purchase this Pravana. Buy something over the counter. I will be buying more of Pravana&#x27;s colors. Just beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, and after the blue dye I&#x27;d been using kept fading rather quickly, my sister (who has a cosmetology license but isn&#x27;t currently working at a salon) and I decided to try the Chromasilk Vivid violet dye and it worked wonders. It dyed deeper and brighter over the faded blue without having to touch up my bleach before applying it, and it lasted longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve used - though it did slowly lighten, it lasted close to six full weeks of vibrant color. I cannot recommend this product enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you decide to use it at home (like my sister and I), you need to treat it like you&#x27;re painting the house. It stains anything it touches, including counters, bathtubs, and even steel sinks. Last time we used it, I had to use both bleach and Comet cleaner to remove the stains from the bathtub, and after a month the sink is still stained. There&#x27;s a reason this product is meant only for professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this product and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. If you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting, vivid color, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> this product is really awesome! its easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t stain everything at all, like other viewers said. I was really careful during dyeing my hair. and even when dye gets on something, if you take care of it as soon as possible, everything&#x27;s going to be fine : )&lt;br /&gt;I tried to experiment with violet [mixed dye with conditioner], to get pastel color, first time it didn&#x27;t work out well, but I redyed my hair the next day - PERFECT! I also dyed part of my hair without bleaching it -  great :)</li>
            <li> This is the best color I have used so far and I have tried many different brands.  I will say be prepared to have a purple bathroom and purple hands for awhile if your not prepared.  It did come off the tub with some baking soda and a little elbow grease.  Also make sure you rinse your hair very well after and don&#x27;t worry about the color coming out like with other brands.  This color holds on for a long time.  I have not had to touch up in a month and have actually been shampooing the ends trying to get it to fade a bit into a lighter purple with not much luck.  Wear gloves when rinsing out your hair because even the rinse out water will stain everything it touches.  You have been warned!  But this is Amazing!</li>
            <li> Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week. (I don&#x27;t use shampoo)</li>
            <li> I have dreadlocs and I wanted to color my hair, but nothing was working. Manic Panic did nothing, Splat was a joke. I had heard good things about Pravana, so I decided to give it one last go.  I did not bleach my loc instead I gradually lightened them using Textures &amp; Tones box dye. Every 4-6 weeks I&#x27;d apply the T &amp; T. I then followed up with a deep condition and used ION repair creme for color treated hair. After 3 rounds of lightening, I then used the Pravana. It gave me pretty, deep purple locs with no damage to my hair. I always shampooed my hair prior to coloring. Prior to applying the Pravana I sprayed my hair with ION pre coloring treatment.</li>
            <li> Be ware it is a hair ink more than a hair dye&lt;br /&gt;Deal with it as dealing with ink</li>
            <li> REALLY vivid!! great color; if washed correctly, keeps well</li>
            <li> This dye is fantastic. It is true to the color, shines brilliantly and doesn&#x27;t fade like others. Perfect! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I always get compliments on my color and asked what brand I used. It&#x27;s been a month and it&#x27;s still a gorgeous purple tone. :) pravana is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Color fades within 2-3 weeks, and I would have to re-paint my hair at least once per month. Color is bright and vibrant, though. People seemed to love it, including myself.</li>
            <li> Wonderful color, stays in my hair way longer than any other dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Good product,  but the shipping cost was so expensive 😞&lt;br /&gt;It is very messy.</li>
            <li> color washes off more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I put this over one week old Mahogany Violet hair dye done at a salon and LOVE how it turned out.  Its an eggplant dark shade of purple but in the sun and different lightings it is bright purple.  I could not be anymore in love with how it turned out.  I haven&#x27;t had ANY bleeding like most of the other reviewers have.  The only time it comes off on anything is when I spray hair spray in it and then touch that section.  None has come off on my pillows or clothes like everyone else has experienced and I didn&#x27;t put a clear gloss over it either.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend putting Vaseline or coconut oil around your hair line and on your ears and neck.  I did around my hair line and ears and they didn&#x27;t stain when washed off.  For places that did stain my skin i used a makeup remover wipe and it took it right off. I have a white sink so when I washed it out my sink turned purple and nothing worked until I poured on some stuff from Dollar General called \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; on it.  Its in a half gallon jug and a yellow liquid and it took the purple stains off everything with hardly any scrubbing!</li>
            <li> Aweome staying power!</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;not true to color, washes all out, rubs off on everything&lt;br /&gt;VERY DEFECTIVE!!&lt;br /&gt;Terrible customer service.</li>
            <li> So far, of the Pravana colors I&#x27;ve tried (blue, magenta and this), this one runs the most. I love the way it looks on my hair but it&#x27;s left the most stains on towels, tubs, skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> great hair color, the only downside is that it stains. the first week I colored my hair it got all over my pillows when I slept, all down my back when I was out in the sun, and all over the shoulders of whatever clothes I was wearing. other than that, hands down one of the best purple colors I&#x27;ve used on my hair. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Beatuiful purple !! but recommend for people that are willing to bleach there hair or blondes, my roots did not take but my bleached hair did!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I&#x27;ve first applied it and the color is still as vibrant today as the first day. I am definitely going to order it again!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I heard so many great things about Pravana Violet so I was so excited to try it but once I did It didn&#x27;t come out the way I was expecting it to and it kinda had an orangy tint to it. Idk why. :(&lt;br /&gt;It made me so sad and I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair because I know it&#x27;s gonna fade completely. I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. great product!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty color, seems to stay in very well too. My hair was bleached before and it&#x27;s kept it&#x27;s color for a while now. It does stain EVERYTHING but that&#x27;s to be expected. No harsh smell or anything. I plan on dying all of my hair this color because it&#x27;s just that pretty. The purple really stands out against black hair. Will continue to buy this color and brand for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This is thee most beautiful violet hair dye I have ever used. Being an Asian with almost jet black hair, yet curly, my hair is pretty difficult to color. I fell in love with purple hair for years, but couldn&#x27;t achieve it for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried Splat, Manic Panic, Raw, and Special Effects. Of course, I had to bleach my hair before I used any of these products and it was terrible. My hair texture was horrible and it took years to have it back. I was tired of the process for purple hair and I was about to give up, until I found this lovely product! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Special Effects in Deep Purple, but it didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted (two weeks). I promised myself to never bleach my hair again and I didn&#x27;t have to in order to achieve the violet hair I love with this product! Before I applied this dye, my hair was a light brown. My hair is pretty long, almost to my waist, so I used two tubes. After I washed it off, I immediately saw the color and fell in love. This hair dye lasted for TWO MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: this dye stains EVERYTHING. It&#x27;ll get on towels, your tub, clothes, etc. So be aware when you use this product. I had to cover my pillow with a black shirt/towel and wear dark clothes for at least a week, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Longest-lasting &amp;#34;weird colored&amp;#34; dye I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely better and less maintenance than Manic Panic or Directions. I plan on switiching to emerald in the next few months and can&#x27;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution though: Get dark pillowcases for sleeping or wear your hair up when sleeping. The purple will rub off on other things the first little while after dying. Not for the faint of heart!</li>
            <li> Great color.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye (I have ordered it before) although this time I have still not received my product. It is about 2 weeks late.</li>
            <li> lasted better then Manic Panic and Kiss. would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok semi permanent dye. Definitely better than manic panic as it doesn&#x27;t fade into weird colors but it does fade really fast on my hair. The color is absolutely gorgeous for about a week then starts fading to a magenta/lavender color. I bought the violet color. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love how much pigmented the violet is, you can also dilute it with conditioner and make a more lighter pastel color.</li>
            <li> 5-STARS for the first 2 weeks. After that, it fades to blue (which is also pretty), then green (not so pretty, but kind of cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pre-treat hair with the Pravana demi-permanent serum before coloring&lt;br /&gt;2. Use smock, gloves and Vaseline along hairline to prevent staining&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash hair 2-3 times per week max with the recommended Pravana Shampoo and Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4. I add some Violet color to the Conditioner (I use a plastic VOSS water bottle for the mixture)&lt;br /&gt;5. Wash hair in cold water: I use the shower in my tub. I partially fill the tub with hot water (just past my ankles to keep my feet warm), then wash my hair in cold water. Aside from keeping me warm, the tub being partially filled prevents the color from staining the floor/sides of tub.&lt;br /&gt;6. Rinse any stains in tub/shower IMMEDIATELY (or it sets).</li>
            <li> Love it! I received so many compliments as my hair is ombre black on top and violet the lower half. Previously it was ombre blond so it was easy for this color to take. I have to wash my hair every day, so this color stays in for a good 3 weeks, before I have to redye again, but even then the &amp;#34;washed out&amp;#34; violet still looks good! It definitely will temporary stain your shower so bleach/scrub it right away and if you go to bed with a wet hair, be warned it will stain your pillow case for the next few days so avoid white or any light color pillow case or clothing if your hair is wet,within the first few days after dying it.</li>
            <li> I used this for doing pastel purple on my silver toned hair. It worked to an extent, but I didn&#x27;t apply it evenly and I got a little bit of patchy color (My fault). But the purple even heavily diluted gave out a very vibrant purple pigment so I am so far happy with it! This is a very good hair dye, and I would recommend it, just be cautious when applying to get it even(especially with pastels)</li>
            <li> The BEST purple dye EVER!!! I used Special Effects Deep purple for about a year until it was sold out everywhere so I switched to Pravana and won&#x27;t go back, the color lasts a good month or more before it starts to fade, my hair basilcy grew out before the color faded. Its amazing. BUT it stains everything, I now have purple towels, pillow cases and bath tub!</li>
            <li> Great product, love the color it provides. Recommend its used for bright and successful hair color.  Have gotten many compliments on the color I used.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color - stays better than any of the other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;Have to bleach and then process but ooooohh what a look!</li>
            <li> Fantastic color. Will stain you like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Purple, but not as purple as I hoped. My hair color didn&#x27;t help the equation so I&#x27;ll lighten next time.</li>
            <li> Best color. Looks better with every wash and two months later I&#x27;m still getting multiple compliments every day</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the seller - item arrived quickly and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I have only tried to colour a strand over my already dark hair and it washed out immediately, but that was to be expected. I have yet to bleach and use the rest of the colour but will update my review when I do!</li>
            <li> It came out exactly how i wanted it ! I added a picture with a description as well. I used 2 tubes very carefully ! As i was washing the color out it turned my entire sink purple but it was nothing a little bleach couldnt handle (it cleans up very easily compared to come other color brands i&#x27;ve used ) I didnt use hair bleach or stripper on my hair to begin with though i prefer a subtle  color so in my opinion it came out perfectly.  This is a stain not a dye, you dont use developer from what the box says, the tubes are pretty large.. i have 22&amp;#34; hair and i only needed 2! Great shipping and great price !  I fully recommend this.</li>
            <li> The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  I use this and the Wild Orchid color to create an ombre in my hair.  The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  I will keep repurchasing.  This DOES stain your shower temporarily during the first few washes and will stain bedding and fingertips until it settles (as with most unnatural colors).  I have found the products that &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; the most last the longest, which is ironic.  But yes, this color is awesome, as long as you don&#x27;t mind your shower looking like where barney was murdered for a few days.</li>
            <li> This color is true to its shade as pictured online, shows up ultra-rich even in non-lightened hair. The only drawback is how quickly it fades, even using color-protecting shampoo. It&#x27;s not too much trouble to touch it up every now and then, though.</li>
            <li> Best dye I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but you kind of have to play with it a little if you haven&#x27;t had experience with it. It took me a couple tries to get the perfect color. I had blonde hair with darker roots, I mixed with conditioner because I didn&#x27;t want it super dark, but I used too much conditioner. So I used less &amp; it was beautiful, but my roots didn&#x27;t take at all. So then I did a root retouch with it &amp; left it on for about 45 mins to make sure the roots would absorb it. It did &amp; now it&#x27;s beautiful. WARNING, this stuff stained my shower &amp; I had to spend all night scrubbing it out. So my suggestion is rinse &amp; shampoo your hair in your kitchen sink, it won&#x27;t stain the metal. I would suggest doing that for the first 2-3 shampoos after coloring with this stuff. I&#x27;m excited to try the other colors in the future :) I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. Also, the lighter you bleach your hair, the more vibrant it will be. My blonde was about a level 9, &amp; the purple came out so vibrant it looks unreal! I love it :)</li>
            <li> Very vibrant, but pretty temporary</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I now have violet hair and love it. It fades to a new exciting color every time I was it. I will use this again.</li>
            <li> Extremely vivid. Would purchase again! They were put in Micro loop extensions and they looked great! It does bleed a lot, even after you wash out the initial color dye.</li>
            <li> Love love love this hair color. Yes, it stains everything when you are coloring your hair. Make sure you use gloves for washing your hair afterwards also. Color comes out a lot in the shower, but if you use a sulfate free shampoo or like me, I use Wen..The color lasts forever. This is the only hair color that seems to last the longest!  And I didn&#x27;t even have to bleach my hair! I have dark brown hair. It is a dark purple and subtle indoors, but outside it is so vibrant!  I love it!</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS DARK BROWN AND THE BOX SAYS TO LEAVE IT IN FOR 20 MIN. I DID AND IT WASHED RIGHT OUT OF MY HAIR!! MY FRIENDS ALSO USE THIS COLOR/BRAND AND TOLD ME TO LEAVE IT IN FOR 2 HOURS, I DID AND IT WORKED! I LOVE THE COLOR IT&#x27;S NOTICEABLE IN OR OUTSIDE. IT&#x27;S MORE OF A PLUM COLOR SO IF YOU ARE GOING FOR THE LOUD PURPLE AND HAVE DARK HAIR I SUGGEST 1 - 1 1/2hours MAX!</li>
            <li> First off -- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting the tube of color straight onto your hair. I&#x27;ve heard that makes it harder to bleach out when you&#x27;re ready for a change. I mixed the violet with some conditioner (just cheap conditioner) to tone it down, but also make a bit more volume so I wouldn&#x27;t use as much from the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came out a really pretty purple. I love it. I decided to bleach a few strips of hair about a month later just to add dimension (my whole head was purple). I mixed 30 volume creme developer and blue bleach, it was on for about 15-20 minutes, and my hair was white where the bleach was. And I think it was that easy to lift because I mixed the violet with conditioner prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that -- no problems at all! I&#x27;ll try to upload a picture if I can figure it out haha.</li>
            <li> I tried some lame brand from sallys to get a plum and turn a ugly red color which faded nasty.  I then tried this which I should of in the first place and my hair came out so beautiful it did get dark like a dark plum but in the sun it looks so pretty. It does bleed and stain your neck and everything but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So glad to get this for a good price. And my hair turned out great!</li>
            <li> Perfect purple! Fades out to a magenta so it looks really rad. Buy some!</li>
            <li> You need to bleach dark hair to get the biggest bang out of this color, but the end result is worth it. Bright, beautiful color that doesn&#x27;t fade quickly. Don&#x27;t use pillow cases or wear shirts you care about until you&#x27;ve shampooed a couple of times - the color takes a few days to stop rubbing off. But having gorgeous purple hair is worth a few smudged pillow cases and collars.</li>
            <li> Smells delightful, but don&#x27;t leave on too long! This stuff is potent and will look black if you exceed a reasonable processing time.</li>
            <li> Not as great as special effects. VERY dark purple at first. Doesn&#x27;t fade to any nice color like some others will. Has odd texture that I didn&#x27;t find spread very well. Stains everything way worse than other dyes do, but doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair as well. I have been dying a large section of my hair purple for the past six years, I won&#x27;t be using this dye again.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair you will want to bleach it. The color in the picture is exactly what you get on bleached out hair. Yes, it is messy and it will fade out. But because it needs no developer you can touch it up easily. I generally leave my color on for at least 6-12 hours. The longer the better. I just cover it with a cap and sleep with it on. I only use mine as highlights so I think it is not as messy as an all over color job would be. Plus I have short hair. Have fun!</li>
            <li> I have been using a different brand (Joico Vero K-Pack Indigo) for years, and thought I would try the Pravana Chromasilk Vivids in Violet. It was very dark, almost an eggplant purple. It rubbed off on everything for months, and never stopped. It stained my nail polish when I shampooed my hair. The nape of my neck and around my ears were permanently purple. I don&#x27;t even want to talk about stains on clothes or bedding. It rubbed off everywhere my head touched the pillow and faded badly in those places, leaving me with unattractive bleached out areas on the sides of my head. I just got my hair redone with the Joico, and after the first shampoo, nothing rubs off or continues to stain. I can&#x27;t recommend this hair color to anyone.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this color, it turned out a lot more of a pink like tone than the blue-purple I would expect from a &amp;#34;Violet&amp;#34; color. When I was not pleased with the color I had put some ultra violet manic panic (that I had already had) over my hair that I had just dyed the night prior with this dye and I received the color I was looking for. Unfortunately the color almost completely faded out from one wash with color safe products and very little sun. I am very sure that it faded because I had put another color over it, because my roots were still pinkish, and the parts of my hair which saw less sunlight were also less faded. But over all I was dissatisfied with this product after all of the hype I had heard about this dye lasting a very long time.</li>
            <li> This dye is some great stuff.  Finding permanent purple dye was a struggle.  This stays vibrant for MONTHS, no joke.  Yes, it washes out every wash (if you have a white shower, beware), but not like you&#x27;d think.  I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic, and that dye actually does wash out.  This stuff is so powerful it really sticks, so when you shampoo, your water/suds will take some color with it, but only when you shampoo.  If your hair just gets wet, it doesn&#x27;t bleed.  Since this is just dye, you need to pre-treat your hair/bleach/lighten, THEN use the dye.  This isn&#x27;t a typical color that you mix with developer and let sit.  What&#x27;s good about that is that you can leave this in for as long as you want.  I left it in for 4 hours, and my hair stylist said I could leave it as long as a day if I wanted.  Like I said, it is powerful stuff so it dyes whatever it touches, therefore, watch out when you are using it.  Bleach cleaner does take it out of just about every surface I&#x27;ve gotten it on, and it has washed out of clothes if washed promptly.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would never choose any other dye to color my hair purple.  I&#x27;ve tried others and Pravana is a CLEAR winner.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair. I didn&#x27;t want to bleach because I&#x27;m terrified of frying my hair. I decided to just do it as is and it worked! It is a dark purple BUT that is just how I wanted it. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The original color is beautiful,  and mixing with other colors is great but it fades quickly and turns into a strange pastel blue color in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color looks good with blondes,  brunettes and other funky colors,  it&#x27;s a great color.</li>
            <li> Great product, my favorite! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my pravana vivids violet hair dye until I got it and it was poorly packaged and exploded inside the package so when I opened it I got hair dye every where so I took a picture and showed the seller and they sent me a new one but it also came exploded so I told them and told them I didn&#x27;t want another replacement and would like a refund so they asked me to send back the damaged tubes but I threw them away like a normal person because they were exploded. So now I&#x27;m out my money and my hair dye.</li>
            <li> This hari color is the best I have found. It is true to color and tends to last longer than others I have tried. Very beautiful purple too.</li>
            <li> I mixed wild orchid and violet to put on top of highlights. I have dark brown hair and love touches of purple. Love the color, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me. I can&#x27;t go long without washing my hair, so I think I end up washing it all out. (I wash my hair about every-other-day.) I hear that it lasts longer if you can stretch the time between shampoos and use cold water, neither of which I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Messy to apply, but worth the effort if you can make the color last. Also didn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, just b/c I don&#x27;t like the upkeep. I had to re-color my highlights about every 8-10 days. Wish someone would make a permanent hair dye in these vivid colors.</li>
            <li> The best purple there is! I get so many compliments on this color! I use it all the time !</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Costed service is also as fast to help or. I had order two tubes but was only sent one. So I sent an email and in two days the second tube was at my apartment. The color is amazing! I had it done at a salon because I read it stains everything and man, is that true. I out the color on too of a lighter brown. Indoors it looks black unless you&#x27;re up close. Outdoors my hair is this vibrant purple and it&#x27;s just lovely. It did make my hair a little stiff but nothing deep conditioning can&#x27;t help with!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Color is really dark.. It stained everything even after I washed it 3 times.. Drove me crazy.. Not too happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had used some other brand originally an it faded in one week. My cousin, who is licensed, recommended pravana violet because it was vivid and had a great color. When I colored my hair, it stained everything it touched. My ears were purple, my neck, my fingers, my back, even my feet. When I rinsed the color, it stained my entire shower. My bathtub was purple and even the walls of my shower. I had to bleach my bathroom to get rid of it. However, I also had to bleach the tub every time I took a shower after that, because it rinsed out and would stain the bathtub every time. It&#x27;s been a month since I colored my hair and now the hair around my hairline is faded. I can see the blonde from having to bleach my hair before coloring it the first time. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all and hope that others don&#x27;t go through the stress I have endured due to my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not hold in my hair for more than 2 weeks... Washed out just like manic panic does..</li>
            <li> So amazing Love it the color mix with orchid just a nice combination.ordering more but you can measure the colors that you need and going to use if not save it for next time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BeautyQueen</li>
            <li> makes a mess! be sure to wear gloves for the application as well as first few shampoos! it will stain your body!</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying the Pastel Lavender Pravana when you can just use a few drops of this in a huge blob of conditioner to get the same Lavender results at a fraction of the cost! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love this color!  I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for! It was very dark and hardly notieable at first, probably because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair all the way to the recommended level, but when it finally did start fading, (it took several weeks!) it showed up brilliantly, especially in sunlight. It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great so it wasn&#x27;t too bright for work. Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintained the color for a while by mixing small amounts of the dye with white conditioner and using that while in the shower, letting the conditioner sit while I did my shaving and other washing. Use gloves or else it will stain your hands! I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST. I will be using this product again, and I have plenty of leftover dye. I only dyed pieces in the bottom layers of my medium length hair, and I still have 3/4 of each tube left, even after making the colored conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I mix half and half with the Pravana &amp;#34;wild orchid&amp;#34; and it comes out a gorgeous shade of warm purple. This violet alone is also beautiful, but a cooler, bluer purple. Great staying power for a semipermanent dye. Wear double gloves, because if it gets through to your skin, you&#x27;ll have purple fingertips for days (ruins the fun a little). Also, seriously cover everything around where you&#x27;ll be coloring, and expect that your bathtub WILL be purple. If you&#x27;re ok with that, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best purple there ever is. Will not buy anything else other than Pravana!</li>
            <li> Same great quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Pravana when purchased from the professional beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li> I adore this color!!! I bleached before coloring to an orange blonde then mixed pravana with conditioner. I used an entire tube, but next time I think I&#x27;ll only use half. I have very thick long hair and I had more than enough to color. The results are just what I wanted! A beautiful rich purple! I&#x27;ve had tons of people ask me what color I used. It&#x27;s been over two weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed very little fading. Only downside is, it stains everything!! My shower, sink, towels and pillowcases are all purple! It also bleeds a lot when you shampoo, it looks like grape juice! Besides that I would absolutely recommend! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. It lasts a long time. Love it.</li>
            <li> The rich color lasts for a while! Very happy.</li>
