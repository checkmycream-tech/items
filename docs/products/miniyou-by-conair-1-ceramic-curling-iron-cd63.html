            <li>I was incredibly impressed at how well this product performed just like my full sized curling iron of what is supposedly a better brand.</li>

            <li>Heats up quick, and produces good results, I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>However, I am thrilled with the item.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need someone teach me how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>I really it, I travel a lot and his size is perfect to travel !</li>

            <li>It provides good heat and is so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Great size and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>The heatproof case was also very handy as you didn&#x27;t have to wait for the iron to cool before packing it away.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect size to keep in my desk at work for those unexpected meeting or presentations.  </li>
            <li>The pros are that it is very basic, heats up quickly, is a great travel size, the price is great, and I liked the length of the cord considering</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap, so</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is below my shoulder blades and had no problems creating nice beachy waves.  </li>
            <li>but luckily the greeks were very very happy to sell me a new one!)  </li>
            <li>Very compact and has a great storage pouch.  </li>

            <li>We are leaving for vacation soon, and I intend to take it with us, it will make packing a lot easier. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i love this product&lt;br /&gt;cheap</li>
            <li>After researching many blogs and Amazon reviews, I decided that this would be cheaper and more convenient.  </li>
            <li>Cute as a button.  </li>
            <li>Better than the one I&#x27;ve been using at home.  </li>
            <li>as many reviews have mentioned so</li>
            <li>perfect for human hair wigs</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s probably better than the zippered one pictured.</li>
            <li>Bought this curling iron 3yrs ago and still love it.</li>
            <li>Love the compact size fits in my bathroom cabinet and my purse if needed.</li>
            <li>It is a great size, and heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dual-voltage and really compact, so it&#x27;s great for travel or carrying in your purse for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it and was okay after that.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in more thicknesses.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>This is ok for travel.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe not the best thing for long hair, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy this iron very cheaply and use with an adaptor that i also bought on Amazon cheaply that could be used for all of my electronics as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Space was limited so this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>so I wanted a mini dryer and curing iron and this is perfect for the days that I don&#x27;t want to leave my hair wet and</li>
            <li>I can fix more curls and control the direction better than I can with a full size.</li>
            <li>love how compact this little bugger is but still get great results!!</li>
            <li>This cute little curling iron is perfect for traveling!  </li>
            <li>The arthritis in my hands was not bothered by this as the clamp is easy to control.  </li>
            <li>to use and easy to carry</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li>Does the job and easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to confuse the on/off switch with the lever-opener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too easy so use</li>
            <li>It gets good and hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works better that my full size curling iron</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waist length hair rolled up fine</li>
            <li>Again, I have hair that falls about 3inches below my shoulders, is fine</li>
            <li>But great for traveling and gets hot fast too.  </li>
            <li>super cute and portable.</li>
            <li>This little guy is great for traveling!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the mini hair straightener, so thought I&#x27;d add to my travel selection.</li>
            <li>The heat proof bag it comes with is a huge time savor.</li>
            <li>I took this on a recent backpacking trip over seas and it worked out GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Took it on recent vacation and it worked great as a compact.</li>
            <li>Compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>It heats p really fast and stays warm.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair, but I really only needed something to curl my bangs a bit, so this works great.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I have used it&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Bought this to fit in my carryon and it fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I can go from a ponytail to a full head of perfect curls in less than 10 minutes,</li>
            <li>The price was right, but there were so many inherent flaws, it was just not useable.</li>
            <li>The case is a nice added bonus when you have to get ready and pack up and go in the morning, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting it cool off before stuffing it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I have full, fine hair</li>
            <li>Might be okay for someone with very fine hair, or to keep at the office for unexpected client meeting touch ups.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the convenience!</li>
            <li>If your hair is shoulder-length or shorter, or if you want to use it to touch up your bangs, it&#x27;s great - and might even be good enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Although this mini curling iron is very cute and compact making it perfect for traveling or having less cluttered drawers and counters, realistically this product does NOT function properly.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with its heat level, and while it does of course take me longer to curl my hair simply because of the need to make two curls where a longer curling iron would make one, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li>result somehow is better then the large one I use at home.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be able to curl large locks of hair...</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool</li>
            <li>Good use if you have short hair and not a lot to cure.</li>
            <li>It was true.  </li>
            <li>the designs are cool and fashionable too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s making good curls with a spray it will last hours and hours</li>
            <li>Home - good for a touch up only.  </li>
            <li>True,</li>
            <li>I bought these to take on vacations when I travel as I didn&#x27;t want to bring my full set of hair products</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s compact, so it travels well and is easy to store at home.</li>
            <li>It heats well and is pretty easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel or even taking along in my big purse for special events like my upcomping Vegas wedding before the big wedding in the spring.</li>
            <li>VERY SMALL, GREAT FOR TRAVELING!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, works well</li>
            <li>Personally, I found this product perfect for my needs of occasional use.  </li>
            <li>With care, it can be done, and the tip on the end is adequate to hold and not burn your fingers as you curl.     </li>
            <li>Creates curls quickly or just smooths out your hair if you don&#x27;t want a lot of curl.</li>
            <li>so if I need a quick fix, I have this.</li>
            <li>it curled quickly</li>
            <li>It heats quickly too - just seconds.  </li>
            <li>and I can touch up quickly just where I need it.</li>
            <li>you could carry it in your purse for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>Cools off quickly so I can do my hair, pack up and go.</li>
            <li>Gets very, very, hot.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the small size I thought would be ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li>I saved between this and a full size model to be worth it on vacation.  </li>
            <li>It is very compact, lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It worked fabulously, heats up quickly, and gets the job done better than my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>best thing for short or long hair!!</li>
            <li>I have very thick and curly hair, so I have experienced ones that were better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useful for times like that...</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I just leave it right in my suitcase with my travel adaptors so its always ready to go!!</li>
            <li>Small, lightweight, fast to heat up, easy to use and great results.  </li>
            <li>Gets super hot, so watch your fingers.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron gets hot quickly</li>
            <li>It may heat up pretty quick, but allows no control whatsoever over the temp.</li>
            <li>It got super hot</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>, that didn&#x27;t even stay in the iron, slipped right out.  </li>
            <li>but the clamp wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold my fine hair - which just slipped right off the barrel.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty item in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little curling iron, although I will keep it strictly for travel as it needs more care using it than a regular sized one.</li>
            <li>Small but great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for short or very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is very compact, quick to heat up and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Just right for travel and making quick curls in my daughters&#x27; bangs or adding a few ringlets to my own.</li>
            <li>I bought this miniature iron to take back to Asia with me from America, and it works well although it gets very hot very quickly, and seemed to scorch my hair a bit if I let it go too</li>
            <li>I needed a small heat tool for workday touchups, and I am in love with this one :)</li>
            <li>First thing to mention is that the case that was included with this item was not the one pictured.</li>
            <li>I have not had any issue with the tip being too hot</li>
            <li>You do have to be cautious of burns, mostly because you are used to having the larger iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li>okay enough for travel</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to spend a bit more time on your hair than if you were to use a regular size curling iron</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping for a carrying case as  I received  with my first  Mini  Conar.  </li>
            <li>The iron&#x27;s built in stand will not keep it sitting in place on your counter, but it will roll to the side, so be carefull where you place it when curling, as the iron gets pretty hot.    </li>
            <li>and it does get hot.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to accidentally touch the hot ceramic.</li>
            <li>I tossed it away after the first use.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, so I adjust the length of time in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to do hair&lt;br /&gt;Too hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sufficient for the occasional curl (which is all I need it for!), but if you need a more frequent and comfortable travel curler, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>For those who said it gets too hot, you&#x27;re not using it every day</li>
            <li>this little sweetie fits perfectly in my purse, heats up &amp; cools down quickly, and comes with a storage bag.</li>
            <li>Some reviews on this were quite negative as well as positive, so I decided to order anyway and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly and easy to use on long hair.</li>
            <li>Third, it has 2 great little legs that allow me to leave it sit on the bathroom counter to cool off without harm.</li>
            <li>It is very small which makes it great in the suitcase</li>
            <li>getting too hot that it burns my hair, but it does get pretty hot and fast.  </li>
            <li>Cute and small, took this on a trip; easy to pack and gets quite hot.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, though, plan to spend a lot more time curling it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I did burn my fingers the first time - there isn&#x27;t much to hold onto at the end -</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for your travels as it is very small but does the job for a great price!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as a full-sized model and it often pulls my hair (I think because it is so small your hairs end up closer to the clamp part).</li>
            <li>I think this iron would be best for short to shortish medium hair due to the short curling area.  </li>
            <li>curly I can now blow dry it out and still curl it for the more polish nigh out when I want</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have large hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who travels frequently as it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li>This little travel curler is good enough for a quick fix, but you would not want to do your whole head of hair with it at home.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I found that is curls fast and holds well</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and presented.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap enough to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>Since it would have cost me almost as much to return it as it did to buy it, I donated it to a charity.</li>
            <li>and I am really satisfy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very compact, but does the job.  </li>
            <li>Did not want it to take up too much room, and it does not.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li>It heats up instantly and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>but if using it at home, it&#x27;s not very advisable as a longer curling thong would be better for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I  really like it,  </li>
            <li>keep one with my travel items, ready to go on a trip.  </li>
            <li>also it heat really fast,</li>
            <li>people really should buy it if they always travel around.</li>
            <li>The fact that it has a thermal sleeve is also very convenient.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to wrap your hair because you have to be careful to keep it on the barrel, and then there&#x27;s more danger of overheating the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the hair box</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really worry about the lack of heat setting.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the travel case.  </li>
            <li>There is a really just an on/off button.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it fits nicely in your pocketbooks ladies and it come in a few colors.</li>
            <li>The barrel is just a little short, otherwise very nice to carry in luggage.</li>
            <li>keeps the hot part of the iron inside, while the cord is neatly contained outside with an elastic band and not exposed to the hot barrel if you have to pack it right</li>
            <li>the ceramic coating does a better curling job than other curling irons that&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If I used one more frequently then I would go with a full size heavy duty curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Could not capture my hair which is long and fine around the shaft.  </li>
            <li>and it was great for such a small item it can be a work horse.</li>
            <li>do-er, so those of you who are more advanced curling iron users you may not have the same issue, but I found this little guy virtually unusable.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to burn your hand because the barrel is so short, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li>Nice small size</li>
            <li>The built-in temperature is a bit higher than I normally use (I have fine hair), but I just keep my hair in it for a shorter period of time than with my other irons.  </li>
            <li>liked that it has no voltage switch...who wants to think that hard about which voltage setting to use a on vacation or for a business trip for that matter?  </li>
            <li>(For some previous irons, I had to get a silicone heat pad to protect the counter top until they cooled.)</li>
            <li>It left a lot more room in my suitcase to bring back presents for ME.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I think that most people will only use this on vacation/travel so it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sorry to have to send it back because it would have been perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even do it that quickly with my regular iron at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually, I think it is a good product, but my hair is not fit on it.</li>
            <li>This is a decent travel curling iron.</li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot and is tiny.</li>
            <li>so if you have super long hair maybe not the thing for you, but it literally takes up as much space as a pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is great, heats up quickly and works just as well as my larger curling iron at home at less than half the size.</li>
            <li>It is small, light and get&#x27;s very hot.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use my own curling irons, irons, blow dryers and other heat appliance in Europe, I would have needed a current converter (sp?).  </li>
            <li>I do agree with some other reviews about how it would be nice to have an extra inch on the barrel.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it may heat up faster than my large professional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Just too small and very easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>It came with a cute little travel case too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely little size for travel, however.  </li>
            <li>Second, it heats up fast and works well, having a nice little tip on the end to hold onto and avoid burns.</li>
            <li>, I have horribly difficult hair, so it&#x27;s a great \\&quot;secret\\&quot; weapon for me to have.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve done that on normal sized curling irons as well.  </li>
            <li>I am more concerned that it does not shut off by itself if left alone too long.  </li>
            <li>Even with my fine hair, the heat does not cause damage due to the ceramic barrel.</li>
            <li>small, works, not expensive, easy to use,</li>
            <li>I should point out that I only use the curling iron for getting my bangs to hang right.</li>
            <li>Although itheats fast, you can&#x27;t put it away hot on the pouch like it&#x27;s sister the flat iron.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think the tiny barrel would make it harder to curl big sections, but it&#x27;s SO fast and makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li>I was going on an extended trip through Europe and wanted a light iron, so I trusted the other reviews.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can mention is that because the barrel is shorter, it did take me a little longer to style my hair and it might not be great for someone with very long hair.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be careful, but as it heats up so fast, just plug it in, use it and unplug it right away</li>
            <li>This little curling iron does everything my full size one does!  </li>
            <li>/lap tops are probably already dual voltage and you will only need an adaptor (check first though -  </li>
            <li>Yes, it gets plenty hot - just too short to manage without a lot of practice.</li>
            <li>Burnt my finger, there is no safty grip, only one setting which is way to hot.  </li>
            <li>There is no temperature setting, but I don&#x27;t find that too much of a problem since I rarely change the setting on my other curling irons.</li>
            <li>Of course I had to do smaller amounts of hair at a time, but it was so hot</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, and small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>one caution, the plastic tip is very small so it is easy to grab the hot part instead of the plastic.</li>
            <li>The heated part is so small that you can&#x27;t fit much hair in it without it getting snagged.</li>
            <li>Great for newer short hair styles especially for adding a few loose curls in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>(right product must also be a consideration) and that hair did not fall loose between the barrel and the clamp.  </li>
            <li>,even though the price was great and I didn&#x27;t have to go out shopping for this, has no case, so disappointing.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it</li>
            <li>You need a lil time to used to but the Conair CD63RR MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Red, 1 Inch works really well</li>
            <li>This curling iron surprised me with its muscle power.  </li>
            <li>This only curled the tips but not the body of my hair very well.</li>
            <li>The barrel is very short and would be too much work to use every day at home.  </li>
            <li>It is true that it does take a bit longer to curl than when using a larger iron, but not so long that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to purchase for travel.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot of time to cool down..</li>
            <li>I love the small size but you cannot adjust the heat hence your hair can cook!</li>
            <li>Be sure to pack it well as mine did dent due to my clumsey packing - and the rough handling of the airlines.</li>
            <li>Not what I wanted (I really like the pouch that comes with the travel flat iron)</li>
            <li>It is also really small and was fine for travel</li>
            <li>and it is so tiny you can&#x27;t get more than a small pinch of hair in it.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I need it for travelling as it is small and light and also compact...</li>
            <li>Did not grab as much hair, and took a long time to curl.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on everyday use,  I would suggest going with a full sized curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical that it would perform as good as my larger one, but it&#x27;s a champ!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the little bit of space</li>
            <li>The size is really small enough to bring, but I still cannot use it smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is important to take extra care when using because the size and small opening clamp can make it akward and therefore easier to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Must exert caution as the potential to burn fingers occurs frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve encountered is the too  small &#x27;cool tip.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>The manufacturers apparently have listened to past comments because it now has a cool tip to hold onto at the point of the heated section.  </li>
            <li>A bit hard to hold given the short barrel, and easy to burn yourself,until you get used to how to handle it.</li>
            <li>The tip is small, so it&#x27;s easy to miss it and burn your fingers when trying to grab the end of the iron, especially when you&#x27;re curling hair on the back of your head.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Conair Ceramic Curling Iron last year for a trip to China.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly due to the dual voltage feature.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully...heated up quickly, and it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li>Fits in small purse, heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t scorch hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the lever/clamp would not open far enough to get my hair in and around the barrell.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast but be careful because it only has one setting</li>
            <li>No heat adjustment though, so it does get a little hot.</li>
            <li>Our Hotel rented them but said that they were always out and recommended I bring my own converter (expensive and large and heavy)</li>
            <li>Bought this because I needed a super small travel curling iron for a trip to Albania where I was only bringing one suitcase for three weeks.</li>
            <li>I have a light weight silicone mesh glove that I sometimes use on the left hand because the tip of the curling iron is very small</li>
            <li>I have to admit - it does roll and is very close to the surface when you lay it down.  </li>
            <li>Heat up in seconds, cools down fast.</li>
            <li>This is a darling little curling iron and it works really well for short hair.</li>
            <li>Just did a trial run at home, but will pack it in my suitcase along with my regular curling iron, and give the little guy a real trial run.  </li>

            <li> Cute as a button.  </li>
            <li> Better than the one I&#x27;ve been using at home.  </li>
            <li> as many reviews have mentioned so</li>
            <li> perfect for human hair wigs</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s probably better than the zippered one pictured.</li>

            <li> but I got the hang of it and was okay after that.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in more thicknesses.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> This is ok for travel.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best thing for long hair, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this iron very cheaply and use with an adaptor that i also bought on Amazon cheaply that could be used for all of my electronics as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Space was limited so this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a mini dryer and curing iron and this is perfect for the days that I don&#x27;t want to leave my hair wet and</li>
            <li> I can fix more curls and control the direction better than I can with a full size.</li>
            <li> love how compact this little bugger is but still get great results!!</li>
            <li> This cute little curling iron is perfect for traveling!  </li>
            <li> The arthritis in my hands was not bothered by this as the clamp is easy to control.  </li>
            <li> to use and easy to carry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>

            <li> Does the job and easy to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to confuse the on/off switch with the lever-opener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too easy so use</li>
            <li> It gets good and hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works better that my full size curling iron</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waist length hair rolled up fine</li>
            <li> Again, I have hair that falls about 3inches below my shoulders, is fine</li>
            <li> But great for traveling and gets hot fast too.  </li>
            <li> super cute and portable.</li>
            <li> This little guy is great for traveling!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the mini hair straightener, so thought I&#x27;d add to my travel selection.</li>
            <li> The heat proof bag it comes with is a huge time savor.</li>
            <li> I took this on a recent backpacking trip over seas and it worked out GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Took it on recent vacation and it worked great as a compact.</li>
            <li> Compact and light weight.</li>
            <li> It heats p really fast and stays warm.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, but I really only needed something to curl my bangs a bit, so this works great.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I have used it&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Bought this to fit in my carryon and it fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I can go from a ponytail to a full head of perfect curls in less than 10 minutes,</li>
            <li> The price was right, but there were so many inherent flaws, it was just not useable.</li>
            <li> The case is a nice added bonus when you have to get ready and pack up and go in the morning, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting it cool off before stuffing it in your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> I have full, fine hair</li>
            <li> Might be okay for someone with very fine hair, or to keep at the office for unexpected client meeting touch ups.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for the convenience!</li>
            <li> If your hair is shoulder-length or shorter, or if you want to use it to touch up your bangs, it&#x27;s great - and might even be good enough for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Although this mini curling iron is very cute and compact making it perfect for traveling or having less cluttered drawers and counters, realistically this product does NOT function properly.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with its heat level, and while it does of course take me longer to curl my hair simply because of the need to make two curls where a longer curling iron would make one, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> result somehow is better then the large one I use at home.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be able to curl large locks of hair...</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool</li>
            <li> Good use if you have short hair and not a lot to cure.</li>
            <li> It was true.  </li>
            <li> the designs are cool and fashionable too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s making good curls with a spray it will last hours and hours</li>
            <li> Home - good for a touch up only.  </li>
            <li> True,</li>
            <li> I bought these to take on vacations when I travel as I didn&#x27;t want to bring my full set of hair products</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s compact, so it travels well and is easy to store at home.</li>
            <li> It heats well and is pretty easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or even taking along in my big purse for special events like my upcomping Vegas wedding before the big wedding in the spring.</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL, GREAT FOR TRAVELING!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, works well</li>
            <li> Personally, I found this product perfect for my needs of occasional use.  </li>
            <li> With care, it can be done, and the tip on the end is adequate to hold and not burn your fingers as you curl.     </li>
            <li> Creates curls quickly or just smooths out your hair if you don&#x27;t want a lot of curl.</li>
            <li> so if I need a quick fix, I have this.</li>
            <li> it curled quickly</li>
            <li> It heats quickly too - just seconds.  </li>
            <li> and I can touch up quickly just where I need it.</li>
            <li> you could carry it in your purse for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Cools off quickly so I can do my hair, pack up and go.</li>
            <li> Gets very, very, hot.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the small size I thought would be ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> I saved between this and a full size model to be worth it on vacation.  </li>
            <li> It is very compact, lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It worked fabulously, heats up quickly, and gets the job done better than my regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> best thing for short or long hair!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair, so I have experienced ones that were better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful for times like that...</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I just leave it right in my suitcase with my travel adaptors so its always ready to go!!</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, fast to heat up, easy to use and great results.  </li>
            <li> Gets super hot, so watch your fingers.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot quickly</li>
            <li> It may heat up pretty quick, but allows no control whatsoever over the temp.</li>
            <li> It got super hot</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> , that didn&#x27;t even stay in the iron, slipped right out.  </li>
            <li> but the clamp wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold my fine hair - which just slipped right off the barrel.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty item in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little curling iron, although I will keep it strictly for travel as it needs more care using it than a regular sized one.</li>
            <li> Small but great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for short or very fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is very compact, quick to heat up and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Just right for travel and making quick curls in my daughters&#x27; bangs or adding a few ringlets to my own.</li>
            <li> I bought this miniature iron to take back to Asia with me from America, and it works well although it gets very hot very quickly, and seemed to scorch my hair a bit if I let it go too</li>
            <li> I needed a small heat tool for workday touchups, and I am in love with this one :)</li>
            <li> First thing to mention is that the case that was included with this item was not the one pictured.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issue with the tip being too hot</li>
            <li> You do have to be cautious of burns, mostly because you are used to having the larger iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li> okay enough for travel</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to spend a bit more time on your hair than if you were to use a regular size curling iron</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping for a carrying case as  I received  with my first  Mini  Conar.  </li>
            <li> The iron&#x27;s built in stand will not keep it sitting in place on your counter, but it will roll to the side, so be carefull where you place it when curling, as the iron gets pretty hot.    </li>
            <li> and it does get hot.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to accidentally touch the hot ceramic.</li>
            <li> I tossed it away after the first use.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, so I adjust the length of time in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to do hair&lt;br /&gt;Too hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sufficient for the occasional curl (which is all I need it for!), but if you need a more frequent and comfortable travel curler, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For those who said it gets too hot, you&#x27;re not using it every day</li>
            <li> this little sweetie fits perfectly in my purse, heats up &amp; cools down quickly, and comes with a storage bag.</li>
            <li> Some reviews on this were quite negative as well as positive, so I decided to order anyway and am so happy I did.</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly and easy to use on long hair.</li>
            <li> Third, it has 2 great little legs that allow me to leave it sit on the bathroom counter to cool off without harm.</li>
            <li> It is very small which makes it great in the suitcase</li>
            <li> getting too hot that it burns my hair, but it does get pretty hot and fast.  </li>
            <li> Cute and small, took this on a trip; easy to pack and gets quite hot.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, though, plan to spend a lot more time curling it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did burn my fingers the first time - there isn&#x27;t much to hold onto at the end -</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for your travels as it is very small but does the job for a great price!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as a full-sized model and it often pulls my hair (I think because it is so small your hairs end up closer to the clamp part).</li>
            <li> I think this iron would be best for short to shortish medium hair due to the short curling area.  </li>
            <li> curly I can now blow dry it out and still curl it for the more polish nigh out when I want</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have large hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who travels frequently as it is travel friendly.</li>
            <li> This little travel curler is good enough for a quick fix, but you would not want to do your whole head of hair with it at home.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> I found that is curls fast and holds well</li>
            <li> Very well packaged and presented.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap enough to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Since it would have cost me almost as much to return it as it did to buy it, I donated it to a charity.</li>
            <li> and I am really satisfy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very compact, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> Did not want it to take up too much room, and it does not.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li> It heats up instantly and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> but if using it at home, it&#x27;s not very advisable as a longer curling thong would be better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I  really like it,  </li>
            <li> keep one with my travel items, ready to go on a trip.  </li>
            <li> also it heat really fast,</li>
            <li> people really should buy it if they always travel around.</li>
            <li> The fact that it has a thermal sleeve is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to wrap your hair because you have to be careful to keep it on the barrel, and then there&#x27;s more danger of overheating the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the hair box</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really worry about the lack of heat setting.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the travel case.  </li>
            <li> There is a really just an on/off button.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it fits nicely in your pocketbooks ladies and it come in a few colors.</li>
            <li> The barrel is just a little short, otherwise very nice to carry in luggage.</li>
            <li> keeps the hot part of the iron inside, while the cord is neatly contained outside with an elastic band and not exposed to the hot barrel if you have to pack it right</li>
            <li> the ceramic coating does a better curling job than other curling irons that&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If I used one more frequently then I would go with a full size heavy duty curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Could not capture my hair which is long and fine around the shaft.  </li>
            <li> and it was great for such a small item it can be a work horse.</li>
            <li> do-er, so those of you who are more advanced curling iron users you may not have the same issue, but I found this little guy virtually unusable.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to burn your hand because the barrel is so short, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice small size</li>
            <li> The built-in temperature is a bit higher than I normally use (I have fine hair), but I just keep my hair in it for a shorter period of time than with my other irons.  </li>
            <li> liked that it has no voltage switch...who wants to think that hard about which voltage setting to use a on vacation or for a business trip for that matter?  </li>
            <li> (For some previous irons, I had to get a silicone heat pad to protect the counter top until they cooled.)</li>
            <li> It left a lot more room in my suitcase to bring back presents for ME.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I think that most people will only use this on vacation/travel so it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to send it back because it would have been perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even do it that quickly with my regular iron at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually, I think it is a good product, but my hair is not fit on it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent travel curling iron.</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot and is tiny.</li>
            <li> so if you have super long hair maybe not the thing for you, but it literally takes up as much space as a pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is great, heats up quickly and works just as well as my larger curling iron at home at less than half the size.</li>
            <li> It is small, light and get&#x27;s very hot.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use my own curling irons, irons, blow dryers and other heat appliance in Europe, I would have needed a current converter (sp?).  </li>
            <li> I do agree with some other reviews about how it would be nice to have an extra inch on the barrel.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it may heat up faster than my large professional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Just too small and very easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> It came with a cute little travel case too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely little size for travel, however.  </li>
            <li> Second, it heats up fast and works well, having a nice little tip on the end to hold onto and avoid burns.</li>
            <li> , I have horribly difficult hair, so it&#x27;s a great \\&quot;secret\\&quot; weapon for me to have.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve done that on normal sized curling irons as well.  </li>
            <li> I am more concerned that it does not shut off by itself if left alone too long.  </li>
            <li> Even with my fine hair, the heat does not cause damage due to the ceramic barrel.</li>
            <li> small, works, not expensive, easy to use,</li>
            <li> I should point out that I only use the curling iron for getting my bangs to hang right.</li>
            <li> Although itheats fast, you can&#x27;t put it away hot on the pouch like it&#x27;s sister the flat iron.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think the tiny barrel would make it harder to curl big sections, but it&#x27;s SO fast and makes my hair look amazing.</li>
            <li> I was going on an extended trip through Europe and wanted a light iron, so I trusted the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can mention is that because the barrel is shorter, it did take me a little longer to style my hair and it might not be great for someone with very long hair.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be careful, but as it heats up so fast, just plug it in, use it and unplug it right away</li>
            <li> This little curling iron does everything my full size one does!  </li>
            <li> /lap tops are probably already dual voltage and you will only need an adaptor (check first though -  </li>
            <li> Yes, it gets plenty hot - just too short to manage without a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> Burnt my finger, there is no safty grip, only one setting which is way to hot.  </li>
            <li> There is no temperature setting, but I don&#x27;t find that too much of a problem since I rarely change the setting on my other curling irons.</li>
            <li> Of course I had to do smaller amounts of hair at a time, but it was so hot</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, and small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> one caution, the plastic tip is very small so it is easy to grab the hot part instead of the plastic.</li>
            <li> The heated part is so small that you can&#x27;t fit much hair in it without it getting snagged.</li>
            <li> Great for newer short hair styles especially for adding a few loose curls in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> (right product must also be a consideration) and that hair did not fall loose between the barrel and the clamp.  </li>
            <li> ,even though the price was great and I didn&#x27;t have to go out shopping for this, has no case, so disappointing.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it</li>
            <li> You need a lil time to used to but the Conair CD63RR MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Red, 1 Inch works really well</li>
            <li> This curling iron surprised me with its muscle power.  </li>
            <li> This only curled the tips but not the body of my hair very well.</li>
            <li> The barrel is very short and would be too much work to use every day at home.  </li>
            <li> It is true that it does take a bit longer to curl than when using a larger iron, but not so long that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to purchase for travel.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time to cool down..</li>
            <li> I love the small size but you cannot adjust the heat hence your hair can cook!</li>
            <li> Be sure to pack it well as mine did dent due to my clumsey packing - and the rough handling of the airlines.</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted (I really like the pouch that comes with the travel flat iron)</li>
            <li> It is also really small and was fine for travel</li>
            <li> and it is so tiny you can&#x27;t get more than a small pinch of hair in it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I need it for travelling as it is small and light and also compact...</li>
            <li> Did not grab as much hair, and took a long time to curl.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on everyday use,  I would suggest going with a full sized curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would perform as good as my larger one, but it&#x27;s a champ!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the little bit of space</li>
            <li> The size is really small enough to bring, but I still cannot use it smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is important to take extra care when using because the size and small opening clamp can make it akward and therefore easier to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Must exert caution as the potential to burn fingers occurs frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve encountered is the too  small &#x27;cool tip.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> The manufacturers apparently have listened to past comments because it now has a cool tip to hold onto at the point of the heated section.  </li>
            <li> A bit hard to hold given the short barrel, and easy to burn yourself,until you get used to how to handle it.</li>
            <li> The tip is small, so it&#x27;s easy to miss it and burn your fingers when trying to grab the end of the iron, especially when you&#x27;re curling hair on the back of your head.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Conair Ceramic Curling Iron last year for a trip to China.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly due to the dual voltage feature.  </li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully...heated up quickly, and it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> Fits in small purse, heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t scorch hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the lever/clamp would not open far enough to get my hair in and around the barrell.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast but be careful because it only has one setting</li>
            <li> No heat adjustment though, so it does get a little hot.</li>
            <li> Our Hotel rented them but said that they were always out and recommended I bring my own converter (expensive and large and heavy)</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed a super small travel curling iron for a trip to Albania where I was only bringing one suitcase for three weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a light weight silicone mesh glove that I sometimes use on the left hand because the tip of the curling iron is very small</li>
            <li> I have to admit - it does roll and is very close to the surface when you lay it down.  </li>
            <li> Heat up in seconds, cools down fast.</li>
            <li> This is a darling little curling iron and it works really well for short hair.</li>
            <li> Just did a trial run at home, but will pack it in my suitcase along with my regular curling iron, and give the little guy a real trial run.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a zippered pouch similar to the one that comes with Conair&#x27;s mini travel flat iron.</li>
            <li> this high heat is not good for normal hair.</li>
            <li> If saving space traveling is your main goal it will work..not really an everyday curling iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not liking it, it really is too small to manuveur</li>
            <li> but this was just too much burn risk (on hands) because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a sucker for anything</li>
            <li> small - OK for me because I expected and wanted it small</li>
            <li> The iron is as I expected, and I curled not only my bangs, but the rest of my hair, just to test it, and the curls were the same as if I used a bigger iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to make my straight long hair curl.</li>
            <li> Since the barrel is so small, you have to divide your hair into 1 inch sections to curl, and the clamp does not open as far as a larger iron, so it is harder to slide your hair into it.  </li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Be warned that if you have long hair like mine you&#x27;ll need to curl half the length of a strand first and then the other half.  </li>
            <li> size is great for travel a little awkward to hold and use because of small size.</li>
            <li> Only downside is not much room on the tip to hold on to while setting your curl-easy to burn your fingers!</li>
            <li> I have short but very thick hair, and it was too much of a frustration.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and needed a travel curling iron for a 2 week trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up in just a few seconds, and I swear it works better than my expensive irons at home.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too time consuming to return for replacement and not sure if replacement would be complete either</li>
            <li> (Do not expect loose wave curls</li>
            <li> The case was a black and white zebra print.</li>
            <li> you get a black and white stripe case.</li>
            <li> I was  tired of lugging around all of the large size hair dryers and curling irons.  </li>
            <li> Why bumble around with a giant curler when you get the job done well with this little guy?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to get hair caught in the base of the clamp when you have to wind a long length of hair.</li>
            <li> I had hesitated buying a mini curling iron after reading bad reviews but I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> Even when I wound it around small sections of hair, long or short sections - it didn&#x27;t hold, so my hair just kept flopping out as I turned the handle.  </li>
            <li> But this pouch is a narrow pouch that you slip the curling iron in (similar to a case for eyeglasses)</li>
            <li> If it were bigger I would probably use it at home for my everyday curling iron.</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful not to get</li>
            <li> The only thing that disappointed me was there was no case (one reviewer said there was, but they must have been reviewing a different product), so I had to wait for it to cool before packing.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair (which I do), it&#x27;s more difficult to use because the barrel is so small, and you can only curl a very small piece of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Only negative you have to get use to the end tip is not as long as others so just use a finger to guide it.</li>
            <li> There is a very small &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t roll around when you put it down, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on anything that might burn, as the stand does not hold it very far off the surface.  </li>
            <li> But the clip doesn&#x27;t clamp down firm enough to hold the hair in while you turn it.  </li>
            <li> The unit is VERY small, and the heated barrell is only 2-3&amp;#34; long.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a small curler that actually curls.</li>
            <li> it is tricking to get the hang of such a small curling iron</li>
            <li> I only give it four stars as the tip is so small that I kept singeing my fingers when I would try to grab the end.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Small enough to stick in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> By the way, when I bought this, other reviews stated that a travel case was included.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful if you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using this.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it for everyday use as it would take a long time to get the job done (not to mention those burned fingers!).</li>
            <li> The barrel is so small that y can only curl small sections of hair, thus it takes you long pager.  </li>
            <li> You also have to be a little careful because the safety tip above the barrel is a little bit small.</li>
            <li> If my hairstyle involved using the curling iron all over, this might be too small and take too long.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it may be too small for my long hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there are limits on how to adjust the heat.</li>
            <li> The clamp was really weak and didn&#x27;t actually hold my hair in the iron and it kept slipping out.</li>
            <li> I usually use a 2\\&quot; roller because I like that \\&quot;loose wave\\&quot; look.</li>

            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> and Super bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> Really small curling iron, that&#x27;s the only negative part.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I needed to touch up my hair and took little space in the suitcase.  </li>
            <li> , it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> ; put it in the little pouch and go.</li>
            <li> I like that it takes up so little space in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron takes up no room in your suitcase; you can stow it inside of a shoe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything in my life, but I just had to give this little iron props.  </li>
            <li> Iended up taking my full size one on vacation. :(</li>
            <li> I just need to use this iron for a few ends that I can&#x27;t do with a brush.  </li>
            <li> One for travel and one for everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Not available.</li>
            <li> Some people wrote that you can burn your fingers cause the little black tip is so small.  </li>
            <li> Learned quickly not to do that!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I travel by air a lot and would like to take this small device instead of a full sized iron.</li>
            <li> Since it is so small, it takes a little practice to use.</li>
            <li> I must say that this little iron gets the job done - and does it well!  </li>
            <li> Little and does its job.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> However this is bad news if you have long hair because there&#x27;s simply not enough surface area to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small curling iron for travel, and this looked like just the thing.</li>
            <li> ...wanted a small one for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am not a skilled hair</li>
            <li> So small that you can burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> safety tip a bit small</li>
            <li> I recommend buying a this small dual voltage curling iron and a travel</li>
            <li> Too small...</li>
            <li> I wanted a small curling iron for my trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> I use this small curling iron while traveling.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is so small, that you burn your hands everytime you use it.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a small iron for travelling, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> I burnt mine a few times!</li>
            <li> Though I was aiming for small and space saving with this curling iron, this one is too small.</li>
            <li> And since the surface area was so small I had a really hard time just manually wrapping my hair around it without the use of the clamp.</li>
            <li> Hard for me to hold</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to curl due to the small size of the barrel and the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, you will just be there longer styling your hair.</li>
            <li> I mean, I don&#x27;t really care what the stupid voltage is.  </li>
            <li> The clamp just makes little kinks and pulls hair pieces making it an unpleasant experience while just giving the overall hair strand an unappealing look.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said this item was worthless, but I was desperate for a curling iron that would fit in my bag for some extended travel.</li>
            <li> It does not curl or even give off some subtle waves.</li>
            <li> Would be very dangerous to use around a young child.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this product.</li>
            <li> but it is very hard to handle and not burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> Not great, but for the price, does the trick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not well-behaved, so I tend to have annoying little bumps and curls where I don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need anything expensive or fancy since it was just for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate to spend your hard earned money on something you didn&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> I needed a travel curling iron, but was afraid that I was compromising efficiency for size.  </li>
            <li> , I was afraid that it would burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just frustrated.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is terrible and does not curl at all.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to touch at the end to support the iron while in your hair so I sustained a nasty burn while on vacation.</li>

            <li> Perfect size for travel and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I bought this mini curling iron to take on a trip to the UK because is had dual voltage.  It was just what I needed to touch up my hair and took little space in the suitcase.  What a find!</li>
            <li> Cute and small, took this on a trip; easy to pack and gets quite hot. Since it is so small, it takes a little practice to use. For daily usage I prefer the longer size, but recommend this for travel , I have short hair, can&#x27;t say how a long-haired lady would find it.</li>
            <li> This is a darling little curling iron and it works really well for short hair. If you have long hair, though, plan to spend a lot more time curling it. The heated part is so small that you can&#x27;t fit much hair in it without it getting snagged.</li>
            <li> Ordered it Sunday, it came Monday! Got a text telling me it was at my door! Perfect for travel or even taking along in my big purse for special events like my upcomping Vegas wedding before the big wedding in the spring. Just wish they&#x27;d come out with a 1.5 in or a cordless version!</li>
            <li> I wanted a small curling iron for travel, and this looked like just the thing. It works so well that I use it for my daily at-home hair styling.  It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space. My hair looks good after I use it. Also, I have seen it in local stores since my Amazon purchase- and Amazon was cheaper!  I should point out that I only use the curling iron for getting my bangs to hang right. If my hairstyle involved using the curling iron all over, this might be too small and take too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not liking it, it really is too small to manuveur so I will have to say I do not recommend it. Iended up taking my full size one on vacation. :(</li>
            <li> works great...wanted a small one for travel.  Like that it&#x27;s in a carry case, too!</li>
            <li> I was incredibly impressed at how well this product performed just like my full sized curling iron of what is supposedly a better brand. I highly recommend this for anyone who travels frequently as it is travel friendly. Be sure to pack it well as mine did dent due to my clumsey packing - and the rough handling of the airlines.</li>
            <li> Dimensions are as follows:  cord - 6ft  heating barrel - 2.25 inches  handle - 3.25 inches  from end to end - 6.25 inches  I must say that this little iron gets the job done - and does it well!  Heats up fast.  In fact, it may heat up faster than my large professional curling iron.  My hair is shoulder length and of a medium coarseness.  I found that is curls fast and holds well (right product must also be a consideration) and that hair did not fall loose between the barrel and the clamp.  It is true that it does take a bit longer to curl than when using a larger iron, but not so long that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to purchase for travel.  I found that it increased my curling time by almost one third.  The arthritis in my hands was not bothered by this as the clamp is easy to control.  Planning on using for three weeks in Europe.  What a great value!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this product. I needed a travel curling iron, but was afraid that I was compromising efficiency for size.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  This little curling iron does everything my full size one does!  So I guess you could say this is a win win situation!</li>
            <li> this little sweetie fits perfectly in my purse, heats up &amp; cools down quickly, and comes with a storage bag. I needed a small heat tool for workday touchups, and I am in love with this one :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Dublin in May 2011.  I was the perfect thing!  Very compact and has a great storage pouch.  It heats up very fast and does a great job.  And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I ordered red and rec&#x27;d blue. Very disappointed and don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of exchanging. Don&#x27;t you just hate to spend your hard earned money on something you didn&#x27;t want.  Smh</li>
            <li> This curling iron worked perfectly for my trip to Italy.  It is small, light and get&#x27;s very hot.  I had no problems in either Italy or France.  It is small so watch your fingers, it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> I use this to curl my ban and sides as needed.  It heats up quickly, works well and you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool; put it in the little pouch and go.</li>
            <li> I took this on a recent backpacking trip over seas and it worked out GREAT.  It is small and compact and gets plenty hot. I was worried that it may be too small for my long hair but it worked.</li>
            <li> Love the item.  Very well packaged and presented.  I understood this to be a Mini curling iron.  Just wish it were a tad bit longer.  Great price, great purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Took it on recent vacation and it worked great as a compact.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the mini hair straightener, so thought I&#x27;d add to my travel selection. The clamp was really weak and didn&#x27;t actually hold my hair in the iron and it kept slipping out. And since the surface area was so small I had a really hard time just manually wrapping my hair around it without the use of the clamp. I will admit that I am not a skilled hair do-er, so those of you who are more advanced curling iron users you may not have the same issue, but I found this little guy virtually unusable. The difficulty of use came no where close to compensating for the size difference between this and my regular curling iron, so I returned.</li>
            <li> Like product and packaging - only problem  I&#x27;ve encountered is the too  small &#x27;cool tip.&#x27;  Must exert caution as the potential to burn fingers occurs frequently.  Otherwise, product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said this item was worthless, but I was desperate for a curling iron that would fit in my bag for some extended travel. It was cheap enough to give it a chance. Save your money!! It is terrible and does not curl at all. It also does not come in the shown zippered pouch.</li>
            <li> Handy and perfect for travel.  It&#x27;s very simple -- just on and off, with no adjustment.</li>
            <li> First thing to mention is that the case that was included with this item was not the one pictured. I thought it would be a zippered pouch similar to the one that comes with Conair&#x27;s mini travel flat iron. [[ASIN:B001ELJO0G Conair CS80 MiniPro Ceramic Straightener, Black, 0.5 Inch]] But this pouch is a narrow pouch that you slip the curling iron in (similar to a case for eyeglasses) and then you have to wrap the cord around the outside and tuck the end of the cord under this elastic band on the outside. It has a zebra pattern. Not what I wanted (I really like the pouch that comes with the travel flat iron) but I suppose it will do the job.    This curling iron is short - which makes sense because you want the device to be compact for travel. However this is bad news if you have long hair because there&#x27;s simply not enough surface area to curl your hair. For travel, I will make do, but if you have room you might as well just bring your regular curling iron.    You might want to get a silicon glove because as other reviewers said, this little baby gets HOT and you need to watch your fingers!</li>
            <li> It is definately cute, but becareful. So small that you can burn your fingers. I like the travel case that came with it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for traveling.  I have not had any issue with the tip being too hot but I had read reviews and was prepared.  I like that it takes up so little space in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest curling iron ever! It works perfectly for me. You do have to be cautious of burns, mostly because you are used to having the larger iron. However, I am thrilled with the item. The heat proof bag it comes with is a huge time savor. I pack my iron with me daily, I have horribly difficult hair, so it&#x27;s a great \\&quot;secret\\&quot; weapon for me to have. We are leaving for vacation soon, and I intend to take it with us, it will make packing a lot easier. :)</li>
            <li> This little guy is great for traveling! It isn&#x27;t as good as a full-sized model and it often pulls my hair (I think because it is so small your hairs end up closer to the clamp part). It came with a cute little travel case too. Love it.</li>
            <li> i love this product&lt;br /&gt;cheap and best i&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and easy to carry&lt;br /&gt;you can take where ever you go</li>
            <li> My hair is not well-behaved, so I tend to have annoying little bumps and curls where I don&#x27;t want them. This curling iron is great for quick touch-ups in the morning. First, it&#x27;s compact, so it travels well and is easy to store at home. Second, it heats up fast and works well, having a nice little tip on the end to hold onto and avoid burns. Third, it has 2 great little legs that allow me to leave it sit on the bathroom counter to cool off without harm. (For some previous irons, I had to get a silicone heat pad to protect the counter top until they cooled.) So this is exactly what I was looking for, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The price was right, but there were so many inherent flaws, it was just not useable. The unit is VERY small, and the heated barrell is only 2-3&amp;#34; long.  Additionally, the lever/clamp would not open far enough to get my hair in and around the barrell. I have short but very thick hair, and it was too much of a frustration. Since it would have cost me almost as much to return it as it did to buy it, I donated it to a charity.</li>
            <li> Compact and light weight. Good use if you have short hair and not a lot to cure. There is no dual voltage switch on this curling iron as seller stated. The plug imprinted 110V-220V only.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. If you have thick hair, you will just be there longer styling your hair. Although itheats fast, you can&#x27;t put it away hot on the pouch like it&#x27;s sister the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to keep in my desk at work for those unexpected meeting or presentations.  It heats p really fast and stays warm.  The tip is pretty small so it takes a bit of getting used to so that you aren&#x27;t bring your fingers.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it getting too hot that it burns my hair, but it does get pretty hot and fast.  If it were bigger I would probably use it at home for my everyday curling iron.</li>
            <li> You need a lil time to used to but the Conair CD63RR MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Red, 1 Inch works really well and I am really satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived really fast too!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. VERY SMALL, GREAT FOR TRAVELING! It left a lot more room in my suitcase to bring back presents for ME.&lt;br /&gt;2. loved the case.  keeps the hot part of the iron inside, while the cord is neatly contained outside with an elastic band and not exposed to the hot barrel if you have to pack it right away!!&lt;br /&gt;3. heats up fast!&lt;br /&gt;4. inexpensive, (well i have enough home hair appliances already I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON A TRAVEL ONE.&lt;br /&gt;5.  dual voltage only needs an adaptor for Europe.  I was able to buy this iron very cheaply and use with an adaptor that i also bought on Amazon cheaply that could be used for all of my electronics as well.&lt;br /&gt;6. liked that it has no voltage switch...who wants to think that hard about which voltage setting to use a on vacation or for a business trip for that matter?  I mean, I don&#x27;t really care what the stupid voltage is.  I just wanna look Good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. small - OK for me because I expected and wanted it small but that is a decision for you and your hair!!&lt;br /&gt;2. safety tip a bit small and you have to be careful not to get burned!&lt;br /&gt;3. I have to admit - it does roll and is very close to the surface when you lay it down.  You just have to be careful, but as it heats up so fast, just plug it in, use it and unplug it right away and you should be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for:  Anyone who is looking for a travel curling iron that travels overseas or who might travel overseas in the future.  I think that most people will only use this on vacation/travel so it should last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to use my own curling irons, irons, blow dryers and other heat appliance in Europe, I would have needed a current converter (sp?).  Our Hotel rented them but said that they were always out and recommended I bring my own converter (expensive and large and heavy) After researching many blogs and Amazon reviews, I decided that this would be cheaper and more convenient.  I was right!!&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend buying a this small dual voltage curling iron and a travel adaptor.&lt;br /&gt;Most of your electronics like ipods/cell phones/lap tops are probably already dual voltage and you will only need an adaptor (check first though -  I burned out my camera battery charger in Greece!!- but luckily the greeks were very very happy to sell me a new one!)  (FYI: used on Cruise ship, Greek and Italian Hotels)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2012:  Still using this product. just returned from Germany and Africa and I still love it!! I just leave it right in my suitcase with my travel adaptors so its always ready to go!!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought  this!  Absolutely perfect for travel.  Gets super hot, so watch your fingers.  But works like a charm.  Allowed me to have relatively acceptable hair for dinners out when I wasn&#x27;t  too deep in the wilderness in Costa Rica last year.</li>
            <li> Very compact, but does the job.  I have used it traveling in the US and Iceland, England and Scotland.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this curling iron for my gym bag. Did not want it to take up too much room, and it does not. It is great, heats up quickly and works just as well as my larger curling iron at home at less than half the size. No fancy settings, on or off, that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one caution, the plastic tip is very small so it is easy to grab the hot part instead of the plastic. Learned quickly not to do that!</li>
            <li> This curling iron surprised me with its muscle power.  I have very long hair, and needed a travel curling iron for a 2 week trip to Europe.  It worked fabulously, heats up quickly, and gets the job done better than my regular curling iron.  The case is a nice added bonus when you have to get ready and pack up and go in the morning, because you don&#x27;t have to worry about letting it cool off before stuffing it in your suitcase.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Cute as a button.  Nice small size but the clamp wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold my fine hair - which just slipped right off the barrel. Would probably be great for someone with longer, thicker hair. Sorry to have to send it back because it would have been perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Too small... okay enough for travel but doesn&#x27;t come with a cover.  Hard for me to hold and I don&#x27;t have large hands.&lt;br /&gt;Waist length hair rolled up fine but this was just too much burn risk (on hands) because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip because of the size and that the &#x27;reviewers&#x27; mentioned that it came in a case&lt;br /&gt;Mine,even though the price was great and I didn&#x27;t have to go out shopping for this, has no case, so disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a small curler that actually curls. This only curled the tips but not the body of my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Be very careful if you buy this one. Gets very, very, hot. Not recommended for short or very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had hesitated buying a mini curling iron after reading bad reviews but I&#x27;m really glad I got this one! It&#x27;s very compact so it&#x27;s great for travelling and it&#x27;s easy to use. I didn&#x27;t burn myself once and the curls I got were great. Yes, you have to spend a bit more time on your hair than if you were to use a regular size curling iron but it&#x27;s worth it for the convenience!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for travel use.  I think this iron would be best for short to shortish medium hair due to the short curling area.  Note:  this does not come with a travel pouch like some models of Conair travel curling irons.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron in the summer for a trip to Europe.  It heats up instantly and does a fantastic job.  Better than the one I&#x27;ve been using at home.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is the tip where you put your finger when you are curling is so short I kept burning my fingers! If you concentrate on what you are doing you won&#x27;t have a problem!  The heatproof case was also very handy as you didn&#x27;t have to wait for the iron to cool before packing it away.  Also there were no switches to turn for the dual voltage....all you had to do was plug it in with a tip for the country you were in.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the reviews when they said the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to hold your hair as you roll the iron does NOT hold your hair.  It was true.  Just did a trial run at home, but will pack it in my suitcase along with my regular curling iron, and give the little guy a real trial run.  I&#x27;d look for something a bit larger, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> i like this size and it works well. it is tricking to get the hang of such a small curling iron as many reviews have mentioned so i suggest you practice with it before traveling with it.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, fast to heat up, easy to use and great results.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given the curling iron away because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it without burning myself. Yes, it gets plenty hot - just too short to manage without a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> i receive this on time.  This curling is nice !&lt;br /&gt;it fits nicely in your pocketbooks ladies and it come in a few colors. perfect for human hair wigs yes i tried it. Buy you one!!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I need it for travelling as it is small and light and also compact...it&#x27;s useful for times like that...but if using it at home, it&#x27;s not very advisable as a longer curling thong would be better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> The size is really small enough to bring, but I still cannot use it smoothly. It&#x27;s hard to make my straight long hair curl. Maybe I need someone teach me how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> I  really like it,  but I was hoping for a carrying case as  I received  with my first  Mini  Conar.  Still it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a sucker for anything \\&quot;mini.\\&quot;  The pros are that it is very basic, heats up quickly, is a great travel size, the price is great, and I liked the length of the cord considering it&#x27;s a mini product.  I do agree with some other reviews about how it would be nice to have an extra inch on the barrel.  You also have to be a little careful because the safety tip above the barrel is a little bit small. I have fine hair that is below my shoulder blades and had no problems creating nice beachy waves.  Be warned that if you have long hair like mine you&#x27;ll need to curl half the length of a strand first and then the other half.  If you&#x27;re planning on everyday use,  I would suggest going with a full sized curling iron.  Personally, I found this product perfect for my needs of occasional use.  The pouch that came with my iron doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured.  The case was a black and white zebra print. You slip the iron in and there is an elastic strap on the outside to hold the cord.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s probably better than the zippered one pictured. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small curling iron for my trip to Europe.  I have shoulder length hair, but I really only needed something to curl my bangs a bit, so this works great.  I would not recommend it for longer hair, unless you just want to curl the ends.      Since the barrel is so small, you have to divide your hair into 1 inch sections to curl, and the clamp does not open as far as a larger iron, so it is harder to slide your hair into it.  With care, it can be done, and the tip on the end is adequate to hold and not burn your fingers as you curl.     The iron&#x27;s built in stand will not keep it sitting in place on your counter, but it will roll to the side, so be carefull where you place it when curling, as the iron gets pretty hot.    The bag that it comes in is not the same zippered bag shown in the picture.  It is not zippered, just a sleeve to slide the iron in, and you have to leave the cord on the outside.    The iron is as I expected, and I curled not only my bangs, but the rest of my hair, just to test it, and the curls were the same as if I used a bigger iron, only I had to divide it into smaller sections.  It is important to take extra care when using because the size and small opening clamp can make it akward and therefore easier to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Conair Ceramic Curling Iron last year for a trip to China.&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly due to the dual voltage feature.  I liked it so much, I have used it&lt;br /&gt;for my daily hair curling iron.  I then decided to purchase a second one so that I&lt;br /&gt;could keep one with my travel items, ready to go on a trip.  This curling iron gets hot quickly&lt;br /&gt;and the ceramic coating does a better curling job than other curling irons that&lt;br /&gt;I have used.  This is an excellent purchase!!</li>
            <li> This little curling iron takes up no room in your suitcase; you can stow it inside of a shoe. It heats up fast but be careful because it only has one setting and it does get hot. Creates curls quickly or just smooths out your hair if you don&#x27;t want a lot of curl. I have a light weight silicone mesh glove that I sometimes use on the left hand because the tip of the curling iron is very small and I don&#x27;t want to accidentally touch the hot ceramic. Even with my fine hair, the heat does not cause damage due to the ceramic barrel.</li>
            <li> best thing for short or long hair!!</li>
            <li> Comprei para dar de presente e acabei ficando pra mim. Adorei, leve, pratico, funcional. Preço bom. A entrega foi muito rapida. Eu recomendo</li>
            <li> I bought it for the small size I thought would be ideal for travel.  I tossed it away after the first use.  Burnt my finger, there is no safty grip, only one setting which is way to hot.  I would have cut off the cord so no one else would have a problem, but did not have anything to cut it off with.  Would be very dangerous to use around a young child.</li>
            <li> small, works, not expensive, easy to use, exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;The result somehow is better then the large one I use at home.</li>
            <li> Bought this to fit in my carryon and it fit the bill. No heat adjustment though, so it does get a little hot. It also heats up in 30 seconds. I would recommend this for anyone that is traveling. It would also be great to put in your handbag for on the go curling.</li>
            <li> and Super bad for your hair. I love the small size but you cannot adjust the heat hence your hair can cook! this high heat is not good for normal hair. If I could I would give zero stars.</li>
            <li> never thought it would work this well. easy to carry and use. also it heat really fast, that what i like. the designs are cool and fashionable too. people really should buy it if they always travel around.</li>
            <li> Could not capture my hair which is long and fine around the shaft.  I was really disappointed as I travel by air a lot and would like to take this small device instead of a full sized iron.</li>
            <li> size is great for travel a little awkward to hold and use because of small size. travel case not the same as pictured you get a black and white stripe case.If saving space traveling is your main goal it will work..not really an everyday curling iron</li>
            <li> love how compact this little bugger is but still get great results!! no temp selection tho. what it lacks in size, it makes up in performance!</li>
            <li> great item to have I went to a wedding in another state and nobody remembered to bring a curling iron the entire wedding party and others used it and it performed great (I should say that I was the last to use it and it was great for such a small item it can be a work horse. Only negative you have to get use to the end tip is not as long as others so just use a finger to guide it. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this compact curling iron to take on a trip to Australia. I was  tired of lugging around all of the large size hair dryers and curling irons.  I was skeptical that it would perform as good as my larger one, but it&#x27;s a champ!  The only thing I can mention is that because the barrel is shorter, it did take me a little longer to style my hair and it might not be great for someone with very long hair.  But I have medium shoulder length hair and it worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick, and produces good results, I am really happy with it. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my trip</li>
            <li> Bought this curling iron 3yrs ago and still love it. Love the compact size fits in my bathroom cabinet and my purse if needed.</li>
            <li> I have this in my suitcase to use while traveling.  It is a great size, and heats up fast.  The fact that it has a thermal sleeve is also very convenient.</li>
            <li> Does the job and easy to use</li>
            <li> Works better that my full size curling iron</li>
            <li> I was going on an extended trip through Europe and wanted a light iron, so I trusted the other reviews. Again, I have hair that falls about 3inches below my shoulders, is fine but a lot of it.  I usually use a 2\\&quot; roller because I like that \\&quot;loose wave\\&quot; look. If I actually wrapped all of my hair around it and only held it for 5 seconds the curl was good and I could shake it out a bit. (Do not expect loose wave curls it truly is a 1\\&quot; curl) But I was amazed at how well it held my curl all day and the temp was between 92-96 degrees every day! Overall, if I would have played with it for a bit before leaving I could have gotten used to it. I actually have it in my gym bag now so if I need a quick fix, I have this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for a 3-week, one-suitcase trip to Central America.  I&#x27;ve been using it at home in advance of the trip so that I&#x27;ll have adapted to it by the time I leave.  The manufacturers apparently have listened to past comments because it now has a cool tip to hold onto at the point of the heated section.  I have had no trouble with its heat level, and while it does of course take me longer to curl my hair simply because of the need to make two curls where a longer curling iron would make one, I am very happy with it and I&#x27;m so glad a good quality curling iron in this size is available!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a really nice product. It&#x27;s dual-voltage and really compact, so it&#x27;s great for travel or carrying in your purse for touch-ups. If your hair is shoulder-length or shorter, or if you want to use it to touch up your bangs, it&#x27;s great - and might even be good enough for daily use.  If you have long hair (which I do), it&#x27;s more difficult to use because the barrel is so small, and you can only curl a very small piece of hair at a time. It takes longer to wrap your hair because you have to be careful to keep it on the barrel, and then there&#x27;s more danger of overheating the hair. It&#x27;s also very easy to get hair caught in the base of the clamp when you have to wind a long length of hair. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to use it every day, but I can make do with it for travel.   There is no temperature setting, but I don&#x27;t find that too much of a problem since I rarely change the setting on my other curling irons. The built-in temperature is a bit higher than I normally use (I have fine hair), but I just keep my hair in it for a shorter period of time than with my other irons.  The tip is small, so it&#x27;s easy to miss it and burn your fingers when trying to grab the end of the iron, especially when you&#x27;re curling hair on the back of your head. But I&#x27;ve done that on normal sized curling irons as well.  Mine came with the Zebra pouch, not the floral one shown. There is no zipper, but it has an elastic strap on the outside for holding the cord.</li>
            <li> I use this small curling iron while traveling.  It is very compact, quick to heat up and does the job.  It gets really hot, so I adjust the length of time in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li> purchased to travel overseas.  it is dual voltage so great for anywhere.  It is very compact, lightweight and easy to use.  My only complaint is that there are limits on how to adjust the heat.</li>
            <li> The barrel is so small that y can only curl small sections of hair, thus it takes you long pager.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the little bit of space I saved between this and a full size model to be worth it on vacation.  Might be okay for someone with very fine hair, or to keep at the office for unexpected client meeting touch ups.</li>
            <li> Really small curling iron, that&#x27;s the only negative part.  But great for traveling and gets hot fast too.  Maybe not the best thing for long hair, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I just need to use this iron for a few ends that I can&#x27;t do with a brush.  It&#x27;s very compact and doesn&#x27;t get in the way.</li>
            <li> I really it, I travel a lot and his size is perfect to travel !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s making good curls with a spray it will last hours and hours</li>
            <li> Like this compact size for travel.  Use only occasionally so it works for my needs.  If I used one more frequently then I would go with a full size heavy duty curling iron.  Priced right.</li>
            <li> Although this mini curling iron is very cute and compact making it perfect for traveling or having less cluttered drawers and counters, realistically this product does NOT function properly. It may heat up pretty quick, but allows no control whatsoever over the temp. so what i realized was that the amount of heat it provides isn&#x27;t enough to curl. The clamp just makes little kinks and pulls hair pieces making it an unpleasant experience while just giving the overall hair strand an unappealing look. Overall, I do not recommend this for any hair type or length. It does not curl or even give off some subtle waves.</li>
            <li> Liked how compact this curling iron was but did not like that it did not have an option for heat.  It got super hot, I was afraid that it would burn my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It is the right size and it works wonderful. I would recommend to all my friends and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Got this as a back-up to stash at the office.  Didn&#x27;t need anything expensive or fancy since it was just for emergencies. Can I just say: IT&#x27;S AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up in just a few seconds, and I swear it works better than my expensive irons at home.  You&#x27;d think the tiny barrel would make it harder to curl big sections, but it&#x27;s SO fast and makes my hair look amazing. I can go from a ponytail to a full head of perfect curls in less than 10 minutes, all while sitting in my cubicle.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I can&#x27;t even do it that quickly with my regular iron at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything in my life, but I just had to give this little iron props.  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this miniature iron to take back to Asia with me from America, and it works well although it gets very hot very quickly, and seemed to scorch my hair a bit if I let it go too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works dual voltage&lt;br /&gt;Nice color&lt;br /&gt;Portable&lt;br /&gt;Nice swivel connection on the cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to do hair&lt;br /&gt;Too hot; tendency to scorch&lt;br /&gt;Cord requires you to lean close to outlet&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to confuse the on/off switch with the lever-opener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sufficient for the occasional curl (which is all I need it for!), but if you need a more frequent and comfortable travel curler, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for traveling - hoping to reduce the size and weight of my carry on.  But the clip doesn&#x27;t clamp down firm enough to hold the hair in while you turn it.  Even when I wound it around small sections of hair, long or short sections - it didn&#x27;t hold, so my hair just kept flopping out as I turned the handle.  Great idea but no way to use it traveling or at home.</li>
            <li> I have already had one of these curling irons and loved it.  It is great or traveling and I also like the short size of it and use it for every day.  That is why I bought two.  One for travel and one for everyday.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so small, that you burn your hands everytime you use it.  Wanted a small iron for travelling, this is not it.  I have short hair, that didn&#x27;t even stay in the iron, slipped right out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Didn&#x27;t even bother to return, just dumped in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This little travel curler is good enough for a quick fix, but you would not want to do your whole head of hair with it at home.  Travel - yes.  Home - good for a touch up only.  The barrel is very short and would be too much work to use every day at home.  It&#x27;s a lovely little size for travel, however.  It heats well and is pretty easy to handle.  Some people wrote that you can burn your fingers cause the little black tip is so small.  True, but I have had no issues with it.  I am more concerned that it does not shut off by itself if left alone too long.  I worry that I will forget to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Little and does its job.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron for travel.  The barrel is just a little short, otherwise very nice to carry in luggage.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Just too small and very easy to burn yourself. Do not recommend to buy. Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The actual barrel size is probably around 1&amp;#34; - 1 1/2&amp;#34;...  so you won&#x27;t be able to curl large locks of hair... another issue is the clamp that holds the hair in place.  It doesn&#x27;t work well.  So if you have even short hair it&#x27;s difficult to curl due to the small size of the barrel and the clamp doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:  it heats up in seconds...  but watch your fingers... I burnt mine a few times!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for a trip to france, and it worked great. The current converts automatically so that I only needed the plug converter, not a currency converter. I only give it four stars as the tip is so small that I kept singeing my fingers when I would try to grab the end. Be careful! It is also really small and was fine for travel but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it for everyday use as it would take a long time to get the job done (not to mention those burned fingers!).</li>
            <li> Not too easy so use but it fits everywhere. It&#x27;s very cheap, so it&#x27;s worth it. It takes a lot of time to cool down..</li>
            <li> Some reviews on this were quite negative as well as positive, so I decided to order anyway and am so happy I did. I have long, thick hair but it curled well and lasted several days.  Of course I had to do smaller amounts of hair at a time, but it was so hot it curled quickly and I finished in about the same time as my regular curling iron.  It heats quickly too - just seconds.  Yes, I did burn my fingers the first time - there isn&#x27;t much to hold onto at the end - but I got the hang of it and was okay after that. There is a very small &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t roll around when you put it down, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it on anything that might burn, as the stand does not hold it very far off the surface.  The only thing that disappointed me was there was no case (one reviewer said there was, but they must have been reviewing a different product), so I had to wait for it to cool before packing.  I would definitely recommend this for your travels as it is very small but does the job for a great price!</li>
            <li> Just right for travel and making quick curls in my daughters&#x27; bangs or adding a few ringlets to my own. Conair never disappoints!</li>
            <li> I owned a mini curling iron and it stopped working.  This one was smaller than the one I had but it gets the job done. You have to be careful not to burn your hand because the barrel is so short, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> super cute and portable. I would definitely buy it again. but you cant tell the actual temperature the iron is</li>
            <li> This is the perfect curling iron for me. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the hair box and I can touch up quickly just where I need it.</li>
            <li> This cute little curling iron is perfect for traveling!  It gets good and hot quickly.  It&#x27;s especially good for bangs, which is why I bought it.  Doing all your hair with it might take a bit of practice because of the tiny barrel length, but there&#x27;s no reason it couldn&#x27;t be done.</li>
            <li> Why bumble around with a giant curler when you get the job done well with this little guy? I have full, fine hair and I can curl my entire head in about 3 minutes with this curler, it&#x27;s awesome! Heat up in seconds, cools down fast. Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a beauty item in a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought these to take on vacations when I travel as I didn&#x27;t want to bring my full set of hair products so I wanted a mini dryer and curing iron and this is perfect for the days that I don&#x27;t want to leave my hair wet and curly I can now blow dry it out and still curl it for the more polish nigh out when I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love them.</li>
            <li> Actually, I think it is a good product, but my hair is not fit on it. But it is a good one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the curling iron because of it&#x27;s size and ability to be used with both 220/110 current.  It worked wonderfully...heated up quickly, and it&#x27;s so small you could carry it in your purse for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I needed a super small travel curling iron for a trip to Albania where I was only bringing one suitcase for three weeks. Space was limited so this worked perfectly. I have shoulder length hair and it worked great. A bit hard to hold given the short barrel, and easy to burn yourself,until you get used to how to handle it. I prefer a regular curling iron when there&#x27;s room in a suitcase but when there&#x27;s not this will do.</li>
            <li> This works great. Small but great for traveling. Gets hot quickly and easy to use on long hair. Nice size curls.</li>
            <li> I would have kept this curling iron but the two that I ordered didn&#x27;t come with the heat resistant pouch as advertised.  Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;I even called the manufacturer to see if I could get one from them.  Not available.</li>
            <li> MiniPro is awesome!  Fits in small purse, heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t scorch hair. Wish it came in more thicknesses.  Fantastic! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this curler to take with me to Englan,Dublin and Wales.  It did not work with&lt;br /&gt;my converter plug so was unusable.  I have tried it a home but found the extra short barrel difficult to work with. I have short hair so that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Not a good&lt;br /&gt;purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Great for newer short hair styles especially for adding a few loose curls in a hurry.  Heats up quickly, and small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and a lot talked about a travel case but mine arrived with no case. Would be nice to have one.  It&#x27;s a great little curling iron, although I will keep it strictly for travel as it needs more care using it than a regular sized one.</li>
            <li> I just love this !  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  It is great for traveling or throwing in my bag between jobs for a quick fix up.  I would order from here again.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected.  Did not grab as much hair, and took a long time to curl.  I have very thick and curly hair, so I have experienced ones that were better.</li>
            <li> As a girl who is all about packing efficiently, this curling iron is awesome! It is tiny so if you have super long hair maybe not the thing for you, but it literally takes up as much space as a pair of sunglasses. Plus the heat protective pouch is great if you&#x27;re running out the door and have to throw it in your bag. For those who said it gets too hot, you&#x27;re not using it every day so I don&#x27;t really worry about the lack of heat setting. Plus it works overseas with dual voltage! Great deal for $12!</li>
            <li> This is a decent travel curling iron. Not great, but for the price, does the trick.  Small enough to stick in my make up bag. Cools off quickly so I can do my hair, pack up and go.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  I use one for travel.  It provides good heat and is so easy to handle.  I can fix more curls and control the direction better than I can with a full size. So, I bought this second one for home use.</li>
            <li> Great size and heats up quickly. Only downside is not much room on the tip to hold on to while setting your curl-easy to burn your fingers!</li>
            <li> I like to say that this product was very nice to travel and carry on! Very effective and easy to manage!</li>
            <li> This is ok for travel.  It is very small which makes it great in the suitcase but it is very hard to handle and not burn yourself.  It tends to roll and burn surfaces so I set it on a curling iron case which is now singed.  By the way, when I bought this, other reviews stated that a travel case was included.  It wasn&#x27;t!  Read through the description of what is included.  I guess it changes from time to time.  I really wanted the travel case.  I had to buy one for a full-sized curling iron.</li>
            <li> Though I was aiming for small and space saving with this curling iron, this one is too small. There is nothing to touch at the end to support the iron while in your hair so I sustained a nasty burn while on vacation. Be very careful when using this. There is a really just an on/off button. It gets VERY hot and is tiny. I&#x27;ll likely not use it again.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling, fits inside a purse or over night carrier easily. Wonderful for short to medium length hair. It heats up immediately, again wonderful for travelers.</li>
            <li> Just pack your regular iron. I&#x27;ve had this for a year and it is so tiny you can&#x27;t get more than a small pinch of hair in it. The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold your hair either.  Don&#x27;t buy this. I end up carrying my regular travel iron now.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the storage bag with curling iron.  It&#x27;s too time consuming to return for replacement and not sure if replacement would be complete either so I&#x27;m just frustrated.</li>
