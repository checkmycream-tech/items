            <li>It smells amazing</li>

            <li>I read all of these great reviews and the only thing this product did</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>My household is smoke free.  </li>
            <li>I like the feel as I apply it and how my face feels smooth and glows after it is applied.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go as smooth.</li>
            <li>After using for only two weeks I started to see great results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I enjoy this cream.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li>Looks cheap and who guarantee the truth about ingredients since no box?</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and not greasy</li>
            <li>One more thing worth mentioning...</li>
            <li>Viva La Vida has made my skin feel so smooth and refreshed.  </li>

            <li>Fabulous feel with no scent...</li>
            <li>It did not make me break out and goes on smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I used this when I went on vacation everyday and loved the feel good feeling</li>
            <li>and  I am also not so sure I really need something like this, but I have some lines from smiles and still waiting for those to disappear - not terribly concerned if they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love that the first thing I saw was the Viva La Vida box with an easy to find list of very recognizable ingredients!</li>
            <li>It arrived with a letter from the manufacturer telling me how much I will love this product, I was even more excited to try it.</li>
            <li>This is the first serum I bought, and I am telling you, it is amazing, I can see a big difference, my skin is more beautiful and look more younger.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly and is easy to add to a skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks so clear, fine and smooth, and young.&amp;#34; Unimaginable !!</li>
            <li>First of all, the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It is this combination that I am so excited about.</li>
            <li>It really appears to diminish those fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is all natural and organic which is very good in skin and specially to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it on clean skin and then follow with my moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky smooth, literally.  </li>
            <li>I use it on a clean face before bedtime and apply a night moisturizer, or not as the mood strikes.</li>
            <li>This is nothing special.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look as good as it does after I have had a facial.  </li>
            <li>So far it has been a nice product.  </li>
            <li>I am beginning to really like my skin a lot better.</li>
            <li>I had been using another brand of C serum and saw good result immediately, but over time when I was running out I stopped seeing further improvement</li>
            <li>So still, maybe not a bad product, this one just is not for my skin.</li>
            <li>The serum has a very pleasant, faint citrus scent, and the pump application bottle makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it is absorb by the skin quickly</li>
            <li>I deeply appreciated that this great product brought back rejuvenation to my skin as well as boosted my confidence !</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, smother, more even toned and all around better and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any significant change in my fine lines or skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This serum is very easy to apply, it has a very subtle and very fine fragrance, it absorbs really well into the skin and leaves a natural shine on skin, which for me is the best part.</li>
            <li>Works great on wrinkles &amp;  discoloration &amp; dark spots.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much smoother, and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li>My skin has not been this smooth and even in years; so much so, I no longer have to use liquid foundation to cover the pigmentation and even my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My face seems to love me for giving it this nice drink of sunshine and is repaying me by diminishing the few lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>ive been using a different kind of serum</li>
            <li>so far it is safe to use i dont hve any skin issues with it.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is so readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>It does take some time for this serum to absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to be effective, but it&#x27;s not harsh.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural and organic product.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My over all tone is finally back to what it used to be, looking healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>excelent and fresh product</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful - an orange and very subtle spice that makes me smile.  </li>
            <li>And it is really inexpensive and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It came in just two days and my daughter and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>I use it right after cleansing in the morning and at nights.  </li>
            <li>right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>My first favorite part is the natural quality of this cream.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t greasy but adds a beautiful, healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but the cheap dispensing bottle, not so much.  </li>
            <li>My friend of 40 years called me and asked &amp;#34; what kind of liquid of make up or loose powder you are using now ?</li>
            <li>I usually have problems with any kind of lotion or moisturizer on my face, as I break out easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and soothing on my skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation using this product.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and will definately purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This product is so light and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like so many other products.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh orange smell and it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Although, I wasn&#x27;t using my oils at night since using this product because I truly wanted to put this to the test first.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Ultimate Vitamin C Serum and plan to purchase it again for myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li>I have been trying various products to help smooth out the lines around my eyes and help lighten the circles that seemed to appear after having a baby (no sleep!).  </li>
            <li>I first tried this prouct as  </li>
            <li>I use it under my daily sunscreen and just love this product.</li>
            <li>Would rate this higher</li>
            <li>Also love that the company will email you just one time to see if you like it and if you have any feed back for them.</li>
            <li>Because of all the benefits of Vit C for skin, I decided to try one more time with a different serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not often compelled to write a review on many products I buy, but this has truly made a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin after just ten days of use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I need just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>I also did not notice any improvement in my skin only more acne</li>
            <li>The first day I used Viva la Vida, my husband and another person told me that my skin was glowing</li>
            <li>Works very well for me!</li>
            <li>Please be aware this is a serum, not a lotion type consistency.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are still there, but I have to get up really close to the mirror to see them now!</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time this am.  </li>
            <li>I also notice a lot more clarity in my skin tone and can actually go without wearing foundation.  </li>
            <li>There is still plenty of product in there, but you have to open the top and &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out.  </li>
            <li>I only use it in the mornings and it keeps my skin hydrated and happy all day despite living in a dry climate .</li>
            <li>, skin looks more fresh and not so dry.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been very dry and this Viva la Vida natural skin care product makes my skin feel so good when it is applied.  </li>
            <li>The bottle worked good initially but later it wouldnt get the serum out.</li>
            <li>did they pay for all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>This feels really good on my face - hard to say I&#x27;ve seen a big difference, but I like it and will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using Viva la Vida for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Then after I applied the first pump to my finger to get ready to put it on my face</li>
            <li>and I think my using it for a long time is the reason I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, after only a few week a of using it my face feels soft even if I have not AppleScript the product.</li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The metered amount that is dispensed when the pump is pushed is adequate to cover the face so there is no waste.  </li>
            <li>It certainly claimed what it was meant to do.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to everyone who is looking for an inexpensive anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly giving this 5/5</li>
            <li>It stops dispensing when it gets to a certain point.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks more luminous, my dark facial spots have diminished and my skin and has a healthy supple feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve had to have multiple cortisone shots and my skin had become discolored in those areas but the discoloration has become less noticeable after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it for a great length of time</li>
            <li>the product itself is very light, can certainly be used along with moisturizer/ foundation or whatever other products you use routinely.</li>
            <li>As far as my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; (laugh lines and lines between my brows)</li>
            <li>and i am having some irritation but thanks to this Viva la vida serum</li>
            <li>and honestly it really helps my darkspot</li>
            <li>Thanks to this</li>
            <li>so much for trying this product out...</li>
            <li>but it works really well too.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks using this product I really feel my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>This is a medium weight, light yellow lotion.</li>
            <li>How unusual is that?</li>
            <li>They seem to really care about the feedback.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it was a faulty container or if the amount is really that sparse.</li>
            <li>It gave me a glow and made my skin look and feels very youthful.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I also want to note that this company cares about their customer and really values the customer&#x27;s feedback.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has actually helped my skin look a lot cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect any real firming-but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it was working real well....</li>
            <li>and I notice a difference, my skin feels and looks very hydrated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but gradually I could really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really moisturized, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>You can feel your skin absorbing the lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this but makes my face really greasy when using it during the day.</li>
            <li>They all seemed over-priced for what they accomplished.  </li>
            <li>and I can see real improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum and will recommend to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please rectify this because this is really upsetting.</li>
            <li>My skin absolutely glows.</li>
            <li>It looked and smeeled nice but makes my skin feel oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li>They are working on a 100% natural ingredients formula, which would be the only thing I would recommend to make this product better.</li>
            <li>I believe ALL good reviews left by not real people for promotion purpose.</li>
            <li>All we can do is help ourselves to age more gracefully and hopefully with less wrinkles to show for it ;)</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing a new bottle very soon!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any significant changes in my facial skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am using it as directed on clean skin, twice a day, and following it with a moisturizer (that includes sunscreen).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of days, so I can&#x27;t offer a full review as to efficacy, but in the first few uses, I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in this formulation as some of the ingredients are natural sunscreens and I have been hoping to find something to avoid the chemical junk.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again but to see full potential, need to combine it with another product.</li>
            <li>I feel that while it would absolutely be better than nothing long-term, this be viewed as a vitamin C serum - not your entire facial care regimen - and supplemented with a product containing more active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay odd.....</li>
            <li>We will definitely be ordering more of this and will continue to use it in our daily routine.</li>
            <li>I use this serum mainly during the daytime.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who is looking into  vitamin C serum shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this one in particular.</li>
            <li>I am excited about improvements with long term use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enought for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels wet and smooth going</li>
            <li>I really like how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I am an over 60 years old gal who still wants to take care of herself.</li>
            <li>(I have very oily skin and have some acne, even though I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>This product really works and leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The texture is much smoother and elasticity has improved considerably.</li>
            <li>It also left my face feeling sticky even though I used the product according to the directions which stated that it would be fully absorbed in five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I would have been completely satisfied with just the Vitamin C, but the Antioxidants, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Green Tea were added bonuses.  </li>
            <li>Well it has been a couple weeks of using twice a day and when I look in the mirror I actually smile because I do believe I am looking younger.</li>
            <li>This goes on wonderfully smooth and light, absorbed immediately and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy, heavy or tight feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I began using it regularly (about 3 times a week) and it has helped with smoothing my skin and giving my face a brightness right after I put it on.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and a little bit covers a reasonable amount of skin.</li>
            <li>(well, I hadn&#x27;t considering I live in Minnesota</li>
            <li>I wish they produced a few other items, but sometimes, doing one superbly is better than several of less than great products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin does glow and it is so very soft.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering another very soon!</li>
            <li>and I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Used daily during AM first applied with protection from moisturizing sun block.  </li>
            <li>I already bought a second one for when I run out of the first.</li>
            <li>I think people call those lines &amp;#34;furrows&amp;#34; and I have 2 that were pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to see what other benefits I am deriving from it.</li>
            <li>In the past I have tried many skin care, anti-aging products and have never felt the urge or need to re-purchase any of them.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other serums, and I have never found a higher percentage of Vitamin C in any other product, nor have I ever received such amazing results.</li>
            <li>only a small amount is needed and it leaves your skin feeling silky and toned..works well on its own or with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; looking but nothing to totally WOW over.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really made such a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;re worried about vitamin C creams, give this one a try.</li>
            <li>However i am sensitive to smells, and my face smells  like smoke.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural, too.</li>
            <li>So far my acne scars and acne has improved since using this serum.</li>
            <li>Plus its natural.</li>
            <li>my face, it&#x27;s as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>how smooth my skin looks - have even had a few compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>This is also quite affordable, I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for a similar product.  </li>
            <li>I am 28 years old</li>
            <li>My 22 year old daughter loves the serum as well.</li>
            <li>I needed something to make me look like the 31 year old that I am.  </li>
            <li>Like the texture etc, but this stuff smells like old man&#x27;s urine, and the smell lingers on your face til you put another product (sunscreen) over it.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin yet.  </li>
            <li>I have used this faithfully for 3 weeks so far and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and you do not need but a few dots...</li>
            <li>It appears to be working so far.</li>
            <li>Pump is easily controlled and dispenses a small amount.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>i lost my bottle when it was half full...</li>
            <li>Lid bottle not tight.</li>
            <li>I rarely use any type of moisturizer or serum on my face due to my sensitivity.</li>
            <li>A tight satisfied, not too dry or not too creamy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I ran errands last week, and for the first time in over a decade, I left the house without makeup.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you want a natural Vit C serum!!</li>
            <li>Usually it takes about a week with the free shipping to deliver anything.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure exactly that my wrinkles have diminished (I am 70 and have a few), but my skin looks firmer and more glowy</li>
            <li>I have received numerous comments on my new glow.</li>
            <li>I have used the entire product and will be ordering a new one.  </li>
            <li>Ijust  got this to review and love the feel of it, as a small drop or two goes a long way, it moisturizes without being oily,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>really improves skin tone and  complexion, not only initially</li>
            <li>I noticed the pleasant smell (Doesn&#x27;t stink like alcohol or artificial fragrance).</li>
            <li>And it smells terrific with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>On my face (oily, sensitive) it made my face feel hot, was slightly oily and sticky, and made me break</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting few months to write a review about this product, due to the fact that most skin products don’t show results immediately.</li>
            <li>Generally, I don&#x27;t write reviews but this lotion deserve mentioning.</li>
            <li>I have also had regular professional facials.  </li>
            <li>With consistent use it has eliminated dark sports on my skin.</li>
            <li>* Fragrance: Grapefruit scented, from natural grapefruit essential oil&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used several skin products, this is one of my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>Dry and normal skin.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin the way so many other products have and at considerably less cost than so many expensive department store brands.  </li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin C serums and this one is a much smoother application.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much younger, clearer, and more vibrant, my dark aging spots have lightened up and I feel at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>Before this product, I have several skin care products including some very high end ones, but to my dismay none worked as advertised or as expected.</li>
            <li>I only used this organic Ultimate Vitamin C product for one week and it completely rejuvenated my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have always had dry skin.</li>
            <li>Since March 5, I have noticed an appreciable difference in the depth of the wrinkles and they really are much less visible.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are getting much lighter and the tone of my skin is improving immensely.  </li>
            <li>I am certain that the improvement in my wrinkles/creases is due to the Vitamin C serum because I have used argan oil for a long time.</li>
            <li>Which I find odd, as I always seek out products without fragrance, and citrus is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>And no, its not hot where I live, in Alaska.</li>

            <li> This serum has a wonderful texture - light and glides easily onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> Is it best for a certain skin type?:</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>

            <li> OK kind of pricey.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my face just looks better, period.</li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>

            <li> I bought this serum based on the the natural ingredients and all of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am not a person who gets excited about skin care or special creams that are supposed to do amazing things, but here I am, going to tell you how incredible this facial serum is.  </li>
            <li> On my arm (normal skin) it felt pleasant.</li>

            <li> Wonderful light fragrance, left my skin clean and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I read all of these great reviews and the only thing this product did</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> My household is smoke free.  </li>
            <li> I like the feel as I apply it and how my face feels smooth and glows after it is applied.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go as smooth.</li>
            <li> After using for only two weeks I started to see great results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I enjoy this cream.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> Looks cheap and who guarantee the truth about ingredients since no box?</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and not greasy</li>
            <li> One more thing worth mentioning...</li>
            <li> Viva La Vida has made my skin feel so smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and leaves my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous feel with no scent...</li>
            <li> It did not make me break out and goes on smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I used this when I went on vacation everyday and loved the feel good feeling</li>
            <li> and  I am also not so sure I really need something like this, but I have some lines from smiles and still waiting for those to disappear - not terribly concerned if they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I love that the first thing I saw was the Viva La Vida box with an easy to find list of very recognizable ingredients!</li>
            <li> It arrived with a letter from the manufacturer telling me how much I will love this product, I was even more excited to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I bought, and I am telling you, it is amazing, I can see a big difference, my skin is more beautiful and look more younger.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly and is easy to add to a skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks so clear, fine and smooth, and young.&amp;#34; Unimaginable !!</li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is this combination that I am so excited about.</li>
            <li> It really appears to diminish those fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is all natural and organic which is very good in skin and specially to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it on clean skin and then follow with my moisturizer and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky smooth, literally.  </li>
            <li> I use it on a clean face before bedtime and apply a night moisturizer, or not as the mood strikes.</li>
            <li> This is nothing special.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look as good as it does after I have had a facial.  </li>
            <li> So far it has been a nice product.  </li>
            <li> I am beginning to really like my skin a lot better.</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of C serum and saw good result immediately, but over time when I was running out I stopped seeing further improvement</li>
            <li> So still, maybe not a bad product, this one just is not for my skin.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very pleasant, faint citrus scent, and the pump application bottle makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it is absorb by the skin quickly</li>
            <li> I deeply appreciated that this great product brought back rejuvenation to my skin as well as boosted my confidence !</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, smother, more even toned and all around better and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any significant change in my fine lines or skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This serum is very easy to apply, it has a very subtle and very fine fragrance, it absorbs really well into the skin and leaves a natural shine on skin, which for me is the best part.</li>
            <li> Works great on wrinkles &amp;  discoloration &amp; dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much smoother, and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> My skin has not been this smooth and even in years; so much so, I no longer have to use liquid foundation to cover the pigmentation and even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My face seems to love me for giving it this nice drink of sunshine and is repaying me by diminishing the few lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> ive been using a different kind of serum</li>
            <li> so far it is safe to use i dont hve any skin issues with it.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is so readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> It does take some time for this serum to absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to be effective, but it&#x27;s not harsh.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is a natural and organic product.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My over all tone is finally back to what it used to be, looking healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> excelent and fresh product</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful - an orange and very subtle spice that makes me smile.  </li>
            <li> And it is really inexpensive and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It came in just two days and my daughter and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> I use it right after cleansing in the morning and at nights.  </li>
            <li> right between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> My first favorite part is the natural quality of this cream.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t greasy but adds a beautiful, healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but the cheap dispensing bottle, not so much.  </li>
            <li> My friend of 40 years called me and asked &amp;#34; what kind of liquid of make up or loose powder you are using now ?</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with any kind of lotion or moisturizer on my face, as I break out easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and soothing on my skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation using this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and will definately purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This product is so light and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like so many other products.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh orange smell and it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed, I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Although, I wasn&#x27;t using my oils at night since using this product because I truly wanted to put this to the test first.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Ultimate Vitamin C Serum and plan to purchase it again for myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various products to help smooth out the lines around my eyes and help lighten the circles that seemed to appear after having a baby (no sleep!).  </li>
            <li> I first tried this prouct as  </li>
            <li> I use it under my daily sunscreen and just love this product.</li>
            <li> Would rate this higher</li>
            <li> Also love that the company will email you just one time to see if you like it and if you have any feed back for them.</li>
            <li> Because of all the benefits of Vit C for skin, I decided to try one more time with a different serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not often compelled to write a review on many products I buy, but this has truly made a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin after just ten days of use.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I need just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I also did not notice any improvement in my skin only more acne</li>
            <li> The first day I used Viva la Vida, my husband and another person told me that my skin was glowing</li>
            <li> Works very well for me!</li>
            <li> Please be aware this is a serum, not a lotion type consistency.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are still there, but I have to get up really close to the mirror to see them now!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time this am.  </li>
            <li> I also notice a lot more clarity in my skin tone and can actually go without wearing foundation.  </li>
            <li> There is still plenty of product in there, but you have to open the top and &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out.  </li>
            <li> I only use it in the mornings and it keeps my skin hydrated and happy all day despite living in a dry climate .</li>
            <li> , skin looks more fresh and not so dry.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been very dry and this Viva la Vida natural skin care product makes my skin feel so good when it is applied.  </li>
            <li> The bottle worked good initially but later it wouldnt get the serum out.</li>
            <li> did they pay for all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my face - hard to say I&#x27;ve seen a big difference, but I like it and will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using Viva la Vida for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Then after I applied the first pump to my finger to get ready to put it on my face</li>
            <li> and I think my using it for a long time is the reason I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, after only a few week a of using it my face feels soft even if I have not AppleScript the product.</li>
            <li> and I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The metered amount that is dispensed when the pump is pushed is adequate to cover the face so there is no waste.  </li>
            <li> It certainly claimed what it was meant to do.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to everyone who is looking for an inexpensive anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly giving this 5/5</li>
            <li> It stops dispensing when it gets to a certain point.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks more luminous, my dark facial spots have diminished and my skin and has a healthy supple feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve had to have multiple cortisone shots and my skin had become discolored in those areas but the discoloration has become less noticeable after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it for a great length of time</li>
            <li> the product itself is very light, can certainly be used along with moisturizer/ foundation or whatever other products you use routinely.</li>
            <li> As far as my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; (laugh lines and lines between my brows)</li>
            <li> and i am having some irritation but thanks to this Viva la vida serum</li>
            <li> and honestly it really helps my darkspot</li>
            <li> Thanks to this</li>
            <li> so much for trying this product out...</li>
            <li> but it works really well too.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks using this product I really feel my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> This is a medium weight, light yellow lotion.</li>
            <li> How unusual is that?</li>
            <li> They seem to really care about the feedback.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it was a faulty container or if the amount is really that sparse.</li>
            <li> It gave me a glow and made my skin look and feels very youthful.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I also want to note that this company cares about their customer and really values the customer&#x27;s feedback.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has actually helped my skin look a lot cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect any real firming-but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it was working real well....</li>
            <li> and I notice a difference, my skin feels and looks very hydrated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but gradually I could really see a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really moisturized, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> You can feel your skin absorbing the lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this but makes my face really greasy when using it during the day.</li>
            <li> They all seemed over-priced for what they accomplished.  </li>
            <li> and I can see real improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and will recommend to try it.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please rectify this because this is really upsetting.</li>
            <li> My skin absolutely glows.</li>
            <li> It looked and smeeled nice but makes my skin feel oily after a few hours.</li>
            <li> They are working on a 100% natural ingredients formula, which would be the only thing I would recommend to make this product better.</li>
            <li> I believe ALL good reviews left by not real people for promotion purpose.</li>
            <li> All we can do is help ourselves to age more gracefully and hopefully with less wrinkles to show for it ;)</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing a new bottle very soon!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any significant changes in my facial skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am using it as directed on clean skin, twice a day, and following it with a moisturizer (that includes sunscreen).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of days, so I can&#x27;t offer a full review as to efficacy, but in the first few uses, I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in this formulation as some of the ingredients are natural sunscreens and I have been hoping to find something to avoid the chemical junk.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again but to see full potential, need to combine it with another product.</li>
            <li> I feel that while it would absolutely be better than nothing long-term, this be viewed as a vitamin C serum - not your entire facial care regimen - and supplemented with a product containing more active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay odd.....</li>
            <li> We will definitely be ordering more of this and will continue to use it in our daily routine.</li>
            <li> I use this serum mainly during the daytime.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who is looking into  vitamin C serum shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this one in particular.</li>
            <li> I am excited about improvements with long term use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enought for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels wet and smooth going</li>
            <li> I really like how soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I am an over 60 years old gal who still wants to take care of herself.</li>
            <li> (I have very oily skin and have some acne, even though I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> This product really works and leaves my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The texture is much smoother and elasticity has improved considerably.</li>
            <li> It also left my face feeling sticky even though I used the product according to the directions which stated that it would be fully absorbed in five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I would have been completely satisfied with just the Vitamin C, but the Antioxidants, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Green Tea were added bonuses.  </li>
            <li> Well it has been a couple weeks of using twice a day and when I look in the mirror I actually smile because I do believe I am looking younger.</li>
            <li> This goes on wonderfully smooth and light, absorbed immediately and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy, heavy or tight feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I began using it regularly (about 3 times a week) and it has helped with smoothing my skin and giving my face a brightness right after I put it on.</li>
            <li> The texture is light and a little bit covers a reasonable amount of skin.</li>
            <li> (well, I hadn&#x27;t considering I live in Minnesota</li>
            <li> I wish they produced a few other items, but sometimes, doing one superbly is better than several of less than great products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin does glow and it is so very soft.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering another very soon!</li>
            <li> and I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Used daily during AM first applied with protection from moisturizing sun block.  </li>
            <li> I already bought a second one for when I run out of the first.</li>
            <li> I think people call those lines &amp;#34;furrows&amp;#34; and I have 2 that were pretty obvious.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to see what other benefits I am deriving from it.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried many skin care, anti-aging products and have never felt the urge or need to re-purchase any of them.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other serums, and I have never found a higher percentage of Vitamin C in any other product, nor have I ever received such amazing results.</li>
            <li> only a small amount is needed and it leaves your skin feeling silky and toned..works well on its own or with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; looking but nothing to totally WOW over.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really made such a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;re worried about vitamin C creams, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> However i am sensitive to smells, and my face smells  like smoke.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural, too.</li>
            <li> So far my acne scars and acne has improved since using this serum.</li>
            <li> Plus its natural.</li>
            <li> my face, it&#x27;s as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> how smooth my skin looks - have even had a few compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> This is also quite affordable, I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for a similar product.  </li>
            <li> I am 28 years old</li>
            <li> My 22 year old daughter loves the serum as well.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make me look like the 31 year old that I am.  </li>
            <li> Like the texture etc, but this stuff smells like old man&#x27;s urine, and the smell lingers on your face til you put another product (sunscreen) over it.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin yet.  </li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully for 3 weeks so far and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and you do not need but a few dots...</li>
            <li> It appears to be working so far.</li>
            <li> Pump is easily controlled and dispenses a small amount.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> i lost my bottle when it was half full...</li>
            <li> Lid bottle not tight.</li>
            <li> I rarely use any type of moisturizer or serum on my face due to my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> A tight satisfied, not too dry or not too creamy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I ran errands last week, and for the first time in over a decade, I left the house without makeup.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you want a natural Vit C serum!!</li>
            <li> Usually it takes about a week with the free shipping to deliver anything.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly that my wrinkles have diminished (I am 70 and have a few), but my skin looks firmer and more glowy</li>
            <li> I have received numerous comments on my new glow.</li>
            <li> I have used the entire product and will be ordering a new one.  </li>
            <li> Ijust  got this to review and love the feel of it, as a small drop or two goes a long way, it moisturizes without being oily,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> really improves skin tone and  complexion, not only initially</li>
            <li> I noticed the pleasant smell (Doesn&#x27;t stink like alcohol or artificial fragrance).</li>
            <li> And it smells terrific with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> On my face (oily, sensitive) it made my face feel hot, was slightly oily and sticky, and made me break</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting few months to write a review about this product, due to the fact that most skin products don’t show results immediately.</li>
            <li> Generally, I don&#x27;t write reviews but this lotion deserve mentioning.</li>
            <li> I have also had regular professional facials.  </li>
            <li> With consistent use it has eliminated dark sports on my skin.</li>
            <li> * Fragrance: Grapefruit scented, from natural grapefruit essential oil&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used several skin products, this is one of my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> Dry and normal skin.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin the way so many other products have and at considerably less cost than so many expensive department store brands.  </li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serums and this one is a much smoother application.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much younger, clearer, and more vibrant, my dark aging spots have lightened up and I feel at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Before this product, I have several skin care products including some very high end ones, but to my dismay none worked as advertised or as expected.</li>
            <li> I only used this organic Ultimate Vitamin C product for one week and it completely rejuvenated my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have always had dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since March 5, I have noticed an appreciable difference in the depth of the wrinkles and they really are much less visible.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are getting much lighter and the tone of my skin is improving immensely.  </li>
            <li> I am certain that the improvement in my wrinkles/creases is due to the Vitamin C serum because I have used argan oil for a long time.</li>
            <li> Which I find odd, as I always seek out products without fragrance, and citrus is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> And no, its not hot where I live, in Alaska.</li>
            <li> Not harsh like other vitamin c products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be difficult for me to make the decision to purchase this product on a long term basis because of my &amp;#34;frugal&amp;#34; nature and the additional fact that I have never spent any significant money on skin-care products; but, it will NOT be difficult because it is so soothing and the results have been far better than I could have ever anticipated or expected.  </li>
            <li> I have developed several dark spots from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am an older women and started using this product a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> It produced a slightly irritated heat on my face; I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally something with 20 percent vitamin C that won&#x27;t over dry my face.</li>
            <li> I am wary about making claims about efficacy on any product as so many other factors contribute.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, supple &amp; well nourished &amp; a few of my friends</li>
            <li> So I am writing this review after having used up one entire bottle and on to half of the next one.</li>
            <li> Moist, soft, very slightly oily.</li>
            <li> Morning and night, just as suggested, but without the additional creme or lotion afterward (due to oily skin &amp; occasional blemish).</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
            <li> It leaves a dry waxy feel to my face?</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side</li>
            <li> My face has always had both dry and oily parts.</li>
            <li> However, when I pumped the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; out of the container I noticed it was a cream and not the usual Vitamin C clear serum</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Vitamin C Serum fights the ageing appearance of pigmentation by brightening the skin, stimulating cell turnover, diminishing dark spots and restoring radiance.</li>
            <li> Big reduction in dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> No, after about a week or week and a half of using it, it really left my skin oily.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years that promised the world only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I am almost half Irish and prone to redness and blotchiness).</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for a little over a month and definitely notice an improvement in my face.</li>
            <li> , it does not break me out or dry out my skin like other serums.</li>
            <li> (maybe that&#x27;s not really a word).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not much of a beauty regimen girl</li>
            <li> I got this serum within a few days and a personal email from the vendor about the product.  </li>
            <li> and I am having to carefully pour it into my hand</li>
            <li> This product has been added to my daily routine and till now I have reordered it a few times.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few pumps at night and after waiting a few minutes to dry</li>
            <li> arrived quicker then expected!</li>
            <li> This serum does not irritate my skin or cause redness like a lot of other products I have tried including the Olay Regenerist.  </li>
            <li> I said to my husband the other night &amp;#34;feel</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s now past mid August).  </li>
            <li> I can use it every night for maintenance - some other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> One other thing I need to point out is the fact I am using argan oil at bedtime, along with the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> No breakouts, thank goodness, which often happens with other products I&#x27;ve used like Oil of Olay.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any other products that this company produces</li>
            <li> After showering, I apply the Vitamin C, allow to dry for a few minutes while brushing my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried other vitamin C creams in the past, only to find that they made my rosacea worse.</li>
            <li> have tested other brands, expensive and not so much</li>
            <li> my face was a lot brighter and little dark spots were harder to see.</li>
            <li> It seems the dark spots on my face are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Usually I get dry patches this time of year.  </li>
            <li> Lines on my face are less visible, and my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes were less noticeable and after a week my skin tone started to even out</li>
            <li> But I guess not I realize that it was a used product and half of the serum</li>
            <li> I have a new baby, and needless to say</li>
            <li> But, now with this C serum, even the few I have are much less visible.</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem to be healthier than other serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say if it works on wrinkles or not, but it does keep my skin tight, firm, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mother and then borrowed it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have been using Viva la Vida for a few days now</li>
            <li> I tried a Vitamin C serum a few months and it caused irritation to my skin, so I had to quit using it.</li>
            <li> have been too harsh and I would have to use it just a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin - c serums for about 6 months now to keep my skin firm and youthful.</li>
            <li> I am using this serum for a few months now</li>
            <li> Its not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum for about 2 weeks now, so I can&#x27;t point to any dramatic developement.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Perhaps the change is subtle but subtle enough that people notice.</li>
            <li> I had little red broken veins on my cheeks from Rosesa which have now disappeared!  </li>
            <li> The container is not that small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Anti-Aging is supposed to do</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t want to waste a drop!  </li>
            <li> The incision line on my neck can hardly be seen.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t have any bad affect to my skin.</li>
            <li> so it was a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> Never oily or thick.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see some subtle changes.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin that I wasn&#x27;t already achieving with a much less expensive Oil of Olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but that was pretty nasty.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Each time I was on the lookout for redness, but I never experienced any.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical but had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I am guilty of not writing reviews even though I base my purchase on others&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> Lancom wich is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, it made my skin so oily.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really good product. it is absorb by the skin quickly</li>
            <li> Works great on wrinkles &amp;  discoloration &amp; dark spots.  Drawback is the fragrance.  Could do without that.  Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. I definitely notice that my skin has become softer and smoother. As far as my &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; (laugh lines and lines between my brows) I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; looking but nothing to totally WOW over. Not at this point anyway. All in all, I DO like the product and I have super sensitive skin so it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I can wear my make-up over it without it looking cakey. My face does seem brighter since using it, so I will continue to use it and see where it takes me. Perhaps time will tell more. If these are the only results I get though, I believe I would still buy the product. I (will) also use (on top of this/at night) either my Argan oil or Burts Bees Ageless oil. Both are really good products too. Although, I wasn&#x27;t using my oils at night since using this product because I truly wanted to put this to the test first. Perhaps using them together will show different results. Can&#x27;t hurt.......I know wrinkles are inevitable as is age. All we can do is help ourselves to age more gracefully and hopefully with less wrinkles to show for it ;)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I love the way it feels, and it has a wonderful fragrance!</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Good price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells wonderful. My husband commented that my face feels like our baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the Best ever. I am 55 years old and have always had dry skin. This stuff has really made such a difference with my skin. I love it and hope that I can always get it. I use it everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this serum for about 2 weeks now, so I can&#x27;t point to any dramatic developement.&lt;br /&gt;However I love the wonderful scent and how it makes my skin feel. I will update this review as soon I can offer more information.</li>
            <li> I began using this product three days ago.  I think I must be imagining things because my skin already looks better.  Is that even possible?  I am using it as directed on clean skin, twice a day, and following it with a moisturizer (that includes sunscreen).  I am not sure exactly that my wrinkles have diminished (I am 70 and have a few), but my skin looks firmer and more glowy (maybe that&#x27;s not really a word).&lt;br /&gt;I have always loved make-up. and have purchased many skin care products over the years. I have also had regular professional facials.  This product makes my skin look as good as it does after I have had a facial.  I am happy with this product including the price.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> works wonderful, makes your skin feel smooth. try it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have tried other vitamin C creams in the past, only to find that they made my rosacea worse. I bought this cream for my mother and then borrowed it a few times. Each time I was on the lookout for redness, but I never experienced any. Eventually I began using it regularly (about 3 times a week) and it has helped with smoothing my skin and giving my face a brightness right after I put it on. If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;re worried about vitamin C creams, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> arrived quicker then expected! So far feels great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin looks and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested other brands, expensive and not so much and I have to say that this organic product is changing the way my skin feel and looks!</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells good too!</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my face - hard to say I&#x27;ve seen a big difference, but I like it and will order another to give it more time.</li>
            <li> ive been using a different kind of serum and i am having some irritation but thanks to this Viva la vida serum so far it is safe to use i dont hve any skin issues with it.I loved it as its not sticky and makes oily skin.been using this for 2 weeks now and honestly it really helps my darkspot clearer.&lt;br /&gt;It is all natural and organic which is very good in skin and specially to my sensitive skin.Thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;i would lovely recommend this to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;testing provided in review purposes.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product... I read all of these great reviews and the only thing this product did was make me break out.... My aesthetician Ramona used a vitamin c serum on me and it did wonders! I am going to go back to her and ask her what she used and buy that from her...so much for trying this product out...did they pay for all these positive reviews? This is nothing special.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Seeing is believing.  I see results. Not harsh like other vitamin c products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any significant change in my fine lines or skin tone.  It also left my face feeling sticky even though I used the product according to the directions which stated that it would be fully absorbed in five minutes.  I use a silk pillow case and was concerned about leaving a residue on the case.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My friend of 40 years called me and asked &amp;#34; what kind of liquid of make up or loose powder you are using now ? Your skin looks so clear, fine and smooth, and young.&amp;#34; Unimaginable !! I only used this organic Ultimate Vitamin C product for one week and it completely rejuvenated my skin. I reordered 5 bottles to share it as a Mother&#x27;s gift with my best friend and relatives. I deeply appreciated that this great product brought back rejuvenation to my skin as well as boosted my confidence !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Ultimate Vitamin C Serum and plan to purchase it again for myself and my daughter. I have tried other serums, and I have never found a higher percentage of Vitamin C in any other product, nor have I ever received such amazing results. I would have been completely satisfied with just the Vitamin C, but the Antioxidants, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Green Tea were added bonuses.  My skin has been severely pigmented for years, and I believed it was something I was fated to suffer with forever.  On the contrary, after I began using the serum, my skin is already reaping the beautiful benefits of this product. The Ultimate Vitamin C Serum fights the ageing appearance of pigmentation by brightening the skin, stimulating cell turnover, diminishing dark spots and restoring radiance. My skin has not been this smooth and even in years; so much so, I no longer have to use liquid foundation to cover the pigmentation and even my skin tone. I ran errands last week, and for the first time in over a decade, I left the house without makeup. I am approaching one month with the serum and I have seen impressive results which get better with longer use, which is why I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I have bought this repeatedly and will again.</li>
            <li> Excellent skincare serum ! I have been using it for over a month and my skin looks so much better. I only use it in the mornings and it keeps my skin hydrated and happy all day despite living in a dry climate . I honestly love this product. I have had many compliments on my complexion since using this and I love how it makes my skin look and feel.  -Steve&#x27;s wife!</li>
            <li> Very good products. It&#x27;s gentle enought for my sensitive skin. With consistent use it has eliminated dark sports on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ijust  got this to review and love the feel of it, as a small drop or two goes a long way, it moisturizes without being oily,&lt;br /&gt;and has a discreet, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This serum had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. I will admit that I was skeptical but had nothing to lose. Well it has been a couple weeks of using twice a day and when I look in the mirror I actually smile because I do believe I am looking younger. I will be ordering again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. It came in just two days and my daughter and I started using it right away. Not only does it smell great but it works really well too. We have been using it now for just about a week and we are very happy with the results. We will definitely be ordering more of this and will continue to use it in our daily routine.</li>
            <li> Best Anti Aging serum!&lt;br /&gt;Cant get enough of it, notice big results using twice a day</li>
            <li> I have been trying various products to help smooth out the lines around my eyes and help lighten the circles that seemed to appear after having a baby (no sleep!).  I have been using Viva la Vida for a few days now and I can already see some subtle changes. my skin feels softer too. Looking froward to seeing more changes in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks using this product I really feel my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> A Must Have! I hv been using the Ultimate Anti Aging Vitamin C Serum for a couple to 3 weeks now &amp; I can&#x27;t say enough good things abt it! My skin feels soft, supple &amp; well nourished &amp; a few of my friends hv said my skin has a glow. I will definitely be ordering another very soon!</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fragrance: Grapefruit scented, from natural grapefruit essential oil&lt;br /&gt;* Feel during application: This is a medium weight, light yellow lotion. It feels wet and smooth going on.&lt;br /&gt;* Feel after absorption: Moist, soft, very slightly oily. It produced a slightly irritated heat on my face; I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Is it best for a certain skin type?: Dry and normal skin. On my arm (normal skin) it felt pleasant. On my face (oily, sensitive) it made my face feel hot, was slightly oily and sticky, and made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;* Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;* Packaging: 1oz plastic pump bottle; possibly an airless pump but I can&#x27;t see inside it to tell. Pump is easily controlled and dispenses a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;* Immediate cosmetic effects: Plumpens, reduces fine lines, makes skin look fresher and brighter. The cosmetic results are excellent and if this hadn&#x27;t made me break out, it&#x27;d be a five-star product.&lt;br /&gt;* Potential long-term effectiveness:* Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and the various herbal oils and extracts are all going to be excellent for your skin. I feel that while it would absolutely be better than nothing long-term, this be viewed as a vitamin C serum - not your entire facial care regimen - and supplemented with a product containing more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.eview.

            <li> this stuff feels great and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> Im sure this is a great product.  However i am sensitive to smells, and my face smells  like smoke.  So I can&#x27;t use it because of the smell.  My household is smoke free.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> I love the result and love the price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any significant changes in my facial skin tone. I use it morning and night before my moisturizer. Only draw back is that it leaves my face feeling tacky which I don&#x27;t like, it would be better if it sank in the skin more.</li>
            <li> Smaller volume/amount than the bottle makes you think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this serum, my face feels more hydrating and firm.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Just love this product.  I have received numerous comments on my new glow.</li>
            <li> I first tried this prouct as  I was very impressed with the ingredients. The reviews seemed to support this. I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month and know I will be purchasing more. I actually look froward to using it. The aroma is delightful- very fresh and citrus. Which I find odd, as I always seek out products without fragrance, and citrus is my least favorite.The texture is light and a little bit covers a reasonable amount of skin. I use it on my face and neck. What really impressed me was the corresponence I received from the owner of the company. How unusual is that? They seem to really care about the feedback. I wish they produced a few other items, but sometimes, doing one superbly is better than several of less than great products. I am wary about making claims about efficacy on any product as so many other factors contribute. But I - say, I am very pleased with the way my skin looks and feels-especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I use it on my face and chest. It does not leave a greasy feel. It smells wonderful!! I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> very good serum. would like to see and all over body lotion like it</li>
            <li> It is a good serum, but to be truthful, I have not seen any outstanding results.  In fact, I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin that I wasn&#x27;t already achieving with a much less expensive Oil of Olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am an older women and started using this product a few months ago.  So far it has been a nice product.  Not heavy.  It has a wonderful light smell to it.  I believe it helps my skin a lot.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Viva la Vida Vitamin C serum is a great product!  It really appears to diminish those fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow.  I have used this product for two weeks and my skin looks great and I have been able to skip the foundation in the morning.  The Vitamin C serum also smells great with an awesome citrus scent that awakens me in the morning.  I use it daily and find it moisturizing without being overly greasy.  I use it under my daily sunscreen and just love this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;After working at the beach for many years I have developed several dark spots from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a month I feel my skin tone has improved greatly.&lt;br /&gt;Generally my skin looks more luminous, my dark facial spots have diminished and my skin and has a healthy supple feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this product again and letting all my beach loving friends know a bout it!!</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with this vitamin C Serum.  I like the feel as I apply it and how my face feels smooth and glows after it is applied. I have used other vitamin C serums and this one is a much smoother application. Sometimes I apply an evening moisturizer after using the vitamin C serum (like I am supposed to), with or without my face feels wonderful.  I will try and be a faithful user of Viva la Vida....like I try to floss every evening.  Thank you for producing a nice and clean product.</li>
            <li> This is as close to a magic as it gets. It is no hyperbole to call it anti-aging.  My face looks and feels great!  And it is really inexpensive and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I rarely use any type of moisturizer or serum on my face due to my sensitivity. Viva la Vida used 70% organic products. I use this under my eyes and have not had any problems. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple days so I&#x27;ll update more as I use it more!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Feels great, makes skin glow. I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of days, so I can&#x27;t offer a full review as to efficacy, but in the first few uses, I&#x27;m in love.  I was interested in this formulation as some of the ingredients are natural sunscreens and I have been hoping to find something to avoid the chemical junk.  This goes on wonderfully smooth and light, absorbed immediately and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy, heavy or tight feeling at all.  Felt like wearing nothing.  The scent is wonderful - an orange and very subtle spice that makes me smile.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t improve my skin tone at all, the act of putting this serum on is truly a bright spot in my morning.</li>
            <li> I love this and have bought it often.  I have the dryest skin and am will be 47 next month (skin a-changin!) and it&#x27;s perfect for moisturizing, tone, brightness and all around awesomeness.  Thank you Viva!</li>
            <li> Would rate this higher but I literally used the product 4 times on my face and it was out. I have no idea if it was a faulty container or if the amount is really that sparse. The container is not that small so it was a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> My first favorite part is the natural quality of this cream. Secondly, it is so readily absorbed. The depth of it&#x27;s penetration can be felt all day or all night. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product leaves skin soft without any breakouts have noticed Sun spots fading along with my fine lines will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> This product was fabulous!  It certainly claimed what it was meant to do.  It gave me a glow and made my skin look and feels very youthful.  I have used the entire product and will be ordering a new one.  Thank you Viva La Vida!&lt;br /&gt;Lilly</li>
            <li> Love love love this! My sister gave it to me for Easter and I have been hooked ever since. This goes on really nice and light and soaks right in. No greasy feel at all. And I think my face looks really good these days- especially since I&#x27;m getting up there in age! (53).  Also love that the company will email you just one time to see if you like it and if you have any feed back for them. They don&#x27;t keep bugging you which is a plus. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tried a Vitamin C serum a few months and it caused irritation to my skin, so I had to quit using it. Because of all the benefits of Vit C for skin, I decided to try one more time with a different serum. So I have been using Viva la Vida now for about 3 weeks and I just LOVE it !! It is very gentle and soothing on my skin, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation using this product. Its very hydrating and feels great when applying to my face. I can see my skin tone has improved and also seeing an improvement with the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth in just the short time I&#x27;ve been using this product. I definitely recommend this Vitamin C serum to everyone looking for this type of skin product.</li>
            <li> I loved this serum!  Wonderful light fragrance, left my skin clean and fresh feeling.  Citrus fragrance and loved the feeling after you use it.  A tight satisfied, not too dry or not too creamy feeling.  I used this when I went on vacation everyday and loved the feel good feeling I had every time I used it.  This is a great serum and I wish I could review it later on when time passes and I have definite results. I have tested this product for an honest opinion and really liked it.</li>
            <li> This serum works for me.  This serum does not irritate my skin or cause redness like a lot of other products I have tried including the Olay Regenerist.  In addition, it makes my skin feel soft and supple and gives my skin a  wonderful texture.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for about 30 days and my skin tone is more even and smooth without irritation.  Also, noticed that it does not cause any breakouts to my skin.  I use this serum mainly during the daytime.  I apply it on clean skin and then follow with my moisturizer and sunscreen.  I also want to note that this company cares about their customer and really values the customer&#x27;s feedback.  Please try it for yourself.  I think you will be very happy you did.</li>
            <li> Love this.  So creamy; lines are disappearing.  Face feels smoother.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural, too.</li>
            <li> After using this serum my skin felt moisturized and looked brighter. It does take some time for this serum to absorbed into your skin.  I have sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t have any bad affect to my skin. I use this serum on my face and back because vitamin C is suppose to help with acne and acne scars. So far my acne scars and acne has improved since using this serum. The ingredients seem to be healthier than other serums I have used in the past. I received this vitamin c serum to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t change the ingredients in this product. I love what this moisturizer has done to my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum. The scent has a light clean orange smell, which I love! I have oily/sensitive skin and this serum feels great on my face without irritation. The consistency seems a bit more of a cream than a serum, but nonetheless still helps moisturize and brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this c serum! This one&#x27;s staying in my skin care routine. Great price too. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have another product I&#x27;m using by skin medica and I like it better. I will give this product a fair try. It leaves a dry waxy feel to my face?</li>
            <li> Started using this product a couple of weeks ago.. have had very good results.  Does not leave my face oily..only a small amount is needed and it leaves your skin feeling silky and toned..works well on its own or with a moisturizer.  I like this product very much and will definately purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has actually helped my skin look a lot cleaner.  Plus its natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not often compelled to write a review on many products I buy, but this has truly made a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin after just ten days of use.  It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin the way so many other products have and at considerably less cost than so many expensive department store brands.  This has exceeded my expectations and will be recommended to my family and friends.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using Viva la Vida for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Viva la Vida for about 3 weeks now. I have very dry skin so have always used a moisturizer at night. I have switched to Viva la Vida and am loving it. I said to my husband the other night &amp;#34;feel my face, it&#x27;s as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve also noticed a difference in how smooth my skin looks - have even had a few compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it. I would highly recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> OK kind of pricey. I like watts serum much better won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Love how light it feels on the skin.  Never oily or thick.  My dark spots are getting much lighter and the tone of my skin is improving immensely.  I will definitely keep using it. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product .</li>
            <li> I used this cream on the 1.5 inch scar from a procedure I had back in June (It&#x27;s now past mid August).  The incision line on my neck can hardly be seen.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am not much of a beauty regimen girl so the simpler the better.  I love that I can pronounce every ingredient in this product. I have used this product for 18 days now and notice an improvement in the texture of skin around my eyes. The tissue looks smoother and feels softer throughout the day. I am excited about improvements with long term use.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, it made my skin so oily. Doesn&#x27;t go as smooth. There is no feeling of refreshed, energized at all. I went with origins products way better results.</li>
            <li> This product is actually good. Feels very nice on my skin. Will get more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum faithfully for over a month and I do believe that it has improved the look of my face. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I received my Viva La Vida serum last week. I put off writing a review until I used it; I have had sensitivity to skincare products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT!  It actually improved the texture of my skin. I didn&#x27;t expect any real firming-but it&#x27;s there. I love the fact that I need just a tiny bit. I can only hope that Viva La Vida comes out with a sunscreen/moisturizer that I can use in the morning. I would be set! Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for several weeks now.  I made a switch from another serum I was using and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This serum has a wonderful texture - light and glides easily onto my skin.  The smell is delicious!  A bit citrusy.  Most importantly my skin is glowing and even.  It really seems to be effective, but it&#x27;s not harsh.  I can use it every night for maintenance - some other products I&#x27;ve used have been too harsh and I would have to use it just a few times a week.  This is also quite affordable, I&#x27;ve paid twice as much for a similar product.  Thank you Viva la Vida, I&#x27;ll be back.  Also thanks for the quick ship, nice packaging, and follow up care!</li>
            <li> I started using Viva la Vida at the perfect time, WINTER, the driest time of year. My skin would just soak up most moisturizers like a sponge. This product is so light and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like so many other products. It smells great too. I really like how soft my skin feels. I get compliments on the glow of skin even when I am not wearing any make up. That is enough proof for me that it has made a glowing and skin toning difference. I will be reordering and recommending this product.</li>
            <li> After researching for about 2 hours for the best Vitamin C serum on the market, this product advertised it was organic, free of most things, had natural ingredients, and was certified by a couple of government entities......I thought to myself \\&quot;this is it!\\&quot; I loved the price, the packaging and all of the descriptions the product had to offer. So i purchased it...of course. It arrived with a letter from the manufacturer telling me how much I will love this product, I was even more excited to try it. However, when I pumped the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; out of the container I noticed it was a cream and not the usual Vitamin C clear serum that I am use to.....okay odd.....I will still give it a try maybe it will do wanders for my skin. No, after about a week or week and a half of using it, it really left my skin oily. So still, maybe not a bad product, this one just is not for my skin. Again i have a combination skin and it even left my cheeks looking like I just rubbed baby oil on them.   UPDATE: Returning the product was very easy and I received a full refund. Great company to do business with. This product just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had reviewed this a week ago but wanted to add an update, my skin looks even better! Can&#x27;t wait to see what a month  will do. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky smooth, literally.  Have noted improvement in skin overall.  Many people have complimented me on my skin and ask what skincare do I use.  I tell them about this product, Viva da Vida and I use olive oil as a moisturizer and eye makeup remover.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, and to get compliments at 56 years of age makes me happy!</li>
            <li> I have never used a vitamin c serum before but a family member told me about Viva la Vida so I thought I would try it and I was very pleasantly surprised! I love the fresh orange smell and it makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed, I do have very sensitive skin and this did not cause any problems for me. I would definitely recommend and buy this vitamin c serum again.</li>
            <li> Great Customer Service!!!  Product is awesome as well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with this product!  Lines on my face are less visible, and my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> When combined with hyaluronic acid skin cream product, worked great to make skin more supple and more clear.  Used daily during AM first applied with protection from moisturizing sun block.  Would buy again but to see full potential, need to combine it with another product.</li>
            <li> i lost my bottle when it was half full... but it was working real well.... my face was a lot brighter and little dark spots were harder to see.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product! Have been using it for about 3 weeks now, my skin feels and looks great! I use it twice a day plus mix it with my BB cream. Finally found the product that works for my skin!</li>
            <li> After using for only two weeks I started to see great results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and will continue buying this product.  I love it!</li>
            <li> It looked and smeeled nice but makes my skin feel oily after a few hours. I also did not notice any improvement in my skin only more acne</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin, and the price felt good, too</li>
            <li> Good product. I notice the results. If I was judging strictly on product quality I would give it 5 stars. However, after purchasing it, I discovered that TJ Maxx sells Vitamin C Serum for around $10, albeit a different brand. So I will purchase from there in the future and save $25.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a keeper and a repeater.  I can now rate this product after using for about three weeks continuously. Goes on smoothly and my skin looks brighter and more hydrated.  I use it right after cleansing in the morning and at nights.  Also, the seller, Viva la Vida Natural Skincare was very courteous and checked in with me a couple times to find out how I liked their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting few months to write a review about this product, due to the fact that most skin products don’t show results immediately. With that said, 6 weeks after using the Ultimate Anti-Aging Vitamin C Serum I can see vast difference in my skin condition. My skin looks much younger, clearer, and more vibrant, my dark aging spots have lightened up and I feel at least 10 years younger. In addition, my best friend and family have seen the difference as well, hence I ordered the serum for my mom and my BFF.  I would certainly recommend this product to everyone who is looking for an inexpensive anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> I have used several skin products, this is one of my favorites so far. I have only been using for four days and I notice a difference, my skin feels and looks very hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product. The best part about this product is all natural ingredients, not expensive like the others I have tried and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful. It is not greasy, nor does it make my skin feel or look oily. I use it morning and evening.  My skin feels very soft. While the product itself is terrific, I can&#x27;t say enough about Viva la Vida as a company. Their customer service is second to none. Immediate responses to questions, knowledgeable about skincare and products. Would (and do) buy from them again!</li>
            <li> Finally something with 20 percent vitamin C that won&#x27;t over dry my face.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum with quality ingredients that easily absorb into the skin.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. I use it on a clean face before bedtime and apply a night moisturizer, or not as the mood strikes. This is my third bottle, and I feel it is truly making a difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Anti-Aging is supposed to do and  I am also not so sure I really need something like this, but I have some lines from smiles and still waiting for those to disappear - not terribly concerned if they don&#x27;t.  But what I will say is that my skin IS visibly brighter - like being kissed by the sun! People have noticed and commented on my skin looking really nice.  Usually I get dry patches this time of year.  Nothing but soft beautiful healthy looking skin!!!  I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is fantastic! I love that it is a natural and organic product. My skin is on the dry side so I definitely like that this product is moisturizing. I feel that my skin is more hydrated and glowing. I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> This company seems to really care about the quality of their products and has superb customer service.  They are working on a 100% natural ingredients formula, which would be the only thing I would recommend to make this product better.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this cream. It is very light and has a light orange fragrance. I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin as yet but I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
            <li> Fifty is fabulous when you have wonderful skin care products to help you stay young looking. I&#x27;ve been so happy with this product! My skin has never felt so smooth and moisturized and I love the wonderful healthy glow its given my face. I would recommend this to anyone of any age.</li>
            <li> What I like about this serum is that my skin looks and feels more healthy. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but gradually I could really see a difference. I definitely will continue using Viva la Vida!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I already bought a second one for when I run out of the first. My skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I bought, and I am telling you, it is amazing, I can see a big difference, my skin is more beautiful and look more younger. Just one week, i hope this serum shall never finish.</li>
            <li> I am guilty of not writing reviews even though I base my purchase on others&#x27; reviews. But for this product, I just had to come back and share what I feel. So I am writing this review after having used up one entire bottle and on to half of the next one. Before this product, I have several skin care products including some very high end ones, but to my dismay none worked as advertised or as expected. Then one day during my research of finding yet another skin care product, I stumbled upon this. I decided to take a leap of faith and order one, and I am so glad I did. This serum is very easy to apply, it has a very subtle and very fine fragrance, it absorbs really well into the skin and leaves a natural shine on skin, which for me is the best part. I am beginning to really like my skin a lot better. It feels fresh and hydrated. I say, definitely try to find out if this works for you too, because if it does then you won&#x27;t have to look anywhere. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I return it. This serum comes with NO box. Lid bottle not tight. Looks cheap and who guarantee the truth about ingredients since no box? Not registered product, no licensed. I believe ALL good reviews left by not real people for promotion purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing to my face. It helps even tone my skin. It seems the dark spots on my face are getting lighter. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> At last a product that does what it says it will do. I have used many products over the years that promised the world only to be disappointed. Looking forward to the expansion of the product line.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I noticed differences in my skin after only a couple of weeks. It absorbs so quickly and is easy to add to a skin care regimen. The price is unbeatable for the quantity and quality. And it smells terrific with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> The first day I used Viva la Vida, my husband and another person told me that my skin was glowing and they thought I&#x27;d been in the sun that day (well, I hadn&#x27;t considering I live in Minnesota and it is the winter!).  My skin felt really moisturized, but not greasy.  I usually have problems with any kind of lotion or moisturizer on my face, as I break out easily.  I didn&#x27;t with Viva la Vida!  I recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely but remains somewhat sticky on the skin for hours. I&#x27;ll use it up but won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Just like the food I eat, I try to buy beauty products made from things that I can pronounce and am familiar with (since my skin is going to absorb it into my body!). I love that the first thing I saw was the Viva La Vida box with an easy to find list of very recognizable ingredients! Then after I applied the first pump to my finger to get ready to put it on my face I noticed the pleasant smell (Doesn&#x27;t stink like alcohol or artificial fragrance). Honestly, it makes me think of sherbert. It went on smooth and not greasy and I swear I started noticing a difference the next day. The lines around my eyes were less noticeable and after a week my skin tone started to even out (I am almost half Irish and prone to redness and blotchiness). Also acne scars on my cheeks that I have had for years have faded. I also use it on my neck and chest where it gets a lot of sun exposure. Very nice product!</li>
            <li> Usually it takes about a week with the free shipping to deliver anything.  I got this serum within a few days and a personal email from the vendor about the product.  My skin feels healthier after just a couple weeks.  It only takes a few pumps at night and after waiting a few minutes to dry I use my nightly cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works so well with my skin:) Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Works very well for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin - c serums for about 6 months now to keep my skin firm and youthful. I am 28 years old so I cannot say if it works on wrinkles or not, but it does keep my skin tight, firm, and glowing. Please be aware this is a serum, not a lotion type consistency. I use a cotton ball to put this on. I use it at night before my moisturizer, it does not break me out or dry out my skin like other serums. Would recommend this product. I received this product at a discount for an honest review</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum since the day it arrived at my home. Morning and night, just as suggested, but without the additional creme or lotion afterward (due to oily skin &amp; occasional blemish). I am an over 60 years old gal who still wants to take care of herself. My face seems to love me for giving it this nice drink of sunshine and is repaying me by diminishing the few lines and wrinkles I have, especially the area on my forehead right between my eyebrows. I think people call those lines &amp;#34;furrows&amp;#34; and I have 2 that were pretty obvious. Since March 5, I have noticed an appreciable difference in the depth of the wrinkles and they really are much less visible. Yes, they are still there, but I have to get up really close to the mirror to see them now! Honestly, my face just looks better, period. One other thing I need to point out is the fact I am using argan oil at bedtime, along with the Vitamin C. After showering, I apply the Vitamin C, allow to dry for a few minutes while brushing my teeth, etc. and then I apply the argan oil to my face, arms, hands and nails.  This routine has made my face look better than it has for years. Younger looking skin!  I am certain that the improvement in my wrinkles/creases is due to the Vitamin C serum because I have used argan oil for a long time. It is this combination that I am so excited about. Argan oil is good for your skin, hair, etc. and I think my using it for a long time is the reason I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to begin with. But, now with this C serum, even the few I have are much less visible. The one problem I did have with the serum is that my pump quit working and I am having to carefully pour it into my hand...don&#x27;t want to waste a drop!  I will order more of this, as needed, and hopefully I will keep reversing the signs of aging!  One more thing worth mentioning... this serum smells delicious.  Just a hint of orangey-citrus, so nice to smell at bedtime!</li>
            <li> Definitely got a great many compliments on my face. I was told that I was glowing, there was something that radiated my skin and made me look younger. Perhaps the change is subtle but subtle enough that people notice. The product smells nice, it&#x27;s light and has a smooth feel. You can feel your skin absorbing the lotion.  I will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for about a month.  My skin looks more hydrated and feels wonderful.  I love the light not greasy feel of the lotion and once I got used to using the pump so that the lotion didn&#x27;t squirt out all over I would say just one pump (not two) is plenty for my skin. Will be purchasing a new bottle very soon!  My 22 year old daughter loves the serum as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum.  I have a new baby, and needless to say have been have lots of sleepless nights...and it showed!  I needed something to make me look like the 31 year old that I am.  Viva La Vida has made my skin feel so smooth and refreshed.  But most importantly it as taken away my eye wrinkles.  I also worked nights for years and nothing was helping with my wrinkles...not until I started using this serum.  My over all tone is finally back to what it used to be, looking healthy and smooth.  Love this product...you probably will too.  You should definitely try it!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time this am.  Like the texture etc, but this stuff smells like old man&#x27;s urine, and the smell lingers on your face til you put another product (sunscreen) over it.  I&#x27;ll use it but that was pretty nasty.  And no, its not hot where I live, in Alaska.</li>
            <li> My face has always had both dry and oily parts. This serum has seemed to even out those differences. As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve had to have multiple cortisone shots and my skin had become discolored in those areas but the discoloration has become less noticeable after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it for a great length of time and I am excited to see what other benefits I am deriving from it. I recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this but makes my face really greasy when using it during the day. I now only use it at night as it doesn&#x27;t soak in for a while, definitely not in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have never tried vitamin C serums. Well I am now a devoted customer. I have used for 6 days and can see a noticable difference in my face. My skin does glow and it is so very soft. I don&#x27;t even add my go to face lotion anymore. This is perfect. Lifetime customer here!!</li>
            <li> feels great when applied but no viable difference after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my skin yet.  However, it is a nice product to apply--it goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without being too greasy (I have very oily skin and have some acne, even though I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s).  No breakouts, thank goodness, which often happens with other products I&#x27;ve used like Oil of Olay.  There is a bit of tackiness to my skin after use, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome.  The serum has a very pleasant, faint citrus scent, and the pump application bottle makes it very easy to use.  I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used the product for a while on the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Generally, I don&#x27;t write reviews but this lotion deserve mentioning. I have used various vitamin c products over the years but ever since I started using this one, I have felt a difference in my skin. This product really works and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. I have seen great results and my skin glows. This product has been added to my daily routine and till now I have reordered it a few times. I love this lotion. I will keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that I am actually writing a review on a skin-care product.  I am not a person who gets excited about skin care or special creams that are supposed to do amazing things, but here I am, going to tell you how incredible this facial serum is.  I absolutely love it.  My skin has always been very dry and this Viva la Vida natural skin care product makes my skin feel so good when it is applied.  It is not greasy at all and leaves my skin smooth and silky. The metered amount that is dispensed when the pump is pushed is adequate to cover the face so there is no waste.  The only regret I have about the product is that I have not been using it before now.  My skin feels the best it has in years.  In the past I have tried many skin care, anti-aging products and have never felt the urge or need to re-purchase any of them.  They all seemed over-priced for what they accomplished.  I thought that it would be difficult for me to make the decision to purchase this product on a long term basis because of my &amp;#34;frugal&amp;#34; nature and the additional fact that I have never spent any significant money on skin-care products; but, it will NOT be difficult because it is so soothing and the results have been far better than I could have ever anticipated or expected.  Great product.  Glad someone recommended it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, after only a few week a of using it my face feels soft even if I have not AppleScript the product.</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand of C serum and saw good result immediately, but over time when I was running out I stopped seeing further improvement so I decided to try this product because of the reviews.  I am very happy to see continued improvement, and it is especially noticable when used twice a day as the instructions suggest.  My skin looks brighter, smother, more even toned and all around better and younger looking.  I had little red broken veins on my cheeks from Rosesa which have now disappeared!  I now only need to wear coverup under my eyes.  Now as I&#x27;m writing this I&#x27;m wondering if it is appopriate to use this in the eye area as well?  I have a relative that I think would appreciate this C serum so I&#x27;m buying her some for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that the serum comes in an airtight bottle with a pump to protect the integrity of the C and antioxidents, which disapates when exposed to air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any other products that this company produces but if there were some, I would be likely to try them if they were something I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum based on the the natural ingredients and all of the great reviews.  It really is a GREAT product!!  I use 2 pumps on my face every night.  I have noticed a difference in the tone of my skin and fine lines by my eyes and on forehead.  I have used this faithfully for 3 weeks so far and will continue using it.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you want a natural Vit C serum!!</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is absolutely perfect. I have been using it now for a little over a month and definitely notice an improvement in my face. The texture is much smoother and elasticity has improved considerably. I also notice a lot more clarity in my skin tone and can actually go without wearing foundation.  I will be ordering another bottle soon. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Skin feels fantastic.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am using this serum for a few months now and I can see real improvements in my skin. Big reduction in dark spots on my face, skin looks more fresh and not so dry. I reduced amount of my regular facial cream, I am using Lancom wich is very expensive. I really like this serum and will recommend to try it.</li>
            <li> My wife tells me this is a wonderful product with almost instant results.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised!  It smells great, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly.  I am very happy with how my skin has improved in overall health and appearance.</li>
            <li> I love the way this goes on my face. Smooth and you do not need but a few dots... one each cheek.</li>
            <li> excelent and fresh product</li>
            <li> 5 Stars from me. I LOVE LOVE this serum. It WORKS! I even have my husband using it. My skin looks so much smoother, and fine lines are gone. I have been using this daily for going on a year. I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a wonderful light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the company I buy from here on Amazon, is a wonderful company to associate with.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my skin.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love it! A little goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t greasy but adds a beautiful, healthy glow to my face. I highly recommend this serum. The price is right and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;m glad I complimented my friend because she&#x27;s the one who told me about this product. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for me. Feels generic</li>
            <li> Love this C serum.. Fabulous feel with no scent...</li>
            <li> Anyone who is looking into  vitamin C serum shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this one in particular. Great product. . really improves skin tone and  complexion, not only initially but it does have cumulative effect and in my case it is seeming preventing occasional  blemishes that I used to have break out before I started to use it regularly. the product itself is very light, can certainly be used along with moisturizer/ foundation or whatever other products you use routinely. I&#x27;ve tried different Vit. C Serum and it was not even close. I&#x27;m certainly giving this 5/5</li>
            <li> Excellent serum. I love the feel of when applying on my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but the cheap dispensing bottle, not so much.  It stops dispensing when it gets to a certain point.  There is still plenty of product in there, but you have to open the top and &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; it out.  That digging out exposes the contents to degradation.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night. It appears to be working so far. It did not make me break out and goes on smooth and not oily. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
            <li> I really like the product. It smells amazing and I feel my skin has a nice dewy complexion.</li>
            <li> I am using Viva la Vida Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The product is nice but not the bottle. The bottle worked good initially but later it wouldnt get the serum out. I didnt understand that if the serum is over or the bottle pipe is the issue. But I guess not I realize that it was a used product and half of the serum was already over.&lt;br /&gt;I checked through the reviews and didnt see anyone else having such a problem. So I had to write this review to make everyone aware.&lt;br /&gt;Please rectify this because this is really upsetting. Its not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Great C Serum, I love it. My skin absolutely glows. I&#x27;d buy it again and I&#x27;d be looking at any additional products by the company.</li>
