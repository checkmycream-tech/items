            <li>how good it supposed to be for your hair</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be a good thing to use on hair</li>

            <li>make my hair so smooth!!  </li>
            <li>I use the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum along with the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Condition with the results of great looking hair.</li>
            <li>But for a while, it will look amazing.</li>
            <li>Tresemme has my utmost respect for this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nice though I might reuse it for something else.</li>
            <li>me, my hands felt warm when rubbing them together with the serum.</li>
            <li>Even if you want to add polish or a nice shine, spray and brush on</li>
            <li>what kind of hair you have when doing a review, because it does have some importance on how the product may or may not work for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this product does that for my hair nice shine and manageable again&lt;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite effective at taming frizz all day.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this stuff out and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It gets five stars because, like many of those products, it does a good job with it.</li>
            <li>This serum works does a good job to help control fly-aways, which happens to me more often than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, just need some more volum  : )</li>
            <li>It kind of defeats the purpose since most of the time you need to \\&quot;smooth\\</li>
            <li>Great Defrizzer, really smoothes my hair and keeps it defrizzed even with humidity, looking good and smooth despite the weather.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice mild scent that my husband commented on!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>hair does look shiny and healthy, so</li>
            <li>And this is the benefit that I&#x27;d most looked forward to from this</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and keeps my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I had to use another smoothing serum on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>more like how our hair used to be on</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>so I love this product don&#x27;t give me volume</li>
            <li>I will be sure to update this review if I do, though.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of static cling and frizzy looking hair.</li>
            <li>Its not a serum, more like a cream.</li>
            <li>do use mostly shampoo and conditioner that is for curly</li>
            <li>and i simply LOVE</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to feel this product in my hair once I had blow-dryed it</li>
            <li>What I found and ordered was this great hair serum from Tresemme that was going to really help me.  </li>
            <li>Your hair type might have a better experience.</li>
            <li>Creme\\&quot; for a couple of years now, which was OK</li>
            <li>have bought this product more than once since I was allowed to review it and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it leaves the soft, beautiful and silky hair.</li>
            <li>And for the price, it&#x27;s really a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>After using these three products my hair is strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for smooth, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li>It pumps easily and comes out as a liquid.  </li>
            <li>* Easy to use&lt;br /</li>
            <li>My stylist warned me that over using keratin products can make your hair so strong that it becomes brittle.  </li>
            <li>All-in-all, its a pretty amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i have used any kind of infusing serum on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy/curly weather reactive hair that has been color treated for years.</li>
            <li>This serum is light, not greasy and goes on your hair and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>It smells fine and works for one day though,</li>
            <li>Your hair will be smooth, silky, and smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It filled my expectations</li>
            <li>TRESemme Kerartin Smooth makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and it it made it look really smooth, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Nor did it seem to smooth or detangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is lightly scent so the scent will wear off before you finish or lesve for work.  </li>
            <li>The second day my hair looked just as great.  </li>
            <li>I always feel it&#x27;s important to state</li>
            <li>B00AO4EBOI Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum]]</li>
            <li>Didnt give me the smooth shine</li>
            <li>I used the Keratin Smooth conditioner and shampoo and then followed up with the smoothing serum.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smooth or reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]</li>
            <li>Many hair products advertise effectiveness at fixing hair products with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>Cheap price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth</li>
            <li>I use this product with the rest of the keratin smooth line.  </li>
            <li>I usually love Tresemme products but this didn&#x27;t do very much.</li>
            <li>have been so impressed with all the new Tresemme products I&#x27;ve been trying recently.  </li>
            <li>He rarely notices things like that!</li>
            <li>I usually use a sulfite-free shampoo anyways, but I bought Tresemme&#x27;s combo to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this is helping control naturally unruly hair.</li>
            <li>used together, these products are AMAZING, even more so because of their low price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is noticeable and pleasant enough, not perfumy.  </li>
            <li>In all, a great product for those who need to calm their tough-to-manage long hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when we were young.......  </li>
            <li>The clear serum had a nice, almost floral fragrance and a non-greasy texture.  </li>
            <li>It lasted throughout the day and my hair even looked good the following day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair straight for more than one day.</li>
            <li>it soft and a nice shine to it</li>
            <li>This is very comparable to my crème rinses I love.</li>
            <li>This product was OK, but did not make much of an improvement on my hair.</li>
            <li>My curls are coming out smooth and pretty, making me feel more positive and</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of another that I used a long time ago that I loved - it adds shine and smooths some...</li>
            <li>My hair was straight and smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li>Good for very dry damage heir, I use it every time I take shawar</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that I don&#x27;t really notice after once I&#x27;ve put the serum in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, but she said it was really helpful and made her hair really smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really liked this product - especially for the price!</li>
            <li>This product (as far as I could tell from the ingredient list) does not contain any silicone, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for my hair.  </li>
            <li>For me, serums of any kind is strictly for the middle to the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, they are all about the same, no matter which brand that I try</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross.</li>
            <li>in all this is an effective product, especially at the price!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding the right combination of products can really help my curls remain smooth instead of frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets oily pretty quickly and this serum does not make me feel greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li>right before heat-styling my hair</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s still damp, right before I blow-dry it.</li>
            <li>Good results (smooth hair, very little frizz)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>had high hopes for the Keratin Smooth, but it just didn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works best in wet hair, but also does the trick with dry</li>
            <li>In the past I have used silicone based smoothing serums and I have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t compared it to any other serums, but I am very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li>I also had very fast delivery</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying if you have very frizzy</li>
            <li>I was definitely impressed as I&#x27;ve been skeptical about how \\&quot;great\\&quot; keratin products are.</li>
            <li>serum makes your hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If you start at the top of your hair, then too much product goes to the top of your head and once dried</li>
            <li>My hair feels so smooth, shiny and just soft.</li>
            <li>Then I can either flat iron my hair or curl the ends for a more finished look.</li>
            <li>I think there are better smoothing serums on the market that work better for me and my thick hair.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of products that help keep frizzy/curly hair straight pretty well after flat-ironing, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot because it cuts down on frizzies and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, super shiny</li>
            <li>I have thick, long hair and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>I liked this Tresemme ok, but it didn&#x27;t do any better or worse than other similar/comparable products (</li>
            <li>is now my new hair product - so I definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I live near Seattle, and the more humid/damp air tends to wreak havoc on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, cut shorter at the back than it is at the front, and it is color-treated.</li>
            <li>The rating for this product was very high</li>
            <li>have naturally curly/wavy fine hair and it can get wild with the frizz</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need the volume or puffiness or anything like that</li>
            <li>I really dig TRESemme shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s so this is just icing on the cake</li>
            <li>Then, I decided to try the whole system-shampoo, conditioner and serum together.  </li>
            <li>I then wore my hair straight thru blowdrying after applying the serum.</li>
            <li>Id definately recommend this product for straight or curly hair.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t really tell that I had used it.</li>
            <li>really recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it really smooths my hair and helps the frizz.  </li>
            <li>some days all it wants to do is frizz up.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i do not have to use mousse nearly as much anymore&lt;</li>
            <li>smell is not overly powerful or masculine smelling</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need much to work</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair will end up greasy and</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use too much product at one time.  </li>
            <li>how much healthier it looks.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s not THICK oil like so many products which builds up quickly making hair more difficult.</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away!!!  </li>
            <li>hair has a lot of body and waviness naturally but this seemed to straighten it and take the life right out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t use this again since I have so many other products, including from this brand, that do wonders.  </li>
            <li>unlike most of the other products this does not leave my hair</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this product did work as well as my usual product - and the same \\&quot;rules\\&quot; applied to this as with my silicone based serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered a whole bunch of great Tresemme products lately</li>
            <li>I also found that it was easy to get out of my hair, which is certainly a problem for other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helps tone down the thickness of my hair and give it a more sleek look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this will keep my hair down when it starts to get frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li>Having fine, thick, curly/frizzy medium-length hair that suffers from coloring and straightening on a regular basis, I was excited to try this - even if it doesn&#x27;t provide a long time of frizz control and smoothness, being able to have smooth hair for a week was a great promise for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a little more &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; thank &amp;#</li>
            <li>As with anything, start with a little and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li>I still end up with a little more than I need.</li>
            <li>after the smoothing shampoos and conditioners, I generally use a leave-in treatment of some kind, especially when I plan to flat iron my hair as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To add a little more body and hold, I&#x27;m also using a Frizz Ease Curl Mousse.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, it seemed to make my hair more limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair, I rub the serum in my hands until it is no longer a \\&quot;blob\\&quot; and then kinda just swipe down over my hair a few times to eliminate frizz an fly aways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive and it&#x27;s very effective at taming hair frizz.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>also I live in Oklahoma so the weather and humidity is always changing</li>
            <li>I have cursed my curls, straightened them, and tried to live with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I live in an RV, I can&#x27;t always shower each day, and I have to take that into consideration when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I was hesitant as anyone is when trying a new hair care product.</li>
            <li>I live in Ohio so it gets humid.</li>
            <li>However, I normally do not wash my hair daily - more likely weekly or bi-weekly and with this product, I noticed that I had to wash my hair sooner than I normally would as it weighed it down more than my normal hair-smoothing</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is the fact that my hair is so fine that it becomes weighed down by this product.</li>
            <li>You always want to start with the least amount, apply it and then if you need more, use a little more... if you start out with a lot, you will end up greasy looking</li>
            <li>If I am going to blow dry my hair, I need something to put in it first to keep it from trying to poof up so much</li>
            <li>Not usually a fan of tresemme  products</li>
            <li>i live in India and have been using L&#x27;Oreal Professional hair serum since about 7 years.</li>
            <li>My hair is mainly smooth with a little bit of frizz in unwanted places.  </li>
            <li>IT&amp;#34;S NOT OILY, I&#x27;ve used other serums that are SUPER OILY</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I use smoothing serums for my naturally curly hair and haven&#x27;t had any luck with this product</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after I wash and condition</li>
            <li>The shine my hair naturally has was dulled by this.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, color treated and mid-back length.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t completely pan it.</li>
            <li>Using all three together leaves my hair soft and silky and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use it enough times to comment on whether or not the condition of my hair was improved or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>apply this anywhere near your roots if you don&#x27;t want a greasy look.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s smell is very subtle, but it has this kind of floral scent that makes you more comfortable to use it, unlike other hair products that smell very serious and yucky.</li>
            <li>After drying, my hair does look shiny and smooth with little to no frizzing!</li>
            <li>When applying the serum to dry hair, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li>She advised me to alternate with a shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s high in moisture.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thinning naturally, but I still have a respectable head of hair which stays dark brown with my only grey being in moustache and beard.  </li>
            <li>My hair was much smoother, much easier to style, but less curly.</li>
            <li>I found that I had to use a little more product than with my silicone, but not much.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling dry and very stringy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for other users, but I noticed  results within my first use.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly - it also happens to be frizzy, dry, and generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, and the product does tame frizzies and flayaways.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to only have to do the whole blow-dry/full-out straightening process every other shampoo, at the very least.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I love this for since I have a lot and also very thick hair</li>
            <li>Its been hard to find a hair serum or lotion that will allow my curly hair to remain frizz free while keeping my curls shiny and bouncy and in tact.</li>
            <li>You can even use it for ponytails to smooth back any small hairs that would stick out or up</li>
            <li>I apply it while my hair is still wet, &amp; works very well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it only lasts a week, and I hope my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clear like most smoothing serums, it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li>So right away I&#x27;m a little put off by how it looks.  </li>
            <li>addition of the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum has helped me gently dry my hair without resulting in a frizzy messy look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions tell the consumer to wash and condition hair as normal and towel dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt very dry and product-y after the first application - very similar to what a keratin treatment would feel like in a salon, only on a less-intense level.  </li>
            <li>If I us a plain shampoo/conditioner and blow dry my hair, my hair comes out HUGE and poofy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on very frizzy, wavy hair and over the last two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference in how the hair is staying together better (cutting down on frizz) and also how much smoother it is to touch and</li>
            <li>I have long, slightly naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li>This may just apply to me, but if I use this product on my hair and then let my hair dry naturally, I look like I have been caught in a rainstorm.  </li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning my hair I applied this product very sparsely - which for me is less than a dime.</li>
            <li>I mainly rely on Bed Head Ego Boost to tame my naturally frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>So thick that even though it&#x27;s long enough to reach the middle of my back, its own weight is still not enough to flatten it down.</li>
            <li>Third rule - do NOT let your hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as thick as previously, so must use more to control your hair.</li>
            <li>just a little fruity&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to find something that i love using on my hair because it gives the result</li>
            <li>First rule, a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Sounds like a good plan to me.</li>
            <li> how good it supposed to be for your hair</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be a good thing to use on hair</li>

            <li> and it smells so good.</li>

            <li> Very good easy to use</li>

            <li> make my hair so smooth!!  </li>
            <li> I use the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum along with the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Condition with the results of great looking hair.</li>
            <li> But for a while, it will look amazing.</li>
            <li> Tresemme has my utmost respect for this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is nice though I might reuse it for something else.</li>
            <li> me, my hands felt warm when rubbing them together with the serum.</li>
            <li> Even if you want to add polish or a nice shine, spray and brush on</li>
            <li> what kind of hair you have when doing a review, because it does have some importance on how the product may or may not work for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this product does that for my hair nice shine and manageable again&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite effective at taming frizz all day.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this stuff out and really liked it.</li>
            <li> It gets five stars because, like many of those products, it does a good job with it.</li>
            <li> This serum works does a good job to help control fly-aways, which happens to me more often than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, just need some more volum  : )</li>
            <li> It kind of defeats the purpose since most of the time you need to \\&quot;smooth\\</li>
            <li> Great Defrizzer, really smoothes my hair and keeps it defrizzed even with humidity, looking good and smooth despite the weather.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice mild scent that my husband commented on!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> hair does look shiny and healthy, so</li>
            <li> And this is the benefit that I&#x27;d most looked forward to from this</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and keeps my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I had to use another smoothing serum on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> more like how our hair used to be on</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> so I love this product don&#x27;t give me volume</li>
            <li> I will be sure to update this review if I do, though.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of static cling and frizzy looking hair.</li>
            <li> Its not a serum, more like a cream.</li>
            <li> do use mostly shampoo and conditioner that is for curly</li>
            <li> and i simply LOVE</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to feel this product in my hair once I had blow-dryed it</li>
            <li> What I found and ordered was this great hair serum from Tresemme that was going to really help me.  </li>
            <li> Your hair type might have a better experience.</li>
            <li> Creme\\&quot; for a couple of years now, which was OK</li>
            <li> have bought this product more than once since I was allowed to review it and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it leaves the soft, beautiful and silky hair.</li>
            <li> And for the price, it&#x27;s really a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> After using these three products my hair is strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for smooth, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> It pumps easily and comes out as a liquid.  </li>
            <li> * Easy to use&lt;br /</li>
            <li> My stylist warned me that over using keratin products can make your hair so strong that it becomes brittle.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, its a pretty amazing product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i have used any kind of infusing serum on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy/curly weather reactive hair that has been color treated for years.</li>
            <li> This serum is light, not greasy and goes on your hair and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> It smells fine and works for one day though,</li>
            <li> Your hair will be smooth, silky, and smell pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It filled my expectations</li>
            <li> TRESemme Kerartin Smooth makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and it it made it look really smooth, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Nor did it seem to smooth or detangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is lightly scent so the scent will wear off before you finish or lesve for work.  </li>
            <li> The second day my hair looked just as great.  </li>
            <li> I always feel it&#x27;s important to state</li>
            <li> B00AO4EBOI Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum]]</li>
            <li> Didnt give me the smooth shine</li>
            <li> I used the Keratin Smooth conditioner and shampoo and then followed up with the smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smooth or reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]</li>
            <li> Many hair products advertise effectiveness at fixing hair products with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> Cheap price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth</li>
            <li> I use this product with the rest of the keratin smooth line.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Tresemme products but this didn&#x27;t do very much.</li>
            <li> have been so impressed with all the new Tresemme products I&#x27;ve been trying recently.  </li>
            <li> He rarely notices things like that!</li>
            <li> I usually use a sulfite-free shampoo anyways, but I bought Tresemme&#x27;s combo to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this is helping control naturally unruly hair.</li>
            <li> used together, these products are AMAZING, even more so because of their low price.  </li>
            <li> The scent is noticeable and pleasant enough, not perfumy.  </li>
            <li> In all, a great product for those who need to calm their tough-to-manage long hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when we were young.......  </li>
            <li> The clear serum had a nice, almost floral fragrance and a non-greasy texture.  </li>
            <li> It lasted throughout the day and my hair even looked good the following day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair straight for more than one day.</li>
            <li> it soft and a nice shine to it</li>
            <li> This is very comparable to my crème rinses I love.</li>
            <li> This product was OK, but did not make much of an improvement on my hair.</li>
            <li> My curls are coming out smooth and pretty, making me feel more positive and</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of another that I used a long time ago that I loved - it adds shine and smooths some...</li>
            <li> My hair was straight and smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li> Good for very dry damage heir, I use it every time I take shawar</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that I don&#x27;t really notice after once I&#x27;ve put the serum in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, but she said it was really helpful and made her hair really smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really liked this product - especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This product (as far as I could tell from the ingredient list) does not contain any silicone, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> For me, serums of any kind is strictly for the middle to the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, they are all about the same, no matter which brand that I try</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross.</li>
            <li> in all this is an effective product, especially at the price!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finding the right combination of products can really help my curls remain smooth instead of frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets oily pretty quickly and this serum does not make me feel greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li> right before heat-styling my hair</li>
            <li> I apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s still damp, right before I blow-dry it.</li>
            <li> Good results (smooth hair, very little frizz)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> had high hopes for the Keratin Smooth, but it just didn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works best in wet hair, but also does the trick with dry</li>
            <li> In the past I have used silicone based smoothing serums and I have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t compared it to any other serums, but I am very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I also had very fast delivery</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying if you have very frizzy</li>
            <li> I was definitely impressed as I&#x27;ve been skeptical about how \\&quot;great\\&quot; keratin products are.</li>
            <li> serum makes your hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> If you start at the top of your hair, then too much product goes to the top of your head and once dried</li>
            <li> My hair feels so smooth, shiny and just soft.</li>
            <li> Then I can either flat iron my hair or curl the ends for a more finished look.</li>
            <li> I think there are better smoothing serums on the market that work better for me and my thick hair.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of products that help keep frizzy/curly hair straight pretty well after flat-ironing, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot because it cuts down on frizzies and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, super shiny</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> I liked this Tresemme ok, but it didn&#x27;t do any better or worse than other similar/comparable products (</li>
            <li> is now my new hair product - so I definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I live near Seattle, and the more humid/damp air tends to wreak havoc on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, cut shorter at the back than it is at the front, and it is color-treated.</li>
            <li> The rating for this product was very high</li>
            <li> have naturally curly/wavy fine hair and it can get wild with the frizz</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need the volume or puffiness or anything like that</li>
            <li> I really dig TRESemme shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s so this is just icing on the cake</li>
            <li> Then, I decided to try the whole system-shampoo, conditioner and serum together.  </li>
            <li> I then wore my hair straight thru blowdrying after applying the serum.</li>
            <li> Id definately recommend this product for straight or curly hair.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t really tell that I had used it.</li>
            <li> really recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it really smooths my hair and helps the frizz.  </li>
            <li> some days all it wants to do is frizz up.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i do not have to use mousse nearly as much anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> smell is not overly powerful or masculine smelling</li>
            <li> Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need much to work</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hair will end up greasy and</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use too much product at one time.  </li>
            <li> how much healthier it looks.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not THICK oil like so many products which builds up quickly making hair more difficult.</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away!!!  </li>
            <li> hair has a lot of body and waviness naturally but this seemed to straighten it and take the life right out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use this again since I have so many other products, including from this brand, that do wonders.  </li>
            <li> unlike most of the other products this does not leave my hair</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this product did work as well as my usual product - and the same \\&quot;rules\\&quot; applied to this as with my silicone based serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered a whole bunch of great Tresemme products lately</li>
            <li> I also found that it was easy to get out of my hair, which is certainly a problem for other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helps tone down the thickness of my hair and give it a more sleek look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this will keep my hair down when it starts to get frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li> Having fine, thick, curly/frizzy medium-length hair that suffers from coloring and straightening on a regular basis, I was excited to try this - even if it doesn&#x27;t provide a long time of frizz control and smoothness, being able to have smooth hair for a week was a great promise for me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a little more &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; thank &amp;#</li>
            <li> As with anything, start with a little and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li> I still end up with a little more than I need.</li>
            <li> after the smoothing shampoos and conditioners, I generally use a leave-in treatment of some kind, especially when I plan to flat iron my hair as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To add a little more body and hold, I&#x27;m also using a Frizz Ease Curl Mousse.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, it seemed to make my hair more limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair, I rub the serum in my hands until it is no longer a \\&quot;blob\\&quot; and then kinda just swipe down over my hair a few times to eliminate frizz an fly aways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and it&#x27;s very effective at taming hair frizz.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> also I live in Oklahoma so the weather and humidity is always changing</li>
            <li> I have cursed my curls, straightened them, and tried to live with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I live in an RV, I can&#x27;t always shower each day, and I have to take that into consideration when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I was hesitant as anyone is when trying a new hair care product.</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio so it gets humid.</li>
            <li> However, I normally do not wash my hair daily - more likely weekly or bi-weekly and with this product, I noticed that I had to wash my hair sooner than I normally would as it weighed it down more than my normal hair-smoothing</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is the fact that my hair is so fine that it becomes weighed down by this product.</li>
            <li> You always want to start with the least amount, apply it and then if you need more, use a little more... if you start out with a lot, you will end up greasy looking</li>
            <li> If I am going to blow dry my hair, I need something to put in it first to keep it from trying to poof up so much</li>
            <li> Not usually a fan of tresemme  products</li>
            <li> i live in India and have been using L&#x27;Oreal Professional hair serum since about 7 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is mainly smooth with a little bit of frizz in unwanted places.  </li>
            <li> IT&amp;#34;S NOT OILY, I&#x27;ve used other serums that are SUPER OILY</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I use smoothing serums for my naturally curly hair and haven&#x27;t had any luck with this product</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after I wash and condition</li>
            <li> The shine my hair naturally has was dulled by this.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, color treated and mid-back length.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t completely pan it.</li>
            <li> Using all three together leaves my hair soft and silky and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use it enough times to comment on whether or not the condition of my hair was improved or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> apply this anywhere near your roots if you don&#x27;t want a greasy look.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s smell is very subtle, but it has this kind of floral scent that makes you more comfortable to use it, unlike other hair products that smell very serious and yucky.</li>
            <li> After drying, my hair does look shiny and smooth with little to no frizzing!</li>
            <li> When applying the serum to dry hair, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li> She advised me to alternate with a shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s high in moisture.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning naturally, but I still have a respectable head of hair which stays dark brown with my only grey being in moustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> My hair was much smoother, much easier to style, but less curly.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to use a little more product than with my silicone, but not much.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling dry and very stringy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for other users, but I noticed  results within my first use.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly - it also happens to be frizzy, dry, and generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, and the product does tame frizzies and flayaways.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to only have to do the whole blow-dry/full-out straightening process every other shampoo, at the very least.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I love this for since I have a lot and also very thick hair</li>
            <li> Its been hard to find a hair serum or lotion that will allow my curly hair to remain frizz free while keeping my curls shiny and bouncy and in tact.</li>
            <li> You can even use it for ponytails to smooth back any small hairs that would stick out or up</li>
            <li> I apply it while my hair is still wet, &amp; works very well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it only lasts a week, and I hope my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear like most smoothing serums, it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> So right away I&#x27;m a little put off by how it looks.  </li>
            <li> addition of the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum has helped me gently dry my hair without resulting in a frizzy messy look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions tell the consumer to wash and condition hair as normal and towel dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt very dry and product-y after the first application - very similar to what a keratin treatment would feel like in a salon, only on a less-intense level.  </li>
            <li> If I us a plain shampoo/conditioner and blow dry my hair, my hair comes out HUGE and poofy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on very frizzy, wavy hair and over the last two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference in how the hair is staying together better (cutting down on frizz) and also how much smoother it is to touch and</li>
            <li> I have long, slightly naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li> This may just apply to me, but if I use this product on my hair and then let my hair dry naturally, I look like I have been caught in a rainstorm.  </li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair I applied this product very sparsely - which for me is less than a dime.</li>
            <li> I mainly rely on Bed Head Ego Boost to tame my naturally frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So thick that even though it&#x27;s long enough to reach the middle of my back, its own weight is still not enough to flatten it down.</li>
            <li> Third rule - do NOT let your hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as previously, so must use more to control your hair.</li>
            <li> just a little fruity&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to find something that i love using on my hair because it gives the result</li>
            <li> First rule, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I applied the serum to my wet hair, the different was profound.</li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Great for thick, coarse or hard to tame tresses!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, but I definitely was not expecting the serum to be warm.</li>
            <li> but then when I brush it - the \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; break and I get straight hair with very little frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used it after flat ironing my hair yet, but I like it already.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, color treated hair that I use a flat iron on 6-7 days per week.  </li>
            <li> I burned my hair with my flat iron</li>
            <li> you get sometimes when using the flat</li>
            <li> I also attempted using it on my dry hair to tame flyaway ends and didn&#x27;t see much improvement their either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use expensive salon products on my hair so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this cheap drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> But still felt product-y, not very soft.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work with my fine hair, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Living in the South, my hair is wavy and flyaway at best and a big ole&#x27; frizzy mess at worst.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair silly smooth and it lasts all day/night.</li>
            <li> LASTS A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s dripping wet and almost instantly I feel the stringiness.</li>
            <li> Using this serum in the same way (after shower on wet hair), in place of the Ego Boost, produced no results.</li>
            <li> My hair dried faster and my curls were soft, bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and can use about a nickel size on my damp hair -</li>
            <li> Shoulder-length hair needs 3 and long hair needs 5 or so.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters all have long hair that is prone to get frizzy when the weather gets too humid.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, and it seems like one pump is just too much, so I try to pump out a little less.</li>
            <li> I used the shine spray after towel-drying and before blow-drying, and it took twice as long for me to dry my hair and straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I will not be applying this to my dry hair again</li>
            <li> My hair dried the same way it would have if I hadn&#x27;t used anything extra in it at all.</li>
            <li> I did not send product back because it just was not worth the time to me.</li>
            <li> I usually use more expensive product on my hair, but this came in a Birchbox Limited Edition box that I bought and I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, you apply the serum to your hair (wet or dry, your choice) and the effects are supposed to be noticeable for 48 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> put 2 pumps on a somewhat wet hair, brush it and leave it to dry.</li>
            <li> I lighten my hair which makes it very dry.  </li>
            <li> On the last day I even used it in addition to my flat iron to straighten my hair, but again it looked no \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than it has in the past.</li>
            <li> Found this little miracle while I was in the hair care aisle at Target earlier</li>
            <li> As with any serum, you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> It also adds a little shine to my hair, not a lot, but enough to make me happier with the appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and damaged hair and just a little of this product after using my flat iron</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling sticky and not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> I have an almost straight hair, but I suffer from frizz and from waviness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;TRESemme Anti-Frizz Secret Smoothing</li>
            <li> This serum was heavy and did a moderate job of de-frizzing my hair.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is not too thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that reaches the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an average serum for my hair type, which is dark brown, long, straight-to-wavy Causcasian hair of medium thickness.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was a little strange.</li>
            <li> and when I say long I mean just above my butt</li>
            <li> You have to use VERY little and only on the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought it may be something to do with my type of hair, so I asked 2 of my other family members to use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it deserves the hype, but this product definitely does nothing to convince me.</li>
            <li> Works just like Loreal and other creams.</li>
            <li> I have had brazillain blwo out before (although none recently), I know what to expect from keratin products but this was no magic.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> This Tresemme serum actually does help to reduce frizziness without making their hair seem oily or slick.  </li>
            <li> Tried this along with the other Keratin treatment products from Tresemme, but it made my hair feel...gross.</li>
            <li> I also apply it to the ends of my hair as well, when it feels like there&#x27;s almost no more product left on my hands, to get rid of that dryness</li>
            <li> I was in a pinch because I ran out of my other serum, I would use this as my back-up.</li>
            <li> So I do recommend this for other aging guys as well as for anyone else.</li>
            <li> My hair is very limp, and remains that way until my next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have less frizz and fluff using nothing than I do with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a small tube, but you use so little at a time, that it will last a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keratin seems to be the big buzz world in the hair world lately.</li>
            <li> The texture of this serum is gooey and sticky, and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that tends to be frizzy</li>
            <li> I usually need to use something to tame that when I can, especially here in the Pacific Northwest dampness!</li>
            <li> since if I used it close to my scalp, it weighed my hair down).</li>
            <li> as weighed down with frizz</li>
            <li> This product weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> It adds shine, helps keep the frizzys away, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and it was a total failure.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it shows when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It squirts out of the bottle into my hand as a slightly gooey sticky slime.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After drying my hair I could discern no noticeable benefit or results from this at all, aside from my hair feeling slightly softer.  </li>
            <li> In the case with my hair, the least little bit of this on the roots of my hair made it look greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> put little bit in my hand, a little less than a dime sized circle, rub my hands together, and then run my hand through or over my hair, depending on the hair</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a quarter-sized amount throughout my hair (my hair is very long, but not as thick and tends to get a little frizzy)</li>
            <li> This little bottle goes along way.</li>
            <li> - you still use just a little bit though.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy and makes my hair look as though it has no volume.</li>
            <li> I swim a few days a week so my hair tends to get frizzier than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy when I squirted in my hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt for a product that will tame the frizzies and make all my hair look</li>
            <li> So I need layers of products to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that if I don&#x27;t shower the next day, the residue makes my hair look dirty in a way that other brands of hair serum don&#x27;t (for example, a few products from Motions and Axe).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like this product, and while I am not sure if it will replace my silicone products, I believe I will rotate this into my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the instructions say to work in from mid-length to ends because a lot of my frizz is closer to my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> I can hardly run my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> There is no frizz, no fly aways</li>
            <li> (You know how it can look unhealthy sometimes when you have a lot of frizz).</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t notice dramatic changes during the 3 weeks of use .</li>
            <li> Completely obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> Because I have not seen any improvement in my hair with this product I&#x27;m unlikely to use it again, but maybe it was just me.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I can.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just not ever crazy about them.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE WAS NOT TO BAD.</li>
            <li> and I hate it when my hair looks like someone poured at bottle of grease on my hair.</li>
            <li> Smoothing shampoos and creamy conditioners are just the base layer.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money on products I cannot use because they are worthless and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in Tresemme.</li>
            <li> This may have been the worst hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair serums I have ever used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This may have been the worst hair product I have ever used! I am very disappointed in Tresemme. I will never order any of their products again. I did not send product back because it just was not worth the time to me. The only g</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! Makes my hair silly smooth and it lasts all day/night. This works really well and is not too thick or heavy. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Like the way this makes my hair feel. I also had very fast delivery</li>
            <li> My hair is mainly smooth with a little bit of frizz in unwanted places.  I&#x27;m on the hunt for a product that will tame the frizzies and make all my hair look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for the Keratin Smooth, but it just didn&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does look shiny and healthy, so bonus points for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My frizzy hair, though, remains unchanged.  And this is the benefit that I&#x27;d most looked forward to from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an inexpensive brand, it comes in a nicely attractive bottle.  It pumps easily and comes out as a liquid.  It has a light fragrance that I don&#x27;t really notice after once I&#x27;ve put the serum in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find this product to be at all sticky.  A couple of swipes of my hand on a towel and it&#x27;s gone.  I find it to be a little more &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; thank &amp;#34;stick.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for shine, this is a great product.  If you&#x27;re looking for smooth, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> It works well in eliminating or greatly reducing frizzy hair. Love it! Will definitely purchase in the future. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already purchased the Keratin conditioner so I was like I&#x27;m getting the serum! And I&#x27;m glad I did, I have Chinese bangs and I use this serum on my edges and on my bangs as well as my ends and it&#x27;s GREAT. PLUS IT&amp;#34;S NOT OILY, I&#x27;ve used other serums that are SUPER OILY and I hate it when my hair looks like someone poured at bottle of grease on my hair. BUY!</li>
            <li> The rating for this product was very high so I decided to try it. It works wonders with my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is holy grail status. I have thick, long hair and this stuff is perfect. My hair gets oily pretty quickly and this serum does not make me feel greasy or oily at all. Not usually a fan of tresemme  products but I decided to give this a try. Exceeded my expectations, great size and inexpensive. On the plus side it smells so wonderful :) love!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair serums I have ever used. i live in India and have been using L&#x27;Oreal Professional hair serum since about 7 years. It is so good. But I wanted to try something new and it was a total failure. I thought it may be something to do with my type of hair, so I asked 2 of my other family members to use it and they had the same review. My hair are color treated and re-bonded. I also tried the shampoo and conditioner from the same brand. But it wasn&#x27;t of any use. I will not recommend anyone to use this product !</li>
            <li> not greasy at all! and makes my hair softer. I like it! i haven&#x27;t used it after flat ironing my hair yet, but I like it already.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Tried it with blow drying, with air drying, and with a straightening iron. I have less frizz and fluff using nothing than I do with this (I have 3b-c curly hair). Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO GOOD. LASTS A LONG TIME AND THE PRICE WAS NOT TO BAD.</li>
            <li> It filled my expectations</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Very good easy to use and it dose it job . However I didn&#x27;t notice dramatic changes during the 3 weeks of use .</li>
            <li> It smells so good and keeps my hair smooth and frizz free. A little goes a long way. I have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this!  I lighten my hair which makes it very dry.  TRESemme Kerartin Smooth makes a huge difference. I like it because it&#x27;s not THICK oil like so many products which builds up quickly making hair more difficult. After use my hair is incredibly smooth and shiny for 48 hours like the label says, which is awesome because I&#x27;m trying to go a couple days between washes to get my hair in better shape and grow it longer.</li>
            <li> I usually love Tresemme products but this didn&#x27;t do very much. It left my hair feeling sticky and not smooth at all. I had to use another smoothing serum on top of it. It&#x27;s not clear like most smoothing serums, it&#x27;s thick. The bottle is nice though I might reuse it for something else.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Works great on my hair!!  I have very dry and damaged hair and just a little of this product after using my flat iron make my hair so smooth!!  It lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL product......leaves your hair shiny but not  greasy.........more like how our hair used to be on it&#x27;s own when we were young.......  REALLY an awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, just need some more volum  : )</li>
            <li> I love it leaves the soft, beautiful and silky hair. I just love it</li>
            <li> I have super long and thick hair and when I say long I mean just above my butt I&#x27;m using also the shampoo and conditioner and I must say I love this for since I have a lot and also very thick hair I really don&#x27;t need the volume or puffiness or anything like that so I love this product don&#x27;t give me volume also I live in Oklahoma so the weather and humidity is always changing and this helps my hair not to get freezy which is a plus my hair is also color treated and can say is damaged in the ends since I always straighten my hair but since using this product I have seen an improvement I&#x27;m going back for the heat protectant one</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling dry and very stringy. I use smoothing serums for my naturally curly hair and haven&#x27;t had any luck with this product and I&#x27;ve used it several times with the same result. I can hardly run my fingers through my hair. I put the product on my hair when it&#x27;s dripping wet and almost instantly I feel the stringiness. My hair is so soft after I wash and condition but once I put this in my hair it changes. I was hoping this product would work but I&#x27;m definitely going back to using the serum from Redken. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really dig TRESemme shampoos and conditioner&#x27;s so this is just icing on the cake</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as previously, so must use more to control your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly - it also happens to be frizzy, dry, and generally unmanageable. I usually use more expensive product on my hair, but this came in a Birchbox Limited Edition box that I bought and I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you pump out one pump of serum into your hands and rub them together. Then, you apply the serum to your hair (wet or dry, your choice) and the effects are supposed to be noticeable for 48 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, my hands felt warm when rubbing them together with the serum. It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, but I definitely was not expecting the serum to be warm. It was a little strange. When I applied the serum to my wet hair, the different was profound. My hair was much smoother, much easier to style, but less curly. When applying the serum to dry hair, I didn&#x27;t notice a positive difference. What I did notice is that my hair was a bit greasy afterwards. I will not be applying this to my dry hair again and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this product - especially for the price! It is definitely worth trying if you have very frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did not use this product when straightening my hair, so I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness in that area. I will be sure to update this review if I do, though.</li>
            <li> Completely obsessed with this product. Found this little miracle while I was in the hair care aisle at Target earlier and I couldn&#x27;t wait to come home and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a quarter-sized amount throughout my hair (my hair is very long, but not as thick and tends to get a little frizzy) right before heat-styling my hair and it it made it look really smooth, shiny, and bouncy. I can&#x27;t speak for other users, but I noticed  results within my first use. I was definitely impressed as I&#x27;ve been skeptical about how \\&quot;great\\&quot; keratin products are. The product&#x27;s smell is very subtle, but it has this kind of floral scent that makes you more comfortable to use it, unlike other hair products that smell very serious and yucky. All-in-all, its a pretty amazing product for the price. I haven&#x27;t compared it to any other serums, but I am very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered a whole bunch of great Tresemme products lately but I can&#x27;t say this one is a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It squirts out of the bottle into my hand as a slightly gooey sticky slime.  So right away I&#x27;m a little put off by how it looks.  It has no scent I am happy to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been so impressed with all the new Tresemme products I&#x27;ve been trying recently.  They perform as well as salon products.  However, this one is the exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed this slime between my palms and applied it to my damp hair before blowing it out.  It felt sticky on my hair and didn&#x27;t spread out.  Nor did it seem to smooth or detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying my hair I could discern no noticeable benefit or results from this at all, aside from my hair feeling slightly softer.  The shine my hair naturally has was dulled by this. Nor did this provide any extra body.  On the contrary, it seemed to make my hair more limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a lot of body and waviness naturally but this seemed to straighten it and take the life right out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use this again since I have so many other products, including from this brand, that do wonders.  This one&#x27;s a tosser.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, color treated hair that I use a flat iron on 6-7 days per week.  In the past I have used silicone based smoothing serums and I have been happy with them.  This product (as far as I could tell from the ingredient list) does not contain any silicone, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for my hair.  I am happy to say that this product did work as well as my usual product - and the same \\&quot;rules\\&quot; applied to this as with my silicone based serum.  First rule, a little goes a long way.  I found that I had to use a little more product than with my silicone, but not much.  As with anything, start with a little and add more if needed.  Second rule - keep away from the roots of your hair.  In the case with my hair, the least little bit of this on the roots of my hair made it look greasy and flat.  For me, serums of any kind is strictly for the middle to the ends of my hair.  Third rule - do NOT let your hair dry naturally.  This may just apply to me, but if I use this product on my hair and then let my hair dry naturally, I look like I have been caught in a rainstorm.  My hair is very limp, and remains that way until my next shampoo.  For my hair, not using a hair dryer is not an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, and while I am not sure if it will replace my silicone products, I believe I will rotate this into my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> This little bottle goes along way. Great for after you wash your hair and blowdry it. Gets rid of static cling and frizzy looking hair. This is lightly scent so the scent will wear off before you finish or lesve for work.  Even if you want to add polish or a nice shine, spray and brush on and your hair will look like you came out the salon.</li>
            <li> I usually use expensive salon products on my hair so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this cheap drugstore brand.  Boy, was I surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried just the serum and it worked well enough but I still had some frizz after brushing.  The clear serum had a nice, almost floral fragrance and a non-greasy texture.  Then, I decided to try the whole system-shampoo, conditioner and serum together.  I was completely blown away!!!  My hair was soft, super shiny and I had no frizz-none, nada.  The second day my hair looked just as great.  Even on the third day, my hair still looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used together, these products are AMAZING, even more so because of their low price.  I plan to continue to use this product with one caveat.  My stylist warned me that over using keratin products can make your hair so strong that it becomes brittle.  She advised me to alternate with a shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s high in moisture.  Sounds like a good plan to me.</li>
            <li> My hair has always tended toward frizzy! I usually need to use something to tame that when I can, especially here in the Pacific Northwest dampness! This stuff does the trick! I&#x27;m not sure why the instructions say to work in from mid-length to ends because a lot of my frizz is closer to my head. My hair is shoulder length, and it seems like one pump is just too much, so I try to pump out a little less. I still end up with a little more than I need. After drying, my hair does look shiny and smooth with little to no frizzing! It also has a nice mild scent that my husband commented on! He rarely notices things like that!</li>
            <li> I mainly rely on Bed Head Ego Boost to tame my naturally frizzy hair. Using this serum in the same way (after shower on wet hair), in place of the Ego Boost, produced no results. My hair dried the same way it would have if I hadn&#x27;t used anything extra in it at all. I also attempted using it on my dry hair to tame flyaway ends and didn&#x27;t see much improvement their either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keratin seems to be the big buzz world in the hair world lately. I&#x27;m not sure if it deserves the hype, but this product definitely does nothing to convince me.</li>
            <li> I always feel it&#x27;s important to state what kind of hair you have when doing a review, because it does have some importance on how the product may or may not work for you.  My hair is naturally curly, color treated and mid-back length.  Frizziness and dryness are my two biggest issues and I combat both by keeping my hair moisturized. There are a lot of Keratin products on the market now and I&#x27;ve tried several of the lower cost ones with varying results.  I used the [[ASIN:B00AO4EBOI Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum]] as directed for several days and there was no noticeable difference in my hair.  On the last day I even used it in addition to my flat iron to straighten my hair, but again it looked no \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than it has in the past. Because I have not seen any improvement in my hair with this product I&#x27;m unlikely to use it again, but maybe it was just me.  At the current selling price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot if this is something you are wanting to try yourself.</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy/curly weather reactive hair that has been color treated for years. Its been hard to find a hair serum or lotion that will allow my curly hair to remain frizz free while keeping my curls shiny and bouncy and in tact. This serum is light, not greasy and goes on your hair and spreads easily. My hair dried faster and my curls were soft, bouncy and shiny. It lasted throughout the day and my hair even looked good the following day. I then wore my hair straight thru blowdrying after applying the serum. My hair was straight and smooth and super shiny. Id definately recommend this product for straight or curly hair.</li>
            <li> To me, all of the smoothing serums work the same.  You have to use VERY little and only on the ends of your hair.  It kind of defeats the purpose since most of the time you need to \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; the hair close to your scalp.  I liked this Tresemme ok, but it didn&#x27;t do any better or worse than other similar/comparable products (since if I used it close to my scalp, it weighed my hair down).</li>
            <li> I burned my hair with my flat iron and I put this product on my hair and oh my gosh, it&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle. ! It made it look like nothing happened to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep my hair straight for more than one day. It smells fine and works for one day though, so I can&#x27;t completely pan it.</li>
            <li> Its not a serum, more like a cream. Works just like Loreal and other creams. Didnt give me the smooth shine sleek finish I was expecting. I have had brazillain blwo out before (although none recently), I know what to expect from keratin products but this was no magic. I guess you have to try your self. may be with time they improve the product.</li>
            <li> Good for very dry damage heir, I use it every time I take shawar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products in the TRESemme&#x27; line and I&#x27;m just not ever crazy about them. I used the Keratin Smooth conditioner and shampoo and then followed up with the smoothing serum. I have thick, coarse hair that tends to be frizzy so I&#x27;m a big fan of hair serum. Honestly, they are all about the same, no matter which brand that I try but this TRESemme didn&#x27;t perform as well. You couldn&#x27;t really tell that I had used it. It didn&#x27;t smooth or reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really recommend it. [[ASIN:B000P9DS4Q John Frieda Frizz-Ease Extra Strength Serum, 1.69 Ounces]] and even [[ASIN:B0062W4T98 Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smooth and Shine Serum, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] serums out shine this one.</li>
            <li> I have started using this every morning.  I apply it from the middle to the ends of my hair.  I have had no problems with it being greasy and it really smooths my hair and helps the frizz.  I have long, slightly naturally curly hair and some days all it wants to do is frizz up.  This product has really helped with this.  I am a believer!</li>
            <li> I use the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum along with the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Shampoo and the Tresemme Keratin Infusing Condition with the results of great looking hair. Using all three together leaves my hair soft and silky and easier to manage. After using these three products my hair is strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great Defrizzer, really smoothes my hair and keeps it defrizzed even with humidity, looking good and smooth despite the weather. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i have used any kind of infusing serum on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do use mostly shampoo and conditioner that is for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly/wavy fine hair and it can get wild with the frizz look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this now for a couple weeks and i simply LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;i do not have to use mousse nearly as much anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product gives me the frizz control and helps to enhance the curls so they are&lt;br /&gt;nearly as weighed down with frizz and you can actually see the curl again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is not overly powerful or masculine smelling just a little fruity&lt;br /&gt;it is hard to find something that i love using on my hair because it gives the result i am needing&lt;br /&gt;this product does that for my hair nice shine and manageable again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes it soft and a nice shine to it not the brittle look that frizz gives it&lt;br /&gt;i have found that using it instead of my mousse gives me nto only the curls i want&lt;br /&gt;but unlike most of the other products this does not leave my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now will have to try the rest of this line to see how well they all work together</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of another that I used a long time ago that I loved - it adds shine and smooths some... but a little goes a long way!  I have really long hair and can use about a nickel size on my damp hair - I blowdry my hair a lot, so I have seen a difference in my ends when using the product - they tend to stay healthier looking even with repeated blow drying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be able to feel this product in my hair once I had blow-dryed it but unfortunately I can. It feels heavy and makes my hair look as though it has no volume. I use a volumizing shampoo but you can&#x27;t tell once I&#x27;ve applied this product to my hair. I have fine hair, cut shorter at the back than it is at the front, and it is color-treated. Perhaps it is the fact that my hair is so fine that it becomes weighed down by this product. I bought this product to control the frizz of my longer hair at the front, which I use straighteners on. I&#x27;ve read a lot about Keratin and how good it supposed to be for your hair and I thought it would be a good thing to use on hair that has straighteners applied to it every day. I hoped it would help the condition of my hair aswell as control the frizz. Considering how it made my hair feel every time I applied it I didn&#x27;t really use it enough times to comment on whether or not the condition of my hair was improved or not.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will go back to using the Kerastase product that I have used before. It is expensive but I did feel as though it improved the condition of my hair. [[ASIN:B000EVIVAG Kerastase Resistance Ciment Anti-Usure Conditioner, 6.8 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> Looking for something I could throw in my suitcase that wouldn&#x27;t spill. This is very comparable to my crème rinses I love.</li>
            <li> Having fine, thick, curly/frizzy medium-length hair that suffers from coloring and straightening on a regular basis, I was excited to try this - even if it doesn&#x27;t provide a long time of frizz control and smoothness, being able to have smooth hair for a week was a great promise for me.  It would have been nice to only have to do the whole blow-dry/full-out straightening process every other shampoo, at the very least.  So I ordered this product, as well as the shampoo and conditioner that goes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter.  My hair felt very dry and product-y after the first application - very similar to what a keratin treatment would feel like in a salon, only on a less-intense level.  Being concerned about the dryness and potential damage to my hair, I bought the keratin shine spray as well.  I used the recommended shampoo and conditioner beforehand, and after 3-4 days when it was time to wash my hair.  My hair was still frizzy!  But still felt product-y, not very soft.  I usually use a sulfite-free shampoo anyways, but I bought Tresemme&#x27;s combo to get the best results.  I used the shine spray after towel-drying and before blow-drying, and it took twice as long for me to dry my hair and straighten it.  Fortunately, it only lasts a week, and I hope my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot because it cuts down on frizzies and makes my hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair. So thick that even though it&#x27;s long enough to reach the middle of my back, its own weight is still not enough to flatten it down. If I us a plain shampoo/conditioner and blow dry my hair, my hair comes out HUGE and poofy. So I need layers of products to tame my hair. Smoothing shampoos and creamy conditioners are just the base layer. If I am going to blow dry my hair, I need something to put in it first to keep it from trying to poof up so much it stands on end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after the smoothing shampoos and conditioners, I generally use a leave-in treatment of some kind, especially when I plan to flat iron my hair as well. This Tresemme Keratin serum has been working well at keeping my hair under control. I apply it to my hair when it&#x27;s still damp, right before I blow-dry it. Then I can either flat iron my hair or curl the ends for a more finished look. It&#x27;s helps tone down the thickness of my hair and give it a more sleek look. Great for thick, coarse or hard to tame tresses!</li>
            <li> I swim a few days a week so my hair tends to get frizzier than I&#x27;d like. Many hair products advertise effectiveness at fixing hair products with varying degrees of success. This keratin serum isn&#x27;t the end all be all, but I was really impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The keratin serum works best on damp hair. It doesn&#x27;t need much to work and it&#x27;s quite effective at taming frizz all day. I also found that it was easy to get out of my hair, which is certainly a problem for other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum. It&#x27;s not too expensive and it&#x27;s very effective at taming hair frizz.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this stuff out and really liked it. She doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; hair, but she said it was really helpful and made her hair really smooth. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross. And for the price, it&#x27;s really a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> This product was OK, but did not make much of an improvement on my hair.</li>
            <li> I live near Seattle, and the more humid/damp air tends to wreak havoc on my naturally curly hair.  I have cursed my curls, straightened them, and tried to live with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right combination of products can really help my curls remain smooth instead of frizzy.  I already use a different brand of shampoo and conditioner that contain Keratin, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum has helped me gently dry my hair without resulting in a frizzy messy look.  My curls are coming out smooth and pretty, making me feel more positive and confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add a little more body and hold, I&#x27;m also using a Frizz Ease Curl Mousse.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of products that help keep frizzy/curly hair straight pretty well after flat-ironing, and this is one of them. It gets five stars because, like many of those products, it does a good job with it. Your hair will be smooth, silky, and smell pretty nice. Will it stay that way? Nope. It&#x27;s not magic. But for a while, it will look amazing. Also, it helps protect hair against damage from the iron. Last thing: one squirt is NOT enough. Shoulder-length hair needs 3 and long hair needs 5 or so.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters all have long hair that is prone to get frizzy when the weather gets too humid.  This Tresemme serum actually does help to reduce frizziness without making their hair seem oily or slick.  In all, a great product for those who need to calm their tough-to-manage long hair.</li>
            <li> Tried this along with the other Keratin treatment products from Tresemme, but it made my hair feel...gross. It stiffened up my hair and it didn&#x27;t smell good at all. I hate wasting money on products I cannot use because they are worthless and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme Serum smells great and works great. As with any serum, you only need a little bit. If you use too much, your hair will end up greasy and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put little bit in my hand, a little less than a dime sized circle, rub my hands together, and then run my hand through or over my hair, depending on the hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I straighten my hair, I rub the serum in my hands until it is no longer a \\&quot;blob\\&quot; and then kinda just swipe down over my hair a few times to eliminate frizz an fly aways. I do the roots last because that area will get the greasy look faster. I also apply it to the ends of my hair as well, when it feels like there&#x27;s almost no more product left on my hands, to get rid of that dryness you get sometimes when using the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am wearing my hair curly, then I run my hands through my hair starting at about the middle of the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum makes your hair so smooth and soft. There is no frizz, no fly aways and it smells so good. You can even use it for ponytails to smooth back any small hairs that would stick out or up - you still use just a little bit though. You always want to start with the least amount, apply it and then if you need more, use a little more... if you start out with a lot, you will end up greasy looking fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a small tube, but you use so little at a time, that it will last a while.</li>
            <li> My hair always starts to get frizzy after I straighten it and it drives me nuts.  What I found and ordered was this great hair serum from Tresemme that was going to really help me.  I&#x27;m so glad that this will keep my hair down when it starts to get frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li> The texture of this serum is gooey and sticky, and a small amount goes a long way. The scent is mild, and the product does tame frizzies and flayaways. It works best in wet hair, but also does the trick with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that if I don&#x27;t shower the next day, the residue makes my hair look dirty in a way that other brands of hair serum don&#x27;t (for example, a few products from Motions and Axe). Since I live in an RV, I can&#x27;t always shower each day, and I have to take that into consideration when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t apply this anywhere near your roots if you don&#x27;t want a greasy look. You will also want to wash the stickiness off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an average serum for my hair type, which is dark brown, long, straight-to-wavy Causcasian hair of medium thickness. Your hair type might have a better experience.</li>
            <li> I have an almost straight hair, but I suffer from frizz and from waviness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;TRESemme Anti-Frizz Secret Smoothing Creme\\&quot; for a couple of years now, which was OK but this product is better!&lt;br /&gt;I put 2 pumps on a somewhat wet hair, brush it and leave it to dry. it creates this \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; like you get when you use hair gel, but then when I brush it - the \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; break and I get straight hair with very little frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my new hair product - so I definitely recommend :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short:&lt;br /&gt;The good&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;* Good scent&lt;br /&gt;* Good results (smooth hair, very little frizz)&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* Cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;* Sticky hands after application&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Tresemme has my utmost respect for this amazing product.  Living in the South, my hair is wavy and flyaway at best and a big ole&#x27; frizzy mess at worst.  Tresemme&#x27;s Keratin Smooth Infusing Serum is a godsend during the summer especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions tell the consumer to wash and condition hair as normal and towel dry.  Then, when the hair is still damp/wet, use one pump of serum and start at the bottom of your hair and work your way up.  I have found that this is the best way to use this product as well.  If you start at the top of your hair, then too much product goes to the top of your head and once dried, your hair looks oily and lank.  Also, don&#x27;t use too much product at one time.  Following the directions is the key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product more than once since I was allowed to review it and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> This product weighs down my hair. I have thick, wavy hair that reaches the middle of my back. After washing and conditioning my hair I applied this product very sparsely - which for me is less than a dime. I started at the roots, as suggested, and went up. This serum was heavy and did a moderate job of de-frizzing my hair. However, I normally do not wash my hair daily - more likely weekly or bi-weekly and with this product, I noticed that I had to wash my hair sooner than I normally would as it weighed it down more than my normal hair-smoothing serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was in a pinch because I ran out of my other serum, I would use this as my back-up. I think there are better smoothing serums on the market that work better for me and my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff on a whim. I had been using another brand for over a year. I was hesitant as anyone is when trying a new hair care product. This stuff is AMAZING! I have thick curly hair and it shows when I flat iron. I live in Ohio so it gets humid. This product hold up to humidity great! My hair feels so smooth, shiny and just soft. Please never stop making this!</li>
            <li> This serum works does a good job to help control fly-aways, which happens to me more often than I care to admit.  It also adds a little shine to my hair, not a lot, but enough to make me happier with the appearance of my hair.  I apply it while my hair is still wet, &amp; works very well.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is an effective product, especially at the price!  Recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on very frizzy, wavy hair and over the last two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a clear difference in how the hair is staying together better (cutting down on frizz) and also how much smoother it is to touch and how much healthier it looks. (You know how it can look unhealthy sometimes when you have a lot of frizz). I&#x27;m very satisfied with how this is helping control naturally unruly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning naturally, but I still have a respectable head of hair which stays dark brown with my only grey being in moustache and beard.  Anyway, I have been using ths product for a few days and have been surprised by getting comments from some of the old gals around here.  The scent is noticeable and pleasant enough, not perfumy.  So I do recommend this for other aging guys as well as for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the rest of the keratin smooth line.  It felt heavy when I squirted in my hands and I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work with my fine hair, but I was wrong.  It adds shine, helps keep the frizzys away, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
