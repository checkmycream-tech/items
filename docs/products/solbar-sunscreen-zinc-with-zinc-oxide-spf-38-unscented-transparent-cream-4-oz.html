            <li>a great moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist was impressed I found this product on my own.</li>

            <li>Great sunscreen for when you are playing sports outdoors.</li>

            <li>I looked for it in the retail shops in my area, but no one carries it for some reason, so I was happy to get it on line.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Everything about it is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a very effective sunscreen.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this to folks who are looking for sunscreens with a good EWG rating.</li>
            <li>I have been using Solbar cream for about 10 years with good results.</li>
            <li>Good luck.y Wes Burgess on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a couple of years and have loved it.</li>
            <li>I knew it had to be good if he recommended it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good waterproof sunblock, and without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good protection</li>
            <li>Good sun protection</li>
            <li>This is a really good sunscreen because of the amount of zinc in it.  </li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re looking for good sun protection, this is it.</li>
            <li>good product good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good...</li>
            <li>In fact, there are NO oils in the sunscreen whatsoever (which is good if you get clogged pores, like me).</li>
            <li>I chose SOLBAR because the zinc oxide is a healthier option for good UVB</li>
            <li>And it must have a fair amount of zinc as it took care of athletes foot fungus caused by using non zinc moisturizers.</li>
            <li>therefore I only want the best of the best to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely liked it on my skin, felt good.</li>
            <li>Glad that I went with Solbar Zin SPF 38!    </li>
            <li>glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as a melanoma survivor, I DO feel qualified (and even kind of compelled) to advise you about this product - and to suggest that, if you have doubts about what I am saying, to check with your own Physician or, if you have access to the specialty, a Board Certified Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have found this to be an effective sunblock.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, as I have a problem with allergies to most skin sun  protection products.  </li>
            <li>This is nice.</li>
            <li>and I think the scent was nice too..</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and used this on my face for a two day outdoor event and just got a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice tube that allows you to use all the product.</li>
            <li>Cream works in well, and a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic sunblock that rubs in clean and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service, quick and easy delivery within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I came across a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen with great reviews</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this sunscreen based on the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Best sun protection without the high</li>
            <li>best suntan lotion ever, recomend it highly.</li>
            <li>feels the best so far!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good while fishing!</li>
            <li>Therefore, let me share my own tricks for getting the most out of sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have tried ALOT of mineral sunscreens and so far this is the best for our purposes:</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for sensitive skin or aversions to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The zinc makes this a better sunscreen as zinc is effective immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat oily, sensitive skin and this also feels the best vs all others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have olive toned skin so most sunscreens make my skin look a very interesting color and most people that see me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product - light, smell-free, applies easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li>But this one feels better on the skin, has never affected my eyes and has given unprecedented performance under the most severe conditions.</li>
            <li>A great product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>sent it to him and he was so happy to get the exact product that he is used to using.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great and rubs in pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I originally heard about this product from a very well known plastic surgeon who told me years ago that using this product would be my best defense to keep my skin from aging.</li>
            <li>it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Very light scent.</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen, works great and doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>It blends into your skin nicely and can be worn easily under make-up or without.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect for sun protection for white people that are very light and are prone to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, I need a SPF 50, so I wish this had a bit more sunblock in it.</li>
            <li>I usually only use this during the summer and it works great!</li>
            <li>it is a better sunscreen</li>
            <li>Follow up rubbing in circles, making sure the cream is distributed evenly over all the skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for those who find most sunscreens unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Much better for skin than chemical sun screens.</li>
            <li>love the beach -</li>
            <li>but I love my life more.  </li>
            <li>love the beach -</li>
            <li>but I love my life more.  </li>
            <li>I found that most sunblocks that I have used don&#x27;t hold up if I perspire from activity, often leaving me with a reddish nose or shoulders after a day of activity.   </li>
            <li>I have been using this sunblock for many years.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I play beach volleyball and re-apply constantly throughout a given day of play and Solbar provides excellent protection.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I love the moisturizer in this product.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist recommended and healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li>Many of the manufacturers have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, really protects the wifes skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, my favorite sunscreen, will never use anything else....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping for a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Solbar Zinc for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously!  </li>
            <li>It is more of a mechanical barrier rather than a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how many of the products in stores have the oxybenzone hormone disruptor in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy unlike many sunscreens with zinc oxide, and massages in well.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen and the price here is reasonable</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin on my face feel.</li>
            <li>any more so now I order online.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreen products do not contain zinc</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous sun protectors and Sobar Zinc Protection Cream is the best on the market!</li>
            <li>I am glad to find it still on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I like the cream better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li>so it really provides great coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am out side most of the day - every day.</li>
            <li>Physical protection is always best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the reviewer who said Solbar is greasy, well, I could not disagree more.</li>
            <li>Mostly silicones (which protect the skin from drying out) and transparent zinc (which does the sun-blocking).</li>
            <li>Safe for my skin and protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li>No harshness and no horrible smells either.</li>
            <li>if applied all over :-)).</li>
            <li>One can either wipe it away or be confident that the coverage is still there.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, but I WOULD NOT buy the one shown here.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I realize that 38spf is lower than many cancer patients are directed to use, but I have found this to provide protection easily on the level of most 50spf+ chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is a good sunscreen for the price and priceless if my kids will wear it without complaint.</li>
            <li>I tried other products that were okay, but I still will always like this best.  </li>
            <li>I have freckles and fair skin, so my risk for skin cancer is very high without any protection.  </li>
            <li>Solbar zinc is light and absorbs quicly and the fact that it contains zinc mineral makes it even more valuable.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is great zinc sunscreen - it isn&#x27;t too oily and it rubs in mostly clear.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on great - not greasy and is clear.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen provides good protection but also is very greasy.</li>
            <li>I originally got samples of this product from a dermatologist, as most sunscreens make me break out.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to rub in and appears to work well.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily, will provide protection in well over 2 hours in the water, and won&#x27;t weep into your eyes if you&#x27;re sweating.</li>
            <li>actually lol but will use more next summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides very adequate sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Has improved my face skin, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily apply my makeup over it.</li>
            <li>This product applies easily considering that it contains zinc.</li>
            <li>This is an effective sun block, easy to apply, long-lasting, smooth and easily absorbed, not goopy or chalky.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Great for use under makeup as a skin brightener while also protecting from broad spectrum rays.</li>
            <li>How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  </li>
            <li>How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  </li>
            <li>It is found in this SOLBAR sunscreen which I have been using faithfully - since being diagnosed with a melanoma (which was successfully and completely) surgically removed.  </li>
            <li>and it looks/feels fine</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, easy to work in</li>
            <li>That said, it feels and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I have also found it useful during the winter when my skin becomes extremely dry as this sunscreen has wonderful moisturizing</li>
            <li>It contains Zinc, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly is non greasey</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This works great as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to how well it blocks sun as I avoid sun, but for daily use its great.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and protects.</li>
            <li>Appears to be the same great product.</li>
            <li>I originally got it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>My quest for the perfect sun screen continues :/.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for my face and chest areas, the Zinc is better for your skin than chemicals in alot of sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Originally suggested to me by my Moh&#x27;s Surgeon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it is not as good as other zinc sunblocks/sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, but this one goes on fast and easy...is not sticky either.  </li>
            <li>As far far I can tell it gives good protection without the allergens of so many products.</li>
            <li>Full protection without a greasy feel, and it can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li>I have had several skin cancers removed and am no longer allowed in the sun without  a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very very quick and the shipping price was very reasonable also..which is always a plus when you have to order on-line.</li>
            <li>I use it as my daily moisterizer and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>not as toxic as conventional sunblock and it works great.  </li>
            <li>My family and I are very satisfied with this sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) and we will be ordering this product again in the future!</li>
            <li>When my 3 year old was a baby and young toddler, and us living in Phoenix, AZ, it was important to find a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The whiteness of formula is great for covering up rosesea or any dark pigmented skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying some more!</li>
            <li>Only Sun Screen that does not break me out in a rash and it is especially good for my dry skin</li>
            <li>It is the truly the best sunblock ,make-up base and very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly &amp; protects very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable to use on my face, because once it&#x27;s dried a bit I can put matte powder on top</li>
            <li>/&gt;But for an all-body, super-effective, completely natural, apply-once-and-forget-about-it sunscreen, you cannot do better than Solbar Zinc SPF 38.</li>
            <li>Goes on and seems to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>and he was right.</li>
            <li>Price seems about right.</li>
            <li>I generally use EltaMD, I love their sunscreens.</li>
            <li>After using both products I conclude that this Solbar product worked really well (and better than the other product) w/o the white film, was very light and easy to spread, non-greasy and SPF was perfectly fine (no sunburn despite being out in the sun the whole day - 1 re-application/day).</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen because it contains a high quality of zinc which protects the skin naturally from the sun.</li>
            <li>Thanks again !</li>
            <li>Without sunscreen for many years, I have had several melanomas and a malignant tumor on my wrist.</li>
            <li>I picked it because it was one of the top ten safest sunscreens in an environmental site.</li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is one of those physical sun blockers - and one most often recommended by professionals.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen - unlike so many others - does not leave you paste-y white.  </li>
            <li>Now I just use it as my first coat on my arms and legs, but once it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li>and it really does absorb as promised!</li>
            <li>This sunblock did the job when I went to Six Flags for a whole day in 90 degree weather!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most commercial sunscreens I swell up and get hives.</li>
            <li>well, never say never ;)</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m over-lathering, but I want to make sure they are covered as they play outside throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>They work very well in the sun and in the water!</li>
            <li>My skin had become blotchy from too many years of sun exposure, so after the procedure i was given Solbar Zinc SPF 38 to prevent further damage.</li>
            <li>consistent use</li>
            <li>I carry it with me all during the hot weather.  </li>
            <li>It is the only sunscreen we use since we discovered it many years ago.  </li>
            <li>It kept me safe under intense, frequent sun surfing in Mexico during the peak of summer, which is pretty much all I could ask from a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This product comes out of the tube with a smooth wet consistency so it spreads  easily.</li>
            <li>We ran out of this one right away as the whole family preferred to use it (esp.</li>
            <li>Used many other brands, didn&#x27;t have any success with them, this on works and works well.</li>
            <li>but I do tan very easily and this helps me not to be several shades darker by the end of summer and stay my natural color.</li>
            <li>I think it protects well, smells mild enough that my 7 and 10 year old don&#x27;t complain and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am combo-oily in summer and more dry in the winter &amp; acne-prone.</li>
            <li>Used this on a backpacking trip where I wanted to use unscented products to avoid the attention of large, furry things with teeth.  </li>
            <li>For sure can&#x27;t do a 2-3hr surf session in the tropics, though it is better than your average sunscreen you would find at your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>, it REALLY burned my eyes, and yes, I waited over 1/2 hour for it to dry just to be sure.  </li>
            <li>When I went to see my dermatologist a few weeks later, I was happy to see that he listed this brand as one of his favorites.</li>
            <li>Like a dime or nickel size amount, because it can get greasy if too much is applied.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to get it in 50 SPF next year if available.</li>
            <li>I really like this type of mineral sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin very shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like sunscreen -</li>
            <li>Found it to be moisturizing, not irrating, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Knowing what the real differences are can give you information that can be, quite literally, life saving.  </li>
            <li>I will give it a real \\&quot;test\\&quot; when I use it in the Bahamas this winter.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommends this product for people allergic to the sun, as I am!</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well thanks to the zinc oxide component.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that there was a typed note regarding the cancer risk of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a fantastic non-greasy sunscreen, it acts as a moisturizer to my medium-dry skin.</li>
            <li>The solbar really does the job.</li>
            <li>Since it has a zinc block it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>And the price is reasonable,</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>A layer of &#x60;physical&#x27; protection is needed as an ingredient in sunscreen creams and lotions to assure a more complete safety screen for your body.  </li>
            <li>I have used that for many years on my face and neck and now I&#x27;m in my 40s and don&#x27;t have nearly the lines and wrinkles of women much younger than me!</li>
            <li>Even though it was listed as for sensitive skin, it tore mine up!!!  </li>
            <li>I have recently even tried using it on my face, and surprisingly it didn&#x27;t brake me out (which has happened with every other sunscreen that I&#x27;ve ever used).  </li>
            <li>This product offers exceptional skin protection from the harsh rays of the sun/  </li>
            <li>You have to reapply more often than other zinc products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well on other areas, and \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li>It does not irritate your eyes like many other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have used it on my hands as they have the sun rash that I normally get when exposed to too much sun.</li>
            <li>Plus, it was a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>We use this as our main sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After trying many brands some of which would ball up with make-up application, sweat off, or turn white when sweating I finally discovered Solbar Zinc.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my face &amp; ears.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a tad heavy.</li>
            <li>active ingredients include: Homosalate (10%), Octinoxate (7.5%) (both chemical protectors found in many other products AND Zinc Oxide (7.5%) - the physical protection ingredient that makes this cream MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply this only when the skin is dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough for my face, and I do have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer now of Solbar and will be as long as they have this product.    </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find a zinc sun barrier product and this product contains 71/5 % zinc which is a very effective sun barrier.</li>
            <li>The first application was thick and sticky and ok, but additional applications were pretty just gross feeling.  </li>
            <li>Our favorite sunscreen of all time is Shiseido&#x27;s Anessa--but at $50 for a small 60ml container, it&#x27;s not for everyday use for all over--we just use it on our faces, where it counts most.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermotologist and I live on a lake.  </li>
            <li>I live in south Florida, so I need to use a zinc based product all the time.  </li>
            <li>I am outdoors a lot and live in California.</li>
            <li>Use this daily with no side effects and its so silky texture feels so divine especially when the sun hits my face knowing that now I can enjoy the sun&#x27;s rays without burning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real greasy, like most of these products, and applies easily without leaving a thick film on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does look a little greasy when you first apply to the face but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>With my skin tone, I usually do not have to worry about sun</li>
            <li>Be aware that the amount of product you are getting is only 4.4oz.  </li>
            <li>It will eat you alive!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to put on just a small amount...</li>
            <li>This is the OLD design, so there is no telling how old particular products are.</li>
            <li>I started using it due to being sensitive to some of the ingredients in most topical products.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling hydrated but on the days when I have extremely dry skin, I use a moisturizer before and then wait a couple of minutes to let it be absorbed and then apply the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was the first one we tried that left her skin soft with no scaly patches.  </li>
            <li>Our 3 year old has very sensitive skin and has been using Solbar Zinc SPF 38 since she was an infant.</li>
            <li>Also kept wearing a swim jacket with long sleeves in and outside of the pool and ocean, so it is hard to know how much the Solbar Zinc SPF 38 contributed to the good result,</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a ton of it to cover a site, just be sure to rub it in or you&#x27;ll have a slight white appearance on your skin (from the zinc as I understand it).</li>
            <li>If you touch your face, it may feel a little goopy, but the look is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Took weeks to clear up.  </li>
            <li>Almost clear for a zinc oxide cream</li>
            <li>It has clear zinc in it</li>
            <li>Rubs in well and is clear.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>You can rub it in so the white doesn&#x27;t show without too much effort.</li>
            <li>I use this also after my monthly microderm appointment both during the day and at night as the product makes your skin incredibly soft and counteracts any redness.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sunscreen is a necessity, but it has to be a sensitive skin formula with zinc.</li>
            <li>For the face I recommend Olay Complete SPF 30.</li>
            <li>We have been using it since for both her and my 17 month old son (although he doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like she does).  </li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and has never had a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>my 2-year-old&#x27;s sensitive cheeks don&#x27;t flare up with this product.</li>
            <li>Either way, if you have sensitive skin, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Many sunscreens are no effective.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I also had a very greasy face but then figured out to use less.</li>
            <li>then many other more expensive brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mild smell, easy to absorb, translucent, not too expensive.</li>
            <li>A few months ago my dermatologist put me on accutane, which made my already sensitive skin dry and even more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>At first I found it actively gross, especially on my legs</li>
            <li>Finally, a pharmacist at CVS is the person who first told me about this product--it had to be special-ordered back then</li>
            <li>Even those saying they provide a high percentage of both UVA and UVB protection are not the same.</li>
            <li>First, wet the skin</li>
            <li>Being as a burn survivor, (went through skin graft surgery on my arm), very important the arm to be protected for the next two summers at least.  </li>
            <li>Not only are the various chemical formulations different, but most of them provide ONLY &#x60;chemical&#x27; protection which, according to current dermatological thinking and research, is simply inadequate.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of the traditional intense sunscreen smell and it is very long lasting.  </li>
            <li>modern sunblocking preparations contain specific chemicals which DO provide some protection from the harmful rays of the sun - especially for those of us who were overexposed (and often burned) on the beach as children.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or been out in the sun with it much, but it is so greasy!</li>
            <li>For those that can wear regular sunscreens there are much cheaper alternatives that work just the same.</li>
            <li>This broad spectrum sunscreen will protect you from both UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for zinc type sun screens but have developed an allergic reaction to other types of sun screen.</li>
            <li>After skin cancer, I know how important it is to protect my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m convinced that much of the differences in peoples&#x27; experience are from putting the creme on too heavily, too lightly, or too unevenly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with children, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a daily moisturizer because I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Solbar apparently is.</li>
            <li>Rubs in completely with no white zinc haze.</li>
            <li>The ONLY sunblock that works for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Then when I finally ordered another Solbar moisturizer, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>While the price is a little high compared to other sun blocks, it&#x27;s worth it for the degree of protection Solbar offers.</li>
            <li>Especially if you live in the Southern California sun like we do.</li>
            <li>(The vulnerability developed by those early exposures apparently never really goes</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now apply the sunscreen in broad strokes on your arms and legs, both in parallel and then transversely across the arm or leg.</li>
            <li>Oct 2013: I have used no other sunscreen since I wrote the above review.</li>
            <li>It is a little expensive compared to drugstore sunscreens, and the only way I can obtain it is through ordering it online, but I have a great use out of it during the sunny seasons.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without white residue (unless you fail to rub it in well), protects skin well, and a real bonus is</li>
            <li>It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is</li>
            <li>It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is</li>
            <li>But, unlike many other Zinc based sunscreens does not leave that thick, white Zinc film that takes awhile to fade.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skin + dry skin +</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to long bike rides, and no longer cover up completely when outside anymore.</li>
            <li>good stuff, a little expensive.  </li>
            <li>We tried several &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin brands but she either got red scaly patches, or her skin would become very dry.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of years and have loved it.</li>
            <li> I knew it had to be good if he recommended it</li>

            <li> I chose SOLBAR because the zinc oxide is a healthier option for good UVB</li>
            <li> And it must have a fair amount of zinc as it took care of athletes foot fungus caused by using non zinc moisturizers.</li>
            <li> therefore I only want the best of the best to apply on my skin.</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as a melanoma survivor, I DO feel qualified (and even kind of compelled) to advise you about this product - and to suggest that, if you have doubts about what I am saying, to check with your own Physician or, if you have access to the specialty, a Board Certified Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be an effective sunblock.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, as I have a problem with allergies to most skin sun  protection products.  </li>
            <li> This is nice.</li>
            <li> and I think the scent was nice too..</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and used this on my face for a two day outdoor event and just got a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice tube that allows you to use all the product.</li>
            <li> Cream works in well, and a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunblock that rubs in clean and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent service, quick and easy delivery within 2 days of ordering.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I came across a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen with great reviews</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this sunscreen based on the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Best sun protection without the high</li>
            <li> best suntan lotion ever, recomend it highly.</li>
            <li> feels the best so far!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good while fishing!</li>
            <li> Therefore, let me share my own tricks for getting the most out of sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have tried ALOT of mineral sunscreens and so far this is the best for our purposes:</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for sensitive skin or aversions to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The zinc makes this a better sunscreen as zinc is effective immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily, sensitive skin and this also feels the best vs all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have olive toned skin so most sunscreens make my skin look a very interesting color and most people that see me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product - light, smell-free, applies easily.  </li>
            <li> This is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li> But this one feels better on the skin, has never affected my eyes and has given unprecedented performance under the most severe conditions.</li>
            <li> A great product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> sent it to him and he was so happy to get the exact product that he is used to using.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great and rubs in pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I originally heard about this product from a very well known plastic surgeon who told me years ago that using this product would be my best defense to keep my skin from aging.</li>
            <li> it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Very light scent.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen, works great and doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
            <li> It blends into your skin nicely and can be worn easily under make-up or without.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect for sun protection for white people that are very light and are prone to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, I need a SPF 50, so I wish this had a bit more sunblock in it.</li>
            <li> I usually only use this during the summer and it works great!</li>
            <li> it is a better sunscreen</li>
            <li> Follow up rubbing in circles, making sure the cream is distributed evenly over all the skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for those who find most sunscreens unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Much better for skin than chemical sun screens.</li>
            <li> love the beach -</li>
            <li> but I love my life more.  </li>
            <li> love the beach -</li>
            <li> but I love my life more.  </li>
            <li> I found that most sunblocks that I have used don&#x27;t hold up if I perspire from activity, often leaving me with a reddish nose or shoulders after a day of activity.   </li>
            <li> I have been using this sunblock for many years.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I play beach volleyball and re-apply constantly throughout a given day of play and Solbar provides excellent protection.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I love the moisturizer in this product.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended and healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li> Many of the manufacturers have gone out of business.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, really protects the wifes skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, my favorite sunscreen, will never use anything else....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solbar Zinc for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously!  </li>
            <li> It is more of a mechanical barrier rather than a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how many of the products in stores have the oxybenzone hormone disruptor in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on creamy unlike many sunscreens with zinc oxide, and massages in well.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen and the price here is reasonable</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin on my face feel.</li>
            <li> any more so now I order online.</li>
            <li> Most sunscreen products do not contain zinc</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous sun protectors and Sobar Zinc Protection Cream is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I am glad to find it still on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I like the cream better than the lotion.  </li>
            <li> so it really provides great coverage.  </li>
            <li> I am out side most of the day - every day.</li>
            <li> Physical protection is always best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the reviewer who said Solbar is greasy, well, I could not disagree more.</li>
            <li> Mostly silicones (which protect the skin from drying out) and transparent zinc (which does the sun-blocking).</li>
            <li> Safe for my skin and protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> No harshness and no horrible smells either.</li>
            <li> if applied all over :-)).</li>
            <li> One can either wipe it away or be confident that the coverage is still there.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, but I WOULD NOT buy the one shown here.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I realize that 38spf is lower than many cancer patients are directed to use, but I have found this to provide protection easily on the level of most 50spf+ chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is a good sunscreen for the price and priceless if my kids will wear it without complaint.</li>
            <li> I tried other products that were okay, but I still will always like this best.  </li>
            <li> I have freckles and fair skin, so my risk for skin cancer is very high without any protection.  </li>
            <li> Solbar zinc is light and absorbs quicly and the fact that it contains zinc mineral makes it even more valuable.</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is great zinc sunscreen - it isn&#x27;t too oily and it rubs in mostly clear.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on great - not greasy and is clear.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides good protection but also is very greasy.</li>
            <li> I originally got samples of this product from a dermatologist, as most sunscreens make me break out.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to rub in and appears to work well.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily, will provide protection in well over 2 hours in the water, and won&#x27;t weep into your eyes if you&#x27;re sweating.</li>
            <li> actually lol but will use more next summer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides very adequate sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Has improved my face skin, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily apply my makeup over it.</li>
            <li> This product applies easily considering that it contains zinc.</li>
            <li> This is an effective sun block, easy to apply, long-lasting, smooth and easily absorbed, not goopy or chalky.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Great for use under makeup as a skin brightener while also protecting from broad spectrum rays.</li>
            <li> How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  </li>
            <li> How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  </li>
            <li> It is found in this SOLBAR sunscreen which I have been using faithfully - since being diagnosed with a melanoma (which was successfully and completely) surgically removed.  </li>
            <li> and it looks/feels fine</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, easy to work in</li>
            <li> That said, it feels and works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I have also found it useful during the winter when my skin becomes extremely dry as this sunscreen has wonderful moisturizing</li>
            <li> It contains Zinc, which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and has not irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly is non greasey</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This works great as a daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well it blocks sun as I avoid sun, but for daily use its great.  </li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and protects.</li>
            <li> Appears to be the same great product.</li>
            <li> I originally got it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My quest for the perfect sun screen continues :/.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for my face and chest areas, the Zinc is better for your skin than chemicals in alot of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Originally suggested to me by my Moh&#x27;s Surgeon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it is not as good as other zinc sunblocks/sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many, but this one goes on fast and easy...is not sticky either.  </li>
            <li> As far far I can tell it gives good protection without the allergens of so many products.</li>
            <li> Full protection without a greasy feel, and it can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have had several skin cancers removed and am no longer allowed in the sun without  a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very very quick and the shipping price was very reasonable also..which is always a plus when you have to order on-line.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily moisterizer and could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> not as toxic as conventional sunblock and it works great.  </li>
            <li> My family and I are very satisfied with this sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) and we will be ordering this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> When my 3 year old was a baby and young toddler, and us living in Phoenix, AZ, it was important to find a good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The whiteness of formula is great for covering up rosesea or any dark pigmented skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely buying some more!</li>
            <li> Only Sun Screen that does not break me out in a rash and it is especially good for my dry skin</li>
            <li> It is the truly the best sunblock ,make-up base and very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; protects very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable to use on my face, because once it&#x27;s dried a bit I can put matte powder on top</li>
            <li> /&gt;But for an all-body, super-effective, completely natural, apply-once-and-forget-about-it sunscreen, you cannot do better than Solbar Zinc SPF 38.</li>
            <li> Goes on and seems to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> and he was right.</li>
            <li> Price seems about right.</li>
            <li> I generally use EltaMD, I love their sunscreens.</li>
            <li> After using both products I conclude that this Solbar product worked really well (and better than the other product) w/o the white film, was very light and easy to spread, non-greasy and SPF was perfectly fine (no sunburn despite being out in the sun the whole day - 1 re-application/day).</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it contains a high quality of zinc which protects the skin naturally from the sun.</li>
            <li> Thanks again !</li>
            <li> Without sunscreen for many years, I have had several melanomas and a malignant tumor on my wrist.</li>
            <li> I picked it because it was one of the top ten safest sunscreens in an environmental site.</li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is one of those physical sun blockers - and one most often recommended by professionals.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen - unlike so many others - does not leave you paste-y white.  </li>
            <li> Now I just use it as my first coat on my arms and legs, but once it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li> and it really does absorb as promised!</li>
            <li> This sunblock did the job when I went to Six Flags for a whole day in 90 degree weather!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most commercial sunscreens I swell up and get hives.</li>
            <li> well, never say never ;)</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m over-lathering, but I want to make sure they are covered as they play outside throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> They work very well in the sun and in the water!</li>
            <li> My skin had become blotchy from too many years of sun exposure, so after the procedure i was given Solbar Zinc SPF 38 to prevent further damage.</li>
            <li> consistent use</li>
            <li> I carry it with me all during the hot weather.  </li>
            <li> It is the only sunscreen we use since we discovered it many years ago.  </li>
            <li> It kept me safe under intense, frequent sun surfing in Mexico during the peak of summer, which is pretty much all I could ask from a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product comes out of the tube with a smooth wet consistency so it spreads  easily.</li>
            <li> We ran out of this one right away as the whole family preferred to use it (esp.</li>
            <li> Used many other brands, didn&#x27;t have any success with them, this on works and works well.</li>
            <li> but I do tan very easily and this helps me not to be several shades darker by the end of summer and stay my natural color.</li>
            <li> I think it protects well, smells mild enough that my 7 and 10 year old don&#x27;t complain and it goes on easily.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am combo-oily in summer and more dry in the winter &amp; acne-prone.</li>
            <li> Used this on a backpacking trip where I wanted to use unscented products to avoid the attention of large, furry things with teeth.  </li>
            <li> For sure can&#x27;t do a 2-3hr surf session in the tropics, though it is better than your average sunscreen you would find at your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> , it REALLY burned my eyes, and yes, I waited over 1/2 hour for it to dry just to be sure.  </li>
            <li> When I went to see my dermatologist a few weeks later, I was happy to see that he listed this brand as one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> Like a dime or nickel size amount, because it can get greasy if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to get it in 50 SPF next year if available.</li>
            <li> I really like this type of mineral sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my skin very shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like sunscreen -</li>
            <li> Found it to be moisturizing, not irrating, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Knowing what the real differences are can give you information that can be, quite literally, life saving.  </li>
            <li> I will give it a real \\&quot;test\\&quot; when I use it in the Bahamas this winter.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommends this product for people allergic to the sun, as I am!</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well thanks to the zinc oxide component.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that there was a typed note regarding the cancer risk of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a fantastic non-greasy sunscreen, it acts as a moisturizer to my medium-dry skin.</li>
            <li> The solbar really does the job.</li>
            <li> Since it has a zinc block it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> And the price is reasonable,</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> A layer of &#x60;physical&#x27; protection is needed as an ingredient in sunscreen creams and lotions to assure a more complete safety screen for your body.  </li>
            <li> I have used that for many years on my face and neck and now I&#x27;m in my 40s and don&#x27;t have nearly the lines and wrinkles of women much younger than me!</li>
            <li> Even though it was listed as for sensitive skin, it tore mine up!!!  </li>
            <li> I have recently even tried using it on my face, and surprisingly it didn&#x27;t brake me out (which has happened with every other sunscreen that I&#x27;ve ever used).  </li>
            <li> This product offers exceptional skin protection from the harsh rays of the sun/  </li>
            <li> You have to reapply more often than other zinc products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works well on other areas, and \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> It does not irritate your eyes like many other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have used it on my hands as they have the sun rash that I normally get when exposed to too much sun.</li>
            <li> Plus, it was a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We use this as our main sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After trying many brands some of which would ball up with make-up application, sweat off, or turn white when sweating I finally discovered Solbar Zinc.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my face &amp; ears.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a tad heavy.</li>
            <li> active ingredients include: Homosalate (10%), Octinoxate (7.5%) (both chemical protectors found in many other products AND Zinc Oxide (7.5%) - the physical protection ingredient that makes this cream MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply this only when the skin is dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough for my face, and I do have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer now of Solbar and will be as long as they have this product.    </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a zinc sun barrier product and this product contains 71/5 % zinc which is a very effective sun barrier.</li>
            <li> The first application was thick and sticky and ok, but additional applications were pretty just gross feeling.  </li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen of all time is Shiseido&#x27;s Anessa--but at $50 for a small 60ml container, it&#x27;s not for everyday use for all over--we just use it on our faces, where it counts most.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermotologist and I live on a lake.  </li>
            <li> I live in south Florida, so I need to use a zinc based product all the time.  </li>
            <li> I am outdoors a lot and live in California.</li>
            <li> Use this daily with no side effects and its so silky texture feels so divine especially when the sun hits my face knowing that now I can enjoy the sun&#x27;s rays without burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real greasy, like most of these products, and applies easily without leaving a thick film on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does look a little greasy when you first apply to the face but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> With my skin tone, I usually do not have to worry about sun</li>
            <li> Be aware that the amount of product you are getting is only 4.4oz.  </li>
            <li> It will eat you alive!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to put on just a small amount...</li>
            <li> This is the OLD design, so there is no telling how old particular products are.</li>
            <li> I started using it due to being sensitive to some of the ingredients in most topical products.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling hydrated but on the days when I have extremely dry skin, I use a moisturizer before and then wait a couple of minutes to let it be absorbed and then apply the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was the first one we tried that left her skin soft with no scaly patches.  </li>
            <li> Our 3 year old has very sensitive skin and has been using Solbar Zinc SPF 38 since she was an infant.</li>
            <li> Also kept wearing a swim jacket with long sleeves in and outside of the pool and ocean, so it is hard to know how much the Solbar Zinc SPF 38 contributed to the good result,</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a ton of it to cover a site, just be sure to rub it in or you&#x27;ll have a slight white appearance on your skin (from the zinc as I understand it).</li>
            <li> If you touch your face, it may feel a little goopy, but the look is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Took weeks to clear up.  </li>
            <li> Almost clear for a zinc oxide cream</li>
            <li> It has clear zinc in it</li>
            <li> Rubs in well and is clear.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> You can rub it in so the white doesn&#x27;t show without too much effort.</li>
            <li> I use this also after my monthly microderm appointment both during the day and at night as the product makes your skin incredibly soft and counteracts any redness.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sunscreen is a necessity, but it has to be a sensitive skin formula with zinc.</li>
            <li> For the face I recommend Olay Complete SPF 30.</li>
            <li> We have been using it since for both her and my 17 month old son (although he doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like she does).  </li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and has never had a reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> my 2-year-old&#x27;s sensitive cheeks don&#x27;t flare up with this product.</li>
            <li> Either way, if you have sensitive skin, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Many sunscreens are no effective.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I also had a very greasy face but then figured out to use less.</li>
            <li> then many other more expensive brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mild smell, easy to absorb, translucent, not too expensive.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my dermatologist put me on accutane, which made my already sensitive skin dry and even more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> At first I found it actively gross, especially on my legs</li>
            <li> Finally, a pharmacist at CVS is the person who first told me about this product--it had to be special-ordered back then</li>
            <li> Even those saying they provide a high percentage of both UVA and UVB protection are not the same.</li>
            <li> First, wet the skin</li>
            <li> Being as a burn survivor, (went through skin graft surgery on my arm), very important the arm to be protected for the next two summers at least.  </li>
            <li> Not only are the various chemical formulations different, but most of them provide ONLY &#x60;chemical&#x27; protection which, according to current dermatological thinking and research, is simply inadequate.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of the traditional intense sunscreen smell and it is very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> modern sunblocking preparations contain specific chemicals which DO provide some protection from the harmful rays of the sun - especially for those of us who were overexposed (and often burned) on the beach as children.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or been out in the sun with it much, but it is so greasy!</li>
            <li> For those that can wear regular sunscreens there are much cheaper alternatives that work just the same.</li>
            <li> This broad spectrum sunscreen will protect you from both UVA and UVB rays.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for zinc type sun screens but have developed an allergic reaction to other types of sun screen.</li>
            <li> After skin cancer, I know how important it is to protect my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m convinced that much of the differences in peoples&#x27; experience are from putting the creme on too heavily, too lightly, or too unevenly.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with children, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a daily moisturizer because I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solbar apparently is.</li>
            <li> Rubs in completely with no white zinc haze.</li>
            <li> The ONLY sunblock that works for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Then when I finally ordered another Solbar moisturizer, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> While the price is a little high compared to other sun blocks, it&#x27;s worth it for the degree of protection Solbar offers.</li>
            <li> Especially if you live in the Southern California sun like we do.</li>
            <li> (The vulnerability developed by those early exposures apparently never really goes</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now apply the sunscreen in broad strokes on your arms and legs, both in parallel and then transversely across the arm or leg.</li>
            <li> Oct 2013: I have used no other sunscreen since I wrote the above review.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive compared to drugstore sunscreens, and the only way I can obtain it is through ordering it online, but I have a great use out of it during the sunny seasons.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without white residue (unless you fail to rub it in well), protects skin well, and a real bonus is</li>
            <li> It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is</li>
            <li> It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is</li>
            <li> But, unlike many other Zinc based sunscreens does not leave that thick, white Zinc film that takes awhile to fade.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive skin + dry skin +</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to long bike rides, and no longer cover up completely when outside anymore.</li>
            <li> good stuff, a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> We tried several &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin brands but she either got red scaly patches, or her skin would become very dry.  </li>
            <li> When you are done, this product will leave a little white residue and feel a little sticky, but wait a bit until the excess fluid evaporates and you will be pretty</li>
            <li> you use it as a moisturizer, just remember, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in the sun for long periods of time, I choose this product for overall protection.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it at night during these really dry winter nights and it not only soothes</li>
            <li> Has micronized zinc which gives you a natural barrier but does not feel thick and chunky like old school zinc.</li>
            <li> my face has not developed any more of those spots that are not only dangerous, but unattractive as well.</li>
            <li> Because it contains Zinc Oxide, I am careful to fully rub it into my skin (especially on my face) until the whitish color becomes trasparent.</li>
            <li> My uncle uses these things that he used long ago.  </li>
            <li> It kept me from burning all week long.</li>
            <li> But the amount of time my kids spend in the sun makes Elta too pricey to keep us stocked up all summer long.</li>
            <li> Beware this is not a natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> it worked even on his unshawed face w/o leaving white residue) over the other product.</li>
            <li> I found that other brands seem to leave a white residue on my face, giving me a ghostly look.  </li>
            <li> The other weekend I rode my bike to an outdoor pool, swam for 50 minutes in the middle of the day, and then rode my bike home and never reapplied this product.  </li>
            <li> It does however give a white sheen to your skin, due to the zinc.</li>
            <li> On your face and neck, apply to wet skin and rub in broad strokes up, down, and across your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I get the protection against harmful sun rays as well as moisterizer for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it in well, and waited for it to dry; never happened.</li>
            <li> However, it was delivered in a crushed box with the inner box crushed also, but the tub of lotion was undamaged, thankfully.</li>
            <li> It was a little scary at first, because the stuff goes on almost clear - not white like other products.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the relatively low SPF of Solbar (38) make you think it provides less protection.  </li>
            <li> It can be rubbed into skin without leaving a typical white chalky look.  </li>
            <li> less toxic formulation - found it thru Skin Deep</li>
            <li> When applied to shoulders or other body areas, it soaks in thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t leave that chalky white residue as other brands are known to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big too opaque for everyday use, but I used it for that for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is not However an organic mineral sunscreen and uses some of the typical chemicals found in traditional sunscreen.</li>
            <li> recommend only using a little if applying to the face.</li>
            <li> Its not too white and it rubs in with a little effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely there, working hard to provide an effective barrier between you and skin cancer, between you and painful sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned of this product after a recent trip to the dermatologist in which I had to get a very dark, bluish mole removed (started turning slightly green actually).  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I work outside and wanted something I could wear everyday.  </li>
            <li> No issues, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Just have to wet my hands, put a dab in the hand and smoother the face.  </li>
            <li> I work outside and was looking for something to wear and reapply every few hours.  </li>
            <li> We followed another reviewer&#x27;s advice and wet our hands before applying so</li>
            <li> If you decide to use it as an everyday sunscreen, just use a smaller amount on your face to reduce the greasy look.</li>
            <li> There is really no smell.  </li>
            <li> The greasiness never really goes away.</li>
            <li> stains the car interior, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> When skin becomes wet, the product is visible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely believe and stand behind this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> oh wow so thick.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, this is due to the fact that the zinc (?) particles are so small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Upgrade your skin from the usual Neutrogena route (we used that brand for many years and hated it the whole time).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely runny and greasy, too, so my goggles kept slipping off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube is slightly too big to take in my carry-on bag, so I have to transfer it to something else for travel.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Zinc and titanium cremes work best--the FDA has some reports on other ingredients that just don&#x27;t block harmful rays.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have looked at all the other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solbar for several years on the recommendation of my dermatologist, after a having a small sun-damage-induced skin cancer removed.  </li>
            <li> The presence of other types of sunscreens on my face causes my eyes to burn.  </li>
            <li> In my hopes to develop no more of these life-threatening growths, I have begun to use this product regularly and encourage you to give it</li>
            <li> This caused me to look around for other brands that offer the Zinc.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it during a time when I was experiencing a lot of redness on my face due to allergies and sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time receiving a wrong product, and I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> My son literally screams when I use ANY other sun lotion on his face, even the stuff for babies faces.  </li>
            <li> (I usually use a different product for my face.)</li>
            <li> Rate it higher than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I resorted to this when other moisturizers weren&#x27;t hip to using zinc because of how it can leave a white&lt;br /&gt;residue</li>
            <li> Now their are other options out there for moisturizers with zinc, but this is still my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I have tried other dermatologist recommended and even baby approved, but they all cause rashes.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my face break out like almost all other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> As I already suffer from hot flashes (13+ yrs now), I don&#x27;t see the point of putting a product that includes hormones on my skin to be absorbed into my system and make an already bad situation worse.  </li>
            <li> usually only use this during the spring and summer time and then in the cooler months switch to a lower spf sunscreen since I don&#x27;t think I need one this high during the winter, and usually during the summer my major skin concern is to prevent peeling and severely dry skin because of the cold and wind!</li>
            <li> It has a zinc-based formula, which provides maximum protection, and none of the potentially dangerous chemicals of some of the mass market super sun blocs (SPF 50 and above) so common in the neighborhood drug store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried well over 15 products, including other Solbar products, and either found them uneffective or much too difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I am fanatic with sunscreen, I wear it daily</li>
            <li> This goes on thick, but after some work it leaves a barely white spread.</li>
            <li> Solbar has an aroma, and it incites my allergies slightly, but less than other zinc sunblocks I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they stick together whenever I sit down...</li>
            <li> I have had over 4 operations for melanoma removal and couldn&#x27;t find a product that would stand up to extended sun exposure without breaking down mucn sooner than advertised (say, under 2 hours).</li>
            <li> I had to wipe myself down to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Solbar has got it down to a science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have it narrowed down to 2,</li>
            <li> This sunblock has never let me down.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy any other sunscreen!</li>
            <li> In use, a thin layer typically worked several hours at a time, keeping me sunburn- and dry skin-free.    </li>
            <li> This is one of the few sunscreens that has been proven to actually provide the SPF it claims it has, it&#x27;s broad spectrum, and it doesn&#x27;t have creepy carcinogenic chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> However, you can now find it in specialty stores sometimes for less than the internet price.  </li>
            <li> I do suspect there was less product in this container than there used to be.</li>
            <li> To compare:  I was previously using Coppertone ultraguard sunscreen lotion SPF 70.  </li>
            <li> I got burned in the same amount of time I usually spend in the sun, applied as directed, where I wouldn&#x27;t have if I had been using the Coppertone like usual.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if you have between 10-15 bucks to spare, just TRY this product--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it if you want an inexpensive quality product without all the scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Adding enough water is the key to getting the stuff evenly distributed so that it doesn&#x27;t gob up and make you look like Caspar or Dracula, and so it doesn&#x27;t make very thin streaks that allow you to get burned.</li>
            <li> I am very active, walk 3 to 4 miles a day</li>
            <li> have to stress that use a little.</li>
            <li> The price tag is a little steep (~$13 for 4 ounces).  </li>
            <li> and I think it is a little shiny for that</li>
            <li> It can get a little gummy at the applicator tip, but product blends in well, even under makeup.</li>
            <li> It usually happens when the other lotions are combined with water or sweat.  </li>
            <li> it goes on a little easier.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy, but I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m in the water.</li>
            <li> It does take a little rubbing in.</li>
            <li> It is a creamy texture and causes little breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I usually put it on about 15-20 minutes before applying makeup and its usually still wet and greasy</li>
            <li> may face everyday for almost two weeks</li>
            <li> Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in the sun everyday.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and at least one other dermatologist I know.</li>
            <li> ( A little goes along way! )</li>
            <li> I agree with other users that this is not a good sunscreen for your face.  </li>
            <li> Alternatively, put a small amount of water in the palm of your hand and add the sunscreen to it, mixing evenly.</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as some of the recommended   ones that have the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wear it every day under my usual mineral-based powdered makeup.</li>
            <li> but i am not sure if any of these ingredients upsets my skin or its the %-age in the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and has no odor, other than a very subtle scent of freshness.</li>
            <li> Its too late to return, though.</li>
            <li> But, soupled with common sense, this stuff gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist disagrees there is a problem, but at least he gave me the Solbar Zinc sample and told me it doesn&#x27;t have hormones in it.</li>
            <li> If I have to wear sunscreen, and I do, this product is least offensive to me..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike others I&#x27;ve tried that leave a film and don&#x27;t allow you to sweat because they are so thick.  </li>
            <li> So thick,</li>
            <li> i hate the way they say for sensitive skin, then have trouble with it burning, tinging and breaking out your face.</li>
            <li> By the way, I am really serious about this.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> on your face, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, especially under makeup.</li>
            <li> however it goes on very thick.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it on thick!</li>
            <li> no more sunburn!!!  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat suffocating.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I&#x27;d recommend it, just don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive</li>
            <li> Living in San Diego makes it even worse!    </li>
            <li> Sorry guys, but homosalate is a xenoestrogen.  </li>
            <li> just made my face break out horribly bad.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy, ingredients aren&#x27;t too bad as I go to EWG to check on lotions.</li>
            <li> are like whoa are you sick?</li>
            <li> We tried Vanicream, Aveeno Baby, Neutrogena Baby, and others but were disappointed in all of them.  </li>
            <li> I used it for my face and it caused my skin to break out :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Referred to me by 2 dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;Zinc is good protection.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on white by then turns transparent. You don&#x27;t look like a mime.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you get it on inanimate objects, like the inside of your car, it stays white. Be careful.</li>
            <li> I like the zinc in this cream - it leaves my skin soft.  However, I need a SPF 50, so I wish this had a bit more sunblock in it.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen, works great and doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell. Also doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by a very good friend.  I order it on-line because I cannot find it in stores.  I use it on my face and neck in the summer as a substitute for my face cream.  I believe it does a great job. The shipping was very very quick and the shipping price was very reasonable also..which is always a plus when you have to order on-line.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dermatologist.  I have been using it for several years to keep my skin protected.  It contains zinc and works wonderfullly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and safest sunscreens out there! I usually only use this during the summer and it works great! Make sure to apply this only when the skin is dry and it actually does not leave a white film on the skin. I have olive toned skin so most sunscreens make my skin look a very interesting color and most people that see me are like whoa are you sick? No it&#x27;s just my sunscreen. Oh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend only using a little if applying to the face. Like a dime or nickel size amount, because it can get greasy if too much is applied. It&#x27;s a great sunscreen and has good safety ratings! Highly recommended! It also leaves my skin feeling hydrated but on the days when I have extremely dry skin, I use a moisturizer before and then wait a couple of minutes to let it be absorbed and then apply the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to stress that use a little. When I first got it, I also had a very greasy face but then figured out to use less. With my skin tone, I usually do not have to worry about sun burns too often but I do tan very easily and this helps me not to be several shades darker by the end of summer and stay my natural color. Also the price is very good considering it is a better sunscreen then many other more expensive brands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually only use this during the spring and summer time and then in the cooler months switch to a lower spf sunscreen since I don&#x27;t think I need one this high during the winter, and usually during the summer my major skin concern is to prevent peeling and severely dry skin because of the cold and wind!</li>
            <li> I agree with other users that this is not a good sunscreen for your face.  It is somewhat suffocating.  However, it applies well to arms, legs, neck, etc.  It is easy to rub in and appears to work well.  I would recommend this to folks who are looking for sunscreens with a good EWG rating.</li>
            <li> I am fanatic with sunscreen, I wear it daily therefore I only want the best of the best to apply on my skin. I have tried numerous sunscreens but they have been either too greasy or would leave a white film on my skin. Solbar zinc is light and absorbs quicly and the fact that it contains zinc mineral makes it even more valuable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not irritate my skin like all the others, so I cannot be without it each morning.  It works great under makeup and sometimes a moisturizer is not even needed in the summer with it.  I can&#x27;t find solbar zinc in any stores, so I order thru Amazon.  Thanks again !</li>
            <li> I have been using Solbar cream for about 10 years with good results. Without sunscreen for many years, I have had several melanomas and a malignant tumor on my wrist. So I am a big proponent of sunblock. Zinc and titanium cremes work best--the FDA has some reports on other ingredients that just don&#x27;t block harmful rays.&lt;br /&gt;  Solbar has an aroma, and it incites my allergies slightly, but less than other zinc sunblocks I have used.&lt;br /&gt;  I have looked at all the other reviews and I&#x27;m convinced that much of the differences in peoples&#x27; experience are from putting the creme on too heavily, too lightly, or too unevenly. Therefore, let me share my own tricks for getting the most out of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;  First, wet the skin you on which are going to apply sunscreen. Alternatively, put a small amount of water in the palm of your hand and add the sunscreen to it, mixing evenly. I start with about a marble-sized blob and spread it out; then when that&#x27;s gone I put on another marble. Now apply the sunscreen in broad strokes on your arms and legs, both in parallel and then transversely across the arm or leg. Rub in until everything is evenly covered.&lt;br /&gt;  On your face and neck, apply to wet skin and rub in broad strokes up, down, and across your face and neck. Follow up rubbing in circles, making sure the cream is distributed evenly over all the skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Adding enough water is the key to getting the stuff evenly distributed so that it doesn&#x27;t gob up and make you look like Caspar or Dracula, and so it doesn&#x27;t make very thin streaks that allow you to get burned. Also, it increases the moisture of your skin, which is then held in by the sunscreen. When you are done, this product will leave a little white residue and feel a little sticky, but wait a bit until the excess fluid evaporates and you will be pretty satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;  By the way, I am really serious about this. If you want to read how to put sunscreen on to go in the water, see my book The Ultimate Snorkeling Book by Wes Burgess on Amazon. Good luck.y Wes Burgess on Amazon. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Being as a burn survivor, (went through skin graft surgery on my arm), very important the arm to be protected for the next two summers at least.  Invited to Caribbean before the accident. Some doctors and survivors advised not to go. Some advised to go, to heal my heart therefore quicker recovery. My heart was divided.   Glad that I went with Solbar Zin SPF 38!    Also kept wearing a swim jacket with long sleeves in and outside of the pool and ocean, so it is hard to know how much the Solbar Zinc SPF 38 contributed to the good result, but the part I covered did not get any tan.   No itchiness, irritations or clogs regardless of wearing the pressure garment + silicone sheet.   For my face,  it is a bit greasy. But will use it in the mid-summer.   Knowing this one is a safer and good product, I recommend it!   Only one thing... I am not so found of this odor. [[ASIN:B000GG13TU Solbar Zinc SPF 38 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I am very fair and have been using this Solbar Zinc SPF 38 lotion for a couple summers and it is the best.  Not only does it protect, but it does not burn my eyes when some gets near/in them.  I&#x27;d like to get it in 50 SPF next year if available.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone. I have used it for a couple of years and have loved it. I never burn, but it does let you tan. I have also used it on my grandchildren and they have not burned. It is a great product. I originally got it from my dermatologist. I knew it had to be good if he recommended it and he was right.</li>
            <li> I work outside and wanted something I could wear everyday.  The product is very safe and smells wonderful.  I&#x27;ve put in on may face everyday for almost two weeks no breaks out which is really nice! feels the best so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this sun protection cream on the advice of my dermatologist.  She recommended Solbar Zinc with SPF38 as one of the best.  Here in Southern California protection against the sun is an every day necessity.  I use Solbar Zinc every day.  It has a nice consistency and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Because it contains Zinc Oxide, I am careful to fully rub it into my skin (especially on my face) until the whitish color becomes trasparent.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended. Works</li>
            <li> Excellent product. absorbs well and does not leave a film on the face.</li>
            <li> I really like this type of mineral sunscreen.  I have tried many, but this one goes on fast and easy...is not sticky either.  It has a light fragrance and has not irritated my skin.  I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> I dunno why everyone&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s non-greasy, because it is.  I put this on before I go out doing errands/running/yard work/whatever and, hours later, my skin is still sticky.  It takes a while to get used to.  At first I found it actively gross, especially on my legs (they stick together whenever I sit down...it&#x27;s just...ew).  It also makes my skin very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately though?  I&#x27;m going to pick sun protection over comfort and attractiveness.  This is one of the few sunscreens that has been proven to actually provide the SPF it claims it has, it&#x27;s broad spectrum, and it doesn&#x27;t have creepy carcinogenic chemicals in it.  It&#x27;s more comfortable to use on my face, because once it&#x27;s dried a bit I can put matte powder on top and it looks/feels fine (I don&#x27;t make enough money to cover my entire body in makeup several times a day though.)  Bottom line, I&#x27;d recommend it, just don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations.  It&#x27;s tacky stuff.</li>
            <li> I swim laps in the ocean, and Solbar protects my exposed back well. It&#x27;s a good waterproof sunblock, and without harmful chemicals. I picked it because it was one of the top ten safest sunscreens in an environmental site.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist introduced me to this product three years  ago.  I use it as my daily moisterizer and could not be more pleased.  I get the protection against harmful sun rays as well as moisterizer for my dry skin.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well and does not make you look white and shiny.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after visit to my Dermatologist.  I had to have two spots removed that were ca  ncerous  and I decided never again to go without Sunblock every day.  I am very active, walk 3 to 4 miles a day and I need protection.    It goes on smoothly is non greasey and I love it.  It&#x27;s protection from the damaging rests of the sun, even on what seems like a cloudy day.  Would&#x27;t go without it now .  It was recommended to me by my Daughter who is a Rwsearch Scientist.  She knows what she is talking about.!!  Marie  SOLBAR. Please don&#x27;t go without it if you care about yourself.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for zinc type sun screens but have developed an allergic reaction to other types of sun screen. Aside from that, this is the best of the zinc types I&#x27;ve used. You can rub it in so the white doesn&#x27;t show without too much effort. It is too expensive but I have no choice.</li>
            <li> As far far I can tell it gives good protection without the allergens of so many products. Not greasy and [I believe] invisible once applied. Recommended for those who find most sunscreens unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit Oct 2013: I have used no other sunscreen since I wrote the above review. I don&#x27;t really like sunscreen - but I know I have to use it, and this has definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with another Zinc based one (70 SPF) for our recent trip to HI. My biggest concern was spreadability without the white film and SPF. After using both products I conclude that this Solbar product worked really well (and better than the other product) w/o the white film, was very light and easy to spread, non-greasy and SPF was perfectly fine (no sunburn despite being out in the sun the whole day - 1 re-application/day). We ran out of this one right away as the whole family preferred to use it (esp. my husband - it worked even on his unshawed face w/o leaving white residue) over the other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solbar for several years on the recommendation of my dermatologist, after a having a small sun-damage-induced skin cancer removed.  This is an effective sun block, easy to apply, long-lasting, smooth and easily absorbed, not goopy or chalky.  It has a zinc-based formula, which provides maximum protection, and none of the potentially dangerous chemicals of some of the mass market super sun blocs (SPF 50 and above) so common in the neighborhood drug store.  Don&#x27;t let the relatively low SPF of Solbar (38) make you think it provides less protection.  In several years of use, even with a lot of outdoor activity, I&#x27;ve never yet had a sunburn nor seen evidence of any further sun damage.  While the price is a little high compared to other sun blocks, it&#x27;s worth it for the degree of protection Solbar offers.</li>
            <li> Contains OctylMethoxycinnamate,  a known endocrine disruptor, so I&#x27;m not buying this product.</li>
            <li> A few months ago my dermatologist put me on accutane, which made my already sensitive skin dry and even more sensitive to the sun. Sensitive skin + dry skin + Arizona &#x3D; no bueno.     Basically out of all the samples my dermo gave me, Solbar zinc was the only sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make me want to scream when I applied it. Plus, it was a decent moisturizer. In use, a thin layer typically worked several hours at a time, keeping me sunburn- and dry skin-free.    Basically, I have no complaints. Works great! A must-have for the dry-skinned.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It is lightweight, but it does tend to leave a white residue on the skin, which I specifically need for my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of the traditional intense sunscreen smell and it is very long lasting.  I have recently even tried using it on my face, and surprisingly it didn&#x27;t brake me out (which has happened with every other sunscreen that I&#x27;ve ever used).  It is a little expensive compared to drugstore sunscreens, and the only way I can obtain it is through ordering it online, but I have a great use out of it during the sunny seasons.  I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product is great for me.  The presence of other types of sunscreens on my face causes my eyes to burn.  This zinc product doesn&#x27;t do that and provides great protection.  I received it promptly from the seller and it was undamaged.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a zinc sun barrier product and this product contains 71/5 % zinc which is a very effective sun barrier. Much better for skin than chemical sun screens. It can be rubbed into skin without leaving a typical white chalky look.  Found it to be moisturizing, not irrating, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> All sunscreens are not the same.  Even those listing the same degree of Sun Protection Factor (SPF) are not the same.  Even those saying they provide a high percentage of both UVA and UVB protection are not the same. Knowing what the real differences are can give you information that can be, quite literally, life saving.  Not only are the various chemical formulations different, but most of them provide ONLY &#x60;chemical&#x27; protection which, according to current dermatological thinking and research, is simply inadequate.  A layer of &#x60;physical&#x27; protection is needed as an ingredient in sunscreen creams and lotions to assure a more complete safety screen for your body.  Zinc Oxide is one of those physical sun blockers - and one most often recommended by professionals. It is found in this SOLBAR sunscreen which I have been using faithfully - since being diagnosed with a melanoma (which was successfully and completely) surgically removed.  In my hopes to develop no more of these life-threatening growths, I have begun to use this product regularly and encourage you to give it some thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most modern sunblocking preparations contain specific chemicals which DO provide some protection from the harmful rays of the sun - especially for those of us who were overexposed (and often burned) on the beach as children. (The vulnerability developed by those early exposures apparently never really goes away.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients include: Homosalate (10%), Octinoxate (7.5%) (both chemical protectors found in many other products AND Zinc Oxide (7.5%) - the physical protection ingredient that makes this cream MUCH more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a physician - so do not consider myself qualified to give a medical opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a melanoma survivor, I DO feel qualified (and even kind of compelled) to advise you about this product - and to suggest that, if you have doubts about what I am saying, to check with your own Physician or, if you have access to the specialty, a Board Certified Dermatologist. It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is your health, safety and life worth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the beach - but I love my life more.  How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  Give it a try!ss to the specialty, a Board Certified Dermatologist. It is a bit more expensive than other brands - but how much is your health, safety and life worth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the beach - but I love my life more.  How wonderful to be able to enjoy the first without fearing that it will lead to the premature conclusion of the second.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I learned of this product after a recent trip to the dermatologist in which I had to get a very dark, bluish mole removed (started turning slightly green actually).  I have freckles and fair skin, so my risk for skin cancer is very high without any protection.  Living in San Diego makes it even worse!    I found that most sunblocks that I have used don&#x27;t hold up if I perspire from activity, often leaving me with a reddish nose or shoulders after a day of activity.   NOT with this sunblock though.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the Zinc or what, but one application in the morning lasts all day, even after playing tennis or hiking 6-8 miles up Iron Mntn. and back.  I am a loyal customer now of Solbar and will be as long as they have this product.    The price tag is a little steep (~$13 for 4 ounces).  This caused me to look around for other brands that offer the Zinc.  I found that other brands seem to leave a white residue on my face, giving me a ghostly look.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll have to deal with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunblock for many years.  Works great on my sensitive skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used this on a backpacking trip where I wanted to use unscented products to avoid the attention of large, furry things with teeth.  No issues, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> The Solbar sunscreen has zinc, but totally disappears on the skin. Full protection without a greasy feel, and it can be worn under makeup.</li>
            <li> Sunblock with zinc was recommended by my dermatologist. I have found this to be an effective sunblock.  I will give it a real \\&quot;test\\&quot; when I use it in the Bahamas this winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen , actually &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; I will ever buy and it&#x27;s convenient to purchase through Amazon. My dermatologist highly recommends this product for people allergic to the sun, as I am!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use Solbar faithfully! It is the truly the best sunblock ,make-up base and very good for sensitive skin. I even use it in the winter months. A great product and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I use medical-grade Obagi for my face, and Solbar for everything else. Since I am a bicyclist, I spend hours at a time outdoors. This is a very effective sunscreen. Good value.</li>
            <li> I have skin cancer and my dermatologist/oncologist recommended Solbar years ago.  It&#x27;s a great product - light, smell-free, applies easily.  You don&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen.  It&#x27;s unlike others I&#x27;ve tried that leave a film and don&#x27;t allow you to sweat because they are so thick.  Great product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. You don&#x27;t need a ton of it to cover a site, just be sure to rub it in or you&#x27;ll have a slight white appearance on your skin (from the zinc as I understand it). Haven&#x27;t had an issue with burns, even if we don&#x27;t follow the reapplication time to the tee. I recommend this product for anyone with children, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is fantastic.  It contains Zinc, which is a huge plus.  But, unlike many other Zinc based sunscreens does not leave that thick, white Zinc film that takes awhile to fade.  I play beach volleyball and re-apply constantly throughout a given day of play and Solbar provides excellent protection.  It&#x27;s mild enough for my face, and I do have fairly sensitive skin.  Solbar has never triggered clogged pores or acne for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it is not as good as other zinc sunblocks/sunscreens.  You have to reapply more often than other zinc products I&#x27;ve used.  For sure can&#x27;t do a 2-3hr surf session in the tropics, though it is better than your average sunscreen you would find at your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Use this daily with no side effects and its so silky texture feels so divine especially when the sun hits my face knowing that now I can enjoy the sun&#x27;s rays without burning.</li>
            <li> Works as described, no issues</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, but homosalate is a xenoestrogen.  I was excited when I came across a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen with great reviews but I had a feeling it was too good to be true.  My quest for the perfect sun screen continues :/.</li>
            <li> I think it protects well, smells mild enough that my 7 and 10 year old don&#x27;t complain and it goes on easily. Its not too white and it rubs in with a little effort.  We have tried ALOT of mineral sunscreens and so far this is the best for our purposes: mild smell, easy to absorb, translucent, not too expensive. I am tempted to take off a star because the description says it wears well under make-up and I think it is a little shiny for that but otherwise it is a good sunscreen for the price and priceless if my kids will wear it without complaint. I also noticed it on sale at my dermotologists so I figure that is another feather in its cap.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for my face and chest areas, the Zinc is better for your skin than chemicals in alot of sunscreens. It can get a little gummy at the applicator tip, but product blends in well, even under makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this on my face. I&#x27;m sure it works well on other areas, and \\&quot;oh god\\&quot; if you get it in your eyes, but don&#x27;t buy this if you want a sunblock for your face unless you want to feel like you&#x27;ve rubbed a mcdonalds hamburger all over you.</li>
            <li> I have had several skin cancers removed and am no longer allowed in the sun without  a good sunscreen.  The Solbar Zinc works great.  Not as expensive as some of the recommended   ones that have the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used this Sunblock for years, which was recommended to me by a leading dermatologist. It is totally non-greasy, and odorless. It&#x27;s protective power lasts for hours, and is waterproof in saltwater too. I continue to order it year after year. It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Very effective and recommended by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> The sunblock is recommended by our dermatologist.  A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> My family and I are very satisfied with this sunscreen (recommended by my dermatologist) and we will be ordering this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen - unlike so many others - does not leave you paste-y white.  It blends into your skin nicely and can be worn easily under make-up or without.  It remains on for the entire day.  If you touch your face, it may feel a little goopy, but the look is fabulous.  The sunscreen does its job in protecting you well throughout the day and can be reapplied if you&#x27;re not wearing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful quality is that this product is wonderfully beneficial and healing to your skin.  My dermatologist recommended it during a time when I was experiencing a lot of redness on my face due to allergies and sensitivities.  I use this also after my monthly microderm appointment both during the day and at night as the product makes your skin incredibly soft and counteracts any redness.  I have also found it useful during the winter when my skin becomes extremely dry as this sunscreen has wonderful moisturizing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this at my dermatologist office, but she has stopped carrying it.  I search it out on the internet whenever I run out as I do not want to be without this product!</li>
            <li> Good protection however it goes on very thick.  I got it to use on my face and I usually put it on about 15-20 minutes before applying makeup and its usually still wet and greasy and I have to pat my face with a towel.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen, so I bought some. It seems to work very well thanks to the zinc oxide component. My only complaint is that the tube is slightly too big to take in my carry-on bag, so I have to transfer it to something else for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have Lupus. I appreciated that there was a typed note regarding the cancer risk of this sunscreen. Its too late to return, though.</li>
            <li> Just have to wet my hands, put a dab in the hand and smoother the face.  Works very well for me.</li>
            <li> So thick, oh wow so thick.  I work outside and was looking for something to wear and reapply every few hours.  The first application was thick and sticky and ok, but additional applications were pretty just gross feeling.  I tried it on my face and the greasiness just made my face break out horribly bad.  Took weeks to clear up.  Now I just use it as my first coat on my arms and legs, but once it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, as I have a problem with allergies to most skin sun  protection products.  However, it was delivered in a crushed box with the inner box crushed also, but the tub of lotion was undamaged, thankfully.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, and what I received today was a completely different product- Person &amp; Covey inc.&#x27;s solbar zinc sunscreen, which is not a physical sunscreen at all. This is my first time receiving a wrong product, and I don&#x27;t know what to do. Maybe they did it indiliberately, but I still can&#x27;t trust them from now on......</li>
            <li> A friend recommend this to me.  My son literally screams when I use ANY other sun lotion on his face, even the stuff for babies faces.  It usually happens when the other lotions are combined with water or sweat.  I used this on my son and hallelujah finally one that doesn&#x27;t make him scream.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that has super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s extremely gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I ran out of this, I bought a Neutrogena face moisturizer with sunblock, and I got an allergic reaction to it (face broke out into tiny dots that looked like a heat rash and they stung whenever I washed my face). Then when I finally ordered another Solbar moisturizer, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin well with no greasiness. I have rosacea and sunscreen is a necessity, but it has to be a sensitive skin formula with zinc. The zinc actually helps with the rosacea breakouts. This is nice.</li>
            <li> Will buy this from now on. Has the ingredients you need and none of the ones you don&#x27;t. Goes on smooth, easy to work in and I can go to the beach without looking like I just came from a mime class.</li>
            <li> We have ordered and used 3 of these now....great product.  We followed another reviewer&#x27;s advice and wet our hands before applying so it goes on a little easier.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist to protect my skin from the sun. It rubs in and is invisible.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Goes on smoothly &amp; protects very well.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunblock that rubs in clean and works perfectly.  I apply once before I hit the course and after being out there for 3-4 hours I feel no burn.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen for my face when I surf, and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a little greasy, but I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;m in the water. If you decide to use it as an everyday sunscreen, just use a smaller amount on your face to reduce the greasy look.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this sunscreen based on the great reviews. When I went to see my dermatologist a few weeks later, I was happy to see that he listed this brand as one of his favorites. This broad spectrum sunscreen will protect you from both UVA and UVB rays. Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it on thick!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen - less toxic formulation - found it thru Skin Deep (google this).  Very light scent.</li>
            <li> After being diagnosed with Basel Cell cancer, I knew I needed excellent sun protection and Solbar  met my needs.  It has also helped my scar heal and now I use it all the time.  I&#x27;ve even used it at night during these really dry winter nights and it not only soothes but  I have noticed the scar on my face has diminished.</li>
            <li> This product offers exceptional skin protection from the harsh rays of the sun/  The sink oxide is a well known medication to prevent sunburn</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.  Provides excellent sun protection.  However, you can now find it in specialty stores sometimes for less than the internet price.  So shop before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was searching for. Good sun protection and I love the moisturizer in this product. Absorbs well without being sticky.</li>
            <li> I have had over 4 operations for melanoma removal and couldn&#x27;t find a product that would stand up to extended sun exposure without breaking down mucn sooner than advertised (say, under 2 hours). I&#x27;ve tried well over 15 products, including other Solbar products, and either found them uneffective or much too difficult to apply. Not so with this Zinc 38spf. It applies easily, will provide protection in well over 2 hours in the water, and won&#x27;t weep into your eyes if you&#x27;re sweating. I realize that 38spf is lower than many cancer patients are directed to use, but I have found this to provide protection easily on the level of most 50spf+ chemical sunscreens. I&#x27;m back to long bike rides, and no longer cover up completely when outside anymore. Just a great product!</li>
            <li> Found this one. Used around end of summer just once actually lol but will use more next summer.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t feel overly greasy and I think the scent was nice too.. I definitely liked it on my skin, felt good.</li>
            <li> Zinc content is lower than I thought only 7.5%</li>
            <li> no more sunburn!!!  and it really does absorb as promised!</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended and healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li> My uncle uses these things that he used long ago.  Many of the manufacturers have gone out of business.  He lives on Maui and couldn&#x27;t find it there.  I looked on Oahu, couldn&#x27;t find it.  So I went to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it to him and he was so happy to get the exact product that he is used to using.</li>
            <li> This is a really good sunscreen because of the amount of zinc in it.  My dermatologist approved it.  It&#x27;s thick and goes on smoothly.  I use it for my arms and legs, and sometimes for my face.  (I usually use a different product for my face.)</li>
            <li> This seems to do the trick by keeping my face well protected from the sun.  It goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for excellent protection when swimming.  Has micronized zinc which gives you a natural barrier but does not feel thick and chunky like old school zinc.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and used this on my face for a two day outdoor event and just got a healthy glow.  I wish I would have used it on my hands as they have the sun rash that I normally get when exposed to too much sun.</li>
            <li> Great product, recommended by my doctor,  got here on time.  Great service!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paranoid of wrinkles, sunspots, sunburns, tans.  This sunblock did the job when I went to Six Flags for a whole day in 90 degree weather!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect for sun protection for white people that are very light and are prone to skin cancer.  It works well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really protects the wifes skin.  She never goes outside without it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for sensitive skin or aversions to fragrance.  There is really no smell.  It provides very adequate sun protection.  It&#x27;s a nice tube that allows you to use all the product.</li>
            <li> Yes it did. I use it all the time and my pharmacy where I get it says it was on backrest. I am allergic to most commercial sunscreens I swell up and get hives. This over doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> On side of package says has ingredient not allowed in CA</li>
            <li> We use this as our main sunscreen. It works well for us. It does take a little rubbing in. It was recommended to us by our dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Won&#x27;t leave you looking like you forgot to rub your sunscreen in and protects your skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine product.  I started using it due to being sensitive to some of the ingredients in most topical products.  I have no problem with this one.  I do suspect there was less product in this container than there used to be.</li>
            <li> Thisis the best sunscreen I have ever found.  Originally suggested to me by my Moh&#x27;s Surgeon.  Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, we order it every time that we need it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my favorite sunscreen, will never use anything else.... well, never say never ;)</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides good protection but also is very greasy. The greasiness never really goes away. It is a creamy texture and causes little breakouts. Not aesthetically pleasing. I would not recommend using this on the face. I am combo-oily in summer and more dry in the winter &amp; acne-prone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for a great product. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solbar Zinc for many years and love it. I won&#x27;t even try another brand! In fact, I mix a dab in the palm of my hand, squeeze a  bit of my liquid foundation in, mix it together and apply to my face. Voila! Works fabulously!  Not only is it a fantastic non-greasy sunscreen, it acts as a moisturizer to my medium-dry skin. When applied to shoulders or other body areas, it soaks in thoroughly and doesn&#x27;t leave that chalky white residue as other brands are known to do. Finally, a pharmacist at CVS is the person who first told me about this product--it had to be special-ordered back then as the store didn&#x27;t (and doesn&#x27;t) carry it in their standard sunscreen inventory. Best decision I ever made. Honestly, if you have between 10-15 bucks to spare, just TRY this product--you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use this sunblock on my face when I&#x27;m exercising outdoors.  It&#x27;s a big too opaque for everyday use, but I used it for that for a long time.  The other weekend I rode my bike to an outdoor pool, swam for 50 minutes in the middle of the day, and then rode my bike home and never reapplied this product.  My face didn&#x27;t burn at all!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is great zinc sunscreen - it isn&#x27;t too oily and it rubs in mostly clear. It kept me safe under intense, frequent sun surfing in Mexico during the peak of summer, which is pretty much all I could ask from a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I saw the show Dr. Oz had with Dr. Andrew Weil about sunscreen. They said that sunscreen containing Oxybenzone is a HORMONE DISRUPTOR. You need to buy the sunscreen that has zinc oxide or titanium dioxide in it. It is more of a mechanical barrier rather than a chemical barrier. I was amazed at how many of the products in stores have the oxybenzone hormone disruptor in them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I found this one on Amazon in time for my cruise to the Bahamas. It goes on creamy unlike many sunscreens with zinc oxide, and massages in well. It kept me from burning all week long. For the face I recommend Olay Complete SPF 30. I have used that for many years on my face and neck and now I&#x27;m in my 40s and don&#x27;t have nearly the lines and wrinkles of women much younger than me!</li>
            <li> great to find zinc in a sunscreen.  Wonderful that I can just purchase on amazon.</li>
            <li> This sunblock was recommended by my dermatologist because of the zinc content.  A little bit goes a long ways.  I use it under my makeup every day.</li>
            <li> Looking for a sunscreen that works great under foundation?  This is it.  After trying many brands some of which would ball up with make-up application, sweat off, or turn white when sweating I finally discovered Solbar Zinc.  Save yourself time &amp; money &amp; simply check out this product.</li>
            <li> keeps the sun off my neck and ears</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen and the price here is reasonable</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, I took this to North Carolina last September, and in combination with a sun shelter and coolibar clothing, sustained zero sun damage to my skin. It was a little scary at first, because the stuff goes on almost clear - not white like other products.  Apparently, this is due to the fact that the zinc (?) particles are so small.  But, soupled with common sense, this stuff gets the job done.</li>
            <li> When my 3 year old was a baby and young toddler, and us living in Phoenix, AZ, it was important to find a good sunscreen.  We tried several &#x27;sensitive&#x27; skin brands but she either got red scaly patches, or her skin would become very dry.  We tried Vanicream, Aveeno Baby, Neutrogena Baby, and others but were disappointed in all of them.  I found this one in a specialty drugstore and decided to try it.  It was the first one we tried that left her skin soft with no scaly patches.  We have been using it since for both her and my 17 month old son (although he doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like she does).  I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the price and that we go through one tube in about two weeks.  Maybe I&#x27;m over-lathering, but I want to make sure they are covered as they play outside throughout the day.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> not as toxic as conventional sunblock and it works great.  stains the car interior, so be careful.  good stuff, a little expensive.  one tube lasts me and my hubby 3 days in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> this product is great for because it is non burning and causes no tears; also non greasy, and my wife and Kid both, love it!</li>
            <li> Great; will take a while to work into routine</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor recommended this product for him and now I use it too. It&#x27;s not real greasy, like most of these products, and applies easily without leaving a thick film on my skin. I use it on my face all the time. My husband has sensitive skin and has never had a reaction to this product. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Have been using for years on face and body. Rib it in well.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermotologist and I live on a lake.  I bought lots and lots of them.  They work very well in the sun and in the water!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great and rubs in pretty well.  not as white as i thought.</li>
            <li> This product is moisturizing yet it&#x27;s not greasy feeling and the best part is it protects for hours on the golf course. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles and will re-order again as needed!</li>
            <li> Almost clear for a zinc oxide cream</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a couple years.  Dr wanted me to use a sunscreen with zink in it. I love how it makes my skin on my face feel.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my doctor. It is great and the zinc is a great blocker.  Cream works in well, and a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Solbar years ago. I wear it every day under my usual mineral-based powdered makeup. It&#x27;s non-greasy and has no odor, other than a very subtle scent of freshness. I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more so now I order online. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I used it for my face and it caused my skin to break out :(</li>
            <li> Solbar is a wonderful sunblock. I have been working outside in the sun all week and this product totally protected my arms and chest and neck. The zinc oxide is what protects your skin. Most sunscreen products do not contain zinc so if you&#x27;re looking for good sun protection, this is it.</li>
            <li> Definitely stopped the itching on my arm. I only had to use it once and since that time I have not had another ocurance.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist turned me on to his sun screen. Not greasy and it works. Rate it higher than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Only Sun Screen that does not break me out in a rash and it is especially good for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this as a daily moisturizer because I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The Zinc in this helps keep my skin hydrated and it&#x27;s non-comedogenic so doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.&lt;br /&gt;It helps heal and prevent acne. I resorted to this when other moisturizers weren&#x27;t hip to using zinc because of how it can leave a white&lt;br /&gt;residue on your face, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad, especially under makeup. Now their are other options out there for moisturizers with zinc, but this is still my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it as a moisturizer, just remember, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I generally use EltaMD, I love their sunscreens. But the amount of time my kids spend in the sun makes Elta too pricey to keep us stocked up all summer long. In search of an alternative, the pharmacist at my CVS told me this stuff is the best they sell. It goes on smoothly without white residue (unless you fail to rub it in well), protects skin well, and a real bonus is my 2-year-old&#x27;s sensitive cheeks don&#x27;t flare up with this product. It does look a little greasy when you first apply to the face but absorbs quickly. Highly recommend trying it if you want an inexpensive quality product without all the scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Has improved my face skin, and it&#x27;s easy to use. Wish we could buy it locally. Price seems about right.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by the doctor who performed my dermabrasion. My skin had become blotchy from too many years of sun exposure, so after the procedure i was given Solbar Zinc SPF 38 to prevent further damage. It&#x27;s not only a sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;but a great moisturizer as well. ( A little goes along way! )&lt;br /&gt;With consistent use my face has not developed any more of those spots that are not only dangerous, but unattractive as well.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist, and at least one other dermatologist I know. When I remember to use it, and I do almost all the time, it prevents me from getting sunburned, and I swim at midday for an hour at a time. And it stays on even in the water.</li>
            <li> Sobar Zinc Sun Protection is not just another sunscreen. It is a sun block. It blocks out harmful UV rays! It does not wash off. It lasts for hours. After skin cancer, I know how important it is to protect my delicate skin. I have tried numerous sun protectors and Sobar Zinc Protection Cream is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 2002.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist.  I tried other products that were okay, but I still will always like this best.  I am glad to find it still on Amazon.  I carry it with me all during the hot weather.  I like the cream better than the lotion.  The solbar in the bottle says cream but it is lotion.  Definitely buying some more!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough or been out in the sun with it much, but it is so greasy! I rubbed it in well, and waited for it to dry; never happened. I had to wipe myself down to get rid of it. I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand to try.</li>
            <li> I had a skin condition that was irritated by the sun.  I did some research and found this product.  It has clear zinc in it so it really provides great coverage.  The condition I had has gone away but I&#x27;m still using this product to protect my skin from sun damage.  My dermatologist was impressed I found this product on my own.</li>
            <li> good product good price</li>
            <li> Solbar Zinc SPF38 is an excellent sunscreen that protects you from the sun and also doesn&#x27;t contain oxybenzone, which always turns my clothes orange where they touch the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> To date I have used two tubes of the Solbar Zinc SPF38 - for me the results were great. I am out side most of the day - every day. The solbar really does the job. My dermotologist even asked me what I was using - It&#x27;s that good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Three more tubes at a very good price / The standard shipping from the factory was inexpensive and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKD</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for when you are playing sports outdoors. Physical protection is always best. This goes on thick, but after some work it leaves a barely white spread.</li>
            <li> Have used this product after working for a dermatologist for several years.  The whiteness of formula is great for covering up rosesea or any dark pigmented skin.  Great for use under makeup as a skin brightener while also protecting from broad spectrum rays.</li>
            <li> Since it has a zinc block it really does the trick.  It does not irritate your eyes like many other sunscreens.  It does however give a white sheen to your skin, due to the zinc.</li>
            <li> Only sunblock that doesn&#x27;t break out our children.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen of all time is Shiseido&#x27;s Anessa--but at $50 for a small 60ml container, it&#x27;s not for everyday use for all over--we just use it on our faces, where it counts most. And Anessa lasts for only about two hours per application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for an all-body, super-effective, completely natural, apply-once-and-forget-about-it sunscreen, you cannot do better than Solbar Zinc SPF 38. Sure, it&#x27;s a tad heavy. You do FEEL it on, if you apply it to your face. It&#x27;s definitely there, working hard to provide an effective barrier between you and skin cancer, between you and painful sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with sunscreens is that the heavier they are, the longer they last. If you use Shiseido Anessa, you&#x27;ll have to reapply every two hours. If you use Solbar, you might not have to reapply at all. Seriously. And the price is reasonable, if not downright cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upgrade your skin from the usual Neutrogena route (we used that brand for many years and hated it the whole time). Solbar has got it down to a science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the reviewer who said Solbar is greasy, well, I could not disagree more. Solbar is NOT greasy. Not oily. In fact, there are NO oils in the sunscreen whatsoever (which is good if you get clogged pores, like me). Solbar is a substantial layer, however. Mostly silicones (which protect the skin from drying out) and transparent zinc (which does the sun-blocking). I&#x27;m buying another tube of this stuff now--good to have one in the car and one in the house. Especially if you live in the Southern California sun like we do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Irish descent living in San Diego.  To compare:  I was previously using Coppertone ultraguard sunscreen lotion SPF 70.  I chose SOLBAR because the zinc oxide is a healthier option for good UVB protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say?  This stuff pales in comparison to the Coppertone I was using.  I got burned in the same amount of time I usually spend in the sun, applied as directed, where I wouldn&#x27;t have if I had been using the Coppertone like usual.  There&#x27;s the proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it REALLY burned my eyes, and yes, I waited over 1/2 hour for it to dry just to be sure.  It&#x27;s extremely runny and greasy, too, so my goggles kept slipping off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL NOTE:  Be aware that the amount of product you are getting is only 4.4oz.  The \\&quot;product weight\\&quot; listed on Amazon is 8.8oz.  I called them and told them this, so hopefully that&#x27;s resolved now.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I can easily apply my makeup over it. I live in south Florida, so I need to use a zinc based product all the time.  I originally heard about this product from a very well known plastic surgeon who told me years ago that using this product would be my best defense to keep my skin from aging.</li>
            <li> Even though it was listed as for sensitive skin, it tore mine up!!!  i hate the way they say for sensitive skin, then have trouble with it burning, tinging and breaking out your face. There &#x3D;are four ingredients and i have it narrowed down to 2, but i am not sure if any of these ingredients upsets my skin or its the %-age in the cream. Either way, if you have sensitive skin, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff.  It will eat you alive!  wish i could return</li>
            <li> Safe for my skin and protects me from the sun. No harshness and no horrible smells either. Would definately purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on great - not greasy and is clear. I use it mainly for my face &amp; ears.  it  I have used it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Beware this is not a natural sunscreen.  That said, it feels and works fine.  For those that can wear regular sunscreens there are much cheaper alternatives that work just the same.</li>
            <li> The only sunblock that does not break-out my face.  I have tried other dermatologist recommended and even baby approved, but they all cause rashes.  Only Solbar Zinc doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t have hormones in it. As I already suffer from hot flashes (13+ yrs now), I don&#x27;t see the point of putting a product that includes hormones on my skin to be absorbed into my system and make an already bad situation worse.  My dermatologist disagrees there is a problem, but at least he gave me the Solbar Zinc sample and told me it doesn&#x27;t have hormones in it.</li>
            <li> Best sun protection without the high price!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The zinc makes this a better sunscreen as zinc is effective immediately.  Rubs in well and is clear.  It is not However an organic mineral sunscreen and uses some of the typical chemicals found in traditional sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen that does not penetrate into your body.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  We all use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, quick and easy delivery within 2 days of ordering. Our 3 year old has very sensitive skin and has been using Solbar Zinc SPF 38 since she was an infant. It has great coverage and she never burns (if applied all over :-)). I use it on my face for extra protection. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product applies easily considering that it contains zinc. Goes on and seems to be absorbed.  When skin becomes wet, the product is visible. One can either wipe it away or be confident that the coverage is still there. Many sunscreens are no effective. Solbar apparently is.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my face break out like almost all other sunscreens. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the white cast it gave.</li>
            <li> I originally got samples of this product from a dermatologist, as most sunscreens make me break out.  I looked for it in the retail shops in my area, but no one carries it for some reason, so I was happy to get it on line.  I used it on a recent trip to Hawaii; it didn&#x27;t totally stop the sunburn, but did minimize it, and I tanned a bit rather than burn.  It does not leave a white residue like some zinc sunscreens, and did not give me a rash.</li>
            <li> This works great as a daily moisturizer.  Rubs in completely with no white zinc haze. I can&#x27;t speak to how well it blocks sun as I avoid sun, but for daily use its great.  And it must have a fair amount of zinc as it took care of athletes foot fungus caused by using non zinc moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I use it on my face daily as a sunscreen and a moisturizer.  I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The ONLY sunblock that works for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this sunblock. I am a two-time melanoma survivor, including several basil cells, etc.  I am outdoors a lot and live in California. I play golf and even do some fishing in tropical waters, where I am out to sea for several days. This sunblock has never let me down. I discovered it after my 2nd melanoma, when my dermatologist suggested the brand. I also use the gel and it&#x27;s excellent. But this one feels better on the skin, has never affected my eyes and has given unprecedented performance under the most severe conditions. I have somewhat oily, sensitive skin and this also feels the best vs all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and I use Solbar Zinc for face protection.  Recommended by an associate at my allergist, after I mentioned store-bought sunscreens tended to burn my eyes when I would sweat in the sun.  This does not, which is a big relief!</li>
            <li> Works fine but it bothers my eyes if I sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always working outside. So this product gives me the additional protection against those harmful rays of the sun. I absolutely believe and stand behind this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, but I WOULD NOT buy the one shown here.  Solbar changed their product packaging.  This is the OLD design, so there is no telling how old particular products are.</li>
            <li> This product comes out of the tube with a smooth wet consistency so it spreads  easily. It works very well, I got no burns after a week at the beach. Great product!</li>
            <li> If I have to wear sunscreen, and I do, this product is least offensive to me.. Be sure to put on just a small amount... Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my Dermatologist.  If I&#x27;m in the sun for long periods of time, I choose this product for overall protection.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it contains a high quality of zinc which protects the skin naturally from the sun.</li>
            <li> I surf a lot and I&#x27;m in the sun everyday.  I need protection like what this product gives.</li>
            <li> I read and believe that zinc is the key/best ingredient in sunscreen.  This goes on smoothly and protects. It is the only sunscreen we use since we discovered it many years ago.  Tube is convenient for travel, but TSA may (or may not) take it away if you carry it in carryon for the plane.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good while fishing!</li>
            <li> Item has changed in package look only , and is now orange in color. Appears to be the same great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Everything about it is great.  Wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
            <li> best suntan lotion ever, recomend it highly. Used many other brands, didn&#x27;t have any success with them, this on works and works well.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years...won&#x27;t buy any other sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you white as others do. Not too greasy, ingredients aren&#x27;t too bad as I go to EWG to check on lotions.</li>
