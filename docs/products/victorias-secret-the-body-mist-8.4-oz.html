            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. My go-to everyday. Day or night, spray and go must have. I love high end European perfumes with not too strong fragrances. I usually hate body sprays such as fantasies by Victoria secret. When I buy them I always end up giving them away. I don&#x27;t like sugary smells but this one I absolutely adore. but what I just bought was water, alcohol, and a tiny hint of fragrance.I have a bottle in my car one at home and one to travel. It&#x27;s that serious lol. So I am very familiar with the smell and am upset that I paid 30 bucks for some fake lazy imitation. Even after a work out you can spray it quickly until you get home to shower. I really wish this was the real stuff because I&#x27;m almost out. The second Stars was out of pity.</li>
            <li> Victoria secrets discontinued this :( it is my favorite</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Delivery was perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love.love,love this scent. Very light clean scent. Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> favorite VS scent. soft and feminine</li>
            <li> Love! I call it my &amp;#34;man killer&amp;#34; perfume!</li>
            <li> Been using for over 10 years</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite body mist.  Am so happy that I could find it on Amazon, since Victoria&#x27;s Secret has discontinued!</li>
            <li> This one flys off the shelf.I like it occasionally for the day.Its got a grapefruit base/slight flower..Not my favorite but its okay</li>
            <li> Love this! VS doesn&#x27;t sell it in store anymore. This is my second bottle buying off here &amp; I love it. Delivery was prompt. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this perfume!</li>
            <li> Fresh and perfect for everyday use!!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I rated with four stars is because it wasn&#x27;t delivered on time but I mean, what can they do, of course i ordered it during the holidays so it took a little longer to get it but I&#x27;m etremely satisfied :))</li>
            <li> Great fragance for everyday use, elegant, soft and fresh. Still, if I want to have more freshness and flavor longer, I spray over after 12 hours, which is fine for me.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, so glad you can purchase this still after VS discontinued carrying it. I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s the only one I wear, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just received the perfume.Shipped on time and I enjoy the smell BUT it&#x27;s more of an instant ion because it&#x27;s not a so STRONG smell like the original from Victoria secret.</li>
            <li> Order came in quickly and everything was just perfect.</li>
            <li> LOVE! My ABSOLUTE FAV</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this particular scent from Victoria&#x27;s Secret!  She has used it ever since it was released to the stores. This time, I gave it to her as a Mothers&#x27; Day gift. It&#x27;s so convenient to shop for it by mail from Amozon</li>
