            <li> Its sturdy and it holds up great, even after cutting it and washing.</li>
            <li> They all had poor stitching with two already unraveling right out of the package.</li>
            <li> I received my with the threads a bit loose and I was worried the cap band would fall part</li>
            <li> so I will be just buying locally next time its also a bit tight</li>
            <li> The cap looks small and constructed differently, I haven&#x27;t used it so it&#x27;s hanging out in my sock drawer.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s smaller seriously will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It fits snuggly on your head without being too tight.  </li>
            <li> Much to tight on my head</li>
            <li> This should be sized because compared to other brands its much smaller and gets smaller if used for wig making, how ever the material appears durable but the band is very wide, bad for edges and circulation.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these</li>
            <li> I have a small head and silky hair, this item slides off my head in no time.</li>
            <li> Maybe my head is too small...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is the only cap I use to sew my wigs; and the only one I will buy! It&#x27;s very secure, and perfect for my head.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these so I could make some wigs and was really upset with what I received. They all had poor stitching with two already unraveling right out of the package. One even had a tiny hole in it. I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> this cap is perfect for creating wigs or just to cover your hair.  It fits snuggly on your head without being too tight.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great wave cap....it&#x27;s awesome, fits very snug and wont shift too much while sleep, it&#x27;s easy to wash and maintains its shape throughout.  This is an overall great cap for building waves, and seeing as to how I hate do-rags this does the trick nicely!!</li>
            <li> I would buy it again. I would like to see if I could get it in brown. I also use it when I swim in the ocean.</li>
            <li> I used this cap to make a wig that I saw on YouTube.  The quality is fine and I would buy from this shipper once again.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and silky hair, this item slides off my head in no time. Maybe my head is too small...IDK. It had a tight fit the first time I wore it and then that was it.  If you&#x27;re going to use it for wig making, you should stitch it on for some security. I can&#x27;t see one rocking this with a head of hair and it not coming off.</li>
            <li> normal dome cap but I did find it cheaper in the store so I will be just buying locally next time its also a bit tight</li>
            <li> Very good wig cap for making your own wig not too much material so your hair underneath can breath and rest</li>
            <li> Super fit! right color will order more!</li>
            <li> I like how it streches to fit. I received my with the threads a bit loose and I was worried the cap band would fall part</li>
            <li> It works 5**************** you will not be disappointed. The price is dirt cheap for the quality that you will receive from this product.</li>
            <li> Great for U-part wig....fits my head perfectly and allows for a snug feeling unlike the wig net caps .  I would reccommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I buy this dome cap to make wigs with and really love the original one that is pictured. But I did not receive the pictured dome cap with the guy looks suave. I instead received one with a dragon and gold lettering on it. The cap looks small and constructed differently, I haven&#x27;t used it so it&#x27;s hanging out in my sock drawer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fits comfortably on your head. Doesn&#x27;t shift around, stays in place. Great for wearing lakefront wigs! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This should be sized because compared to other brands its much smaller and gets smaller if used for wig making, how ever the material appears durable but the band is very wide, bad for edges and circulation.</li>
            <li> My name is Iris, I used this dome came to create my u part wig. Its sturdy and it holds up great, even after cutting it and washing.</li>
            <li> The cap not what I thought. Much to tight on my head or it&#x27;s smaller seriously will not buy again.</li>
            <li> i made a 3/4 wig and i love it. it fits snug and does not stretch when u cut the the elastic to make a u part wig. very durable i would recomend to others.</li>
            <li> It was good at first but the elastic quickly wore out and didn&#x27;t last. i replaced it with a net cap two week later.</li>
