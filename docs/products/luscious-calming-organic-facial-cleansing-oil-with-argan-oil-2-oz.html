    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>a cleansing oil is out of the question, and this is the perfect product!</li>
            <li>The convenience is awesome.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a great product and does wonder for your skin!</li>
            <li>, your skin feels amazing!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t CAUSE the problem, rather, I felt so sure that my skin was perfect</li>
            <li>While it does a good job of cleaning, including removing makeup, I do not like that</li>
            <li>The price was the best and the service was quick and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Great job.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really warm to it until I remembered</li>
            <li>You are directed to massage the product onto your face and then to use a warm wash-cloth to hold to your face and then to wipe the oil away.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was a dissapointment because this oil has very strong and &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My pores looked great at first</li>
            <li>I love this product but it isnt something you can use every couple of days...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like once a week if that.</li>
            <li>I really love what my skin looks and feels like.</li>
            <li>I did not, however, notice a difference in pore size, more just the texture.</li>
            <li>If you think about it, washing your face with oil makes more sense than using water and soap.  </li>
            <li>, admittedly, did not have the patience to wait 25 minutes and do it more than once - so I just massaged my skin</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my skin since I started using.  </li>
            <li>like that there are more types of oils in here than in a homemade cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this oil as a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple of days ago and already love it.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m really happy to support a company like AFB who uses safe ingredients, they&#x27;re local to me (located in Portland, I&#x27;m in Seattle) and the products are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented (sort of a chamomile fragrance), which concerned me, but it is truly VERY lightly scented.</li>
            <li>This is the first oil-based cleanser I have purchased and I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a cleansing oil for a while, and there are a lot of different ones out there right now, but this one is great!</li>
            <li>Scent is great, hydrates beautifully, but not a great cleansing oil for me.</li>
            <li>Skin feels comfortable after using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I have loved this product so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin, but I do have large pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a &#x27;Splash of water, quick suds of gentle face wash, and rinse&#x27; kind of girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>oils clean my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few other products from Angle Face Botanicals and wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but this one had great reviews</li>
            <li>The oil is very nice and the little blue bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant to use and diminishes wrinkles and very little fragrance.</li>
            <li>my super sensitive skin would probably freak out if fragrance had been added, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>And I really do look forward to coming home from work to just put this on and a hot face cloth (more like for a minute) and</li>
            <li>It is amazing - this product seems to remove every last trace of dirt and make-up.</li>
            <li>Soap dries out my sensitive skin, and in the pursuit of finding better products for my face, I turned to one of my favorites for my hair - argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate it&#x27;s mostly made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that not all natural ingredients are good for skin or body just because they are natural.</li>
            <li>keep this little gem in the shower and enjoy the recommendation of putting a warm cloth over my face after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have converted completely to all organic skincare, and so using the Angel Face Luscious cleanser seemed like an easy choice.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin feeling super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Thats exactly what happens with this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>(I still had makeup on and it was the end of the day) for a couple of minutes and then held a hot washcloth over each part of my face for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This is my first foray into the oil cleansing method.  </li>
            <li>used it every other night for a while, but the time it takes to massage in and putting hot towels on my face and then having to wash/dry the towel to make sure it was clean</li>
            <li>I do know this - when I threw out the super high priced face wash and started using this</li>
            <li>but it goes far, so it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>Its really relaxing to use and the hot wash cloth is soothing, I prefer this over spashing water all over myself, the sink, and my sleeves all the time.</li>
            <li>It passed the test for me and I must say my skin reacts pretty much to anything.</li>
            <li>I tried other types of oil in the past and cannot admit that I was so impressed as with this oil.</li>
            <li>and you will start noticing amazing results within a few applications.</li>
            <li>and you can really tell by the smell.</li>
            <li>but then my face started becoming itchy &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t steam my face or hold it over my face for a long time - I just simply wipe the product off with a warm damp washcloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle face cleanser that is lightly scented, not too expensive, and effective (so I don&#x27;t have to use both cleanser and toner all the time).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to fragrance, but this has caused zero</li>
            <li>This oil is a unique blend of different types of oil which helped to soothe and calm my sensetized skin and remove entirely my makeup.</li>
            <li>I was new to cleansing oil and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I had High hopes for this product</li>
            <li>recommend wetting face first and removing as much makeup as possible with water first or you will run through the oil pretty quickly, especially if you wear a lot of eye makeup.</li>
            <li>It does feel wonderful to sit and massage it into my face and neck, and, while my skin did begin to get a little too dry when using it every night, switching to every other night</li>
            <li>When the weather was less severe, I even felt like this product was potent enough to warrant my skipping moisturizer on certain evenings.</li>
            <li>I live in northern michigan and the winters and wind</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again because I love that I&#x27;m not putting any harsh chemicals on my face or stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and with acne-prone and sensitive skin that is must!</li>
            <li>while I really do like Luscious cleansing oil and appreciate that I have it if I need a deep clean, my use of it is often limited by time and patience.</li>
            <li>I had started to use Aveda in an effort to use \\&quot;greener\\&quot; products, but was surprised to find Aveda uses quite a number of toxic chemicals as well.  </li>
            <li>I massage into my face, wait a minute, then remove with a damp soft washcloth.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this made my face burn and itch.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Luscious oil does not contain any extra substances and I like this fact as minimum of ingridients not to ovewhelm the skin and in particular sensitive one.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;d highly recommend Facial Cleansing Oil for those who have reactive and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>only thing I have found an inconvenience is the price for such a small bottle, and the oil slips through fingertips and takes more than two pumps to apply to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, no real issues, this has made it silky soft!</li>
            <li>A little goes a super long way, and I&#x27;ve actually saved money by not having to buy toners and exfoliators.</li>

            <li> Oil is repelled by water, so you have to use a harsh cleanser to clear your face of the build up of oil that accumulates all day/night.  </li>
            <li> I have been on a search for organic/greener skin care products and have spent alot of money trying and failing with different brands.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from dry, red patches, but this completely prevented them.</li>
            <li> and while they all worked well enough, none of them wowed me or made me want to toss all my other products.  </li>
            <li> I will use this for a long time!</li>
            <li> (removes ALL make-up), doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but also doesn&#x27;t leave an oily</li>
            <li> Followed the directions, I&#x27;m not sure how well it removes make-up, so far hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s a little pricey-</li>
            <li> are rough on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a facial oil without any additional ingridients irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In just a few uses I have noticed my skin is smoother, pores smaller, and even my acne scars seem less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several of AFB&#x27;s products over the past couple weeks</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t remove 100% of make-up like other cleansing oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Do NOT forget to exfoliate when using such a thick product.</li>
            <li> - it all became a little too time intensive for me.</li>
            <li> Initially it feels weird because it doesn&#x27;t feel like you can get all the oil off, however, about 5 minutes after you dry your face</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes in a small size and is a little expensive for every day use.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have the blotchy winter skin I usually get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing a lot about the \\&quot;oil cleansing method\\&quot;, so when I saw this on Angel Face Botanical&#x27;s website, I decided to get a small sample of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> usually apply just one pump to my face every night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems expensive, but I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks and only through about 1/4th of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had used one oil based cleanser before, DHC brand, and I (wrongly) assumed that this would rinse off the same way, it does not.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not just reapplying the crap I took off my face back onto my face the next night</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m naive and those are scientific words for oil,</li>
            <li> I am addicted.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that my skin has improved, nor can I say that it has gotten any worse.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product but it isnt something you can use every couple of days... it&#x27;s more like once a week if that. It does give really specific directions for oil cleansing which educated me. It brightens skin and softens lines and wrinkles. I wouldnt buy it again because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Soap dries out my sensitive skin, and in the pursuit of finding better products for my face, I turned to one of my favorites for my hair - argan oil.  Don&#x27;t be mislead by the concept of putting oil on your face, it should be called honey.  And I really do look forward to coming home from work to just put this on and a hot face cloth (more like for a minute) and the stress of the day melts away.  People started complimenting me on my skin&#x27;s tone and texture, you can just feel the goodness inside and out.</li>
            <li> I was new to cleansing oil and really wanted to try it. I have converted completely to all organic skincare, and so using the Angel Face Luscious cleanser seemed like an easy choice. I used it every day this winter, and it saved me a lot of heart ache. I usually suffer from dry, red patches, but this completely prevented them. When the weather was less severe, I even felt like this product was potent enough to warrant my skipping moisturizer on certain evenings. I really love what my skin looks and feels like. I did not, however, notice a difference in pore size, more just the texture. My one issue that I must share is that I actually had Millia from using this product. This is where tiny bumps that look like acne appear from lack of exfoliation. It didn&#x27;t CAUSE the problem, rather, I felt so sure that my skin was perfect that I totally skipped exfoliating for way too long. Do NOT forget to exfoliate when using such a thick product.</li>
            <li> This is the first oil-based cleanser I have purchased and I am very pleased with the product.  If you think about it, washing your face with oil makes more sense than using water and soap.  Oil is repelled by water, so you have to use a harsh cleanser to clear your face of the build up of oil that accumulates all day/night.  Oil is attracted to oil.  Thats exactly what happens with this cleanser.  Initially it feels weird because it doesn&#x27;t feel like you can get all the oil off, however, about 5 minutes after you dry your face, your skin feels amazing!  I live in northern michigan and the winters and wind are rough on your skin.  My face is hydrated and I don&#x27;t have the blotchy winter skin I usually get.  I love this product!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s a little pricey-but it goes far, so it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been hearing a lot about the \\&quot;oil cleansing method\\&quot;, so when I saw this on Angel Face Botanical&#x27;s website, I decided to get a small sample of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, admittedly, did not have the patience to wait 25 minutes and do it more than once - so I just massaged my skin (I still had makeup on and it was the end of the day) for a couple of minutes and then held a hot washcloth over each part of my face for about 20 seconds.  I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin, but I do have large pores.  I was truly amazed at how different my skin looked after just doing my shortened version of the cleansing with the oil.  My pores were less visible, every bit of makeup &amp; dirt was gone, and my skin just felt really, really soft.  I am addicted.  I&#x27;ve been using several of AFB&#x27;s products over the past couple weeks and I have yet to find one that doesn&#x27;t deliver.  I used to be a Sephora addict (I used Ole Henriksen, Skyn Iceland, Philosophy, Clinique, Bliss, you name it) and while they all worked well enough, none of them wowed me or made me want to toss all my other products.  I had started to use Aveda in an effort to use \\&quot;greener\\&quot; products, but was surprised to find Aveda uses quite a number of toxic chemicals as well.  So I&#x27;m really happy to support a company like AFB who uses safe ingredients, they&#x27;re local to me (located in Portland, I&#x27;m in Seattle) and the products are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.  I have been following the directions and augmenting them by mixing 1 teaspoon of sugar with the oil once a week for extra exfoliation.  I have received so many compliments on my skin since I started using.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts or issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend wetting face first and removing as much makeup as possible with water first or you will run through the oil pretty quickly, especially if you wear a lot of eye makeup.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t remove 100% of make-up like other cleansing oils I have used. I have to follow up with another cleanser. Scent is great, hydrates beautifully, but not a great cleansing oil for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been searching for a cleansing oil for a while, and there are a lot of different ones out there right now, but this one is great! Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and with acne-prone and sensitive skin that is must! And it removes all my makeup in one application- even waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> This is one of 3 similar products that I bought, all for comparison.  (For the record, all 3 are wonderful!)&lt;br /&gt;I keep this little gem in the shower and enjoy the recommendation of putting a warm cloth over my face after applying.&lt;br /&gt;The oils clean my face (removes ALL make-up), doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but also doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;m approaching 50 my facial skin has become drier and using anything but a cleansing oil is out of the question, and this is the perfect product!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant to use and diminishes wrinkles and very little fragrance. Skin feels comfortable after using. I appreciate it&#x27;s mostly made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients - oil. Yep, this oil and that oil, there are oils in here. Not iso-propo-bobo-whatevers all over the place. Maybe I&#x27;m naive and those are scientific words for oil, oh well. I do know this - when I threw out the super high priced face wash and started using this, I received numerous compliments on my skin and lots of questions about what I&#x27;m doing differently... so I guess it shows. A-plus plus!&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are more types of oils in here than in a homemade cleanser. I&#x27;ll invest the extra $$ to buy this than acquiring all the ingredients to make it myself. The convenience is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this oil as a cleanser.  My only complaint is that it comes in a small size and is a little expensive for every day use.  I use about twice week, but wish I could use every day... Still, it is a great product and does wonder for your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle face cleanser that is lightly scented, not too expensive, and effective (so I don&#x27;t have to use both cleanser and toner all the time). I&#x27;ve used a few other products from Angle Face Botanicals and wasn&#x27;t super impressed, but this one had great reviews so I thought I&#x27;d give them another chance. I&#x27;m really glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply just one pump to my face every night. I massage into my face, wait a minute, then remove with a damp soft washcloth. I don&#x27;t steam my face or hold it over my face for a long time - I just simply wipe the product off with a warm damp washcloth. It is amazing - this product seems to remove every last trace of dirt and make-up. And it leaves my skin feeling super soft and clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts since I started using this. It is lightly scented (sort of a chamomile fragrance), which concerned me, but it is truly VERY lightly scented. I&#x27;m usually pretty sensitive to fragrance, but this has caused zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems expensive, but I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks and only through about 1/4th of the bottle. A little goes a super long way, and I&#x27;ve actually saved money by not having to buy toners and exfoliators. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this made my face burn and itch.  It was anything but calming.</li>
            <li> I have been on a search for organic/greener skin care products and have spent alot of money trying and failing with different brands. I have normal skin, no real issues, this has made it silky soft! Its really relaxing to use and the hot wash cloth is soothing, I prefer this over spashing water all over myself, the sink, and my sleeves all the time. I am sold! I will use this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a facial oil without any additional ingridients irritating my sensitive skin. This oil is a unique blend of different types of oil which helped to soothe and calm my sensetized skin and remove entirely my makeup. I tried other types of oil in the past and cannot admit that I was so impressed as with this oil. Also, keep in mind that not all natural ingredients are good for skin or body just because they are natural. Origins oil, for example, contains vitamin C which irritated my skin. The same happened when I tried an apricot oil.Luscious oil does not contain any extra substances and I like this fact as minimum of ingridients not to ovewhelm the skin and in particular sensitive one. Therefore, I&#x27;d highly recommend Facial Cleansing Oil for those who have reactive and sensitive skin. It passed the test for me and I must say my skin reacts pretty much to anything. Just follow the instructions on the package and you will start noticing amazing results within a few applications.</li>
            <li> It was a dissapointment because this oil has very strong and &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; smell&amp;#34;. I did not like it at all</li>
            <li> I like the way this oil feels on my face.  Followed the directions, I&#x27;m not sure how well it removes make-up, so far hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple of days ago and already love it. In just a few uses I have noticed my skin is smoother, pores smaller, and even my acne scars seem less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have found an inconvenience is the price for such a small bottle, and the oil slips through fingertips and takes more than two pumps to apply to the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have loved this product so far. It has done things in a couple of days that took prescription acne medicine to do in weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into the oil cleansing method.  I cannot say that my skin has improved, nor can I say that it has gotten any worse.  I will probably buy it again because I love that I&#x27;m not putting any harsh chemicals on my face or stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li> The oil is very nice and the little blue bottle is beautiful. The product&#x27;s number one ingredient is olive oil and you can really tell by the smell. I didn&#x27;t really warm to it until I remembered my super sensitive skin would probably freak out if fragrance had been added, so that&#x27;s nice. It does feel wonderful to sit and massage it into my face and neck, and, while my skin did begin to get a little too dry when using it every night, switching to every other night resolved that problem quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every other night for a while, but the time it takes to massage in and putting hot towels on my face and then having to wash/dry the towel to make sure it was clean so I&#x27;m not just reapplying the crap I took off my face back onto my face the next night - it all became a little too time intensive for me. I&#x27;m a &#x27;Splash of water, quick suds of gentle face wash, and rinse&#x27; kind of girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I really do like Luscious cleansing oil and appreciate that I have it if I need a deep clean, my use of it is often limited by time and patience.</li>
            <li> I needed to buy this product and this brand. The price was the best and the service was quick and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Great job.</li>
            <li> I had High hopes for this product but I just didn&#x27;t love it.  My pores looked great at first but then my face started becoming itchy &amp; dry.  I have sensitive skin so it could just be me.</li>
            <li> I had used one oil based cleanser before, DHC brand, and I (wrongly) assumed that this would rinse off the same way, it does not. You are directed to massage the product onto your face and then to use a warm wash-cloth to hold to your face and then to wipe the oil away. While it does a good job of cleaning, including removing makeup, I do not like that I cannot just rinse off.</li>
