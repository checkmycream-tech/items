            <li>Hooray for healthy skin!</li>
            <li>The SPF is very important for your face, and this has good protection with zero oiliness or greasy shine like 99% of the SPF products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer was light and didn&#x27;t clog my skin or cause breakouts, but was still moisturizing and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is lightweight, non greasy and does a really great job at keeping my skin moisturized and blemish free.  </li>
            <li>nice travel size  non allergic works for me</li>
            <li>The SPF is effective, plus it is anti aging and blemish preventing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great purchase and being speedy with the order!</li>
            <li>I love that this product is lite on the skin and the smell is great, very clean.  </li>
            <li>This is my most favorite moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product on the market for what it does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size to fit in a travel or gym bag.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li>It is very light on your skin, great smelling and has a very fresh and clean feel.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This product feels weightless on the skin once it absorbs and it is appropriate for oily skin of all ages.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love all these products - they truly make a difference in my complextion.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I also love their skin perfecting lotion and use it at night and this one during the day.</li>
            <li>I Love Murad products.  </li>
            <li>I HOPE THAT I FALL IN LOVE WITH IT</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>, I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE MINTY FEEL, NOT OILY,</li>
            <li>so I figured one formulated for an acne line should be better.</li>
            <li>I love that there is sunscreen in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It feels like you&#x27;re using the sunscreen you&#x27;d use ok your body.</li>
            <li>I love the skin perfecting moisturizer for acne, but it has no SPF.</li>
            <li>I am middle age and have found this product to what it says, best lotion for acne and wrinkles I have found</li>
            <li>Would like more for the money.</li>
            <li>love the SPF 20 for daytime.  </li>
            <li>Has really been great for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I even check Murad&#x27;s website and still did not find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li>I love the variety of Murad products available with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It works great with my oily skin by not making it any worse,and so far its not causing any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing, because it provides just the right amount of moisture where I need it</li>
            <li>Wonderful product worth every penny (I use twice daily and purchase once every 2 months).</li>
            <li>I have even noticed myself not washing up at night because it doesn&#x27;t hold the dust on my face that easily.</li>
            <li>Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and really gives you a glow, love it.</li>
            <li>It goes great under makeup, and you can barely tell it is a sunscreen...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very easy to order &amp; much more reasonably price than at the spa</li>
            <li>I use a serum under this and it works fine, plus I get the SPF.</li>
            <li>Great product, using daily</li>
            <li>I was told it is this way because it&#x27;s oil free to combat acne, so</li>
            <li>I really enjoy Murad products, but they can be pricey.</li>
            <li>It feels light as well.  </li>
            <li>light, clean fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>This is what I wanted at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was recommended as a good daily moisturizer with a SPF.  </li>
            <li>I was beginning to notice some fine lines near my mouth and eyes before using this and within a couple of weeks of using this they notably lightened.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how lightweight it is, but I did end up buying another serum to go under it for just a tiny bit more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Mild scent - a</li>
            <li>really like the entire line of Murad Anti aging acne kind!</li>
            <li>It smells kind of medicinal, but that&#x27;s the only downside...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in my life and nearly all have made me break out</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh after applying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, not as moisturizing as expected.</li>
            <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making improvements, but I love Murad products.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting but not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger, and the SPF protection is a big bonus.  </li>
            <li>Also I have always had very large pores and after using this product twice a day for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Also, every time I have ordered, it came quickly and was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and wrinkle free</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this moisturizer years ago by my esthetician and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well!</li>
            <li>Been using this moisturizer for years and only recently discovered that Amazon sells it and for a better price!  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>(Dermalogica has a moisturizer that looks promising and is almost $10 cheaper)</li>
            <li>WHEN I WAS READY TO ORDER</li>
            <li>I REALLY WANTED IT...</li>
            <li>I try not to pile on too much of the one with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>Drys fast too.</li>
            <li>I really like how this lotion feels and works.</li>
            <li>and it really is making my skin glow.</li>
            <li>and we don&#x27;t break out nearly as much and noticed our skin isn&#x27;t as blotchy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell to much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but you really need to rub it in like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this feels on my face...not greasy &amp; absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I am honestly amazed with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone especially someone who&#x27;s been trying to find a “miracle” cream.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t yet review the anti-aging properties or even long-term acne care, but I can say that this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used as an adult that prevented oil from building up on my face over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite SPF that I&#x27;ve tried, as I have oily skin type and don&#x27;t like to feel heavy products on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li>Product is decent, just upset that I paid $30.00 for this three days ago and</li>
            <li>It goes on very light (as opposed to being rich) but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>MY HOPES ARE HIGH.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have acne, but as many women do I get small &amp;#34;eruptions&amp;#34; of it during certain times of the month, and I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less of that than I normally would at this particular time of the month; in addition, my face seems to have a nice glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since my last pregnancy!  </li>
            <li>I love Murad products and have been using them for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li>Light, not very greasy.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not very oily and leaves my sensitive skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years young!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past ten years, I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this yet in the market!</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin in the winter and this stuff still keeps my skin hydrated and clear</li>
            <li>It does clear my skin and make it smoother.  </li>
            <li>My old moisturizer was unavailable on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s no harsh nor pore clogging</li>
            <li>We have used two of these so far</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>I see a MAJOR difference in my skin!!</li>
            <li>Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it would be a knock off since the price was so much lower, but to my surprise it seems to be the exact same formula I bought in store.</li>
            <li>My face is soft to the touch and the moisture is back!</li>
            <li>Have only used this a couple of time but so far I really,really like it.</li>
            <li>I break out from almost anything if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a decent daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(I have combination skin that gets extremely oily in my t-zone but dry around my laugh lines) without creating oil elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It softens my skin like I could never believe, and my friends call me &amp;#34;vampire&amp;#34; because thanks to this, I look the same as I did as 16 (but with clear skin worlds apart from my previous pizza-ness).</li>

            <li> It smells kind of medicinal, but that&#x27;s the only downside...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in my life and nearly all have made me break out</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh after applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, not as moisturizing as expected.</li>
            <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making improvements, but I love Murad products.</li>
            <li> The smell is interesting but not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger, and the SPF protection is a big bonus.  </li>
            <li> Also I have always had very large pores and after using this product twice a day for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Also, every time I have ordered, it came quickly and was the real deal.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and wrinkle free</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this moisturizer years ago by my esthetician and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well!</li>
            <li> Been using this moisturizer for years and only recently discovered that Amazon sells it and for a better price!  </li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> (Dermalogica has a moisturizer that looks promising and is almost $10 cheaper)</li>
            <li> WHEN I WAS READY TO ORDER</li>
            <li> I REALLY WANTED IT...</li>
            <li> I try not to pile on too much of the one with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> Drys fast too.</li>
            <li> I really like how this lotion feels and works.</li>
            <li> and it really is making my skin glow.</li>
            <li> and we don&#x27;t break out nearly as much and noticed our skin isn&#x27;t as blotchy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell to much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but you really need to rub it in like sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my face...not greasy &amp; absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I am honestly amazed with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone especially someone who&#x27;s been trying to find a “miracle” cream.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t yet review the anti-aging properties or even long-term acne care, but I can say that this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used as an adult that prevented oil from building up on my face over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite SPF that I&#x27;ve tried, as I have oily skin type and don&#x27;t like to feel heavy products on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li> Product is decent, just upset that I paid $30.00 for this three days ago and</li>
            <li> It goes on very light (as opposed to being rich) but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> MY HOPES ARE HIGH.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have acne, but as many women do I get small &amp;#34;eruptions&amp;#34; of it during certain times of the month, and I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less of that than I normally would at this particular time of the month; in addition, my face seems to have a nice glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since my last pregnancy!  </li>
            <li> I love Murad products and have been using them for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Light, not very greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not very oily and leaves my sensitive skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years young!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past ten years, I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this yet in the market!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin in the winter and this stuff still keeps my skin hydrated and clear</li>
            <li> It does clear my skin and make it smoother.  </li>
            <li> My old moisturizer was unavailable on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s no harsh nor pore clogging</li>
            <li> We have used two of these so far</li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> I see a MAJOR difference in my skin!!</li>
            <li> Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would be a knock off since the price was so much lower, but to my surprise it seems to be the exact same formula I bought in store.</li>
            <li> My face is soft to the touch and the moisture is back!</li>
            <li> Have only used this a couple of time but so far I really,really like it.</li>
            <li> I break out from almost anything if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a decent daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin that gets extremely oily in my t-zone but dry around my laugh lines) without creating oil elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It softens my skin like I could never believe, and my friends call me &amp;#34;vampire&amp;#34; because thanks to this, I look the same as I did as 16 (but with clear skin worlds apart from my previous pizza-ness).</li>
            <li> My face has been dry for about the last 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I introduced my boyfriend to it despite the fact that he has different issues (really dry skin, no acne) and the consistency and evenness of his skin improved and he no longer has any dryness issues when using it.</li>
            <li> Because the other acne products I use dry my skin out I sometimes have to apply a different lotion 30min to hours later after I apply this.</li>
            <li> Not even a single mural product worked for me</li>
            <li> Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t even make it to late afternoon without my face glistening with oil, but since I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s moisturizer I make it to bedtime every day without having to deal with the shine of oil buildup.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, only complaint is the bottle is quite small.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matte the shine that well - a minus.</li>
            <li> Recived my order faster then I expected</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT OF THE CREAM GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way and my face never feels oily.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but I like it!</li>
            <li> I have very delicate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Beware to only use a very small amount because it does make the skin look a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I purchase this on Amazon vs my spa because it is half the price.  </li>
            <li> The little lines I had in my forehead and under eyes have started to visibly fade.  </li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO USE IT IN A FEW DAYS AND UPDATE THIS REVIEW.</li>
            <li> FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS, EVERYTHING THAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> A lot of moisture without feeling heavy on skin.</li>
            <li> At 26 I still suffer from acne which can get pretty bad at times.  </li>
            <li> Has worked very well, and the few times I was without it and tried something else, had bad skin issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the anti-aging ingredient works or if it&#x27;s just there for marketing.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because its a small tube.</li>
            <li> Not oily in the least</li>
            <li> Sucks</li>
            <li> bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to.</li>
            <li> It triggers acne break out on my forehead :(</li>
            <li> So dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my skin:(</li>
            <li> I had Horrible breakouts which took months to fade away..  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Zero rating&lt;br /&gt;Worse product that I ever used. I had Horrible breakouts which took months to fade away..  Not even a single mural product worked for me</li>
            <li> I love the variety of Murad products available with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is lite on the skin and the smell is great, very clean.  I like that it has spf and it does NOT flake.  Beware to only use a very small amount because it does make the skin look a bit oily.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, great product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very easy to order &amp; much more reasonably price than at the spa I go to.</li>
            <li> My old moisturizer was unavailable on Amazon so I searched around for something else and landed on this Murad product. It&#x27;s pricey but I really like it. It goes on very light (as opposed to being rich) but a little goes a long way. And my face feels great afterward. The SPF is also a big plus. My 50-ish, still-prone-to-breakout skin is looking good. It smells kind of medicinal, but that&#x27;s the only downside... along with the price (which is the reason for the four stars, as opposed to five). I can&#x27;t promise I won&#x27;t try something else (Dermalogica has a moisturizer that looks promising and is almost $10 cheaper) but, if I do stray, I suspect I may eventually come back to this Murad moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product, using daily and it was cheaper than buying it from the place where I get facials.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician/facial specialist and I&#x27;ve tried a number of different SPFs from a variety of skin care lines of all price points.  This is my absolute favorite SPF that I&#x27;ve tried, as I have oily skin type and don&#x27;t like to feel heavy products on my skin.  This product feels weightless on the skin once it absorbs and it is appropriate for oily skin of all ages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and I love it. Here&#x27;s what I like about it: 1. I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers in my life and nearly all have made me break out but this one doesn&#x27;t. 2. I was beginning to notice some fine lines near my mouth and eyes before using this and within a couple of weeks of using this they notably lightened. 3. My skin feels fresh after applying it. 4. My skin looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey but a little goes a long way. So all in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good value!</li>
            <li> My face has been dry for about the last 4 years.  Nothing I tried has made a difference including spa facials, etc.  Finally, I have found a product that actually works.  My face is soft to the touch and the moisture is back! Yipee!  I love all these products - they truly make a difference in my complextion. I am 63 years young!</li>
            <li> I got many pimples after using this product, and I had never got acne before!!!</li>
            <li> It triggers acne break out on my forehead :( I have opened and tried it. Is it possible to return it? So dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> I bought this after it was recommended to me by the lady who did my Murad facial at Massage Envy. I love how lightweight it is, but I did end up buying another serum to go under it for just a tiny bit more moisture.  I was told it is this way because it&#x27;s oil free to combat acne, so I guess it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
            <li> Wish it were more than SPF 20 because it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on the market for what it does. It is hydrating but not oily.  It does clear my skin and make it smoother.  It goes great under makeup, and you can barely tell it is a sunscreen...no white filmy stuff at all.  I love it.  I also love their skin perfecting lotion and use it at night and this one during the day.</li>
            <li> this product have me a rash that lasted for 7 days and made my eyes swell up!</li>
            <li> I Love Murad products.  I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s no harsh nor pore clogging</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR ONE PRODUCT  THAT HAS THESE BENEFITS -&gt; SUNSCREEN, ANTI-AGING, ANTI-ACNE AND OIL-CONTROLING. I READ REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ON MURAD.COM. I AM GOING TO USE IT IN A FEW DAYS AND UPDATE THIS REVIEW. I HOPE THAT I FALL IN LOVE WITH IT CAUSE IT IS A BIT PRICEY. ALSO THE PRICE FLUCTUATES. THE 1ST TIME THAT I SAW IT ON AMAZON IT WAS $38. WHEN I WAS READY TO ORDER THE PRICE JUMPED UP TO $45.35. I BOUGHT IT AT THE MOMENT CAUSE I REALLY WANTED IT... AND NOW TODAY IM SEEING IT FOR $40. AT MURAD.COM IT&#x27;S $46. SO.. MY HOPES ARE HIGH.    *COUPLE DAYS LATER*    OK !! I USED IT AND I LOVE IT, I LOVE THE SMELL AND THE MINTY FEEL, NOT OILY, A LITTLE BIT OF THE CREAM GOES A LONG WAY. IT&#x27;LL LAST FOR AT LEAST 2 MONTHS, EVERYTHING THAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> Great deal thank you!</li>
            <li> This did not work foe me, won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> loved it , not to oily for the skin</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a year now. Moisturizing yet not too greasy. Does not clog pores or cause breakouts. Great for all seasons.</li>
            <li> Mild scent - a plus, the consistency - a plus, moisturizer - a plus. Sun protection - a plus. It doesn&#x27;t matte the shine that well - a minus.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Murad products, but they can be pricey. This is what I wanted at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have acne and lotions with sunscreen are one of the things that can aggravate acne so I figured one formulated for an acne line should be better. I think it goes on well. I don&#x27;t think it is aggravating my acne any. Its thicker than I would like but I think that is the sunscreen component and unavoidable. Because the other acne products I use dry my skin out I sometimes have to apply a different lotion 30min to hours later after I apply this. I try not to pile on too much of the one with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;all in all I have no complaints about the product. I am happy with it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it - great product</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in store for about triple the price I paid here. I was a little worried that it would be a knock off since the price was so much lower, but to my surprise it seems to be the exact same formula I bought in store. The product itself is wonderful. Smooth, not very oily and leaves my sensitive skin moisturized. I love that there is sunscreen in the moisturizer. Drys fast too. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I really like how this lotion feels and works. Just a little bit goes a long way and my face never feels oily.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and it really is making my skin glow. I had a facial with my last massage and they used the Murad products.</li>
            <li> A lot of moisture without feeling heavy on skin. Keeps my skin clear and wrinkle free</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good! Completely delighted with all aspects of transaction: delivery, product, and results. Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout. Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li> Have only used this a couple of time but so far I really,really like it. It works great with my oily skin by not making it any worse,and so far its not causing any breakouts. I use it along with the Murad oil control.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Even if I never had to worry about acne again (history of pernicious, persistent acne. Oily in the T-zone), I&#x27;d never stop using this product. The SPF is very important for your face, and this has good protection with zero oiliness or greasy shine like 99% of the SPF products I&#x27;ve tried. It softens my skin like I could never believe, and my friends call me &amp;#34;vampire&amp;#34; because thanks to this, I look the same as I did as 16 (but with clear skin worlds apart from my previous pizza-ness). I introduced my boyfriend to it despite the fact that he has different issues (really dry skin, no acne) and the consistency and evenness of his skin improved and he no longer has any dryness issues when using it. Used to buy it as an acne cure, but now that it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m buying it as a moisturizer. Wonderful product worth every penny (I use twice daily and purchase once every 2 months). Also, every time I have ordered, it came quickly and was the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but not my favorite. It feels like you&#x27;re using the sunscreen you&#x27;d use ok your body. I love the skin perfecting moisturizer for acne, but it has no SPF.</li>
            <li> Been using this moisturizer for years and only recently discovered that Amazon sells it and for a better price!  It&#x27;s of the same quality that I would get from the Murad Spa itself.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was light and didn&#x27;t clog my skin or cause breakouts, but was still moisturizing and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> this feels and smells great. light, clean fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase so far. Not oily in the least and I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin afterwards, which is great.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS — a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find a soothing moisturizer with SPF that doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. Murad hits the ball out of the park with this one. I start every morning with it.</li>
            <li> We have used two of these so far and we don&#x27;t break out nearly as much and noticed our skin isn&#x27;t as blotchy.  It feels light as well.  I have even noticed myself not washing up at night because it doesn&#x27;t hold the dust on my face that easily.</li>
            <li> I am middle age and have found this product to what it says, best lotion for acne and wrinkles I have found</li>
            <li> I really like this product, only complaint is the bottle is quite small. Would like more for the money.</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin in the winter and this stuff still keeps my skin hydrated and clear all at the same time plus there is spf....bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the entire line of Murad Anti aging acne kind!</li>
            <li> Switched to this lotion 6 months ago and am still getting compliments.  Thanks Murad!&lt;br /&gt;I love the SPF 20 for daytime.  I use their Skin Perfecting Lotion at night.  Hooray for healthy skin!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Not too drying. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Light, not very greasy. Doesn&#x27;t smell to much like sunscreen. Has really been great for my combination skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> Too soon to report on product.</li>
            <li> nice travel size  non allergic works for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week so I can&#x27;t yet review the anti-aging properties or even long-term acne care, but I can say that this is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used as an adult that prevented oil from building up on my face over the course of the day.  Normally I don&#x27;t even make it to late afternoon without my face glistening with oil, but since I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s moisturizer I make it to bedtime every day without having to deal with the shine of oil buildup.  That hasn&#x27;t happened since I was a teenager.  It&#x27;s really amazing, because it provides just the right amount of moisture where I need it (I have combination skin that gets extremely oily in my t-zone but dry around my laugh lines) without creating oil elsewhere.  I&#x27;ve never known another moisturizer that did that for me.  I don&#x27;t really have acne, but as many women do I get small &amp;#34;eruptions&amp;#34; of it during certain times of the month, and I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less of that than I normally would at this particular time of the month; in addition, my face seems to have a nice glow that I haven&#x27;t seen since my last pregnancy!  The smell is interesting but not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger, and the SPF protection is a big bonus.  Overall I&#x27;d say this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Used this for years now, recommended by our dermatologist. Goes on very smooth, not oily. Has worked very well, and the few times I was without it and tried something else, had bad skin issues.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, not as moisturizing as expected. I didn&#x27;t know until I received the product that it&#x27;s also anti-acne, so I think that&#x27;s why it lacks the moisturizing feeling. I use a serum under this and it works fine, plus I get the SPF.</li>
            <li> Recived my order faster then I expected</li>
            <li> My family member has used this product for years.  After trying it at her house I loved it!  It is very light on your skin, great smelling and has a very fresh and clean feel.  I have VERY oily and dry skin.  At 26 I still suffer from acne which can get pretty bad at times.  After I decided to order this for myself and I have been using it for about 3 weeks I see a MAJOR difference in my skin!! The little lines I had in my forehead and under eyes have started to visibly fade.  Also I have always had very large pores and after using this product twice a day for 3 weeks my pores have also become visibly smaller! Now when I apply my makeup in the morning my skin looks and feels flawless!  I am honestly amazed with this product and definitely recommend it to anyone especially someone who&#x27;s been trying to find a “miracle” cream.  A little bit goes a long way.  This is the only product I will ever use on my face from now on.  I am beyond pleased!! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was recommended as a good daily moisturizer with a SPF.  It&#x27;s a good size to fit in a travel or gym bag.  It keeps the skin on your face moisturized but you really need to rub it in like sunscreen.  I like that it has a SPF.  I&#x27;m not sure if the anti-aging ingredient works or if it&#x27;s just there for marketing.  Overall it&#x27;s a decent daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past ten years, I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this yet in the market!</li>
            <li> The Murad Anti-Aging Moisturizer SPF 20 is my &#x27;go to moisturizer&#x27;.  I was first introduced to this moisturizer years ago by my esthetician and have been using it ever since.  I have adult acne and it really works well with my skin year round - not too oily and does not make my skin peel in any way.  I purchase this on Amazon vs my spa because it is half the price.  I even check Murad&#x27;s website and still did not find a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, but I like it!</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite moisturizer ever! The SPF is effective, plus it is anti aging and blemish preventing. Best product ever. I use it every day.  Keeps me from having any break out without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my face...not greasy &amp; absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging cream is great. Love the smell of it. It&#x27;s like being at a spa and having a facial. It goes on nice and really gives you a glow, love it. I give it 4 stars because its a small tube.</li>
            <li> Great Item, as described. Would purchase again. Arrived on time! Thanks for a great purchase and being speedy with the order!</li>
            <li> This product works very well! Makes my skin feel and look wonderful! I break out from almost anything if I&#x27;m not careful. I have very delicate sensitive skin. I love this product. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and no breakouts! Just beautiful moisturized skin!</li>
            <li> I love Murad products and have been using them for a little over a year.  This moisturizer is lightweight, non greasy and does a really great job at keeping my skin moisturized and blemish free.  I still get an occasional pimple but Im not expecting this to be a miracle product.  I definitely feel my breakouts are fewer since using this product.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Product is decent, just upset that I paid $30.00 for this three days ago and it&#x27;s now on sale for $18.25.&lt;br /&gt;Wool was over my eyes. Sucks</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s my favorite. I&#x27;m on my second tube and it&#x27;s been great. It&#x27;s light-weight, non-sticky and goes on even. I feel like I&#x27;m maintaining the look of my skin. So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be making improvements, but I love Murad products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my skin:(</li>
            <li> Love it, and it works!!!!!!</li>
