            <li>This is a EXCELLENT smelling colonge!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest for price but was sent in a good time frame!</li>
            <li>Dior fahrenheit smells amazing on him, 32 smells just as amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Guaranteed top 5 best cologne and it goes for all ages.</li>
            <li>Smells great, i love it.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It has a lighter more summery kind of scent.</li>
            <li>then why bother to order it, better go get it from the mall..  </li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with me for it</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my take: are you comfortable with yourself, in your own skin?</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I originally fell in love with the original Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>It has a very sexy and romanic smell, and it was a very good deal compared to the prices charged for this same size itmes in major stores!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly rugged guy who&#x27;s comfortable with himself, so I have to completely disagree with those who think Fahrenheit 32 is feminine.</li>
            <li>Great product, I only wish it came with the after shave balm, but overall a great product for men.</li>
            <li>this product is really genuine.</li>
            <li>The gentle touches of vanilla became more prominent during the drydown of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Feminine compared to the original Fahrenheit?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Fahrenheit for 10 years now and wanted this one in addition for special occasions.</li>
            <li>A fresh, floral, woody feel to the fragrance graced my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey for a reason but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too powerful and stuffy.</li>
            <li>Certainly, but the original Fahrenheit is arguably one of the manliest colognes I&#x27;ve smelled with its petroleum/tar based scent.</li>
            <li>The original Fahrenheit is one of my all-time favorite colognes, but I stumbled upon Fahrenheit 32 a few months ago, and I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>i like very much how it smell.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience when i order via amazon</li>
            <li>Upon spraying Fahrenheit 32 for the first time, notes of orange blossom took charge.</li>
            <li>he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>(I should have ordered a sample first).</li>
            <li>Learned to sample colognes before committing to a bottle, even if it&#x27;s from the same company that makes your favorite.</li>
            <li>and it is light enough that i don&#x27;t cause my co-workers to pass out from the fumes, yet strong enough to have caused enough comments from the female of the species to know that it&#x27;s liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle of Fahrenheit 32 very soon.</li>
            <li>I used to use Fahrenheit when the original was released back in the Eighties</li>
            <li>Never went back but found this new release in duty free last year and fell back in love.</li>
            <li>I also use classic Fahrenheit and Roma.  </li>
            <li>, might just go to Macy&#x27;s and pay a little more.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but very manly and being it a Dior, a single spray can last up to 2 days!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweeter than the original, so if you&#x27;re buying it, choose carefully when to use it.</li>
            <li>and the price is really cheap if you compare to other stores.</li>
            <li>Fahrenheit 32 is a lesser masculine cologne that can be appreciated if you like orange blossom or vanilla scents.</li>
            <li>Do you feel masculine?</li>
            <li>I ordered a 3.4-Ounce bottle of this cologne from Amazon in early 2013</li>
            <li>Let me break it down like this...as a man, I think it&#x27;s a little too perfumey - smells more like perfume than cologne.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T LAST TOO LONG AND WAS PRICED TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>Now, On the negative side:  no samples, like from other suppliers, and more important, so upsettingly late, it came after our aniversary..</li>
            <li>I might add this particular was cancelled due to seller not having the size that was advertised.</li>

            <li> Finally got the item, after the due date, when it was too late.. thank God at least they wrapped it nicely. Yes, that helped! Now, On the negative side:  no samples, like from other suppliers, and more important, so upsettingly late, it came after our aniversary.. then why bother to order it, better go get it from the mall..  This is my first experience when i order via amazon and it arrives late, though it was from a third party named Dole.. So.. i learned the lesson, never again from them. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This has always been my signature scent. My wife fell in love with me for it and I still wear it now. It&#x27;s the best scent for men. Not too strong but very manly and being it a Dior, a single spray can last up to 2 days!</li>
            <li> I used to use Fahrenheit when the original was released back in the Eighties [yeah - showing my age here!] but stopped after a few years as it just fell out of fashion. Never went back but found this new release in duty free last year and fell back in love. Use it as an everyday for work and it is light enough that i don&#x27;t cause my co-workers to pass out from the fumes, yet strong enough to have caused enough comments from the female of the species to know that it&#x27;s liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Fahrenheit for 10 years now and wanted this one in addition for special occasions. And it totally did the trick. It&#x27;s sweeter than the original, so if you&#x27;re buying it, choose carefully when to use it. I&#x27;d recommend to have both.</li>
            <li> The original Fahrenheit is one of my all-time favorite colognes, but I stumbled upon Fahrenheit 32 a few months ago, and I&#x27;m pleased.  Upon spraying Fahrenheit 32 for the first time, notes of orange blossom took charge. A fresh, floral, woody feel to the fragrance graced my nose. The gentle touches of vanilla became more prominent during the drydown of this fragrance.  There are reviewers out there who think Fahrenheit 32 is not very masculine. Here&#x27;s my take: are you comfortable with yourself, in your own skin? Do you feel masculine? If so, Fahrenheit 32 can be worn by you with no problem. I&#x27;m a fairly rugged guy who&#x27;s comfortable with himself, so I have to completely disagree with those who think Fahrenheit 32 is feminine. Feminine compared to the original Fahrenheit? Certainly, but the original Fahrenheit is arguably one of the manliest colognes I&#x27;ve smelled with its petroleum/tar based scent. Fahrenheit 32 is a lesser masculine cologne that can be appreciated if you like orange blossom or vanilla scents.</li>
            <li> Great product, I only wish it came with the after shave balm, but overall a great product for men. I might add this particular was cancelled due to seller not having the size that was advertised.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with the original Fahrenheit. This is terrific as well!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this cologne! Love this!</li>
            <li> Guaranteed top 5 best cologne and it goes for all ages. It&#x27;s pricey for a reason but worth it. I wish they made a bigger size</li>
            <li> Let me break it down like this...as a man, I think it&#x27;s a little too perfumey - smells more like perfume than cologne. But when I wear it, the women respond like no ther cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn. That&#x27;s reason enough for me to buy another bottle. I thought I found a deal on ebay, but it was an imposter. I&#x27;m skeptical about buying on Amazon as well, might just go to Macy&#x27;s and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3.4-Ounce bottle of this cologne from Amazon in early 2013 and I still have a little bit left.  I also use classic Fahrenheit and Roma.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is my favorite cologne.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle of Fahrenheit 32 very soon.</li>
            <li> Just received this cologne I ordered for my man. he absolutely loves it! Dior fahrenheit smells amazing on him, 32 smells just as amazing!!! It has a lighter more summery kind of scent. its great!</li>
            <li> Smells great, i love it.</li>
            <li> This is a EXCELLENT smelling colonge! It has a very sexy and romanic smell, and it was a very good deal compared to the prices charged for this same size itmes in major stores!</li>
            <li> This Item was suggested for me by a friend because he has tried it. But when I received mine,  It is not as I was expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T LAST TOO LONG AND WAS PRICED TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> Definitivamente que esta fragancia se las trae. Pese a lo que digan en los foros de perfumes. Esta es digna de colección. Me hubiese gustado tenerla para antes de la navidad...</li>
            <li> The original Fahrenheit in the red bottle is my all time favorite cologne, but this 32 one is terrible. I bought to try it out and never really liked it after that (I should have ordered a sample first). I&#x27;ve been using it for several years on and off, just trying to use up the bottle. The stuff makes me (and others) cough and choke. It&#x27;s just too powerful and stuffy. I&#x27;ve grown to hate it. Learned to sample colognes before committing to a bottle, even if it&#x27;s from the same company that makes your favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume every now and them since 2008 and this one i got was fake. The bottle was fake and smell was nothing like the real one.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest for price but was sent in a good time frame!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> this product is really genuine. i like very much how it smell. and the price is really cheap if you compare to other stores.</li>
            <li> My fiance requested this as a gift.  Although sceptical, I got it for him anyway.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.</li>
