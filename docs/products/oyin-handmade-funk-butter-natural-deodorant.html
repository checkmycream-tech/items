    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It smells delicious and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>This stuff is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>The Coco Mango smells like an oatmeal raisin cookie or something delicious to eat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a trigger is set off and the delicious scent is ejected instead of funky body odor.</li>
            <li>I have used Funk Butter for six years and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation</li>
            <li>it goes on great smells</li>
            <li>Which is great because I found Funk Butter as an alternative.  </li>
            <li>The coco-mango smells great</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and does reduce my perspiration rate.</li>
            <li>None of them worked great.</li>
            <li>The scent is not that good.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer wrote, this product works best when applied right after showering when the skin is still a bit damp.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Works better than poisonous deodorant!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I scoop out a pea size amount and warm it up between my fingers.</li>
            <li>They may smell nice for a while</li>
            <li>This is undoubtably the best natural deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>make sure u wash it off in morning it&#x27;ll smell lol other than that its awesome XD</li>
            <li>I had to use another deodorant to be able to spread the Funk Butter.</li>
            <li>great stays on thru out whole day and mornings but</li>
            <li>and I found it to work ok...</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>and I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because there&#x27;s so many others that I&#x27;d like to try</li>
            <li>I love their haircare products.</li>
            <li>I love Funk Butter and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Oyin has the best basic products around.  </li>
            <li>version as I&#x27;d love to get some for my husband.</li>
            <li>I love that aspect of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Crunchy Betty makes a wonderful product (Kokomo Cream Deodorant) that is a much larger quantity than FunkButter and packaged in a glass jar with plastic lid.</li>
            <li>with or without underarm hair, it is consistent, &amp; the bit of scent is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all Natural Deodorant that would smell good, this does the job!  </li>
            <li>The coco mango smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>They have way more product available there.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars since I still like the idea of natural ingredients and also the good smell.</li>
            <li>Effective, all natural ingredients and made with love.</li>
            <li>The best way to apply it is to wet your armpit first with water and then rub a pea-sized amount into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you test it first as suggested for any allergic reactions (not that I had any).</li>
            <li>This is a shame since I had heard so many good thing about this product and especially that the ingredients are natural and safe.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good inside the tub as it does outside.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the mango one, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>For now, I am attempting my own recipes since clearly my skin is way too sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This natural deodorant is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Baking soda is not ph balanced for the skin, so go easy at first.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY natural deodorants and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this natural home made product because the aluminum in most deodorants darkened and irritated my under arms over time.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant I was using before.</li>
            <li>This keeps me fresh, and never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>this still wins.</li>
            <li>but it works well, smells good and keeps me pretty dry.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this natural product did not work well with my body chemistry apparently because within a week of use my arm pits are 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve not been funk free for 12hours since high school</li>
            <li>They make some awesome products, and I&#x27;ve tried some other commercial and independent brands for natural deodorant, even made my own...</li>
            <li>This was the first one that worked â€“ and it keeps working, even though I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied (I bought 3 initially</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, though I have to cut it by like a third with coconut oil (and sometimes arrowroot powder too)</li>
            <li>It is the only one I have found that works more like an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Even with all those challenges, this stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I would love it if Oyin switched back to the tins or maybe glass tubs with metal lids.</li>
            <li>Oyin, Oyin, go back to the tin!  :-)    </li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fast shipping on this one too!</li>
            <li>The scents  are lovely and subtle, though I do wish they come out with more of an herbal one.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does smell lovely but it also keeps you fairly dry.</li>
            <li>It did not work and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell too much either.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job</li>
            <li>Too much baking soda in product.</li>
            <li>It actually smells kind of gross before you put it on.</li>
            <li>I bought it after watching a u tube review claiming how good it was and seeing as I had tried numerous other natural deodorants that did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any issue with it at all anymore and a little irritation seems way better than the possibility of alzheimer&#x27;s from stuff that has aluminum in it.  </li>
            <li>The skin may react with some redness and irritation, but that is normal.  </li>
            <li>I thought what have I got to lose as it was so much cheaper than the others.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply but the only negative comment I would have is that it leaves white marks on clothing (which washes out easily)</li>
            <li>, my husband has very sensitive skin and found this to be an irritant.</li>
            <li>But I was not going back to rolling on aluminum so braved on and settled on this after a particularly funny review on youtube.</li>
            <li>As far as natural deodorants go, this stuff gets an A+!</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to become a natural deodorant user, but nothing had ever worked.</li>
            <li>but I fixed that, I just put on a rubber glove and rinse the glove off when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I dab it on multiple spots under my arm, then gently rub it in.</li>
            <li>If someone can come up with a working natural deodorant that does not cause pain or blackened underarms, I will stock up.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin (redhead) and the baking soda in this</li>
            <li>Ok seriously.</li>
            <li>Due to that, when I run out of my current stash of FB, I will have to use another product with earth friendly packaging.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, it&#x27;s hot and humid, and I am the kind of person who sweats when it&#x27;s cold outside.</li>
            <li>I am devastated because it is the only natural deodorant so far to work for keeping odor away all day.</li>
            <li>Years ago I used a similar product made by Lush that was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I have tried 10+ natural deodorants in the last couple years.</li>
            <li>So far, all the natural deodorants that I have tried either keep me dry, but let me stink, or take care of the stink, but leave me sweaty.</li>
            <li>Look no further, this is the deodorant for you if you want some natural stuff that actually works!</li>
            <li>Generally you have the same effect as putting some perfume under your arms.</li>
            <li>Stands up to some pretty heavy activity as well.  </li>
            <li>I spent years going through many different traditional deodorant brands, and then trying a few natural ones with no success.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that keeps me dry.</li>

            <li> Be careful if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> but my other natural deodorant experiences have fallen short on multiple occasions.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to try as some of the other natural deodorants would make her break out in a rash..</li>
            <li> I have had my eyes opened in the last few years on using natural and organic products/eating foods.</li>
            <li> Of course no natural deodorant is going to work as well as the toxic ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cyclist and this product works for me even after a long ride.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a long day I never have any odor.</li>
            <li> or it works, but the ingredients dry out my skin and cause flaking/ darkening under my armpits (Jungle Man).</li>
            <li> It is actually a paste with baking soda as the active ingredient, with oils and shea butter added for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re committed to using natural body products, finding a deodorant can be pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I usually put a thin layer on after taking a shower, so the water helps smooth it across the skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s even being outside half the day in the Florida heat.</li>
            <li> but that was expected.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s not much else going on there.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> but I will however purchase lots of other products for my hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to rotate out any other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any of the irritation that other people speak of, but I can see what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> so be very careful on how you put your clothing on.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s hard to apply when it starts drying up.</li>
            <li> Its never let me down.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the extra effort to stay dry and not smell bad!</li>
            <li> (so does the black mission fig, but this one is my fav).  </li>
            <li> The irritation can turn underarms black, but they&#x27;ll return once you stop using the product.</li>
            <li> I do have to reapply mid-day if I am having a very active day though.</li>
            <li> Just use a little less.  </li>
            <li> I also suggest that when you dab your fingers in the product that you run a little water on it and emulsify it a bit so that it is easier to spread on.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy</li>
            <li> Now for the cons...it is messy but just wash your hands afterward.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t failed me.  </li>
            <li> I also find that natural deodorants are very irritating to my underarm skin, no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days and it burned my skin and made it raw.</li>
            <li> My experience with Oyin started out wrong, as my package made a trip to the opposite side of the country (from Maryland to California instead of North Carolina).  </li>
            <li> but I follow their advice - not applying after shaving, using a small amount, etc</li>

            <li> My experience with Oyin started out wrong, as my package made a trip to the opposite side of the country (from Maryland to California instead of North Carolina).  This was unfortunate since I paid more for delivery than for the product itself. Once it finally arrived, the oils of the deodorant had leaked from the container onto the paper and candies they had added to the package. Everything was oily inside the envelope! I tried to apply some of the deodorant and the paste was so dry (missing all the oily component) that it was almost impossible to spread evenly on my skin (it started to be abrasive and hurt!). I had to use another deodorant to be able to spread the Funk Butter. This is a shame since I had heard so many good thing about this product and especially that the ingredients are natural and safe. I gave it 3 stars since I still like the idea of natural ingredients and also the good smell. But I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s deodorant for years simply because of its strength and resilience to &#x27;funk.&#x27; I have always wanted to become a natural deodorant user, but nothing had ever worked. Then came funk butter. It smells delicious and works like a charm. I&#x27;m sold for life!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking I would be adding it to my collection of all natural aluminum free deodorants that didn&#x27;t work, well I was wrong.  Funk Butter works for ME and it stops my under arms from sweating and being musty.  I LOVE this product and the natural ingredients.  It can be a little messy but I fixed that, I just put on a rubber glove and rinse the glove off when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I LOVE OYIN products, unfortunately this funk butter is not for me.. I tried it for a few days and it burned my skin and made it raw. I couldn&#x27;t put anything under my arms, not even soap without it burning. I gave it 1 star because it was the only way to write a review..I will never purchase this again but I will however purchase lots of other products for my hair</li>
            <li> I spent years going through many different traditional deodorant brands, and then trying a few natural ones with no success. This was the first one that worked â€“ and it keeps working, even though I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a year. I haven&#x27;t had to rotate out any other products. I&#x27;ve never had any of the irritation that other people speak of, but I can see what they&#x27;re talking about. The scents  are lovely and subtle, though I do wish they come out with more of an herbal one. I keep buying this product even though I&#x27;d like to try some others â€“ every time I look at the cost per ounce, I just can&#x27;t justify trying any of the more expensive brands (soap walla, schmidts, primal pit paste) especially because this one works so well.</li>
            <li> It did not work and I didn&#x27;t care for the smell too much either.  It crumbles and falls off too which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few bad experiences with natural deodorants, either they don&#x27;t work (ex: Natures Gate, Aubrey Organics) or it works, but the ingredients dry out my skin and cause flaking/ darkening under my armpits (Jungle Man). But I was not going back to rolling on aluminum so braved on and settled on this after a particularly funny review on youtube. I am completely satisfied (I bought 3 initially so that was a big relief)!!! Just for background, I work in a warehouse that requires me to walk 12 miles plus--so don&#x27;t worry about getting nasty when exercising or whatever. I also suggest that when you dab your fingers in the product that you run a little water on it and emulsify it a bit so that it is easier to spread on.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtably the best natural deodorant I have ever used.  I bought it after watching a u tube review claiming how good it was and seeing as I had tried numerous other natural deodorants that did absolutely nothing for me I thought what have I got to lose as it was so much cheaper than the others.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to apply but the only negative comment I would have is that it leaves white marks on clothing (which washes out easily) so be very careful on how you put your clothing on.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be \\&quot;shocked,\\&quot; but my other natural deodorant experiences have fallen short on multiple occasions. I&#x27;ve been volunteering on a farm with this (in 90 deg, humid conditions) and end up smell-neutral. I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation but I follow their advice - not applying after shaving, using a small amount, etc.. I&#x27;ve only used the unscented version.</li>
            <li> Really does the job and I&#x27;ve been through everything on the shelf. Reserved 1star since I did have severe reaction to the baking soda under one arm. But I&#x27;ve not been funk free for 12hours since high school and that was was 15 years ago!!!!</li>
            <li> it goes on great smells great stays on thru out whole day and mornings but make sure u wash it off in morning it&#x27;ll smell lol other than that its awesome XD</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to try as some of the other natural deodorants would make her break out in a rash..But sadly this one did the same... She gave it to me to use and I found it to work ok...</li>
            <li> Love! It&#x27;s a little weird to get used to applying with your fingers but it works well, smells good and keeps me pretty dry. Works much better than the Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant I was using before.</li>
            <li> Definitely still made me sweat but that was expected. Started to burn me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now. Its never let me down. I sweat like a beast, plus I box 3x a week. This keeps me fresh, and never irritates my skin. with or without underarm hair, it is consistent, &amp; the bit of scent is pleasant and not overpowering. They make some awesome products, and I&#x27;ve tried some other commercial and independent brands for natural deodorant, even made my own...this still wins.</li>
            <li> I tried the crystal stick and crystal roll on and they did not work at all for me. I also try Primal Pit Paste and it didn&#x27;t work either. This one has been working well for me. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks and I don&#x27;t have any issues or complaints. I scoop out a pea size amount and warm it up between my fingers. I dab it on multiple spots under my arm, then gently rub it in. I don&#x27;t have any issues or white marks. I think I have found a winner.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo good! It doesn&#x27;t smell as good inside the tub as it does outside. It actually smells kind of gross before you put it on. This isn&#x27;t my favorite deodorant and I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because there&#x27;s so many others that I&#x27;d like to try but it does keep me from smelling bad which is the sole purpose of deodorant. I really appreciate the fast shipping on this one too!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, though I have to cut it by like a third with coconut oil (and sometimes arrowroot powder too) or it gives me a rash from the alkalinity.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this natural home made product because the aluminum in most deodorants darkened and irritated my under arms over time. Surprisingly this natural product did not work well with my body chemistry apparently because within a week of use my arm pits are 3 shades darker. I am devastated because it is the only natural deodorant so far to work for keeping odor away all day. It&#x27;s going to take months to fade this discoloration too :( Be careful if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that keeps me dry. The only downside is it&#x27;s hard to apply when it starts drying up. Just mix in some oil. I used vitamin e oil or olive oil. It is well worth the extra effort to stay dry and not smell bad!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY natural deodorants and this is by far my favorite! It is the only one I have found that works more like an antiperspirant. Of course no natural deodorant is going to work as well as the toxic ones but if you&#x27;re committed to using natural body products, finding a deodorant can be pretty disappointing. Generally you have the same effect as putting some perfume under your arms. They may smell nice for a while but there&#x27;s not much else going on there. Funk Butter is totally different! Yes, it does smell lovely but it also keeps you fairly dry. As far as natural deodorants go, this stuff gets an A+! One note, my husband has very sensitive skin and found this to be an irritant. But he can&#x27;t use regular antiperspirant either.</li>
            <li> Works better than poisonous deodorant!</li>
            <li> Contains some type of soda and it had my underarms irritated on the 2nd day.  The scent is not that good.  I love their haircare products.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is weird that you have to apply with your fingers, but it works. So far, all the natural deodorants that I have tried either keep me dry, but let me stink, or take care of the stink, but leave me sweaty. This one takes care of both. I do have to reapply mid-day if I am having a very active day though. The coco mango smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a similar product made by Lush that was discontinued.  Which is great because I found Funk Butter as an alternative.  The coco-mango smells great (so does the black mission fig, but this one is my fav).  I have used this since 2007 and never wanted to try anything else.  Stands up to some pretty heavy activity as well.  I&#x27;m a cyclist and this product works for me even after a long ride.  It is actually a paste with baking soda as the active ingredient, with oils and shea butter added for moisturizing.  Baking soda is not ph balanced for the skin, so go easy at first.  I usually put a thin layer on after taking a shower, so the water helps smooth it across the skin.  The skin may react with some redness and irritation, but that is normal.  Just use a little less.  I don&#x27;t have any issue with it at all anymore and a little irritation seems way better than the possibility of alzheimer&#x27;s from stuff that has aluminum in it.  I love Funk Butter and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Oyin has the best basic products around.  Genius.  But check out their website.  They have way more product available there.</li>
            <li> I carry this in my purse to refresh when I&#x27;m out and it doesn&#x27;t have to worry about melting during warmer weather.  It has a great smell and does reduce my perspiration rate.</li>
            <li> Ok seriously. I have had my eyes opened in the last few years on using natural and organic products/eating foods. Thankfully I learned now while I&#x27;m young to not put aluminum and other horrible chemicals on my body. Anyway, I have tried 10+ natural deodorants in the last couple years. None of them worked great. If I didn&#x27;t smell, I&#x27;d be sweating (which NEVER happened with the craptastic chemical deodorants) This stuff is THE BEST. I seriously am telling all my friends about it. I hope they make a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; version as I&#x27;d love to get some for my husband. I have only tried the mango one, and it smells so good. I love it! Look no further, this is the deodorant for you if you want some natural stuff that actually works!</li>
            <li> This natural deodorant is pretty good. The Coco Mango smells like an oatmeal raisin cookie or something delicious to eat. It works all day for non-sweaters like me. But for people who sweat, it definitely covers your odor! It&#x27;s like a trigger is set off and the delicious scent is ejected instead of funky body odor. I love that aspect of this deodorant. Now for the cons...it is messy but just wash your hands afterward. I also find that natural deodorants are very irritating to my underarm skin, no matter what I do. The irritation can turn underarms black, but they&#x27;ll return once you stop using the product. The ones that work, hurt, but the ones that keep you funky are soothing. If someone can come up with a working natural deodorant that does not cause pain or blackened underarms, I will stock up. For now, I am attempting my own recipes since clearly my skin is way too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do recommend this for non-sensitive skin because it truly works!</li>
            <li> Put on a bit in the morning and by night I am still smelling like the coco mango. That&#x27;s even being outside half the day in the Florida heat. I would recommend any day!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, it&#x27;s hot and humid, and I am the kind of person who sweats when it&#x27;s cold outside. Even with all those challenges, this stuff really works!  I&#x27;ve worn it outside for several hours while walking around the zoo and while playing at the park with the kids.  So far it hasn&#x27;t failed me.  The best way to apply it is to wet your armpit first with water and then rub a pea-sized amount into your skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin (redhead) and the baking soda in this did cause irritation... this is a common problem with baking soda based deodorants. So after some research, I found an amazingly simple solution: Vinegar! Just mix two tablespoons with 1 cup water and pat or spray on 1-2 times a day.  If applied regularly it will soothe that nasty rash (caused by Ph imbalance) and eventually prevent it.</li>
            <li> I have used Funk Butter for six years and it is wonderful! Effective, all natural ingredients and made with love. I bike commute regularly and need something that holds up well to the heat. This product does just that. At the end of a long day I never have any odor. As another reviewer wrote, this product works best when applied right after showering when the skin is still a bit damp. A little goes a long way.    The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that they switched from packaging FB in tins (which can be reused or recycled) to plastic tubs. Due to that, when I run out of my current stash of FB, I will have to use another product with earth friendly packaging. I would love it if Oyin switched back to the tins or maybe glass tubs with metal lids. Oyin, Oyin, go back to the tin!  :-)    UPDATE 02/14/14: Crunchy Betty makes a wonderful product (Kokomo Cream Deodorant) that is a much larger quantity than FunkButter and packaged in a glass jar with plastic lid. Betty also includes the recipe with your order so you can make it yourself if you&#x27;d like. You can find the product at this link:  [...]</li>
            <li> Too much baking soda in product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all Natural Deodorant that would smell good, this does the job!  I would recommend this product.  Just make sure you test it first as suggested for any allergic reactions (not that I had any).</li>
