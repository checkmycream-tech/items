            <li>I love this makup.  </li>
            <li>I have used this makeup for many years</li>
            <li>My wife and friends love these</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get the shade of olive</li>
            <li>HAVE BEEN USING FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Love max factor....</li>
            <li>Ya&#x27; gotta love it more than money...</li>
            <li>so I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to check on the website.  </li>
            <li>I have used Max Factor before but cannot find around my town any more</li>
            <li>Over all these years, I have had many, many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>glad to get it for her</li>
            <li>Purchased the item for my wife and she is pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is still my favorite go to refresher for my faceðŸ’‹</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is price well for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have paid more for this item.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT  </li>
            <li>Max Factor Pan-stik is the best make-up for any age and for any skin-type.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most important step in my daily make-up</li>
            <li>I love how it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope this shade continues to be available.</li>
            <li>She was DELIGHTED when I discovered it at amazon.com, so of course I ordered for her straight away.  </li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted and I love it!</li>
            <li>What I received was NOT ultra creamy, hence not so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>so glad it is available on line as I used it years ago when Max Factor pan stick was available in the U.S.</li>
            <li>smooth coverage, easy to apply especially to older skin, just the right shade for my skin, good coverage for age spots</li>
            <li>it is not as good as the one I normally buy.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage of this product, the creaminess, and convience of carrying it in my purse for easy, quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>I am happy to find it to purchase again, even though the Price and amounts, along with shipping costs really are much higher now.</li>
            <li>The product is fine</li>
            <li>color was good, but it was not creamy like it should be, it was kind of dry</li>
            <li>If it were available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but we were fortunate to have found a supply of it.</li>
            <li>Because this item is no longer available in stores, I purchased the make-up on Amazon.com and received it within days.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available in the United States and when I found it on Amazon I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>I tried a lot of foundations but never found one I liked as much as pan stick.  </li>
            <li>I also want to know what happened to the Rich Ginger that used to be available?</li>
            <li>This too is pictured as the original size</li>
            <li>I would like to find the original size product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product since I did a layout for Max Factor when I was 15, some years ago and now that I can no longer buy it in the store in the original size I have to take what I can get.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin and as I am becoming older, I need a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li>It really covers my flaws and gives me a smooth look .Way better than liquid makeup.</li>
            <li>I am 76 years old and have used Max Factor Pan stick for many many years.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product and wish suntone would also be available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The item was smaller than I remember but thr makeup was the same good coverage creamy and great consistency and the right shade for my skin tone</li>
            <li>I really like this makeup, have used it many times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it and have bought it at clearance stores for $3+, which pleased me very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you shipped me True Beige 12</li>
            <li>I am so glad to get what I need at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I tryied many other kinds of makeup when I finally found this on line and was thrilled!!!</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I paid way too much, you be the judge !!</li>
            <li>The price was right and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>The product is still very good, cut considerably smaller in size for the same price I paid&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make shopping affordable and fun.  </li>
            <li>This is the right shade for me.</li>
            <li>The color is right for my complexion which I use as a foundation and a concealer.</li>
            <li>Color right on.</li>
            <li>they sell the right one pictured and save yourself the headache of getting sample size from this seller.</li>
            <li>Yes, the right color.  </li>
            <li>And consequently, as you might expect, she opined that the price - $14.99 (an amount that I had no reference for) - was - all things considered (i.e., the smaller size and an additional $3.99 shipping - surprisingly and unexpectedly \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Not the big amount that we used to be able to get, but it is worth paying for</li>
            <li>I like the product very much, evidentially from my usage over the years.</li>
            <li>I found this product for a very reasonable price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I used to find it in local stores but was really pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>first review ever..</li>
            <li>I want others to be aware that this product sold at 5g...is not the product they are used to getting..</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I, personally would be more agressive in my ordering if I didn&#x27;t feel raped everytime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much smaller tube than I used to get when I was able to purchase it in the USA:-</li>
            <li>I love the DEEP OLIVE....</li>
            <li>Excellent the Max Factorpan-stik ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9 would order the same make up again from the same dealer,</li>
            <li>I have used this makeup since I first starting using makeup and that&#x27;s been many years.  </li>
            <li>It lookes natural and gives a smooth look to the face.</li>
            <li>I would much rather find them in the US, we still want our products made in the US!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and it still is the same quality.</li>
            <li>The size is smaller than it used to be and costs a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It was a large Market for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it is available on Amazon.com especially the color Deep Olive, which I cannot find on many other web sites.  </li>
            <li>only wish is that it would be available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34; or #137.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, JoAnn</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for almost 50 years and was really upset when Max Factor discontinued it in the states.  </li>
            <li>a 14 gr (.5 oz) # 113 returned at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price being in the $5 to $10 range.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I now</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Very deceiving on your part.</li>
            <li>this is a very deceptive ad.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the suntone #137, But</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Only wish they had not moved to Europe and their product was still available in the US.  </li>
            <li>It covers blemishes very well.</li>
            <li>But the price for the quantity is to high,the  product very good,have been using this product for 40 years.you have to reduce the price or raise the amount of onces in the container.</li>
            <li>I love this little purse size roll up make up, and it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pan stik for many, many years and have never seen such a small container.</li>
            <li>Size of the prodict.this is much smaller than the original that I used to buy before it was sold to cover girl.  </li>
            <li>I have  used olive Pan-stik makeup since I was a junior in high in high school which was in 1946!  </li>
            <li>To restore at least some of the \\&quot;luster\\&quot; of the \\&quot;find\\&quot; for her I was happy to make a gift of her first resupply in some time, but I&#x27;m not sure she will want to part with as much cash for so much smaller a package next time, even if it is still all she has always loved and lauded.  </li>
            <li>I love it even though it is more expensive now.</li>
            <li>Your picture displayed looks like the older panstiks I have bought.</li>
            <li>But the prices you offer are to high</li>
            <li>The price is too high.</li>
            <li>you raised the price on it so high that I cannot afford to buy it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in the smaller size as I had read a previous review that it would be much smaller - on the positive side - for me it fits much better into a make-up case and purse.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to find the Max Factor Pan-stick for a long time so am glad to finally have it again.</li>
            <li>The person I got it from actually had it at a reasonable price unlike many of the other people that had it.</li>
            <li>Container is smaller than the max factor previously manfactured in the US and the deep olive seems to be more orange than the original.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this all around where I live.  </li>
            <li>I assumed it was the true size..and found out later that I could have purchased it at Drugstore.com for less and getting the true size of 14g.  </li>
            <li>I made this purchase for my mother who has used this product for many, many years, but has been for the past couple of years unable to find it in - or special</li>
            <li>The only disadvantage is the size is not as large as when it was made in the US.</li>
            <li>The tube was smaller than the old ones but seems as though there is just as much make up in it.</li>
            <li>The sale of this product was clearly misrepresented.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for bring it back to me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover like the old one.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable out there.  </li>
            <li>i was so glad to find the makup i&#x27;ve been using for 44 years its been dicontinued for at least 5 yrs,the color (olive,Deep olive).</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>I use deep olive and although I&#x27;ve used many other brands over the years, I always come back to Pan Stik.  </li>
            <li>i is last have used this make up for over 30 years since i was in high school, but this last stick was not as creamy or as large.</li>
            <li>It was actually for my older mother, who is not computer savvy.</li>
            <li>I have used max factor  pan stik fo 35 + years .I was so sad when it went out of the stores and very glad when I found it</li>
            <li>It really does cover minor blemishes and gives the skin a creamy finish.</li>
            <li>having others think it is the normal larger size...</li>
            <li>Not until it was taken off the general market</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 89 year old mother who used to buy this back in the day!</li>
            <li>stores in america no long carry it.  </li>
            <li>Needed to be a tad  creamier for my old dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is my choice to re-order,,,,,it is also your choice to make new customers, keep the ones you have,,,,or continue to pay the pencil pushers to create new venues that in todays economy is harder and harder for the potential customers to afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not anymore it is a good product,i have been using it for years never any problems before to bad .......</li>

            <li> This is the best full coverage foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> As with the olive the deep olive works best works best for night wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone, somewhere, some entity, could take the &amp;#34;greed&amp;#34; out of the over inflated prices and make a lot of customers happy.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this product since I was a teenager, and now I&#x27;m 75!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Like so many things, the size has shrunk but not the price!</li>
            <li> I had used this product for many years,and loved it.</li>
            <li> I liked the price.  </li>
            <li> She is thrilled that she can still get the make-up she&#x27;s been using for 30+ years.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find my color and the price was not jacked up to unreasonable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to know that this product is still available as it has been discontinued  everywhere</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to still get it for her.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly &amp; lasts all day &amp; still looks good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup, goes on so smooth and covers very well.</li>

            <li> Received quickly and at a good price.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for more years than I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding it in stores, as Max Factor is no longer available in the United States, what a shame!</li>
            <li> Love this as a cover-up.</li>
            <li> I like this color, but I like sun tone better.  </li>
            <li> sun Tone is my favorite burt wld like the cost to belowered and availabilty a lot easier to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it meets my expectations for sure.  </li>
            <li> This is a makeup that used to be in most stores in the US.</li>
            <li> my wife was worried that she may have to go without her favorite makeup</li>
            <li> Love this makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy goes on great.</li>
            <li> love this make-up -</li>
            <li> Just glad I can once again purchase the pan-stik makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are &amp;#34;others&amp;#34; who share my sentiment.  </li>
            <li> I love this makup.  </li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for many years</li>
            <li> My wife and friends love these</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get the shade of olive</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li> Love max factor....</li>
            <li> Ya&#x27; gotta love it more than money...</li>
            <li> so I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to check on the website.  </li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor before but cannot find around my town any more</li>
            <li> Over all these years, I have had many, many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> glad to get it for her</li>
            <li> Purchased the item for my wife and she is pleased.  </li>
            <li> This is still my favorite go to refresher for my faceðŸ’‹</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is price well for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have paid more for this item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT  </li>
            <li> Max Factor Pan-stik is the best make-up for any age and for any skin-type.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most important step in my daily make-up</li>
            <li> I love how it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope this shade continues to be available.</li>
            <li> She was DELIGHTED when I discovered it at amazon.com, so of course I ordered for her straight away.  </li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted and I love it!</li>
            <li> What I received was NOT ultra creamy, hence not so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> so glad it is available on line as I used it years ago when Max Factor pan stick was available in the U.S.</li>
            <li> smooth coverage, easy to apply especially to older skin, just the right shade for my skin, good coverage for age spots</li>
            <li> it is not as good as the one I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage of this product, the creaminess, and convience of carrying it in my purse for easy, quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> I am happy to find it to purchase again, even though the Price and amounts, along with shipping costs really are much higher now.</li>
            <li> The product is fine</li>
            <li> color was good, but it was not creamy like it should be, it was kind of dry</li>
            <li> If it were available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but we were fortunate to have found a supply of it.</li>
            <li> Because this item is no longer available in stores, I purchased the make-up on Amazon.com and received it within days.</li>
            <li> It is no longer available in the United States and when I found it on Amazon I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> I tried a lot of foundations but never found one I liked as much as pan stick.  </li>
            <li> I also want to know what happened to the Rich Ginger that used to be available?</li>
            <li> This too is pictured as the original size</li>
            <li> I would like to find the original size product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I did a layout for Max Factor when I was 15, some years ago and now that I can no longer buy it in the store in the original size I have to take what I can get.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and as I am becoming older, I need a bit more coverage.</li>
            <li> It really covers my flaws and gives me a smooth look .Way better than liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> I am 76 years old and have used Max Factor Pan stick for many many years.  </li>
            <li> Really love this product and wish suntone would also be available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The item was smaller than I remember but thr makeup was the same good coverage creamy and great consistency and the right shade for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup, have used it many times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it and have bought it at clearance stores for $3+, which pleased me very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you shipped me True Beige 12</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get what I need at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I tryied many other kinds of makeup when I finally found this on line and was thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I paid way too much, you be the judge !!</li>
            <li> The price was right and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> The product is still very good, cut considerably smaller in size for the same price I paid&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make shopping affordable and fun.  </li>
            <li> This is the right shade for me.</li>
            <li> The color is right for my complexion which I use as a foundation and a concealer.</li>
            <li> Color right on.</li>
            <li> they sell the right one pictured and save yourself the headache of getting sample size from this seller.</li>
            <li> Yes, the right color.  </li>
            <li> And consequently, as you might expect, she opined that the price - $14.99 (an amount that I had no reference for) - was - all things considered (i.e., the smaller size and an additional $3.99 shipping - surprisingly and unexpectedly \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Not the big amount that we used to be able to get, but it is worth paying for</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, evidentially from my usage over the years.</li>
            <li> I found this product for a very reasonable price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I used to find it in local stores but was really pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> first review ever..</li>
            <li> I want others to be aware that this product sold at 5g...is not the product they are used to getting..</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I, personally would be more agressive in my ordering if I didn&#x27;t feel raped everytime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much smaller tube than I used to get when I was able to purchase it in the USA:-</li>
            <li> I love the DEEP OLIVE....</li>
            <li> Excellent the Max Factorpan-stik ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9 would order the same make up again from the same dealer,</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup since I first starting using makeup and that&#x27;s been many years.  </li>
            <li> It lookes natural and gives a smooth look to the face.</li>
            <li> I would much rather find them in the US, we still want our products made in the US!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it still is the same quality.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than it used to be and costs a lot more.  </li>
            <li> It was a large Market for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it is available on Amazon.com especially the color Deep Olive, which I cannot find on many other web sites.  </li>
            <li> only wish is that it would be available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34; or #137.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, JoAnn</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for almost 50 years and was really upset when Max Factor discontinued it in the states.  </li>
            <li> a 14 gr (.5 oz) # 113 returned at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price being in the $5 to $10 range.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I now</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving on your part.</li>
            <li> this is a very deceptive ad.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the suntone #137, But</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Only wish they had not moved to Europe and their product was still available in the US.  </li>
            <li> It covers blemishes very well.</li>
            <li> But the price for the quantity is to high,the  product very good,have been using this product for 40 years.you have to reduce the price or raise the amount of onces in the container.</li>
            <li> I love this little purse size roll up make up, and it is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pan stik for many, many years and have never seen such a small container.</li>
            <li> Size of the prodict.this is much smaller than the original that I used to buy before it was sold to cover girl.  </li>
            <li> I have  used olive Pan-stik makeup since I was a junior in high in high school which was in 1946!  </li>
            <li> To restore at least some of the \\&quot;luster\\&quot; of the \\&quot;find\\&quot; for her I was happy to make a gift of her first resupply in some time, but I&#x27;m not sure she will want to part with as much cash for so much smaller a package next time, even if it is still all she has always loved and lauded.  </li>
            <li> I love it even though it is more expensive now.</li>
            <li> Your picture displayed looks like the older panstiks I have bought.</li>
            <li> But the prices you offer are to high</li>
            <li> The price is too high.</li>
            <li> you raised the price on it so high that I cannot afford to buy it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed in the smaller size as I had read a previous review that it would be much smaller - on the positive side - for me it fits much better into a make-up case and purse.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to find the Max Factor Pan-stick for a long time so am glad to finally have it again.</li>
            <li> The person I got it from actually had it at a reasonable price unlike many of the other people that had it.</li>
            <li> Container is smaller than the max factor previously manfactured in the US and the deep olive seems to be more orange than the original.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this all around where I live.  </li>
            <li> I assumed it was the true size..and found out later that I could have purchased it at Drugstore.com for less and getting the true size of 14g.  </li>
            <li> I made this purchase for my mother who has used this product for many, many years, but has been for the past couple of years unable to find it in - or special</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is the size is not as large as when it was made in the US.</li>
            <li> The tube was smaller than the old ones but seems as though there is just as much make up in it.</li>
            <li> The sale of this product was clearly misrepresented.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for bring it back to me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover like the old one.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable out there.  </li>
            <li> i was so glad to find the makup i&#x27;ve been using for 44 years its been dicontinued for at least 5 yrs,the color (olive,Deep olive).</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I use deep olive and although I&#x27;ve used many other brands over the years, I always come back to Pan Stik.  </li>
            <li> i is last have used this make up for over 30 years since i was in high school, but this last stick was not as creamy or as large.</li>
            <li> It was actually for my older mother, who is not computer savvy.</li>
            <li> I have used max factor  pan stik fo 35 + years .I was so sad when it went out of the stores and very glad when I found it</li>
            <li> It really does cover minor blemishes and gives the skin a creamy finish.</li>
            <li> having others think it is the normal larger size...</li>
            <li> Not until it was taken off the general market</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 89 year old mother who used to buy this back in the day!</li>
            <li> stores in america no long carry it.  </li>
            <li> Needed to be a tad  creamier for my old dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is my choice to re-order,,,,,it is also your choice to make new customers, keep the ones you have,,,,or continue to pay the pencil pushers to create new venues that in todays economy is harder and harder for the potential customers to afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not anymore it is a good product,i have been using it for years never any problems before to bad .......</li>
            <li> this was my only option other than buying old stock on Ebay at an inflated price.</li>
            <li> It performs like it always has but the packaging is different, smaller, but it&#x27;s not clear if it is actually the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> Does apply as good as other makeup, also the color is wrong, and to dark, for my skin color, and face.</li>
            <li> Smaller container than I expected.</li>
            <li> It took too long to receive it, but I like the product.  </li>
            <li> Had not reordered in a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product was not only half the size of the regular pan stik but the dye lots of each tube</li>
            <li> /&gt;The previous statements are my personal opinions.  </li>
            <li> What I previously have purchased on line is 14 g and about the same price as what you charged.</li>
            <li> Smaller than previous purchases.  </li>
            <li> These were much smaller than the previous ones I had ordered, but I still like the product.</li>
            <li> I bought it when it came in a white tube then  in the the black tube.  </li>
            <li> Make up was the color I expected</li>
            <li> I spent $23.00 on 2 of them.</li>
            <li> I was most disappointed and stock piled it whenever I could find it.</li>
            <li> Just wish it came in a bigger tube as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the product is small.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other makeup but didn&#x27;t give me the satisfaction as Max Factor.</li>
            <li> I usually have to blend two different shades to get my desired shade but</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little less expensive, but some things are worth paying for.</li>
            <li> (  I love the product, it&#x27;s just less of it for twice the price:-(</li>
            <li> THAT WE ORDERED WASEN&#x27;T DARK LIKE THE ONE OF YEARS AGO</li>
            <li> The color was not as dark as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> very small from the original one, wanted suntone, but to expensive.</li>
            <li> That is why I hate the company for taking advantage of us, but love the product...</li>
            <li> I would definitely go back to the person I got it from again to shop for other things!!!!</li>
            <li> why did they not advertise that it was going down in size</li>
            <li> I used to buy 14g for less than $9.00 a tube even with price increases over the years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost half the size I&#x27;m used to buying.</li>
            <li> As usual and as expected.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it for  several years and found that the company/distributer had moved overseas.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and like it.  </li>
            <li> It is misleading the customer when in small print</li>
            <li> I do not agree with marketing Pan-stik in this small quantity, nor do I like the inflated prices.</li>
            <li> They are so small, not even what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I have used suntone #137 for the past forty years.  </li>
            <li> when usually its 14gr</li>
            <li> BELIEVE HOW SMALL THE TUBE WAS.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A SMALL ITEM</li>
            <li> Max factor makeup has been hard to find in the past.  </li>
            <li> Being so small their charge was ridiculous...</li>
            <li> These are getting hard to find and came from overseas.</li>
            <li> Us elderly people are not used to changes and it is hard to change.</li>
            <li> If needed again would reorder again as these are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor for probably at least 30 years; cannot believe they no longer make it.  </li>
            <li> The amount of the product was to small!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the small size for the same price.  </li>
            <li> Very small amount.</li>
            <li> wrong container, thought  it was in the round container.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed I can no longer purchase it locally.</li>
            <li> It is now very hard to get.  </li>
            <li> This is a classic product that is and has always been the bomb diggity of base makeup for any complexion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about this at all!!</li>
            <li> She was sad when they quit making this product.  </li>
            <li> i was very disappointed that the size was so little.  </li>
            <li> Max Factor product resourced again, she was, however, disappointed that it was delivered packaged in a 9 gram dispenser rather than the 14 gram she had always bought.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 16, what a disappointment when they did away with it here in the states!</li>
            <li> i also am disappointed that this product can not be purchased at retail anymore.</li>
            <li> Pan-Stik for 20 years and am disappointed that I can no longer find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> MY WIFE USED DEEP OLIVE FOR AGREAT NUMBER OF YEARS AND SHE SAID  THE PAN STIK THAT WE ORDERED WASEN&#x27;T DARK LIKE THE ONE OF YEARS AGO</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it for  several years and found that the company/distributer had moved overseas.  I was most disappointed and stock piled it whenever I could find it. This is the best full coverage foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.  Once again, I&#x27;ve ordered several.  I sincerely hope this shade continues to be available.</li>
            <li> It performs like it always has but the packaging is different, smaller, but it&#x27;s not clear if it is actually the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> I love this product since I was a teenager, and now I&#x27;m 75! Thank you so much for bring it back to me.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many, many, many years and absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it would be available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34; or #137.  Thank you. SAdams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  If it were available in &amp;#34;Sun Tone&amp;#34; (#137), I&#x27;d buy ten or twenty at a time.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase for my mother who has used this product for many, many years, but has been for the past couple of years unable to find it in - or special order it from - local B&amp;M retail stores.  She was DELIGHTED when I discovered it at amazon.com, so of course I ordered for her straight away.  As happy as she was to have this (her) Max Factor product resourced again, she was, however, disappointed that it was delivered packaged in a 9 gram dispenser rather than the 14 gram she had always bought.  And consequently, as you might expect, she opined that the price - $14.99 (an amount that I had no reference for) - was - all things considered (i.e., the smaller size and an additional $3.99 shipping - surprisingly and unexpectedly \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;.  To restore at least some of the \\&quot;luster\\&quot; of the \\&quot;find\\&quot; for her I was happy to make a gift of her first resupply in some time, but I&#x27;m not sure she will want to part with as much cash for so much smaller a package next time, even if it is still all she has always loved and lauded.  Vanity, while always dear, is not always priceless.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and a good product!</li>
            <li> I had used this product for many years,and loved it. Also lots of compliments over the years. I am happy to find it to purchase again, even though the Price and amounts, along with shipping costs really are much higher now. I used to buy 14g for less than $9.00 a tube even with price increases over the years. But I Am Delighted to find it again. Will it ever be selling in the United States Again. It was a large Market for it. Thanks, JoAnn</li>
            <li> smooth coverage, easy to apply especially to older skin, just the right shade for my skin, good coverage for age spots</li>
            <li> about one inch of make up</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and as I am becoming older, I need a bit more coverage. I have used this product for more years than I can remember.  I have had difficulty finding it in stores, as Max Factor is no longer available in the United States, what a shame! But, finding it online is so simple and convenient! I love the coverage of this product, the creaminess, and convience of carrying it in my purse for easy, quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling maxfactor,but i could still find it on the internet not deep olive though this is the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> Not the same panstick that I have used for over 50 years.  Doesn&#x27;t cover like the old one.  Very small amount.</li>
            <li> Love this as a cover-up.</li>
            <li> As usual and as expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> have used this product for 50 years.  It has served me well.  Protected my skin through  a life of sports and outside activities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to know that this product is still available as it has been discontinued  everywhere and it is the only makeup my mother uses</li>
            <li> I love it even though it is more expensive now. I used to find it in local stores but was really pleased to find it on Amazon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup, have used it many times and then they took it off the market in the US. My daughter found this for me on Amazon....she uses it also.....</li>
            <li> now in smaller bottles</li>
            <li> THE MAX FACTOR PAN-STICK CREAMY MAKEUP GIVES THE EXTRA COVER I NEED, ESPECIALLY ON MY CHEEKS BEFORE MY BLUSH...I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> good purchase experience.  A++++</li>
            <li> What I received was NOT ultra creamy, hence not so easy to apply.  I am dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and like it.  Like so many things, the size has shrunk but not the price!</li>
            <li> I like this color, but I like sun tone better.  Wld order Deep olive again.  Like the make up.  sun Tone is my favorite burt wld like the cost to belowered and availabilty a lot easier to order</li>
            <li> Hello:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first review ever..I want others to be aware that this product sold at 5g...is not the product they are used to getting..the product is always sold at 14g.  It is misleading the customer when in small print it is designed at 5g..having others think it is the normal larger size...Since the item sold for $14.99/each... I assumed it was the true size..and found out later that I could have purchased it at Drugstore.com for less and getting the true size of 14g.  Being so small their charge was ridiculous...That is why I hate the company for taking advantage of us, but love the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you for asking us to send a review of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not opened the cases, and wish to know if I can return it and get a refund...Please advise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in advance, again,&lt;br /&gt;Have a blessed day,&lt;br /&gt;Marlene Amrein</li>
            <li> wrong container, thought  it was in the round container.  it is not as good as the one I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it meets my expectations for sure.  This is the right shade for me.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. The only disadvantage is the size is not as large as when it was made in the US.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for50 yrs I hope they don&#x27;t run out of it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a makeup that used to be in most stores in the US. It is now very hard to get.  I bought this for my 89 year old mother who used to buy this back in the day! She only likes this brand.  She still looks 60!!!!!  It is nice to be able to still get it for her.</li>
            <li> color was good, but it was not creamy like it should be, it was kind of dry</li>
            <li> a requirement for every dragquen!</li>
            <li> I have always used max factor Have always loved it.But the prices you offer are to high Will be looking else where</li>
            <li> my wife was worried that she may have to go without her favorite makeup but we were fortunate to have found a supply of it.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup.  I&#x27;ve been looking forever for this. Very creamy goes on great.Amazon is the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pan Stik for 50 years.  It&#x27;s creamy and covers up imperfections.  I use deep olive and although I&#x27;ve used many other brands over the years, I always come back to Pan Stik.  If a person has deep wrinkles, it may accentuate them, so you want to keep that in mind.  I love how it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup, goes on so smooth and covers very well.</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; would recommend it to friends. It goes on smoothly &amp; lasts all day &amp; still looks good.</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor Pan Stick for 40 years and then it was discontinued and I tryied many other kinds of makeup when I finally found this on line and was thrilled!!! The person I got it from actually had it at a reasonable price unlike many of the other people that had it. I would definitely go back to the person I got it from again to shop for other things!!!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the makeup. The tube was smaller than the old ones but seems as though there is just as much make up in it. I have tried to find the Max Factor Pan-stick for a long time so am glad to finally have it again.The color is perfect. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> love this make-up - so glad it is available on line as I used it years ago when Max Factor pan stick was available in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I love this little purse size roll up make up, and it is exactly as described. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Make up was the color I expected but the pansticks were smaller than the American made versions. Since they don&#x27;t make it anymore here in the USA this was my only option other than buying old stock on Ebay at an inflated price. I would make the purchase again. I had rather had Suntone was it is not offered.</li>
            <li> The amount of the product was to small! The pleasant smell of Max Factor isn&#x27;t there. The price is too high. The coverage is good.</li>
            <li> Needed to be a tad  creamier for my old dry skin.  Just glad I can once again purchase the pan-stik makeup.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed in the smaller size as I had read a previous review that it would be much smaller - on the positive side - for me it fits much better into a make-up case and purse.  Next time I&#x27;ll purchase two.  Been using this product for almost 50 years and was really upset when Max Factor discontinued it in the states.  So far I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable out there.  Just happy I can still get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pan-stik for 47 years.  Not until it was taken off the general market did I see the 9 gr product. I do not agree with marketing Pan-stik in this small quantity, nor do I like the inflated prices. I like the product very much, evidentially from my usage over the years. Would like to see a 14 gr (.5 oz) # 113 returned at a reasonable price.  Reasonable price being in the $5 to $10 range.  I&#x27;ve seen it and have bought it at clearance stores for $3+, which pleased me very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone, somewhere, some entity, could take the &amp;#34;greed&amp;#34; out of the over inflated prices and make a lot of customers happy.  I, personally would be more agressive in my ordering if I didn&#x27;t feel raped everytime I bring the page up and see some of the prices.  It is my choice to re-order,,,,,it is also your choice to make new customers, keep the ones you have,,,,or continue to pay the pencil pushers to create new venues that in todays economy is harder and harder for the potential customers to afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous statements are my personal opinions.  I&#x27;m sure there are &amp;#34;others&amp;#34; who share my sentiment.  Make shopping affordable and fun.  Thank you for soliciting my opinion.</li>
            <li> Have used this prodcut for years So disappointed I can no longer purchase it locally. Thanks to Amazon I now&lt;br /&gt;continued using this great product. thanks.</li>
            <li> Max Factor Pan-stik is the best make-up for any age and for any skin-type.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most important step in my daily make-up regime.&lt;br /&gt;I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> Thought size would be larger</li>
            <li> I have used max factor  pan stik fo 35 + years .I was so sad when it went out of the stores and very glad when I found it online.please don&#x27;t ever get rid of this product.</li>
            <li> The item was smaller than I remember but thr makeup was the same good coverage creamy and great consistency and the right shade for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Your picture displayed looks like the older panstiks I have bought. What I received is much smaller than the picture. In checking I see that what I received from you is 9 g. What I previously have purchased on line is 14 g and about the same price as what you charged. Very deceiving on your part.</li>
            <li> The description made you think you were getting a regular size, when in fact it was much smaller.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size. I&#x27;ve been using Pan stik for many, many years and have never seen such a small container. It&#x27;s almost half the size I&#x27;m used to buying.</li>
            <li> I love this makup.  I have been using it for about 46 years.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my grandmother because she can no longer find this product in stores. The tubes are smaller than she is used to but she says the color is perfect. Her order always arrives way before it is supposed to as well.</li>
            <li> This too is pictured as the original size but it too is not.  I am very disappointed.  Size of the prodict.this is much smaller than the original that I used to buy before it was sold to cover girl.  Also I ordered 2 in deep olive and 1 in olive.  I was sent 2 in olive and 1 in deep olive.l this is a very deceptive ad. I also want to know what happened to the Rich Ginger that used to be available? That color was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I liked the price.  The color is right for my complexion which I use as a foundation and a concealer.</li>
            <li> This is a classic product that is and has always been the bomb diggity of base makeup for any complexion!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted and I love it! I have used this makeup for many years and I was so happy to find it on Amazon! Now I can order it whenever I need it!!</li>
            <li> Just what the wife was looking for. Color right on. These are getting hard to find and came from overseas. Ireland I believe. Max Factor needs to start producing these again. My wife and friends love these</li>
            <li> Works well for contouring</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much smaller tube than I used to get when I was able to purchase it in the USA:-(  I love the product, it&#x27;s just less of it for twice the price:-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Just wish it came in a bigger tube as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 16, what a disappointment when they did away with it here in the states!</li>
            <li> It breaks my face out and itches, it&#x27;s not the same Pan-Stick I use to buy from Max Factor I got in the USA.</li>
            <li> This makeup is great. It really covers my flaws and gives me a smooth look .Way better than liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed that the size was so little.  i didn&#x27;t realize when i ordered it and never would have bought it for the price you charged.  i also am disappointed that this product can not be purchased at retail anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using Max Factor Pan-Stik for 20 years and am disappointed that I can no longer find it in the stores.  I&#x27;m glad it is available on Amazon.com especially the color Deep Olive, which I cannot find on many other web sites.  I hope Max Factor will continue to make this product as there is no substitute.  It really does cover minor blemishes and gives the skin a creamy finish.</li>
            <li> They are so small, not even what is pictured. I spent $23.00 on 2 of them. I&#x27;m not happy about this at all!! when contacting the seller they don&#x27;t seem to care that their picture is misleading anyone. just go to drugstore.com and order this they sell the right one pictured and save yourself the headache of getting sample size from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Max factor products. It was the perfect color for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product was not only half the size of the regular pan stik but the dye lots of each tube (I purchased 5 tubes), were different.  The sale of this product was clearly misrepresented. When i contacted the seller, they responded by saying they have no control over the manufacturer. I will not do business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> Yes, the right color.  Not the big amount that we used to be able to get, but it is worth paying for</li>
            <li> The same Product that I always bought at Wal-Mart. Just a lot smaller and more expensive. I wish Max Factor would put it back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for this Item for quite sometime, She found it on Amazon we got it she is happy and so am I.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. 1- Max Factor Pan-stick Ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9. Great gift for my mother. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have  used olive Pan-stik makeup since I was a junior in high in high school which was in 1946!  The only regret I have I wasn&#x27;t able to get the shade of olive sometimes when I ran out of it--that is why I ordered five!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> As with the olive the deep olive works best works best for night wear. Covers flaws well with even color</li>
            <li> Received quickly and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Because this item is no longer available in stores, I purchased the make-up on Amazon.com and received it within days. It was actually for my older mother, who is not computer savvy. She is thrilled that she can still get the make-up she&#x27;s been using for 30+ years. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. It is different than what I was using pan-stik Ultra creamy makeup deep olive. I wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> I love the DEEP OLIVE....HAVE BEEN USING FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.  Maybe the next time I order....you could give me a break&lt;br /&gt;on shipping.  I PURCHASED THIS MAKEUP JIN THE USA FOR YEARS.....BUT I WILL STILL DEAL WITH AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Excellent full-coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered Max Factor Pan-stik Ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9 and you shipped me True Beige 12 so I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I used to find this makeup in lots of stores but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.. but here.  It is the perfect consistency for covering blemishes that pop up on occasion.</li>
            <li> The product is still very good, cut considerably smaller in size for the same price I paid&lt;br /&gt;years back for a much larger size.</li>
            <li> I am 76 years old and have used Max Factor Pan stick for many many years.  I am very happy with this product because I also feel it has kept my skin looking fairly wrinkle free.  I feel very comfortable wearing this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother.  She uses pan stick by Max Factor.  She was sad when they quit making this product.  I found it on Amazon for her and am going to surprise her with it.  I know she will be happy.  The only problem I have is the product is small.  I would like to find the original size product.</li>
            <li> Love max factor....but I paid way too much, you be the judge !! Ya&#x27; gotta love it more than money...</li>
            <li> happy to get my favorite makeup! have been using for40 years...</li>
            <li> I love maxx factor and I will order from these from now on excellent service and great product for anyone looking for it go buy it</li>
            <li> I found this product for a very reasonable price at Amazon.  It is the only make up one of my elderly friends likes to use and we cannot find it in the States anymore.</li>
            <li> The color was not as dark as I thought it would be.  I really like the suntone #137, But you raised the price on it so high that I cannot afford to buy it anymore.  I have used suntone #137 for the past forty years.  Also deep olive 9 Gr comes in a much smaller container than the suntone #137.  Also  you know longer carry Max Factor Linemaker.(Liquid waterproof eyeliner).  Us elderly people are not used to changes and it is hard to change.</li>
            <li> Max factor makeup has been hard to find in the past.  stores in america no long carry it.  I always order on line.  I was thrilled to find my color and the price was not jacked up to unreasonable so I was pleased. I have some skin conditions that require a make up like pan stick to cover some scarring.  I am so glad to get what I need at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this all around where I live.  This is the only makeup I used, until I could no longer find  it any longer.  I am so glad I decided to check on the website.  There is just one thing, this is not my shade.  Maybe I was not looking in the correct spot, but this is the only shade.  I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathi Farr</li>
            <li> Best makeup in the world, my Mom has been using it for 50 years ! It even heals blemishes .</li>
            <li> Smaller than previous purchases.  I have used this product since I did a layout for Max Factor when I was 15, some years ago and now that I can no longer buy it in the store in the original size I have to take what I can get.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and timeliness of delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent the Max Factorpan-stik ultra Creamy Makeup Deep Olive 9 would order the same make up again from the same dealer,</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup since I first starting using makeup and that&#x27;s been many years.  It is no longer available in the United States and when I found it on Amazon I was amazed.  Its a great makeup.  It lookes natural and gives a smooth look to the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THE PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND AM HAPPY THAT I CAN STILL ORDER IT.</li>
            <li> Smaller container than I expected. It took too long to receive it, but I like the product.  I have used Max Factor before but cannot find around my town any more</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for over 40 years. I have tried other makeup but didn&#x27;t give me the satisfaction as Max Factor. Thank you Amazon for finding this makeup. I&#x27;m very happy!!</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor for probably at least 30 years; cannot believe they no longer make it.  It gives great coverage.  I usually have to blend two different shades to get my desired shade but to me, that is no problem.  Over all these years, I have had many, many compliments on my skin.&amp; in reality, I do not think that my skin is all that great---it is the makeup.</li>
            <li> very small from the original one, wanted suntone, but to expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product and the color was close to the one I had used before. I would much rather find them in the US, we still want our products made in the US! Thanks</li>
            <li> i is last have used this make up for over 30 years since i was in high school, but this last stick was not as creamy or as large.</li>
            <li> If you are still looking for Max Factor, this is the place to get it! I have ordered three times and have been satified each time.</li>
            <li> My mom has used this for 50 yrs&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find her color&lt;br /&gt;The size is pretty small :(&lt;br /&gt;But glad to get it for her</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Well worth the money spent.  Only wish they had not moved to Europe and their product was still available in the US.  Have used this product for many years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> looked for years to find this product for my wife</li>
            <li> i was so glad to find the makup i&#x27;ve been using for 44 years its been dicontinued for at least 5 yrs,the color (olive,Deep olive).</li>
            <li> I did not like the size 9gr  when usually its 14gr why did they not advertise that it was going down in size i ordered 4 of them not anymore it is a good product,i have been using it for years never any problems before to bad .......</li>
            <li> Purchased the item for my wife and she is pleased.  If needed again would reorder again as these are hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite go to refresher for my faceðŸ’‹</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and it still is the same quality. It covers blemishes very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Max Factor Pan-stik makeup for years.  Had not reordered in a long time.  These were much smaller than the previous ones I had ordered, but I still like the product.</li>
            <li> To small&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Max Factor Pan-stik since I was 14  In the store. I am now 80.  Now I can not find it in the stores.  When I bought it in the store it was a larger tube.  I was shocked at the small size for the same price.  I bought it when it came in a white tube then  in the the black tube.  Are there any stores in the USA to but it.??????  The product is fine the size is a disgrace.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the delivery was quick. No complaints. Amazon is the best way to go!</li>
            <li> missed it.  Finally found it again.  Will buy again  and again.</li>
            <li> I used this product in deep olive for 45 years, then all of a sudden, it was gone with no warning. I tried a lot of foundations but never found one I liked as much as pan stick.  The size is smaller than it used to be and costs a lot more.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but some things are worth paying for.</li>
            <li> This item is a lot smaller then the original.&lt;br /&gt;The color is close to the original.&lt;br /&gt;It is price well for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have paid more for this item.</li>
            <li> This is my makeup.  Been using it for years and will continue to do so in the future.  Thank You Max Factor !!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT  i HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR YEARS.  BUT I COULDNT BELIEVE HOW SMALL THE TUBE WAS.  IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A SMALL ITEM</li>
            <li> Really love this product and wish suntone would also be available at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Container is smaller than the max factor previously manfactured in the US and the deep olive seems to be more orange than the original.</li>
            <li> But the price for the quantity is to high,the  product very good,have been using this product for 40 years.you have to reduce the price or raise the amount of onces in the container.Fran.</li>
            <li> Does apply as good as other makeup, also the color is wrong, and to dark, for my skin color, and face.</li>
