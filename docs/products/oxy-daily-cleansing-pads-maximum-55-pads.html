            <li>They clear up my acne fast with just a quick swipe!</li>

            <li>You have to be sure to use it often or else the cleansing pads will dry out and be of no use.</li>
            <li>and you would not believe how much dirt comes off.</li>
            <li>I have been using Oxy products for several years and this is the only way I have been able to keep my acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though I use them AFTER washing my face, it is amazing how much excess dirt/makeup they usually remove!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oxy since high school</li>

            <li>Started using these and my breakouts stopped and for the first time in months I had no new breakouts and clear skin.</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t realize that 1) salicylic acid is NOT effective as part of a facial wash/similar product, as it just gets rinsed away, and 2) 2% is the minimum strength needed for effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these pads to anyone having issues with  breakthru acne, whether young or old.</li>
            <li>It was actually pretty harsh, but can last maybe too much.</li>
            <li>I go through phases of moderate adult acne and nothing ever helped.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are key to the success of this product, it drys up the skin, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it itchie and tight.  </li>
            <li>Before I was washing my face three times daily with little success.</li>

            <li> For me at least, I end up breaking out the first week after starting to use them then the pimples all but go away as long as I consistently (at least 2-3 times a week when my skin is the worst) use them.</li>

            <li> I have tried stridex and clearasil and both of those products make my breakouts even worse.</li>

            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oxy since high school and I have always had wonderful results</li>
            <li> Never worked. I tried clearasil and that works great.</li>
            <li> Used the product for a few weeks and product is great!</li>
            <li> Cheap, affordable, prevents and helps during and after break outs. Great product.</li>
            <li> Always loved oxy the most.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s.  I had only minor problems with acne as a teen but increased issues when I hit my 30s.  I was actually on various prescription medications for awhile, but I&#x27;ve actually found an inexpensive regimen of over-the-counter products that works well for me.  Oxy Daily Cleansing Pads are one of those products.  The active ingredient in these pads is 2% salicylic acid.  Many people don&#x27;t realize that 1) salicylic acid is NOT effective as part of a facial wash/similar product, as it just gets rinsed away, and 2) 2% is the minimum strength needed for effectiveness.  Also, I prefer salicylic acid to benzyl peroxide, as not only is it gentler on the skin, but also it won&#x27;t stain towels or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these pads every night.  Even though I use them AFTER washing my face, it is amazing how much excess dirt/makeup they usually remove!  Oxy has helped control the occasional breakouts that I continued to have, even though the other products I was using (from the Alpha Hydrox line) were helping to keep my skin clear overall.  I would definitely recommend these pads to anyone having issues with  breakthru acne, whether young or old.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliating...alcohol smell makes me wanna puke.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased proactive for my own acne and in all seriousness I may have seen one MINOR improvement in my acne after three and a half weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product i would get a wet towel and get off any excess sweat from my face and then follow using one of these wipes (both sides) and you would not believe how much dirt comes off. I do this every morning and night and since I got it a week ago I have seen fantastic improvement in my acne. The price, shipping speed and effectiveness of this product gives it a five star in my book.</li>
            <li> I would rate this at 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the time which has passed since I last used them, or if they changed their formula, but these seem a bit harsher than I remember. They work great though. For me at least, I end up breaking out the first week after starting to use them then the pimples all but go away as long as I consistently (at least 2-3 times a week when my skin is the worst) use them.</li>
            <li> Easy way to help keep a teen&#x27;s face clean.  Made for daily use.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping breakouts to a minimum.Now if I could just remember to use it.</li>
            <li> These are my holy grail acne treatment. So glad I found them. I go through phases of moderate adult acne and nothing ever helped. Started using these and my breakouts stopped and for the first time in months I had no new breakouts and clear skin. I ran out a couple weeks ago and have broken out pretty badly since then, but more are arriving today! Hoorah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I would not use these if you have the tendency to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Everybody skin/body is different so this may work for some and not others. For me it works. I have oily skin and have suffered with acne since high school. I have tried stridex and clearasil and both of those products make my breakouts even worse. I have been using Oxy products for several years and this is the only way I have been able to keep my acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewer complained about this product burning. I have not experienced any burn from just using it on my skin only after shaving do I feel a burn. But again everyone is different so your experience may differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also suggest [[ASIN:B0028YWND8 Oxy Maximum Strength Deep Cleaning Face Wash-6 oz]] and a good facial pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used Oxy products before I would suggest giving them I try.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> Item that was sent was wrong item. I received the stronger pads which are no use for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best product you can buy for acne.</li>
            <li> At 66 and going through puberty for the second time Oxy is really doing a great job  Before I was washing my face three times daily with little success. I now wash at least two times and use Oxy with great results</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 14 yr old son. He has slight acne in the t-zone area. I have tried telling him to wash his face day and night, but who knows how often that happens. I like the container it comes in (kind of masculine and cool) . It is easy for him to swipe on his face when he gets ready for the day. I have seen a noticeable difference in the clarity of his skin. I will definetly get again</li>
            <li> Ok product, great smell, burns a little. Avoid applying near your eye area</li>
            <li> These are good! They&#x27;re not over drying and the price is great. I actually also use this on my body.</li>
            <li> Works great! Takes care of my acne in a couple of days, easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly as part of my night skincare regiment.  It&#x27;s a great product because it&#x27;s cheap and is ready to use meaning the cleansing pads are soaked in the solution so it is great for travel and incredibly portable.  The salysilic acid leaves your cleansed skin feeling tingly and clean.  Helps maintain a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> Did not like. Days your face. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Pros: You see what is coming off your face after you wipe with it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It burns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t work instantly. It was actually pretty harsh, but can last maybe too much. You have to be sure to use it often or else the cleansing pads will dry out and be of no use.</li>
            <li> Love Oxy Daily Cleansing Pads! They clear up my acne fast with just a quick swipe! Been using Oxy for years and will continue to use this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are key to the success of this product, it drys up the skin, yet doesn&#x27;t leave it itchie and tight.  Easy to use in the shower, morning, after sports activities or evenings.  Recommend for all my children and their friends.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and very convenient.</li>
            <li> feels good on my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena... I switched to Oxy because of the subscription option here on Amazon.  These are great, very convenient and effective.</li>
