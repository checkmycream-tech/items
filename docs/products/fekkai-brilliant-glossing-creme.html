    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>A great value!</li>
            <li>COMPLIMENTS GALORE ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!!</li>
            <li>Great shipping!  </li>
            <li>What a great deal!</li>
            <li>Best glossing creme EVER made</li>
            <li>This has added brilliant shine to my hair!</li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s about the best de-frizzer I have ever used, for me there was no brilliance and my hair can edge a bit toward oily</li>
            <li>To start with, the scent had a citrus smell that smelled awesome.</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m a long-time user and this is the best smoothing product on the market.</li>
            <li>Best product Fekkai makes!</li>
            <li>just the best hair cream.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for all climates!  </li>
            <li>so I do not have the best hair</li>
            <li>I must admit I had used some of this product line and was not favorably impressed, not so with this one.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the BEST hair cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Just smoothing a dollop of this on my hair  transforms the texture to silky, smoother, and wonderfully frizz-free!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Best Friend for colored / chemically treated hair !  </li>
            <li>the best stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>It lives up to its name as a brilliant glosser for hair - EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li>Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li>It adds incredible shine, softness, smoothness -</li>
            <li>Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is ultra-concentrated.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product in conjunction with the Fekkai Brilliant Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>The fekkai brilliant glossing creme has been a great addition to my morning hair routine.</li>
            <li>It works great on color treated and bleached hair.</li>
            <li>this is great for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>smells great too.</li>
            <li>Adds a great sheen.</li>
            <li>so now I have streaks of gray, and this product is great on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>but if you have thicker hair would probably work out great.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and keeps my curls/waves from frizzing which is great.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of giving you shine without feeling like you need to re-wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>Frederic Fekkai makes great hair products.....</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Fekkai is a great brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Strong fragrance (I think it smells great, but you may not agree!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for hair</li>
            <li>great product..works as described</li>
            <li>/&gt;There you have it, a very honest assessment.</li>
            <li>It does feel very nice once my hair is</li>
            <li>Excellent product for my fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>but if a product doesn&#x27;t smell good to me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product, though, and would purchase it for my own use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this cream for a while, I hope to be able to say that it does indeed add that brilliant gloss that we all want.</li>
            <li>good good good good goodgood good</li>
            <li>Probably a good product for some.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did smell really good though, and so I will give it to a friend with thinner hair.</li>
            <li>It has an excellent texture and mild scent.  </li>
            <li>its smells really nice, too, with a pleasant floral scent that isn&#x27;t too perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this glossing cream</li>
            <li>Love it not grease and work great</li>
            <li>Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, nice scent of olive oil and a bit of lemon (to my nose anyway).</li>
            <li>and it sure does that!  </li>
            <li>I don’t like using hair spray on my hair after using this, because I want to keep the lovely scent!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and smells amazing as do the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme.  </li>
            <li>This product has a really nice scent and and texture to it.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t want something with that much weight it might not be the best for you.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>Another free sample from Influenster that is a HUGE WIN!  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme via Amazon Vine and thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice and light and gives hair great shine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice smell to it, almost reminds me of an oceany, beach scent.</li>
            <li>Not quite as &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; as I imagined, but it is nice.</li>
            <li>This is really nice stuff, but it does nothing for my ends.</li>
            <li>I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am excited to report that this product has a great consistency that does not add weight to the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I found that this works for an excellent detangler and something that does seem to moisturize my hair, it did not provide any particular shine that I could tell.  </li>
            <li>takes the dry, fly away look and tames it into the perfect looking beach-tossed look.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also very pleasant and not too much</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>but with the glossing creme you could not tell it looks beautiful and super healthy.  </li>
            <li>I get smooth silky gorgeous curled under</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*May not be suitable for very fine or thinning hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I also like how after applying it, it made my hair feel weightless, very light.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  </li>
            <li>I love me some Fakkai.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the resuld.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly without one actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was more frizzy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner for my hair when I use this</li>
            <li>I generally love Fekkai shampoos and hair-care products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I really like the micro shimmer particles suspended in this great smelling, non-sticky styling cream.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cr&amp;egrave;me.  </li>
            <li>It is olive oil, so it is healthy for your hair as well.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I may try the shampoo and conditioner in this line too since they reformulated my favorite,</li>
            <li>is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far to keep my hair perfectly smooth, silky and non-frizzy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how shiny it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked as healthy as it does now.</li>
            <li>like many product smells do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>concern at a 5, mostly because of fragrance and methylchloroisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and adds a believable bit of shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I put a pea size amount in my palm and rub it through the top layer of my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I like this Fekkai product better for my hair.</li>
            <li>This was a reorder and I love using it.</li>
            <li>Fekkai Glossing Creme adds a healthy sheen and makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li>I was looking most for the &amp;#34;Brilliant Glossing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This line of hair care has really been great.  </li>
            <li>: I am in love and you cannot pry this stuff from my hands no matter</li>
            <li>, I smooth it over the ends of my hair and then finish off by running my hands over the crown of my head, then BAM!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>have three favorite smoothing creams .......</li>
            <li>and I love trying their products.</li>
            <li>I love their PRX Reparative oil and this product</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Looks more greasy than shiny.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I had given up my days of shiny healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>love the scent</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li>and I needed more than that.  </li>
            <li>This is made by the CHI folks, so if you love their Silk Infusion, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
            <li>Love the way it works.</li>
            <li>The scent could be better.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Amazon to the rescue at a good price &amp; shipped right to the door.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job smoothing frizzy hair and adding a bit of shine, but silicone is one of the main ingredients</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you are looking for a new and better product, but if you&#x27;re happy with a product you already have, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend switching.</li>
            <li>is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Fekkai products and this glossing creme is right up there with some of my favorite Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li>but it does seem to add more shine and strength to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>A huge difference that many creams, gels and glossing products do not do.</li>
            <li>With the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme, I can actually get everything to lay in the layers that I have.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and refreshing, not overpowering like some cremes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily after using.</li>
            <li>it is a great idea because it leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I found this glossing creme to have a really lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make hair feel sticky, just smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>After using my straightener, it looked a bit more smooth and shiny too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light, and lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available in stores, but you&#x27;ll pay a lot more for it.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, and it goes on weightless and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or that feeling you get when there is too much product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>All of that is well and good, but it doesn&#x27;t really do what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, blonde hair and this cream gives a glossy finish to my color and also helps to keep the fly away ends in place.  </li>
            <li>This is a very rich but smooth balm for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Makes hair easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;over-apply&amp;#34; and end up looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>It smells so lovely and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells AMAZING (I get compliments ALL the time on how good my hair smells)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day, sometimes even until the next day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The new glossing cream is not that good.</li>
            <li>package arrived as promised and all was fine</li>
            <li>I was fine in the Florida humidity, BUT using this</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands silky soft and also smelling pleasant</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the clean, fresh smell of this product!</li>
            <li>This is pretty much a high gloss formula to make hair shine, but for that, it works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great - a light scent, thank goodness - not big on scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt light and didn&#x27;t require too much product to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair fabulous</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell the products are great quality and the olive oil in</li>
            <li>I received this product free to try and I have to say I think I will buy some when my sample is gone.  </li>
            <li>Light floral smell.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>There is a light floral scent, but it is not one that sticks with you</li>
            <li>The texter has become so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received a free product sample from Influencer and Fekkai</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li>My bathroom is awash with conditioners of every brand and formula, from the cheap to the way-too-pricey.</li>
            <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t find any fault with it, unless you are using too much of it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product  --  Tames the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and smoothes the hair cuticle for glossy, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is gorgeous as well - an herbal/flower scent that is sophisticated and very present, although not cloying.</li>
            <li>Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a preservative that can cause allergic skin reactions, so if you  have sensitive skin, this would not be a good product choice for you.</li>
            <li>I have tried creams and gels, and pretty much everything, (salon products included), and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get the samples and used them right away.  </li>
            <li>Arrived super-fast and exactly as described :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when they run out, but I&#x27;m buying and storing lol!</li>
            <li>Love this product and absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>Willing to give this some more time because I truly want it to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance at all too!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This worked great on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>- i was so excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great in that it gives me a little more control without making it look like I slathered my head in product.  </li>
            <li>Clean scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many years and love the results I get on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is potent but works really well.</li>
            <li>and I liked the way it made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>However, we do find occasional good deals at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>True, it retails for around $15-20, which is a bit cost-prohibitive, but...</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>This 4-oz tube of brilliant glossing creme is the first styling product I’ve tried (the other products were shampoos/conditioners).</li>
            <li>and this cream did help manage my mild frizz issues.  </li>
            <li>I got to try this free as a Vine customer, but I liked it enough to reorder.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about the Fekkai line of hair products and recalled trying a sample of the shampoo and conditioner which left my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I find it tames my little frizzies and gives my hair a beautiful shine and feel.</li>
            <li>one little bead is all you need to control  your hair and also give it a beautiful shine ..</li>
            <li>If you like the luster that a good hair oil can bring to your locks, but still aren&#x27;t crazy about an oil&#x27;s slick texture, Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is an ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally like silicone-based hair products, but this smoothing cr&amp;egrave;me is going to be a handy weapon to have in my hair</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more shine than normal</li>
            <li>very  first time I used it one of my co workers asked what I had used in my hair that morning, so in that regard...</li>
            <li>After years of trying new products, I still think of this as my favorite to apply to my curly, bleach-damaged hair, before drying and heat styling.</li>
            <li>I love trying new products out for my frizzy hair--</li>
            <li>Best styling product for dry hair, especially from coloring.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s extremely fine and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>It really does make my hair shiny and silky and tangle free.</li>
            <li>The smell on this stuff is fantastic, very lemon drops and sunshine.  </li>
            <li>maybe this will work!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ha, you think you can handle this madness, ya tube of gunk?&amp;#34; It did help that the name Fekkai was on the bottle, which has always been a great brand in the few times</li>
            <li>It helped to calm frizzies and my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Love how it smoothes the cuticle and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>will keep buying because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I like the old one much better.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It gives my thick hair an incredible shine without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  </li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dry smooth and keeps fly a ways at bay and helps smooth hair before a blow dry.  </li>
            <li>The first 2 days I was able to use with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li>They smell clean and refreshing, don&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling and unless someone gets physically close to you, they won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, not very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I tend to be one of those people who tries new products even when what I have is working great..</li>
            <li>So many hair care products have oil or are some kind of oil based products because a little oil really helps out in the beauty world.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling and looking super smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>I tried this and first the review wasn&#x27;t going to be 4 stars because of the frizz my hair still had in the underlayers but the 2nd day (didn&#x27;t wash hair next morning), the results were better and I liked it.</li>
            <li>In the dry air my hair felt great, soft and maintained being straight.  </li>
            <li>When I actually take the time to put some wave into it, I want it sleek on top where the greys tend to ping and stand out because of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and soft to the touch, but it doesn&#x27;t look glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this has been the first one I have grabbed for days.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for years and really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with Aveda products, and I recently saw that a competitor will be carrying Carol&#x27;s Daughter products in it&#x27;s stores, so I may try that instead.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, soft and shiny and feels lighter.  </li>
            <li>a little bit of this nice, lightweight cream, melts into the air and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy thanks to its olive oil formula and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to flat iron any more</li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair, and this product does a wonderful job of keeping the frizz down without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>When I used it on my wet hair to see how my curls would look I actually had beautiful curls for the first time since I was probably 3 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>very good，it makes my hair looks very sharing and healthy。。I like it very much 。</li>
            <li>This one makes your hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>In fact, I kinda think this is making my ends feel even more dry than normal?!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant but light, and so long as you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>With the very dry winter, the ends of my hair needed a boost most days and since using the Fekkai glossing creme</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>A product my girlfriend really likes.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use that much either.  </li>
            <li>I used the tiniest amount of this after washing my face and my complexion was instantly brightened and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands too and they look MUCH younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my hair frizz free and shiny just like it promised.</li>
            <li>The oil in the cream really adds to the smoothing and shine for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really condition like an oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it as an intense conditioner.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>also makes your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>(very humid)</li>
            <li>When I straightened it in the humid Florida climate it stayed straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Brillian Glossing Creme.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do that much greasiness.  </li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>It can get really frizzy as well.</li>
            <li>I used the sample, and it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>I thought the creme was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much).  </li>
            <li>Fekkai Brillant Glossing Creme left my hair soft, my curls defined, and my hair shiny, and absolutely FRIZZ FREE!  </li>
            <li>(there’s a warning on the back about that) and it doesn’t weigh hair down - it smooths and shines beautifully for my dark hair (fine, wavy-curly and prone to frizziness).</li>
            <li>back I actually won a free full size tube of Fekkai Glossing Cream in a Facebook contest.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t get any shine and that&#x27;s really the products main stated purpose.</li>
            <li>After only a couple of uses, I was hooked, so I had to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m using it mostly on my ends (from my ears down), I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it looking greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, lasting style with this product!</li>
            <li>The old one used to make it look and feel great and just a little would go a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair has the curious distinction of being both fine and frizzy.</li>
            <li>If you want to enjoy a little pampering, this is a nice little splurge.  </li>
            <li>I maintained the straight, non-greasy, non-brittle, soft hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I used too much -- even though I only used a tad.</li>
            <li>I used to while straightening my hair which normally takes me just about an hour to do.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t add a lot to my dry ends and there are products for the same price that add more conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, very fine, and fairly long, about 4&amp;#34; below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have 3B type curly hair, and I&#x27;m always on the look-out for new leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li>It says a little goes along way, which is very true.  </li>
            <li>Fekkai products are high-end styling aids; I have tried several different ones as samples and they are really fantastic.</li>
            <li>It says very clearly on the label to use it sparingly</li>
            <li>leaves the hair so shinny and soft!</li>
            <li>WOW, it works so well!  </li>
            <li>: LESS IS MORE (WAY MORE): In other words, even on my really long hair I only really needed maybe a nickel sized amount in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>The old one worked wonders, but when the new one came out, I figured I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li>Right now it is long because I&#x27;ve got no idea what to do with it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff or oily, and did I mention it smells divine!  :)</li>
            <li>This product is a fast and pleasant way to instantly quench thirsty strands a bit and tame the stray wispys down.</li>
            <li>I never know what it&#x27;s going to respond to as far as products and the weather.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve let it go natural,</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to make a big difference.</li>
            <li>Just remember to only use a lil&#x27; dab, it&#x27;s really concentrated.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to an organic shampoo and it&#x27;s been taking me forever to comb out my hair after washing it because it tangles so much.</li>
            <li>It calms the frizzies and makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair appear sleeker and softer even after putting it through a straightener on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This far, I am not overwhelmed by the results with this product, but it did make my hair feel somewhat softer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and frizz-free, with a touch of shine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it works really well as a leave in conditioner product, but I don&#x27;t think my hair is any glossier.</li>
            <li>And at a list price of 19.99 it better do at least some of what it promises.  </li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my frizzy hair really soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it again on a rainy day when my hair tends to frizz, but so far unimpressed...</li>
            <li>which only dried my hair more.  </li>
            <li>The olive oil base is nice, and while it doesn&#x27;t have a lovely scent, it&#x27;s not an unpleasing scent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very light, not too oily or shiny, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The formula is light but not watery, and spreads beautifully-- a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Love this product as a little bit goes a long  way.</li>
            <li>I did have VERY deep lines on my forehead (too much tanning bed as a teen) and they are almost completely gone from this new regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the higher price is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Gray hair can lack shine and this stuff really puts the shine in, smooths the overall look of my hair and, unexpectedly, seems to reduce the overall look of grayness.</li>
            <li>The styling creme was FANTASTIC, and I subbed it in in lieu of my usual detangler/leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>First rub your hands together to emulsify the cr&amp;egrave;me then work into WET hair from mid-shaft through to the ends.  </li>
            <li>It is also very fine and thin.</li>
            <li>I use a little on the end part of my shoulder length straight fine hair and it shines but isn&#x27;t weighed down like some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li>They were long and soft and just nice and I am very hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, I&#x27;m sure this package will last me forever.</li>
            <li>My hair stays super soft as this does not dry to a stiff result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to toss out too many leave-on products due to heavy smell and oily feel, but for my hair and sensitivities, this product works well.</li>
            <li>a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to buy the old stuff.</li>
            <li>Because YES), and I am a complete magpie gathering piles and piles of products to try out and/or add to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Awhile</li>
            <li>All in all, it does feel nice in my hair and leaves a faint, but pleasnt scent.</li>
            <li>so I cannot complain too much but left my hair and skin incredibly dry no matter what product I used.  </li>
            <li>Too much trouble to get just the right amount ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use a bit right before and after ironing my hair, both to give it a little moisture boost and to tame flyaways still clinging onto dear life right after the heat damage is done.</li>
            <li>and we all have different hair types (fine, thick, wavy, etc.).</li>
            <li>Other products I have used have made my hair feel oily or greasy and that can happen with this product if you use too much</li>
            <li>The second day I used a much smaller amount and my hair dryed naturally.</li>
            <li>; which is a plus because my hair is already pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>The 4 ounce size should last a while as you don&#x27;t need very much product to give a little oomph to your hairdo.</li>
            <li>Too much will weigh it down and make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li>since too much of any styling product tends to weigh down hair or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps the texture and look without weighing it down or turning it into a grease ball.  </li>
            <li>My hair falls about 3\\&quot; past my shoulders and I find that slightly less than a pea-sized amount is more than enough product to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>not shiny and even a little bit more frizzy than usual</li>
            <li>Arizona and Nevada (desert direct sun)  Utah dry air, and California.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add a conditioning softness to my hair, but there is a slight glossy look.</li>
            <li>I normally have with other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight, black Asian hair.  </li>
            <li>that claim to tame flyaways, smooth out your hair, etc, but none so far have come close to what Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream does.&lt;br /&gt;After just a small dollop in my hand</li>
            <li>Makes hair managably ready to be styled; put a little on, comb or brush to desired style and voila -- it holds and holds and holds.  </li>
            <li>For years, I have searched for a product, (other than mousse), for my dry, very curly, and frizzy hair.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li> A great value!</li>
            <li> COMPLIMENTS GALORE ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!!</li>
            <li> Great shipping!  </li>
            <li> What a great deal!</li>
            <li> Best glossing creme EVER made</li>
            <li> This has added brilliant shine to my hair!</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s about the best de-frizzer I have ever used, for me there was no brilliance and my hair can edge a bit toward oily</li>
            <li> To start with, the scent had a citrus smell that smelled awesome.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m a long-time user and this is the best smoothing product on the market.</li>
            <li> Best product Fekkai makes!</li>
            <li> just the best hair cream.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product for all climates!  </li>
            <li> so I do not have the best hair</li>
            <li> I must admit I had used some of this product line and was not favorably impressed, not so with this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST hair cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Just smoothing a dollop of this on my hair  transforms the texture to silky, smoother, and wonderfully frizz-free!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Best Friend for colored / chemically treated hair !  </li>
            <li> the best stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> It lives up to its name as a brilliant glosser for hair - EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li> It adds incredible shine, softness, smoothness -</li>
            <li> Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is ultra-concentrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Fekkai Brilliant Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> The fekkai brilliant glossing creme has been a great addition to my morning hair routine.</li>
            <li> It works great on color treated and bleached hair.</li>
            <li> this is great for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> smells great too.</li>
            <li> Adds a great sheen.</li>
            <li> so now I have streaks of gray, and this product is great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> but if you have thicker hair would probably work out great.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and keeps my curls/waves from frizzing which is great.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of giving you shine without feeling like you need to re-wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> Frederic Fekkai makes great hair products.....</li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is a great brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Strong fragrance (I think it smells great, but you may not agree!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for hair</li>
            <li> great product..works as described</li>
            <li> /&gt;There you have it, a very honest assessment.</li>
            <li> It does feel very nice once my hair is</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> but if a product doesn&#x27;t smell good to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product, though, and would purchase it for my own use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this cream for a while, I hope to be able to say that it does indeed add that brilliant gloss that we all want.</li>
            <li> good good good good goodgood good</li>
            <li> Probably a good product for some.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did smell really good though, and so I will give it to a friend with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> It has an excellent texture and mild scent.  </li>
            <li> its smells really nice, too, with a pleasant floral scent that isn&#x27;t too perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this glossing cream</li>
            <li> Love it not grease and work great</li>
            <li> Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, nice scent of olive oil and a bit of lemon (to my nose anyway).</li>
            <li> and it sure does that!  </li>
            <li> I don’t like using hair spray on my hair after using this, because I want to keep the lovely scent!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and smells amazing as do the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme.  </li>
            <li> This product has a really nice scent and and texture to it.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t want something with that much weight it might not be the best for you.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> Another free sample from Influenster that is a HUGE WIN!  </li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme via Amazon Vine and thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice and light and gives hair great shine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it, almost reminds me of an oceany, beach scent.</li>
            <li> Not quite as &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; as I imagined, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff, but it does nothing for my ends.</li>
            <li> I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am excited to report that this product has a great consistency that does not add weight to the hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I found that this works for an excellent detangler and something that does seem to moisturize my hair, it did not provide any particular shine that I could tell.  </li>
            <li> takes the dry, fly away look and tames it into the perfect looking beach-tossed look.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also very pleasant and not too much</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> but with the glossing creme you could not tell it looks beautiful and super healthy.  </li>
            <li> I get smooth silky gorgeous curled under</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*May not be suitable for very fine or thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I also like how after applying it, it made my hair feel weightless, very light.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  </li>
            <li> I love me some Fakkai.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the resuld.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly without one actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was more frizzy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner for my hair when I use this</li>
            <li> I generally love Fekkai shampoos and hair-care products, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I really like the micro shimmer particles suspended in this great smelling, non-sticky styling cream.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cr&amp;egrave;me.  </li>
            <li> It is olive oil, so it is healthy for your hair as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I may try the shampoo and conditioner in this line too since they reformulated my favorite,</li>
            <li> is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far to keep my hair perfectly smooth, silky and non-frizzy!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how shiny it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked as healthy as it does now.</li>
            <li> like many product smells do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> concern at a 5, mostly because of fragrance and methylchloroisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and adds a believable bit of shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I put a pea size amount in my palm and rub it through the top layer of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I like this Fekkai product better for my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder and I love using it.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Glossing Creme adds a healthy sheen and makes it more manageable.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> love the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> I was looking most for the &amp;#34;Brilliant Glossing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This line of hair care has really been great.  </li>
            <li> : I am in love and you cannot pry this stuff from my hands no matter</li>
            <li> , I smooth it over the ends of my hair and then finish off by running my hands over the crown of my head, then BAM!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> have three favorite smoothing creams .......</li>
            <li> and I love trying their products.</li>
            <li> I love their PRX Reparative oil and this product</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Looks more greasy than shiny.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I had given up my days of shiny healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> love the scent</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> and I needed more than that.  </li>
            <li> This is made by the CHI folks, so if you love their Silk Infusion, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works.</li>
            <li> The scent could be better.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Amazon to the rescue at a good price &amp; shipped right to the door.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job smoothing frizzy hair and adding a bit of shine, but silicone is one of the main ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this if you are looking for a new and better product, but if you&#x27;re happy with a product you already have, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend switching.</li>
            <li> is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Fekkai products and this glossing creme is right up there with some of my favorite Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> but it does seem to add more shine and strength to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> A huge difference that many creams, gels and glossing products do not do.</li>
            <li> With the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme, I can actually get everything to lay in the layers that I have.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and refreshing, not overpowering like some cremes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily after using.</li>
            <li> it is a great idea because it leaves your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I found this glossing creme to have a really lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make hair feel sticky, just smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> After using my straightener, it looked a bit more smooth and shiny too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is light, and lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available in stores, but you&#x27;ll pay a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, and it goes on weightless and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or that feeling you get when there is too much product in your hair.  </li>
            <li> All of that is well and good, but it doesn&#x27;t really do what I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, blonde hair and this cream gives a glossy finish to my color and also helps to keep the fly away ends in place.  </li>
            <li> This is a very rich but smooth balm for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Makes hair easy to comb and style.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;over-apply&amp;#34; and end up looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> It smells so lovely and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells AMAZING (I get compliments ALL the time on how good my hair smells)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day, sometimes even until the next day&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The new glossing cream is not that good.</li>
            <li> package arrived as promised and all was fine</li>
            <li> I was fine in the Florida humidity, BUT using this</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands silky soft and also smelling pleasant</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the clean, fresh smell of this product!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a high gloss formula to make hair shine, but for that, it works great.</li>
            <li> It smells great - a light scent, thank goodness - not big on scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt light and didn&#x27;t require too much product to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair fabulous</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the products are great quality and the olive oil in</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try and I have to say I think I will buy some when my sample is gone.  </li>
            <li> Light floral smell.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> There is a light floral scent, but it is not one that sticks with you</li>
            <li> The texter has become so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product sample from Influencer and Fekkai</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this from Influenster to try and review.  </li>
            <li> My bathroom is awash with conditioners of every brand and formula, from the cheap to the way-too-pricey.</li>
            <li> and I honestly can&#x27;t find any fault with it, unless you are using too much of it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product  --  Tames the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and smoothes the hair cuticle for glossy, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is gorgeous as well - an herbal/flower scent that is sophisticated and very present, although not cloying.</li>
            <li> Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a preservative that can cause allergic skin reactions, so if you  have sensitive skin, this would not be a good product choice for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried creams and gels, and pretty much everything, (salon products included), and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get the samples and used them right away.  </li>
            <li> Arrived super-fast and exactly as described :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when they run out, but I&#x27;m buying and storing lol!</li>
            <li> Love this product and absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Willing to give this some more time because I truly want it to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance at all too!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked great on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> - i was so excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is great in that it gives me a little more control without making it look like I slathered my head in product.  </li>
            <li> Clean scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many years and love the results I get on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is potent but works really well.</li>
            <li> and I liked the way it made my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> However, we do find occasional good deals at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> True, it retails for around $15-20, which is a bit cost-prohibitive, but...</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> This 4-oz tube of brilliant glossing creme is the first styling product I’ve tried (the other products were shampoos/conditioners).</li>
            <li> and this cream did help manage my mild frizz issues.  </li>
            <li> I got to try this free as a Vine customer, but I liked it enough to reorder.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about the Fekkai line of hair products and recalled trying a sample of the shampoo and conditioner which left my hair very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I find it tames my little frizzies and gives my hair a beautiful shine and feel.</li>
            <li> one little bead is all you need to control  your hair and also give it a beautiful shine ..</li>
            <li> If you like the luster that a good hair oil can bring to your locks, but still aren&#x27;t crazy about an oil&#x27;s slick texture, Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is an ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally like silicone-based hair products, but this smoothing cr&amp;egrave;me is going to be a handy weapon to have in my hair</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more shine than normal</li>
            <li> very  first time I used it one of my co workers asked what I had used in my hair that morning, so in that regard...</li>
            <li> After years of trying new products, I still think of this as my favorite to apply to my curly, bleach-damaged hair, before drying and heat styling.</li>
            <li> I love trying new products out for my frizzy hair--</li>
            <li> Best styling product for dry hair, especially from coloring.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely fine and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> It really does make my hair shiny and silky and tangle free.</li>
            <li> The smell on this stuff is fantastic, very lemon drops and sunshine.  </li>
            <li> maybe this will work!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ha, you think you can handle this madness, ya tube of gunk?&amp;#34; It did help that the name Fekkai was on the bottle, which has always been a great brand in the few times</li>
            <li> It helped to calm frizzies and my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Love how it smoothes the cuticle and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> will keep buying because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the old one much better.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It gives my thick hair an incredible shine without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry smooth and keeps fly a ways at bay and helps smooth hair before a blow dry.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 days I was able to use with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was very soft.  </li>
            <li> They smell clean and refreshing, don&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling and unless someone gets physically close to you, they won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, not very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I tend to be one of those people who tries new products even when what I have is working great..</li>
            <li> So many hair care products have oil or are some kind of oil based products because a little oil really helps out in the beauty world.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling and looking super smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I tried this and first the review wasn&#x27;t going to be 4 stars because of the frizz my hair still had in the underlayers but the 2nd day (didn&#x27;t wash hair next morning), the results were better and I liked it.</li>
            <li> In the dry air my hair felt great, soft and maintained being straight.  </li>
            <li> When I actually take the time to put some wave into it, I want it sleek on top where the greys tend to ping and stand out because of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and soft to the touch, but it doesn&#x27;t look glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this has been the first one I have grabbed for days.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for years and really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with Aveda products, and I recently saw that a competitor will be carrying Carol&#x27;s Daughter products in it&#x27;s stores, so I may try that instead.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, soft and shiny and feels lighter.  </li>
            <li> a little bit of this nice, lightweight cream, melts into the air and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy thanks to its olive oil formula and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to flat iron any more</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair, and this product does a wonderful job of keeping the frizz down without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> When I used it on my wet hair to see how my curls would look I actually had beautiful curls for the first time since I was probably 3 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> very good，it makes my hair looks very sharing and healthy。。I like it very much 。</li>
            <li> This one makes your hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> In fact, I kinda think this is making my ends feel even more dry than normal?!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant but light, and so long as you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> With the very dry winter, the ends of my hair needed a boost most days and since using the Fekkai glossing creme</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> A product my girlfriend really likes.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use that much either.  </li>
            <li> I used the tiniest amount of this after washing my face and my complexion was instantly brightened and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands too and they look MUCH younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair frizz free and shiny just like it promised.</li>
            <li> The oil in the cream really adds to the smoothing and shine for your hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really condition like an oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it as an intense conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li> also makes your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> (very humid)</li>
            <li> When I straightened it in the humid Florida climate it stayed straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Brillian Glossing Creme.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do that much greasiness.  </li>
            <li> too much</li>
            <li> It can get really frizzy as well.</li>
            <li> I used the sample, and it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> I thought the creme was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much).  </li>
            <li> Fekkai Brillant Glossing Creme left my hair soft, my curls defined, and my hair shiny, and absolutely FRIZZ FREE!  </li>
            <li> (there’s a warning on the back about that) and it doesn’t weigh hair down - it smooths and shines beautifully for my dark hair (fine, wavy-curly and prone to frizziness).</li>
            <li> back I actually won a free full size tube of Fekkai Glossing Cream in a Facebook contest.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t get any shine and that&#x27;s really the products main stated purpose.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of uses, I was hooked, so I had to buy a full size.  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m using it mostly on my ends (from my ears down), I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, lasting style with this product!</li>
            <li> The old one used to make it look and feel great and just a little would go a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair has the curious distinction of being both fine and frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you want to enjoy a little pampering, this is a nice little splurge.  </li>
            <li> I maintained the straight, non-greasy, non-brittle, soft hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I used too much -- even though I only used a tad.</li>
            <li> I used to while straightening my hair which normally takes me just about an hour to do.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t add a lot to my dry ends and there are products for the same price that add more conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, very fine, and fairly long, about 4&amp;#34; below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have 3B type curly hair, and I&#x27;m always on the look-out for new leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> It says a little goes along way, which is very true.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai products are high-end styling aids; I have tried several different ones as samples and they are really fantastic.</li>
            <li> It says very clearly on the label to use it sparingly</li>
            <li> leaves the hair so shinny and soft!</li>
            <li> WOW, it works so well!  </li>
            <li> : LESS IS MORE (WAY MORE): In other words, even on my really long hair I only really needed maybe a nickel sized amount in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> The old one worked wonders, but when the new one came out, I figured I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> Right now it is long because I&#x27;ve got no idea what to do with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff or oily, and did I mention it smells divine!  :)</li>
            <li> This product is a fast and pleasant way to instantly quench thirsty strands a bit and tame the stray wispys down.</li>
            <li> I never know what it&#x27;s going to respond to as far as products and the weather.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve let it go natural,</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> Just remember to only use a lil&#x27; dab, it&#x27;s really concentrated.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to an organic shampoo and it&#x27;s been taking me forever to comb out my hair after washing it because it tangles so much.</li>
            <li> It calms the frizzies and makes my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair appear sleeker and softer even after putting it through a straightener on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This far, I am not overwhelmed by the results with this product, but it did make my hair feel somewhat softer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and frizz-free, with a touch of shine.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it works really well as a leave in conditioner product, but I don&#x27;t think my hair is any glossier.</li>
            <li> And at a list price of 19.99 it better do at least some of what it promises.  </li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my frizzy hair really soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it again on a rainy day when my hair tends to frizz, but so far unimpressed...</li>
            <li> which only dried my hair more.  </li>
            <li> The olive oil base is nice, and while it doesn&#x27;t have a lovely scent, it&#x27;s not an unpleasing scent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very light, not too oily or shiny, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The formula is light but not watery, and spreads beautifully-- a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product as a little bit goes a long  way.</li>
            <li> I did have VERY deep lines on my forehead (too much tanning bed as a teen) and they are almost completely gone from this new regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the higher price is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Gray hair can lack shine and this stuff really puts the shine in, smooths the overall look of my hair and, unexpectedly, seems to reduce the overall look of grayness.</li>
            <li> The styling creme was FANTASTIC, and I subbed it in in lieu of my usual detangler/leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> First rub your hands together to emulsify the cr&amp;egrave;me then work into WET hair from mid-shaft through to the ends.  </li>
            <li> It is also very fine and thin.</li>
            <li> I use a little on the end part of my shoulder length straight fine hair and it shines but isn&#x27;t weighed down like some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li> They were long and soft and just nice and I am very hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I&#x27;m sure this package will last me forever.</li>
            <li> My hair stays super soft as this does not dry to a stiff result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to toss out too many leave-on products due to heavy smell and oily feel, but for my hair and sensitivities, this product works well.</li>
            <li> a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to buy the old stuff.</li>
            <li> Because YES), and I am a complete magpie gathering piles and piles of products to try out and/or add to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Awhile</li>
            <li> All in all, it does feel nice in my hair and leaves a faint, but pleasnt scent.</li>
            <li> so I cannot complain too much but left my hair and skin incredibly dry no matter what product I used.  </li>
            <li> Too much trouble to get just the right amount ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use a bit right before and after ironing my hair, both to give it a little moisture boost and to tame flyaways still clinging onto dear life right after the heat damage is done.</li>
            <li> and we all have different hair types (fine, thick, wavy, etc.).</li>
            <li> Other products I have used have made my hair feel oily or greasy and that can happen with this product if you use too much</li>
            <li> The second day I used a much smaller amount and my hair dryed naturally.</li>
            <li> ; which is a plus because my hair is already pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li> The 4 ounce size should last a while as you don&#x27;t need very much product to give a little oomph to your hairdo.</li>
            <li> Too much will weigh it down and make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> since too much of any styling product tends to weigh down hair or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps the texture and look without weighing it down or turning it into a grease ball.  </li>
            <li> My hair falls about 3\\&quot; past my shoulders and I find that slightly less than a pea-sized amount is more than enough product to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> not shiny and even a little bit more frizzy than usual</li>
            <li> Arizona and Nevada (desert direct sun)  Utah dry air, and California.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really add a conditioning softness to my hair, but there is a slight glossy look.</li>
            <li> I normally have with other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight, black Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> that claim to tame flyaways, smooth out your hair, etc, but none so far have come close to what Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream does.&lt;br /&gt;After just a small dollop in my hand</li>
            <li> Makes hair managably ready to be styled; put a little on, comb or brush to desired style and voila -- it holds and holds and holds.  </li>
            <li> For years, I have searched for a product, (other than mousse), for my dry, very curly, and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s on the pricier side, the 4-oz container lasts a long time, since just a small amount goes a very long way--resist the temptation to squeeze out as much as you&#x27;d normally use with cheaper stuff or it will leave your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is one of a very few that leaves my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It has the right, thick consistency to give my hair the body I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> It also makes it easier to blow dry my hair straight, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> A little too heavy for my hair and, while it does give a nice shine, a little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I have short, dark brown hair and it enhances my natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that my hair is fine, thin, dry, colored &amp; tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> Lasts awhile because even with long hair you only need to use a pea size or slightly larger amount</li>
            <li> They are so small you can&#x27;t really see them until you look at your palms after you&#x27;ve rubbed the cream in-</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Pureology and I found this to be very comparable.</li>
            <li> Fekkai puts shine in my hair while making my hairstyle last all day long.  </li>
            <li> Even with my long hair, I only need a dime-quarter size amount for my roots.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that falls to my lower back.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, curly/wavy, color-treated for years, and definitely has a mind of</li>
            <li> Overuse can leave the hair flat or even greasy looking</li>
            <li> I like to take a dime sized amount and rub it on my ends and low dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is above my shoulders and I use only a dab on my wet hair working it in thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I have hunted for just this product for a long time and now would not do without it.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to let you in on a secret I discovered when I was fresh out of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I rub a little pea-sized bit (too much makes my hair limp, I found out the hard way) which really increases the shine and &amp;#34;swing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I use about a pea size amount and it adds natural shine and helps tame my frizz.</li>
            <li> It tangles faster than you can say &amp;#34;Rapunzel,&amp;#34; especially in the winter when it&#x27;s dry inside due to heaters.</li>
            <li> seriously, it&#x27;s a mass riot of waves, straight and greys that ever existed together on a scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and use a relaxer on my hair, which tends to dry it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and unruly.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry.</li>
            <li> work another pea sized amount into dry hair focusing on end pieces for frayed end management.</li>
            <li> but my hair felt dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Dry, brush and go.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry in the winter</li>
            <li> It worked well as a finishing gloss on dry styled hair.</li>
            <li> (my hair is long, slightly wavy and mildly coarse) and work through.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try, especially if you have thick, dull hair.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that takes the frizziness out of my hair without weighing down the curls.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and use less than a dime size drop daily.  </li>
            <li> Can be used on wet or dry hair and smells great!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> (lesson learned) you only need a LITTLE bit.  </li>
            <li> Something my husband never wants to run out of.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see a faint golden shimmer.  </li>
            <li> In a few hours, the lines on my face were tightened and my skin looked younger.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective at taming those annoying frizzies.</li>
            <li> My hair has been through hell the last four years thanks to a ton of ill health and having to take ongoing  steroids and other meds.  </li>
            <li> You can also apply it when the hair is dry, though I find that it weighs my hair (which is on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; textured side) down and leaves it too \\&quot;flat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A really small amount goes a long way to giving my hair a less frizzy and coarse look, imparting shine and, well, slickness.</li>
            <li> the directions say:  a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As the package says, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I use some oils and other sheen-type products sometimes it looks to shiny to be believed, which I don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li> After I ran out of shampoo and conditioner I continued to use the gloss to see how well it works with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of other products if I loaded my head up with a combination of 5 products and had an oily look</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I also use a tiny amount on the ends of my dried hair to add a little gloss when my ends looked fried.</li>
            <li> I put it on towel dried hair and let air dry</li>
            <li> I like using only a small amount on bottom half of my hair (not close to roots)</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair that use to always look wild.</li>
            <li> On the back of the tube, it states that “dull frizzy hair is nurtured to shine and smoothness” -</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> like it says a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse wavy hair</li>
            <li> I hate my hair so much, so many times.</li>
            <li> It also helped my hair hold unto the curly waves that I get when I take my braids down.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> The cream while sleeking my frizzy hair down, did not offer any additional shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend applying to the root area as it can weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair which I usually wear down or in braids</li>
            <li> Blow dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dull and flat now with no life.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how shiny my hair is, or that my hair is less frizzy (it doesn&#x27;t get too frizzy anyway).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less inclined to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using Moroccan Oil styling cream</li>
            <li> Slightly lotion-y.</li>
            <li> I thought the choice of olive oil was odd, but it turned out to be well paired with the floral scent.  </li>
            <li> Even though they are expensive, I highly recommend Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> I have long and curly thick hair which typically needs quite a bit of product to take away the frizz.</li>
            <li> A dime size amount ( ok on a really bad day 2 dimes) rubbed into the worst offending strands smooths everything out magically.</li>
            <li> usually put about a pea size or two in my wet hair</li>
            <li> I prefer that to the oil based shine enhancing products which tend to make my hair look a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I find this makes my hair greasy no matter how little of this product I use.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars because I have used shine products that also add a little conditioning and while this makes hair silky</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is still a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Use just a little bit and focus around the ends of your hair and where it is thickest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhoo, I recommend for thicker, coarser hair because this stuff feels a little heavy and maybe a little greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Put you do need to use very little or it will weigh down the hair...</li>
            <li> not all dried out.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it leaves hair feeling heavy and almost greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It also worked well on towel dried damp hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely made the job a lot easier, where other products that I&#x27;ve tried have failed.</li>
            <li> This creme holds my hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> everything except stiff hold.</li>
            <li> I immediately put the cream to the test on my long and impossibly thick (and hard to tame)</li>
            <li> Can use it to make hair spiky or tame.</li>
            <li> I have used it both as as curly hair smoother and after a blow out to help tame a miss placed stray hair.</li>
            <li> It glides onto my hair, making it dry smoother, look glossier, and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> I usually use sprays</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they did to this cream, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downside to this product is the ingredient list of scary sounding chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> and I have never gone back to expensive $100</li>
            <li> just use it in small quantities</li>
            <li> and Benefits**&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair smoothed, with unbelievable gloss and shiny finish</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever purchased one that I did not absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t respond well to ordinary gels and creams.  </li>
            <li> It just left my hair stringy and weird...</li>
            <li> I have heard that using an oil based product on your skin helps regulate oil production, but obviously I&#x27;m not a good test subject for the theory.</li>
            <li> I have found lots of these creams to leave my hair feeling very heavy and greasy but this did not do that.</li>
            <li> it made my hair dull instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes dull hair shine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still dull.</li>
            <li> Fekkai products were not so expensive, I&#x27;d give them five stars, but they are a bit costly.</li>
            <li> Hey, call me weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that was not my experience.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin, wavy hair that goes crazy in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> I was really totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use all Fekkai products and love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far. This one makes your hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Something my husband never wants to run out of.  Amazon to the rescue at a good price &amp; shipped right to the door.</li>
            <li> This really helped manage my hair after the harsh straightening I did. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my hair for several years.  Love how it smoothes the cuticle and is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I use a little on the end part of my shoulder length straight fine hair and it shines but isn&#x27;t weighed down like some conditioners can do.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34; hair.  I never know what it&#x27;s going to respond to as far as products and the weather.  This is a very rich but smooth balm for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;As the directions say:  a little goes a long way.  I find it tames my little frizzies and gives my hair a beautiful shine and feel.</li>
            <li> I tend to be one of those people who tries new products even when what I have is working great..and I don&#x27;t know why I ever stopped using this product. It is everything I like in a pre-styling hair product. It glides onto my hair, making it dry smoother, look glossier, and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily greasy feeling behind. It works great on color treated and bleached hair. A little goes a long way, so the higher price is completely worth it. After years of trying new products, I still think of this as my favorite to apply to my curly, bleach-damaged hair, before drying and heat styling. I also use a tiny amount on the ends of my dried hair to add a little gloss when my ends looked fried. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is great for curly hair.  defines my curls and softens without stiffness.  smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme.  Fekkai puts shine in my hair while making my hairstyle last all day long.  I love me some Fakkai.</li>
            <li> just as described.  A great value!</li>
            <li> one little bead is all you need to control  your hair and also give it a beautiful shine ..</li>
            <li> I have very short, silver hair that needs a bit of taming. Love this product as a little bit goes a long  way. Can use it to make hair spiky or tame. Adds a great sheen.</li>
            <li> EVERY WOMAN SHOULD USE THIS BEFORE GOING OUTDOORS!!  YOUR HAIR SAYS &amp;#34;THANK YOU&amp;#34; AND YOU WILL GET COMPLIMENTS GALORE ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this glossing crème for years.  It give my hair lots of shine and control.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived super-fast and exactly as described :)</li>
            <li> Makes hair easy to comb and style. Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair.  This product is one of a very few that leaves my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my hair feel soft and manageable. I have very thick curly hair that use to always look wild. This product has tamed my mane.</li>
            <li> I have 3B type curly hair, and I&#x27;m always on the look-out for new leave-in conditioners. I usually use sprays but I decided to give a chance on this product. This is a good product, nice scent of olive oil and a bit of lemon (to my nose anyway). Even with my long hair, I only need a dime-quarter size amount for my roots. It does also seem to volumize my hair a bit when I blow-dry my hair. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how shiny my hair is, or that my hair is less frizzy (it doesn&#x27;t get too frizzy anyway). My hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after using it, or tacky. I&#x27;d recommend this if you are looking for a new and better product, but if you&#x27;re happy with a product you already have, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend switching.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse wavy hair and I&#x27;ve let it go natural, so now I have streaks of gray, and this product is great on my hair. Gray hair can lack shine and this stuff really puts the shine in, smooths the overall look of my hair and, unexpectedly, seems to reduce the overall look of grayness. The scent is light and pleasant. I&#x27;ve had to toss out too many leave-on products due to heavy smell and oily feel, but for my hair and sensitivities, this product works well. Wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey but will keep buying because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product has a really nice scent and and texture to it. It says very clearly on the label to use it sparingly and that is definitely the case. It is potent but works really well. I used it on damp hair and I liked the way it made my hair feel soft. I have color treated hair so I will take all the moisture I can get. It is a little heavy so if you don&#x27;t want something with that much weight it might not be the best for you. The smell is nice and not over-powering. I would recommend it especially if you have dry/damaged hair</li>
            <li> leaves the hair so shinny and soft!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is one of my &#x27;go to&#x27; products.  It has an excellent texture and mild scent.  I apply it on my blown out hair and then style.  It leave it looking managed and not all dried out.  On occasion i use it in place of a conditioner in the shower and rinse it out.  I absolutely love the resuld.</li>
            <li> My hair is untamable... seriously, it&#x27;s a mass riot of waves, straight and greys that ever existed together on a scalp. I hate my hair so much, so many times. Right now it is long because I&#x27;ve got no idea what to do with it. When I actually take the time to put some wave into it, I want it sleek on top where the greys tend to ping and stand out because of it. With the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme, I can actually get everything to lay in the layers that I have. Also, my hair looks shiny without looking oily. A huge difference that many creams, gels and glossing products do not do. There is no heaviness when I use this creme either, and I can rub it into my hands and face for some moisturizing benefit. The olive oil base is nice, and while it doesn&#x27;t have a lovely scent, it&#x27;s not an unpleasing scent. It&#x27;s mostly without one actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Fekkai products were not so expensive, I&#x27;d give them five stars, but they are a bit costly. However, we do find occasional good deals at Walgreens. So maybe keep an eye out for them there.</li>
            <li> My hair was more frizzy with this product.  Into the trash it goes</li>
            <li> Great shipping!  Love this product, I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner for my hair when I use this</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Especially on my split ends. Brings them back to life and keeps my unruly frizzy hair neat until I wash my hair again!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair, but it has lots of body and is sometimes a bit uncooperative when it comes to styling.  This product is great in that it gives me a little more control without making it look like I slathered my head in product.  The smell is light and refreshing, not overpowering like some cremes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and use a relaxer on my hair, which tends to dry it out. Also, my hair has the curious distinction of being both fine and frizzy. This product has solved all of my hair problems.  After shampooing, I rub a little pea-sized bit (too much makes my hair limp, I found out the hard way) which really increases the shine and &amp;#34;swing.&amp;#34;  Although the manufacturers don&#x27;t suggest using it as a hair creme, I also use a bit on my ends in between shampoos. I hope someone notifies me if the manufacturers ever decide to discontinue this product so that I can stockpile a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, blonde hair and this cream gives a glossy finish to my color and also helps to keep the fly away ends in place.  I would recommend this cream if you want as honey finish to your hair.</li>
            <li> package arrived as promised and all was fine</li>
            <li> it made my hair dull instead of shiny. I was really totally disappointed. The word glossing caught my eye, that is why i made the purchase</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly and as advertised. What a great deal!</li>
            <li> A product my girlfriend really likes.  Here&#x27;s what she says. Fekkai products are high-end styling aids; I have tried several different ones as samples and they are really fantastic. This 4-oz tube of brilliant glossing creme is the first styling product I’ve tried (the other products were shampoos/conditioners). True, it retails for around $15-20, which is a bit cost-prohibitive, but...WOW, it works so well!  On the back of the tube, it states that “dull frizzy hair is nurtured to shine and smoothness” - and it sure does that!  A little goes a long way (there’s a warning on the back about that) and it doesn’t weigh hair down - it smooths and shines beautifully for my dark hair (fine, wavy-curly and prone to frizziness). The smell is gorgeous as well - an herbal/flower scent that is sophisticated and very present, although not cloying. I don’t like using hair spray on my hair after using this, because I want to keep the lovely scent!  In fact, if Fekkai sold a hairspray with that scent, I might just&lt;br /&gt;  pony up for that too. It lives up to its name as a brilliant glosser for hair - EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li> The new glossing cream is not that good. I like the old one much better. The old one worked wonders, but when the new one came out, I figured I&#x27;ll switch. It has to be improved and updated. I&#x27;m not sure what they did to this cream, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. My hair is dull and flat now with no life. The old one used to make it look and feel great and just a little would go a long way. I&#x27;m going back to buy the old stuff. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when they run out, but I&#x27;m buying and storing lol!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair fabulous</li>
            <li> Best glossing creme EVER made</li>
            <li> I generally love Fekkai shampoos and hair-care products, and this one is no exception. A really small amount goes a long way to giving my hair a less frizzy and coarse look, imparting shine and, well, slickness. The fragrance is pleasant but light, and so long as you don&#x27;t use much, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. Definitely worth a try, especially if you have thick, dull hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the micro shimmer particles suspended in this great smelling, non-sticky styling cream.  They are so small you can&#x27;t really see them until you look at your palms after you&#x27;ve rubbed the cream in-you&#x27;ll see a faint golden shimmer.  I prefer that to the oil based shine enhancing products which tend to make my hair look a little oily.  I also like the way the cream smells, sort of reminds me of apples.  Hey, call me weird but if a product doesn&#x27;t smell good to me I&#x27;m less inclined to use it.  I have very long hair which I usually wear down or in braids and this cream did help manage my mild frizz issues.  It also helped my hair hold unto the curly waves that I get when I take my braids down.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to keep your hair from getting frizzy and such then this is the product for you. Hair becomes smoother and a bit shiner as well. Works well on both short and longer hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. This gives my curls definition, with no fuzziness. My hair stays super soft as this does not dry to a stiff result. I have bought several of this product over the years and it never disappoints me. Clean scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cr&amp;egrave;me.  It is the only thing that takes the frizziness out of my hair without weighing down the curls.  A very little bit goes a long way.  I have medium length hair and use less than a dime size drop daily.  Too much will weigh it down and make it look greasy.  Start with a pea size drop and add if necessary.  It is olive oil, so it is healthy for your hair as well.</li>
            <li> Makes dull hair shine.  It&#x27;s great and you don&#x27;t need much to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have frizzy hair, and this product does a wonderful job of keeping the frizz down without weighing my hair down.  I may try the shampoo and conditioner in this line too since they reformulated my favorite, the color care one.</li>
            <li> Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;Every hair product I&#x27;ve used has a downside.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is the ingredient list of scary sounding chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Not big on that. I may keep searching for a hair product that works as well without the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;But,&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far to keep my hair perfectly smooth, silky and non-frizzy!&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to report that this product has a great consistency that does not add weight to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does not make the hair appear as if there is product in it - looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky, but silky. It smells great - a light scent, thank goodness - not big on scents.&lt;br /&gt;There you have it, a very honest assessment.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way. I love how shiny it makes my hair. I have short, dark brown hair and it enhances my natural highlights. It also makes it easier to blow dry my hair straight, without weighing it down. Just remember to only use a lil&#x27; dab, it&#x27;s really concentrated.</li>
            <li> I got samples of the Shampoo, Conditioner, and Glossing creme from an Influenster voxbox.  I was very excited to get the samples and used them right away.  The glossing creme was icing on the cake.  It goes in without leaving your hands or hair sticky.  It is lightweight and smells amazing as do the shampoo and conditioner.  You can definitely tell the products are great quality and the olive oil in it is a great idea because it leaves your hair soft and shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have product in my hair and you don&#x27;t have to use that much either.  My hair feels and smells like I just left the salon!</li>
            <li> A little too heavy for my hair and, while it does give a nice shine, a little goes a very long way and it&#x27;s easy to &amp;#34;over-apply&amp;#34; and end up looking greasy.  Won&#x27;t buy again but if you have thicker hair would probably work out great.</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try and I have to say I think I will buy some when my sample is gone.  I LOVE the smell.  Light floral smell.  It makes my hair shiny and keeps my curls/waves from frizzing which is great.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel stiff or oily, and did I mention it smells divine!  :)</li>
            <li> Have used for for 10 years and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Another free sample from Influenster that is a HUGE WIN!  Soft, smooth, lasting style with this product! I received this product free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I got this to review for Influenster but have gotten it and used it before.  It does a great job of giving you shine without feeling like you need to re-wash your hair.  No stickiness or greasy look!  Love this product and absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product! My hair has never looked as healthy as it does now. This has added brilliant shine to my hair!</li>
            <li> I got to try this free as a Vine customer, but I liked it enough to reorder. It really does make my hair shiny and silky and tangle free. It only takes a little bit. My hair is dry, very fine, and fairly long, about 4&amp;#34; below my shoulders. So I use an amount about the size of 2 peas. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that falls to my lower back. It is also very fine and thin. It tangles faster than you can say &amp;#34;Rapunzel,&amp;#34; especially in the winter when it&#x27;s dry inside due to heaters. I recently switched to an organic shampoo and it&#x27;s been taking me forever to comb out my hair after washing it because it tangles so much. I had the opportunity to try the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme via Amazon Vine and thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after getting out of the shower, then comb my hair. It&#x27;s definitely made the job a lot easier, where other products that I&#x27;ve tried have failed. Because I&#x27;m using it mostly on my ends (from my ears down), I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it looking greasy. There is a light floral scent, but it is not one that sticks with you like many product smells do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Environmental Working Group database, it&#x27;s rated as &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; concern at a 5, mostly because of fragrance and methylchloroisothiazolinone. Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a preservative that can cause allergic skin reactions, so if you  have sensitive skin, this would not be a good product choice for you. It also does not leave my hair &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; as I&#x27;d define it. It&#x27;s smooth and soft to the touch, but it doesn&#x27;t look glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product, though, and would purchase it for my own use.</li>
            <li> Frederic Fekkai makes great hair products..... a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This creme holds my hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for many years and love the results I get on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to enjoy a little pampering, this is a nice little splurge.  It smells so lovely and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and adds a believable bit of shine to my hair.  My hair is straight, black Asian hair.  When I use some oils and other sheen-type products sometimes it looks to shiny to be believed, which I don&#x27;t care for.  It does not weigh my hair down; which is a plus because my hair is already pretty heavy.  The 4 ounce size should last a while as you don&#x27;t need very much product to give a little oomph to your hairdo.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about the Fekkai line of hair products and recalled trying a sample of the shampoo and conditioner which left my hair very soft and smooth.  With the very dry winter, the ends of my hair needed a boost most days and since using the Fekkai glossing creme I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement of the look of the ends.  I like using only a small amount on bottom half of my hair (not close to roots) since too much of any styling product tends to weigh down hair or make it look greasy.  I found this glossing creme to have a really lovely scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering and doesn&#x27;t make hair feel sticky, just smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of shoulder length hair but it&#x27;s extremely fine and very prone to frizz. A dime size amount ( ok on a really bad day 2 dimes) rubbed into the worst offending strands smooths everything out magically. But I don&#x27;t get any shine and that&#x27;s really the products main stated purpose. Also it makes my hair a bit piecey , so unless I start going frizzy I don&#x27;t immediately grab this. So while it&#x27;s about the best de-frizzer I have ever used, for me there was no brilliance and my hair can edge a bit toward oily so I would have thought shine wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Fekkai products and this glossing creme is right up there with some of my favorite Fekkai products.  Just a little bit goes a long way.  I put a pea size amount in my palm and rub it through the top layer of my hair.  It calms the frizzies and makes my hair shiny and soft.  This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have long and curly thick hair which typically needs quite a bit of product to take away the frizz. I was very pleased with this glossing cream, it&#x27;s very light, not too oily or shiny, and a little goes a long way. I use about a pea size amount and it adds natural shine and helps tame my frizz. I was previously using Moroccan Oil styling cream and I like this Fekkai product better for my hair. The smell is also very pleasant and not too much</li>
            <li> This was a reorder and I love using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and unruly.  Fekkai Glossing Creme adds a healthy sheen and makes it more manageable.  Good product!</li>
            <li> I tried this and first the review wasn&#x27;t going to be 4 stars because of the frizz my hair still had in the underlayers but the 2nd day (didn&#x27;t wash hair next morning), the results were better and I liked it. The smell is light and non irritating and I noticed on the 2nd day my hair was a bit softer and shinier</li>
            <li> A great product. Nice and light and gives hair great shine. Lasts awhile because even with long hair you only need to use a pea size or slightly larger amount</li>
            <li> If I only had one styling product for the rest of my life, this would be it. Protects, moisturizes, manages frayed ends, reduces frizz... everything except stiff hold. LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put about a pea size or two in my wet hair (my hair is long, slightly wavy and mildly coarse) and work through. Brush hair. Blow dry. work another pea sized amount into dry hair focusing on end pieces for frayed end management. I finish with wiping palums on either side of part to manage flyaways. Perfection!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m hesitant to divulge this, I&#x27;m hoping someone else will get the benefits I have from this product. So, I&#x27;m going to let you in on a secret I discovered when I was fresh out of moisturizer. I used the tiniest amount of this after washing my face and my complexion was instantly brightened and smooth. In a few hours, the lines on my face were tightened and my skin looked younger. I was so pleasantly surprised and I have never gone back to expensive $100+ creams, toners, and scrubs. This (and some vitamin c + rosehip serum) has brought my skin back 10 years. I use it on my hands too and they look MUCH younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin that isn&#x27;t prone to breakouts or oil. I have heard that using an oil based product on your skin helps regulate oil production, but obviously I&#x27;m not a good test subject for the theory. I did have VERY deep lines on my forehead (too much tanning bed as a teen) and they are almost completely gone from this new regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it too. I wish they made a perfume.</li>
            <li> Works great. Leaves hair soft and shiny. Always have use it.....just use it in small quantities otherwise it leaves hair feeling heavy and almost greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that my hair is fine, thin, dry, colored &amp; tends to frizz. After using the Fekkai shampoo &amp; condition, I finished it off with a pea size dab of this styling cream. I was looking most for the &amp;#34;Brilliant Glossing&amp;#34; effect. To start with, the scent had a citrus smell that smelled awesome. The cream while sleeking my frizzy hair down, did not offer any additional shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream for a while, I hope to be able to say that it does indeed add that brilliant gloss that we all want. Willing to give this some more time because I truly want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Best styling product for dry hair, especially from coloring. Makes my curls shine without any greasy feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> This line of hair care has really been great.  It has given my hair such shine.  The texter has become so silky smooth.  I will definitely purchase this line again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the clean, fresh smell of this product! It left my hair feeling and looking super smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product sample from Influencer and Fekkai BUT I&#x27;m a long-time user and this is the best smoothing product on the market. Can be used on wet or dry hair and smells great!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have since become a big fan of this product! It really makes my hair appear sleeker and softer even after putting it through a straightener on a daily basis. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance at all too! You really only need a tiny amount to see a big difference. Love it!</li>
            <li> I would give this unlimited stars if I could!&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of anything girlie (can you be a techie and girlie at the same time? Because YES), and I am a complete magpie gathering piles and piles of products to try out and/or add to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Awhile back I actually won a free full size tube of Fekkai Glossing Cream in a Facebook contest. Giveaway Princesses UNITE! I immediately put the cream to the test on my long and impossibly thick (and hard to tame) long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Two things I learned immediately:&lt;br /&gt;One: LESS IS MORE (WAY MORE): In other words, even on my really long hair I only really needed maybe a nickel sized amount in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;Two: I am in love and you cannot pry this stuff from my hands no matter what!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple hair serums, creams etc. that claim to tame flyaways, smooth out your hair, etc, but none so far have come close to what Frederic Fekkai Glossing Cream does.&lt;br /&gt;After just a small dollop in my hand, I smooth it over the ends of my hair and then finish off by running my hands over the crown of my head, then BAM! I’m done and I look like I walked out of a salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Features and Benefits**&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair smoothed, with unbelievable gloss and shiny finish&lt;br /&gt;Smells AMAZING (I get compliments ALL the time on how good my hair smells)&lt;br /&gt;Lasts all day, sometimes even until the next day&lt;br /&gt; A tube should last you months if you use the same amount that I do. Mine actually has A LOT left in it after months of use, and I use it about three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;(Side benefit) Leaves your hands silky soft and also smelling pleasant</li>
            <li> Best product Fekkai makes! I have several friends that use it and we all have different hair types (fine, thick, wavy, etc.). It&#x27;s fab!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. It left my hair frizz free and shiny just like it promised. I also love the way it smells. I have found lots of these creams to leave my hair feeling very heavy and greasy but this did not do that. In the past I have used Pureology and I found this to be very comparable. Re</li>
            <li> I find this makes my hair greasy no matter how little of this product I use.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m a product junkie.  The smell on this stuff is fantastic, very lemon drops and sunshine.  The consistency is. Dry smooth and keeps fly a ways at bay and helps smooth hair before a blow dry.  I like to take a dime sized amount and rub it on my ends and low dry.  I get smooth silky gorgeous curled under ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three favorite smoothing creams .......and this has been the first one I have grabbed for days.  The oil in the cream really adds to the smoothing and shine for your hair.  So many hair care products have oil or are some kind of oil based products because a little oil really helps out in the beauty world.</li>
            <li> If you like the luster that a good hair oil can bring to your locks, but still aren&#x27;t crazy about an oil&#x27;s slick texture, Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is an ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit of this nice, lightweight cream, melts into the air and leaves it feeling soft and looking shiny and healthy thanks to its olive oil formula and its smells really nice, too, with a pleasant floral scent that isn&#x27;t too perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although it&#x27;s on the pricier side, the 4-oz container lasts a long time, since just a small amount goes a very long way--resist the temptation to squeeze out as much as you&#x27;d normally use with cheaper stuff or it will leave your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is a great brand and I love trying their products. I love their PRX Reparative oil and this product is pretty good too. It  adds a silky texture to hair and make hair shinier. It doesn&#x27;t really condition like an oil but it does seem to add more shine and strength to my fine hair. I gave this product four stars because I have used shine products that also add a little conditioning and while this makes hair silky it doesn&#x27;t add a lot to my dry ends and there are products for the same price that add more conditioning. This is pretty much a high gloss formula to make hair shine, but for that, it works great.</li>
            <li> Love it not grease and work great</li>
            <li> I always, always, ALWAYS have this in my arsenal. It adds incredible shine, softness, smoothness - in one use it looks so much different. I&#x27;ve even used it as an intense conditioner. The smell is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li> Even though they are expensive, I highly recommend Fekkai products.  They smell clean and refreshing, don&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling and unless someone gets physically close to you, they won&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this from Influenster to try and review.  The first 2 days I was able to use with the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was very soft.  After I ran out of shampoo and conditioner I continued to use the gloss to see how well it works with other shampoos.  I put it on towel dried hair and let air dry and my hair did okay.  The next day I used it again but this time used my styling mousse also.  It does give my hair a softer feel to it.  Put you do need to use very little or it will weigh down the hair...like it says a small amount goes a long way.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Too glossy!  Looks more greasy than shiny.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and really like it!</li>
            <li> just the best hair cream.  takes the dry, fly away look and tames it into the perfect looking beach-tossed look.  also makes your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I used too much -- even though I only used a tad. My hair is long, curly/wavy, color-treated for years, and definitely has a mind of it&#x27;s own. My bathroom is awash with conditioners of every brand and formula, from the cheap to the way-too-pricey. Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Creme is ultra-concentrated. Because of it, I had to wash my hair again the next day. The second day I used a much smaller amount and my hair dryed naturally. To my eye, it didn&#x27;t seem to have additional shine and felt a bit coated to me. This far, I am not overwhelmed by the results with this product, but it did make my hair feel somewhat softer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for all climates!  I used this product in Florida (very humid) Arizona and Nevada (desert direct sun)  Utah dry air, and California.  I used to while straightening my hair which normally takes me just about an hour to do.  (My hair is med back length, curly and frizzy).  Other products I have used have made my hair feel oily or greasy and that can happen with this product if you use too much (lesson learned) you only need a LITTLE bit.  I get my hair colored about every 4-6 weeks so I do not have the best hair but with the glossing creme you could not tell it looks beautiful and super healthy.  In the dry air my hair felt great, soft and maintained being straight.  When I used it on my wet hair to see how my curls would look I actually had beautiful curls for the first time since I was probably 3 yrs old.  They were long and soft and just nice and I am very hard on my hair.  When I straightened it in the humid Florida climate it stayed straight.  I did not have the ever growing frizz head I normally have with other products I have used.  Speaking of other products if I loaded my head up with a combination of 5 products and had an oily look but my hair felt dry and brittle I was fine in the Florida humidity, BUT using this I maintained the straight, non-greasy, non-brittle, soft hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I am a fan. I will continue to use this product and I honestly can&#x27;t find any fault with it, unless you are using too much of it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been through hell the last four years thanks to a ton of ill health and having to take ongoing  steroids and other meds.  Granted they saved my life so I cannot complain too much but left my hair and skin incredibly dry no matter what product I used.  I had given up my days of shiny healthy looking hair.  No more.  This product really helps the texture and look without weighing it down or turning it into a grease ball.  My hair is above my shoulders and I use only a dab on my wet hair working it in thoroughly.  Dry, brush and go.  I don&#x27;t need to flat iron any more which only dried my hair more.  I must admit I had used some of this product line and was not favorably impressed, not so with this one.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice smell to it, almost reminds me of an oceany, beach scent. I also like how after applying it, it made my hair feel weightless, very light. It doesn&#x27;t really add a conditioning softness to my hair, but there is a slight glossy look. All in all, it does feel nice in my hair and leaves a faint, but pleasnt scent. After using my straightener, it looked a bit more smooth and shiny too. Not quite as &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; as I imagined, but it is nice.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job smoothing frizzy hair and adding a bit of shine, but silicone is one of the main ingredients so you&#x27;ll want to use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent - it smells \\&quot;green\\&quot;, like fresh-cut grass.  My hair falls about 3\\&quot; past my shoulders and I find that slightly less than a pea-sized amount is more than enough product to get the job done.  First rub your hands together to emulsify the cr&amp;egrave;me then work into WET hair from mid-shaft through to the ends.  I would not recommend applying to the root area as it can weigh the hair down.  Blow dry as usual.  It leaves my color-treated hair feeling soft and frizz-free, with a touch of shine.  You can also apply it when the hair is dry, though I find that it weighs my hair (which is on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; textured side) down and leaves it too \\&quot;flat\\&quot; looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*May not be suitable for very fine or thinning hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Strong fragrance (I think it smells great, but you may not agree!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Contains silicone which can coat the hair; some hair stylists recommend limiting or avoiding silicone-based hair care products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A little goes a long way!  Overuse can leave the hair flat or even greasy looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I don&#x27;t generally like silicone-based hair products, but this smoothing cr&amp;egrave;me is going to be a handy weapon to have in my hair care arsenal once the humid weather rolls around - it&#x27;s effective at taming those annoying frizzies.</li>
            <li> I love trying new products out for my frizzy hair-- it&#x27;s a mixture of, &amp;#34;Wow, maybe this will work!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Ha, you think you can handle this madness, ya tube of gunk?&amp;#34; It did help that the name Fekkai was on the bottle, which has always been a great brand in the few times I&#x27;ve used something of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light, and lovely. Slightly lotion-y. The formula is light but not watery, and spreads beautifully-- a little really does go a long way. I&#x27;d use a bit right before and after ironing my hair, both to give it a little moisture boost and to tame flyaways still clinging onto dear life right after the heat damage is done. This product is a fast and pleasant way to instantly quench thirsty strands a bit and tame the stray wispys down.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Fekkai products.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever purchased one that I did not absolutely love.  Glossing just doesn&#x27;t seem to be for me.  While I found that this works for an excellent detangler and something that does seem to moisturize my hair, it did not provide any particular shine that I could tell.  Also, my hair is still a little frizzy.  Overall, it works really well as a leave in conditioner product, but I don&#x27;t think my hair is any glossier.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair.  It&#x27;s not smooth and shiny.  It has a bit of curl and some days frizz.  I know the name Frederick Fekkai and his fame for hair products so I thought that this could be what the answers to my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve used this product now for about a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed any more shine than normal and my hair can still be frizzy and times.  It does smell good, and it goes on weightless and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or that feeling you get when there is too much product in your hair.  All of that is well and good, but it doesn&#x27;t really do what I bought it for.  And at a list price of 19.99 it better do at least some of what it promises.  Unfortunately that was not my experience.  I&#x27;ll be using what I have left, but I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with Aveda products, and I recently saw that a competitor will be carrying Carol&#x27;s Daughter products in it&#x27;s stores, so I may try that instead.</li>
            <li> As the package says, a little goes a long way.  Makes hair managably ready to be styled; put a little on, comb or brush to desired style and voila -- it holds and holds and holds.  Great for hair that doesn&#x27;t respond well to ordinary gels and creams.  A winner!</li>
            <li> very good，it makes my hair looks very sharing and healthy。。I like it very much 。good good good good goodgood good</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST hair cream I have ever used. It has the right, thick consistency to give my hair the body I&#x27;m looking for. I used to use a L&#x27;oreal one, but then i tried this and I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> great product..works as described</li>
            <li> The instructions say to only use a dab.  My hair is dry in the winter and I needed more than that.  It worked well as a finishing gloss on dry styled hair. It helped to calm frizzies and my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It also worked well on towel dried damp hair.  Pleasant, not very strong smell. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff, but it does nothing for my ends. In fact, I kinda think this is making my ends feel even more dry than normal?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, I recommend for thicker, coarser hair because this stuff feels a little heavy and maybe a little greasy. It does feel very nice once my hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very  first time I used it one of my co workers asked what I had used in my hair that morning, so in that regard... Success!</li>
            <li> It gives my thick hair an incredible shine without being greasy. I have hunted for just this product for a long time and now would not do without it.</li>
            <li> Some time ago, I received a sample of this from somewhere, so I gave it a try.  After only a couple of uses, I was hooked, so I had to buy a full size.  I have a lot of thin, wavy hair that goes crazy in the humidity.  Just smoothing a dollop of this on my hair  transforms the texture to silky, smoother, and wonderfully frizz-free!  This is made by the CHI folks, so if you love their Silk Infusion, you&#x27;ll love this.  It&#x27;s available in stores, but you&#x27;ll pay a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> I received this product compliments of @influenster and love it. It has made my hair shiny and more alive looking.  My hair is moisturized and glossy and feels soft and bouncy.  I have been using this product in conjunction with the Fekkai Brilliant Shampoo and Conditioner and I will continue to use this product as I love the results.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked great on my long hair.  My hair is smooth, soft and shiny and feels lighter.  It says a little goes along way, which is very true.  Use just a little bit and focus around the ends of your hair and where it is thickest.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works. The scent could be better.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very shiny and smooth. A little goes a long way, I&#x27;m sure this package will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I really like the Brillian Glossing Creme.  My hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes my frizzy hair really soft</li>
            <li> Fantastic product  --  Tames the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and smoothes the hair cuticle for glossy, shiny hair. It&#x27;s the Best Friend for colored / chemically treated hair !  I won&#x27;t be without it.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Maybe you need to have curly hair for this to do anything? It just left my hair stringy and weird... not shiny and even a little bit more frizzy than usual.. I&#x27;m going to try it again on a rainy day when my hair tends to frizz, but so far unimpressed...</li>
            <li> Probably a good product for some.  I can&#x27;t do that much greasiness.  Too much trouble to get just the right amount ....too much and you&#x27;re a grease-ball.</li>
            <li> I received this product from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to get this since my think, brown hair is dull and I really want it to be shiny and smooth. It can get really frizzy as well. I used the sample, and it didn&#x27;t really help. My hair is still dull. I am disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work - i was so excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did smell really good though, and so I will give it to a friend with thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I received this set courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes.  I thought the creme was great--the smell wasn&#x27;t too cloying (sometimes floral scents can be too much).  I thought the choice of olive oil was odd, but it turned out to be well paired with the floral scent.  The styling creme was FANTASTIC, and I subbed it in in lieu of my usual detangler/leave-in conditioner.  It felt light and didn&#x27;t require too much product to be effective.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> For years, I have searched for a product, (other than mousse), for my dry, very curly, and frizzy hair.  I have tried creams and gels, and pretty much everything, (salon products included), and this is by far the best. Fekkai Brillant Glossing Creme left my hair soft, my curls defined, and my hair shiny, and absolutely FRIZZ FREE!  I was really impressed, and happy to FINALLY find a product that really works!  Thank you Fekkai!</li>
            <li> The fekkai brilliant glossing creme has been a great addition to my morning hair routine. I have used it both as as curly hair smoother and after a blow out to help tame a miss placed stray hair. The shine has been an added bonus in addition to keeping my curls in check.</li>
            <li> the best stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my fine, color treated hair.</li>
