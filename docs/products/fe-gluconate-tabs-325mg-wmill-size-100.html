    <ol>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this brand and am allergic to coating on other products.  I am delighted to find it here at a good price.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product, and not so harsh on my stomach, I don&#x27;t feel as weak as before!</li>
            <li> Same as I got in the hospital</li>
            <li> For some reason Fergon iron tabs have become difficult to find. After being on waitlist for several months through another Amazon order, I saw the listing for these Fergon tabs and ordered 2 bottles. But when the product arrived, it was NOT Fergon as the photo in the listing ad clearly shows... instead it is a generic version of Fergon. I have tried all iron supplements on the market and Fergon is the only one that doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach because of its unique coating... this generic brand does NOT have that coating. Amazon should make them replace the Fergon photo with one of the actual product they are selling... which is Windmill Fe Gluconate 325mg tablets. [[ASIN:B001BKNIIY Windmill Fe Gluconate 325 MG Tablets - 100 Ea [Health and Beauty]]]</li>
            <li> I love this version of iron.  Ferrous Sulfate was horrible, but I was severely anemic.  Highly recommend it.  Great alternative.</li>
            <li> I have no way to tell if it is as good as the brand I have been using, Fergon. But the price is certainly better!</li>
            <li> The material complies with my doctor&#x27;s prescription, the price beats my drug store&#x27;s, the quality is fine, and the mail order and receipt convenience is an appreciated bonus.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work okay but bound me up.  Had to try something else.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and reliable, sent in a timely fashion, seems to be what the Doctor ordered for my anemia - cautious at first as iron needs to be taken in an informed manner, it is nothing to play around with. Have experienced no negative reactions as my system has been very reactive to &amp;#34;Wal-mart and Drug store-type&amp;#34; supplements. Makes me quite toxic. Will order again if need be - should not be taken as a &amp;#34;precautionary&amp;#34; supplement in case you think you need it.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully and are a steal of a deal at this price. I love the high dosage of Ferrous Gluconate as well. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> good and easy to digest</li>
            <li> They helped my saltwater algae turn green and grow very noticeable. I like not a lot of extra ingredients you donâ€™t need.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001BKNIIY Windmill Fe Gluconate 325 MG Tablets - 100 Ea]]The reason for selecting this product is the significant cost saving over Fergon.  The two products are equivalent.</li>
            <li> great price for the amount,cheaper than if you have your drugstore order it. works just as well and you get three times the amount,came quick also</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the iron tablets had a candy coating like the ones sold locally.  They are hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> The Ferrous Gluconate 324 Mg tablets were the solution to my anemic problems. My Doctor prescribed 325 Mg for me. I had trouble finding the right MG. I got online, googled for Ferrous Gluconate found it on Amazon. I received my order in a few days. This is a lot easier than going from store to store. The price was similer but it saves gasoline and frustration.</li>
            <li> After only few weeks of taking the tabs my iron level has come back to normal, so my gastro doc said to stop it and get re-tested in 1-2 mos. with my GP.</li>
            <li> Ferrous gluconate is the most readily absorbed of all the various iron preparations. This generic product offers a great value for a superior product. If you need supplemental iron, this is the one to buy.</li>
            <li> Have used ferrous gluconate for several years. Find this brand to be similar in strength to a drugstore brand I had been taking and there is a cost advantage. Time will tell more about the effectiveness however.</li>
            <li> They actually made me ill</li>
            <li> This product is misrepresented online.&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised as 325 MG but the product that is shipped is 27 MG from 239 MG of elemental iron.</li>
            <li> I am a post duodenal switch patient and was required by physician to take ferrous gluconate (water soluble). Many pharmacies carry iron supplements but was never able to find the 325mg tabs. The price is unbeatable. They are easy to swallow but have a very faint metallic after taste. Not bothersome enough that will keep me from ordering again. Highly recommend.</li>
