            <li>The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  </li>
            <li>I have had this in my shower for about 9 months now and it still works perfectly.</li>

            <li>Stuck to the wall of my shower and they look great!</li>
            <li>the shampoo and body soap work perfectly, so will be experimenting with a thinner conditioner to see if this helps.  </li>

            <li>Functionally, this is a great unit.</li>

            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>It looks great, but it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>For a shower dispenser, this gets the job done and looks good.</li>
            <li>It looks good too.</li>
            <li>They look very pretty and the size it just perfect.  </li>
            <li>These work great and are easy to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>very nice looking &amp; extremely easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it has hooks to hold brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>Consequently they did not work effectively and I resorted to taking them off of the wall to pour the liquid out of them.</li>
            <li>but well made and nice looking,</li>
            <li>It is so nice not having bottle sitting around the tub/shower.</li>
            <li>Nice design, and looks/feels quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li>looks nice in our tile shower.</li>
            <li>The thing I liked about it was how it looked, and the fact that each dispenser could be removed separately to fill.  </li>
            <li>The pump looks great, mounts easily and when working dispenses the fluids easily.</li>
            <li>They dispence a good amount deliberately and cleanly with no drips.</li>
            <li>I love the look of these in my shower.</li>
            <li>Love them and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions</li>
            <li>My shower is so much more organized.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>The dispensers show the levels, something most bottles do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far quite happy.  </li>
            <li>They have worked great so far</li>
            <li>Seems easy to refill with it mounted on the wall</li>
            <li>/&gt;Installation was easy.  </li>
            <li>Installation was easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install, use and re-fill</li>
            <li>easy to install.</li>
            <li>They are easy to install and stay up.</li>
            <li>When this happens, I use the heel of my hand to strike the dispenser button authoritatively (very quickly and forcefully) a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo pumps out fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo itself since the conditioner and soap work fine.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy, easy to mount, buttons worl smoothly.</li>
            <li>I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  </li>
            <li>Just installed yesterday and it seems securely attached to the wall</li>
            <li>Although I can see the razor hooks being convenient for some people, they look cheap to me.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have been happy using them.</li>
            <li>I filled the containers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash.</li>
            <li>The unit is as attractive (or perhaps I should say unobtrusive) as one can expect for a product such as this.</li>
            <li>The dispenser was very easy to install and has worked very well.</li>
            <li>I originally order from Frontgate.</li>
            <li>The biggest thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have not been able to get the containers to pump consistently.  </li>
            <li>For the price of this pump, it should be user friendly.  </li>
            <li>so long ago - I have received good customer service from the company that sold this through Amazon and I now have a dispenser that is  working fine.  </li>
            <li>Love these and would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I love this dispenser so much.  </li>
            <li>But as it&#x27;s a shower dispenser, I would think shampoo should dispense :)  If I could get the shampoo, I would be much happier with this product.</li>
            <li>Other than this one flaw; however, this is one of the best purchases we have made for the new bathroom.</li>
            <li>If it is installed properly, primed properly, and if you remember this hint, it will work wonderfully for you.</li>
            <li>you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  </li>
            <li>That seems to unclog it, and then if you need more shampoo, you can press the dispenser button as normal.  </li>
            <li>As gorgeous as I think my new shower is with all the new hardware and marble and expanse of glass, the one thing that people consistently comment on is this shower dispenser.</li>
            <li>Great product, make for a clean shower stall and now longer using excessive amounts of skin and hair products</li>
            <li>how much we use, but like my clutter free shower.  </li>
            <li>This dispenser is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I loved my first one so much that I ordered a second one for my kids bathroom!  </li>
            <li>The labels are nice, but a tight fit when trying to align them into the slots provided.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this dispenser as it has removed some of the clutter from my shower.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this dispenser, I didn&#x27;t read the directions for how to prepare the pumps.</li>
            <li>It would be better if only the bottles showed after instalation.  </li>
            <li>It has to spots for razors and the three compartments are exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>These dispensers work exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>I have these in my guest bathroom and they look pretty sleek.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to knock one off if not careful.  </li>
            <li>The silicon adhesive smells really strong so open the windows, turn on the fart fan and close the door.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping accurated description</li>
            <li>By the way - I coudln&#x27;t believe how much cleaner the bathtub looked after clearing out all the bottles - very organized now.</li>
            <li>They think that is absolutely the coolest thing.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids using to much shampoo now.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The design, ease of filling, and not too much dispensed at once.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch of bottles on the shower floor.</li>
            <li>Very convenient way to rid clutter in shower.  </li>
            <li>I had to flush down water first to make sure its aerated.</li>
            <li>It seems odd that all three of the original pump/valve combos were faulty, and when I put the new ones in, I was able to prime the pumps easily and have had no problems other than a drip or two onto the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>My kids are 5,7 and 10 years old and if you let them to their own devices, they would use or spill half a bottle of shampoo each time they take a shower.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence to spend more money and get the simple human stainless steel 3 chamber dispenser.</li>
            <li>The chambers are much easier to remove and refill, the dispense function - with the push button- is much better than the Simple Human pull type function.</li>
            <li>I wish the pump gave you a bit more so less pumps were needed.</li>
            <li>This is a much better product than the Simple Human dispenser, which I returned 3 days after using it.</li>
            <li>I do wish a little more product was dispensed per pump.</li>
            <li>You MUST pump it several times before putting the liquid in first.  </li>
            <li>I got the unit in satin and in person I feel like it looks and feels a little cheap as every component is plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used that model at my work and it looks nicer and pumps loads of product in one pump action.</li>
            <li>I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>10 pumps are required to supply an adequate amount of shampoo for my hair, but at least I don&#x27;t have a bunch of bottles cluttering up my pretty shower.</li>
            <li>The install was pretty simple and it seems like its rock solid.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and was a bit concewrned that these were not good quality, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be a better product for the price.</li>
            <li>I like the new brushed nickel color.  </li>
            <li>What finally resolved the problem with the pumps was having the company send out 3 new pumps and valves.  </li>
            <li>It took for ever to get any of them to work at all following the directions as written, and two of the 3 stopped working very soon after I finally got them pumping as they should.  </li>

            <li> What finally resolved the problem with the pumps was having the company send out 3 new pumps and valves.  </li>
            <li> It took for ever to get any of them to work at all following the directions as written, and two of the 3 stopped working very soon after I finally got them pumping as they should.  </li>
            <li> I am giving the pump a 4 because of the potential to knock a chamber loose or off if not careful, and because though the new valves work well I have had a few issues with drips.  </li>
            <li> I end up buying a triple, then using the individual units to replace that one since it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a single unit.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions regarding how to prime the pumps, otherwise you will drive yourself crazy.</li>
            <li> It seems to deteriorate the mechanism such that when you try to push on it, it just gets jammed.</li>
            <li> Two minor issues; otherwise, they pump as expected and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> After working on it for weeks, I finally took it down and threw it away.</li>
            <li> It took a while to prime the pump on the conditioner, but I was expecting that from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into some of the details that other reviewers have covered so well,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little rough.</li>
            <li> It really beats the game of &amp;#34;drop the soap&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the dispenser tops are not held in place.  </li>

            <li> The hooks could be a little wider to accommodate the monster razors that they make for ladies these days.</li>
            <li> When I wipe them down, the tops usually come off and fall on the floor.</li>

            <li> $50+ for a dispenser seemed excessive</li>
            <li> I have a small shower and this helps control clutter</li>
            <li> I like that the dispensers are separately removable and hope that when one fails, I can order a single dispenser because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to get this off the wall.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner and body wash take  about 40-50 pumps, with hardly anything coming out.</li>
            <li> Let it set for at least 24 hours before loading it up with product.</li>
            <li> I am having issues with the conditioner as it is too thick and keeps clogging.  </li>
            <li> assuming i can sort out the thick conditioner clogging issue, i would recommend this product</li>

            <li> but I just wanted to pass on a hint if your dispenser tends to clog or doesn&#x27;t seem to work with thick shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the unit dispensing thick product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Functionally, this is a great unit. The hooks could be a little wider to accommodate the monster razors that they make for ladies these days. The labels are nice, but a tight fit when trying to align them into the slots provided. Two minor issues; otherwise, they pump as expected and don&#x27;t leak. Yay!</li>
            <li> I loved my first one so much that I ordered a second one for my kids bathroom!  Unfortunately one of the dispensers does not work and I had to order a replacement part (over 11$ including shipping)</li>
            <li> Picture &amp; decription of item is no what was received.  Received one unit with just dividers in the middle rather than the one shown.</li>
            <li> I have to pump each one about 8 times to get enough soap</li>
            <li> Nice that it has hooks to hold brushes, etc. But, difficult to prime and really didn&#x27;t dispense thick liquids! Avoid it! Popular amongst Amazon users, but don&#x27;t know why!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. I do wish a little more product was dispensed per pump. 10 pumps are required to supply an adequate amount of shampoo for my hair, but at least I don&#x27;t have a bunch of bottles cluttering up my pretty shower.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this dispenser as it has removed some of the clutter from my shower. The install was pretty simple and it seems like its rock solid. Could be a bad thing if I do need to remove the entire unit someday. I got the unit in satin and in person I feel like it looks and feels a little cheap as every component is plastic. I have no problems with it dispensing my soap, shampoo, and conditioner after priming all the pumps. Once working properly it takes me 5-6 pumps to get enough shampoo/conditioner. I wish the pump gave you a bit more so less pumps were needed. Seems easy to refill with it mounted on the wall and I like the fact that you can remove the individual units as I might want to run them through the dishwasher if they start getting gunked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence to spend more money and get the simple human stainless steel 3 chamber dispenser. I&#x27;ve used that model at my work and it looks nicer and pumps loads of product in one pump action. $50+ for a dispenser seemed excessive so I went with the Aviva. I guess we will see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> A beautifully simple way to equip your shower with 3 dispensers of soap, shampoo, body lotion or ?????.  It really beats the game of &amp;#34;drop the soap&amp;#34;! Simple to install and refill. It avoids handling bars of slippery soap, bottles of shampoo and after shower body lotion/oils.</li>
            <li> The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it&#x27;s a little rough.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping accurated description</li>
            <li> I love the look of these in my shower. The dispenser was very easy to install and has worked very well. I have had this in my shower for about 9 months now and it still works perfectly. Just a note... When I first purchased this dispenser, I didn&#x27;t read the directions for how to prepare the pumps. Consequently they did not work effectively and I resorted to taking them off of the wall to pour the liquid out of them. After contacting customer service they instructed me that you have to prepare the pumps when you put liquid in them so that they work correctly. Once I did this, they are perfect! I have very thick shampoo, conditioner and body wash in mine and they work perfectly. Love these and would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well-made product. The chambers are plastic, but so what? It looks great, holds all of our shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The conditioner is very thick and it still dispenses quite well. The price is unbeatable, as I tried several bath and home stores looking for a similar product and they were all $60+ for similar ones. A great but over all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a guest bedroom or the kids bathroom. Plastic but well made and nice looking,</li>
            <li> These work great and are easy to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34;. We didn&#x27;t even need to prime them. It is so nice not having bottle sitting around the tub/shower.</li>
            <li> Great product, make for a clean shower stall and now longer using excessive amounts of skin and hair products</li>
            <li> So far quite happy.  Just installed yesterday and it seems securely attached to the wall (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to need to use screws to keep it up).  Nice design, and looks/feels quite sturdy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the appearance of the rack the bottles attach to.  Although I can see the razor hooks being convenient for some people, they look cheap to me.  It would be better if only the bottles showed after instalation.  By the way - I coudln&#x27;t believe how much cleaner the bathtub looked after clearing out all the bottles - very organized now.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and when we remodeled our bathroom, we put this in. The middle section worked. The others didn&#x27;t. After working on it for weeks, I finally took it down and threw it away. I bought another one at Home Depot that works great.</li>
            <li> As gorgeous as I think my new shower is with all the new hardware and marble and expanse of glass, the one thing that people consistently comment on is this shower dispenser. They think that is absolutely the coolest thing. And it is. Except for one of the dispensers seems to have a faulty valve that allowed a very expensive bottle of shampoo to drip out overnight all over the shower floor. I hate to even complain in the review since this just happened and I have not had a chance yet to speak with the seller to have a replacement chamber sent to me. Other than this one flaw; however, this is one of the best purchases we have made for the new bathroom. It truly does give a spa feel to the room! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using these in a vacation rental property for years.  Shampoo and body wash work well but thicker conditioner, they tend to plug up so I  only use them for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read allot of reviews before purchasing this product. Installation was easy.  I was under the impression that there were metal pieces to them but it is all plastic. This does not seem to be an issue though. They have worked great so far and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my kids using to much shampoo now. Love them and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Second set I&#x27;ve purchased because they work so well.  I like the new brushed nickel color.  They dispence a good amount deliberately and cleanly with no drips.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I originally order from Frontgate. Overall I have been happy using them. I have a small shower and this helps control clutter</li>
            <li> Stuck to the wall of my shower and they look great! Make sure to follow the directions and I think the pumping mechanism will have no issues.I did not receive anything broken and they have been in use for awhile without any issues.</li>
            <li> My kids are 5,7 and 10 years old and if you let them to their own devices, they would use or spill half a bottle of shampoo each time they take a shower.  This makes their shower clutter and mess-free, not to mention saving on shampoo, conditioner and soap.  Easy to install, use and re-fill, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For a shower dispenser, this gets the job done and looks good. It has to spots for razors and the three compartments are exactly what we needed. The silicon adhesive smells really strong so open the windows, turn on the fart fan and close the door. Let it set for at least 24 hours before loading it up with product.</li>
            <li> These are the least expensive I could find.  They look very pretty and the size it just perfect.  You MUST pump it several times before putting the liquid in first.  I had to flush down water first to make sure its aerated.,. otherwise, your soap will not pump out</li>
            <li> works great. easy to install. looks nice in our tile shower. removable individual tubs make refill easier.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions regarding how to prime the pumps, otherwise you will drive yourself crazy.</li>
            <li> Pumps worked only about week and all 3 stopped. Would not even pump water. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very nice looking &amp; extremely easy to install.  I am having issues with the conditioner as it is too thick and keeps clogging.  the shampoo and body soap work perfectly, so will be experimenting with a thinner conditioner to see if this helps.  assuming i can sort out the thick conditioner clogging issue, i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a much better product than the Simple Human dispenser, which I returned 3 days after using it. The chambers are much easier to remove and refill, the dispense function - with the push button- is much better than the Simple Human pull type function.</li>
            <li> I read and followed all of the directions. I filled the containers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The shampoo pumps out fine. The conditioner and body wash take  about 40-50 pumps, with hardly anything coming out. It seems as if the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; consistency of the conditioner and body wash is too thick to come out.  Now I have this dispenser stuck to my wall, and my shampoo, conditioner and body wash bottles are back on the floor of the shower :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this dispenser in white, and it came in silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My shower is so much more organized. I bought two because my husband has different shampoo and conditioners. It took a while to prime the pump on the conditioner, but I was expecting that from other reviews.</li>
            <li> These dispensers work exactly as promised.  They are easy to install and stay up.</li>
            <li> I love this dispenser so much.  I won&#x27;t go into some of the details that other reviewers have covered so well, but I just wanted to pass on a hint if your dispenser tends to clog or doesn&#x27;t seem to work with thick shampoos.  When this happens, I use the heel of my hand to strike the dispenser button authoritatively (very quickly and forcefully) a couple of times.  That seems to unclog it, and then if you need more shampoo, you can press the dispenser button as normal.  This dispenser is totally worth the money.  If it is installed properly, primed properly, and if you remember this hint, it will work wonderfully for you.</li>
            <li> I like almost everything about this product.  The design, ease of filling, and not too much dispensed at once.  But the shampoo dispenser will not work.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the shampoo itself since the conditioner and soap work fine.  But as it&#x27;s a shower dispenser, I would think shampoo should dispense :)  If I could get the shampoo, I would be much happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Would have given no star as this thing stopped working less than a month. It looks great, but it didn&#x27;t work.  Stayed away from this product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product two or three times now, because I like the convenience of having hands-free dispensing in my shower. Overall it works well and we&#x27;ve had no problems with it it&#x27;s sticking to our tile walls. However I have to replace the unit that holds my conditioner every year or so because it makes the pump mechanism jam up. It isn&#x27;t a simple clog you can fix by cleaning it. It seems to deteriorate the mechanism such that when you try to push on it, it just gets jammed. I end up buying a triple, then using the individual units to replace that one since it&#x27;s cheaper than buying a single unit. If anyone has a solution for keeping the pump from jamming, I&#x27;m all ears.</li>
            <li> This is the third triple chamber shower dispenser I have used over the years.  The thing I liked about it was how it looked, and the fact that each dispenser could be removed separately to fill.  What I have found however, is that with the containers each being separate is that they seem to move about when I am trying to pump them.  It would be easy to knock one off if not careful.  The biggest thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have not been able to get the containers to pump consistently.  It took for ever to get any of them to work at all following the directions as written, and two of the 3 stopped working very soon after I finally got them pumping as they should.  Since the dispenser is hooked quite well to my wall - it is to my benefit to make this thing work.  For the price of this pump, it should be user friendly.  I would not recommend this for two reasons then, the instability of the individual chambers, and the difficulty with getting anything to come out when you I pump the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wrote this review oh so long ago - I have received good customer service from the company that sold this through Amazon and I now have a dispenser that is  working fine.  What finally resolved the problem with the pumps was having the company send out 3 new pumps and valves.  It seems odd that all three of the original pump/valve combos were faulty, and when I put the new ones in, I was able to prime the pumps easily and have had no problems other than a drip or two onto the shower floor.  I am giving the pump a 4 because of the potential to knock a chamber loose or off if not careful, and because though the new valves work well I have had a few issues with drips.  The pump looks great, mounts easily and when working dispenses the fluids easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 chamber product.  There was only 4 double sided adhesive tapes in the package as opposed to 6 for the 3 chamber product.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, easy to mount, buttons worl smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am satisfied with this product. I read all the reviews and was a bit concewrned that these were not good quality, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be a better product for the price. I understood the priming issue and the problems that people were having with the chrome finish.  I ordered the satin finish to mitigate for loss of finish and followed the directions to prime the pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a European glass shower, so everything inside can be seen. The unit is as attractive (or perhaps I should say unobtrusive) as one can expect for a product such as this. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the unit dispensing thick product.  I like that the dispensers are separately removable and hope that when one fails, I can order a single dispenser because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to get this off the wall.  The dispensers show the levels, something most bottles do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dispenser tops are not held in place.  They just sit on the dispenser. When I wipe them down, the tops usually come off and fall on the floor. However, the unit has eliminated the bottles and razors that were on the shower floor, so I think I can put up with some inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch of bottles on the shower floor. I have these in my guest bathroom and they look pretty sleek.</li>
            <li> Very convenient way to rid clutter in shower.  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference it how much we use, but like my clutter free shower.  It looks good too.</li>
