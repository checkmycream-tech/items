            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Do not hesitate to try it Very good gel, skin looks younger, clean, fresh.</li>
            <li>When it arrived Wednesday I was excited until I read the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I just got the shipment in today, I am excited and looking forward to use it day and night.</li>
            <li>Wow, my skin is looking even better now!</li>
            <li>I was excited about buying snail cream since I had read some good reviews about it online; however, I have used it several times and have seen no impact at all.</li>
            <li>That is by far the fastest service I have ever experienced so far.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, and well packed...</li>
            <li>my skin was more vibrant, fresher.</li>
            <li>courtesy of super wholesale .&lt;br</li>
            <li>With such great service I have high hopes in this product.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to live with them for the rest of my life since I&#x27;ve tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after I use this, feels so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>But I wish to know more information about if I can use other kind of facial creams with. :-)</li>
            <li>Useless..not even as good as other moisturizers I have used</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed my skin was firmer right away.</li>
            <li>It looked like an innocent enough gel.</li>
            <li>bought this not knowing exactly what it was but went by the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The price has more than doubled since I bought it three weeks ago from the same company.</li>
            <li>First, I was hesitant because of the name, it&#x27;s called Anti- aging snail cream</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this is NOT a cream, nor does it moisturize in any way shape or form.</li>
            <li>My pores and fine lines are the same as they were before using this product.</li>
            <li>have helped me as much as snail cream products.</li>
            <li>i ordered it because i had read so much about the benefits of SNAIL slime to benefit the skin....</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>but I am excited too for the simple fact that it says snail cream</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find any more information at other websites</li>
            <li>I will let you guys know later in a few weeks about a good result.</li>
            <li>I am receiving comments that my skin seems more &#x27;healthy&#x27; but I can&#x27;t honestly say if this is as a result of this gel or the other moisturizer I&#x27;m using, or the fact I&#x27;ve got a little sun lately.</li>
            <li>This product does not have a delightful scent but does not smell bad either.</li>
            <li>Didnt really feel or see a marked difference..</li>
            <li>if felt cool, it was soothing, and as long as I kept it away from my mouth, I was not grossed out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product last Sunday after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I AM A 50 YEAR OLD MAN AND HAVE BEEN USING THIS</li>
            <li>FOR OVER 10 YEARS, EVERY ONE THINKS I AM 35 YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I saw these results I had bruising on my arms from being in the hospital and all the I V medication and blood test after using the cream it has almost completely cleared up all these bruises</li>
            <li>have almost gone, also my skin is baby soft,.</li>
            <li>more point...a little goes a long way, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>However, this gel will do the following for you: It will slightly tighten your skin, it will apply smoothly; it will &#x27;feel&#x27; as though it&#x27;s doing something, and it will potentially help clear your blemishes.</li>
            <li>and you have to be careful with how much you use</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I AM A 50 YEAR OLD MAN AND HAVE BEEN USING THIS&lt;br /&gt;ANTI-AGING SNAIL CREAM (CREMA DE CARACOL) FOR OVER 10 YEARS, EVERY ONE THINKS I AM 35 YEARS OLD. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS PRODUCT REGENERATES MY SKIN DAILY, I HAVE NO WRINKLES, OR BLEMISHES ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY MOM, MY WIFE, SISTERS, AND FRIENDS HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS WITH AMAZING RESULTS. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY ONE OUT THERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JC</li>
            <li> I have not yet used this product yet but I am excited too for the simple fact that it says snail cream, Id hope that means it will tighten up my skin. As soon as I use it tonight I will come back to update you on how it works! I had to rush on and let everyone know I put this order in sometime on the 6th of June. I am not certain of the time but it had to have been afternoon through the evening. Today is the 8th and I found it on my doorstep already!!!! That is by far the fastest service I have ever experienced so far. The box, shipping labels, the product within the box fit perfectly together! With such great service I have high hopes in this product. Im coming up close on 28 and I notice loser skin which terrifies me. Will this be the answer? Im hoping so! Good luck all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (6/13/13)!!!! I LOVE this product! I can feel it tightening my facial skin immediately! It leaves my skin looking radiant! To be honest, I have also used this product on my breast area to tighten the skin, Ive had four kids in which Ive breast fed, and Ive already been able to see a difference there. It is a great product, I absolutely love! I recommend this product to any and everyone! Why not get a head start on keeping tight skin even if you don&#x27;t yet have a problem???? LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Hi everyone, I have acne-prone skin and If you do as well, you know how difficult it is to handle (especially if you&#x27;re a female because periods usually make you breakout). I used to pick at my pimples, and now I have these scars that shame me for it. I looked for all sorts of products to reduce the scars and no products have helped me as much as snail cream products. My scars have gone from bulging red marks to thin pink marks in 3 to 4 weeks. Now if that&#x27;s too long for you, you need to realize that skin rejuvenation does not happen under a night, or even a week. Sure people get faster results than others, but it&#x27;s a process, and it&#x27;s whether you keep up the routine or give up that decides it. Make sure you cleanse your skin before you put on the product, and when it absorbs, put on moisturizer. SNAIL CREAM ISN&#x27;T A MOISTURIZER. If you read that bottle, it tells you to moisturize after use.    Side note for people suffering from acne: Don&#x27;t use this and expect your whiteheads to disappear. This product is to help out with scars. If you have both active acne and scars, red marks, etc. Cleanse your skin with a product that has a low percentage of salicylic acid. Put this cream and wait for absorption. Apply moisturizer(I preferably use an oil free combination dry/oily skin by Neutrogena). Then use a pimple cream with benzoyl peroxide(I use epiduo-works wonders) and dab on the active areas only. You must exfoliate 1-2 a week in your routine. You have to work for these things.    Anyways this cream has worked wonders for me. The thing is.. it&#x27;s really expensive. I would recommend waiting until the product is on sale for lower than $20, cause it is a tiny bottle and you have to be careful with how much you use or it&#x27;s gone. Thank you for your time and good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard several great things about this product so I decided to try it. I am very happy with the results of this gel I can see how my face regenerates  it&#x27;s amazing. Do not hesitate to try it Very good gel, skin looks younger, clean, fresh. I love this product...</li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;ll try almost anything once, and when I heard about Snail Cream I decided I had nothing to lose. It came quickly, and well packed... of course out of morbid curiosity I had to open it immediately to see the mysterious goo. It looked like an innocent enough gel. It had a lovely clean scent. The question was, could I actually slather my face with the slime of a garden pest? I washed and dried my face, took a deep breath, and tried not to think about what it was... if felt cool, it was soothing, and as long as I kept it away from my mouth, I was not grossed out. But the proof was in the morning. Any inflammation I had on my skin had lessened, my pores were tighter, firmer... my skin was more vibrant, fresher. So I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for a few days - and I&#x27;m sold, everything about my skin has had some improvement already... so, Snail Cream on my face?? Yes! Heck yes!!!!!! I&#x27;m gonna need a bigger bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this cream.  I think I had anticipated something creamier and long lasting.  This is more like a gel.  It smells flowery.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks now.  Immediately after using it my skin feels wonderful.  I&#x27;m hoping that after prolonged use I&#x27;ll begin to see a bigger impact.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last Sunday after reading the positive reviews. I tried to find out what ALL the ingredients were but I couldn&#x27;t find any more information at other websites so I assumed what was mentioned was all there was.  When it arrived Wednesday I was excited until I read the list of ingredients.  They include triethanolamine, methylparaben, and propylparaben.  All of these chemicals are used in the cosmetic industry but they are NOT good for you.  I already know parabens are BAD so I searched the web for articles on all these and found triethanolamine is questionable too. Since I have the product I shall use but will NEVER buy it again.  The seller should list ALL the ingredients so consumers can make an informed decision as to whether they want to use a product with questionable ingredients. Remember, just because the FDA approves it doesn&#x27;t make it safe!  Also, it is a 1 ounce jar.</li>
            <li> Is good. But I wish to know more information about if I can use other kind of facial creams with. :-)</li>
            <li> I used Snailcream in the past when I bought it from the trip I went to Thailand. I got hooked in using Snail cream, it worked wonder. I did a lot search on the internet, I found Comandari with the highest review and most of them are 4 or 5 stars. I just got the shipment in today, I am excited and looking forward to use it day and night. I will let you guys know later in a few weeks about a good result.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a cream or lotion that did what this did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has age spots or bruising because her skin is very fragile and she used this and the bruising spots were gone in 48 hours it amazed me. She has tried everything even prescribed medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I saw these results I had bruising on my arms from being in the hospital and all the I V medication and blood test after using the cream it has almost completely cleared up all these bruises I can&#x27;t believe the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly amazing for this and it&#x27;s not even advertised for the removing of bruises</li>
            <li> Seems to work as described by others.&lt;br /&gt;Please keep this item in stock.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I put it on in the morning under my makeup and at night&lt;br /&gt;when I go to bed.  You feel it draw up you skin and it makes it so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this not knowing exactly what it was but went by the reviews.  I do&lt;br /&gt;not regret this purchase and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have only been using 4 days, already the brown sun spots that was on my face have almost gone, also my skin is baby soft,. every one already thinks I am years younger than my age of 80 yrs, Cant waite to see myself after a few months of use. Will review again when I have used awhile longer. I have tried plenty of face cream in my life, this is absolutely the best, you must try it to believe it!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see if there is a difference....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now. The first time I used it I noticed my skin was firmer right away. I was hoping for a reduction in wrinkles,  but it&#x27;s only been a week.  However, the blemishes I&#x27;ve been battling for the last 2 years are almost all gone!  I thought I&#x27;d have to live with them for the rest of my life since I&#x27;ve tried so many products.  I will be buying this again just for that reason alone!</li>
            <li> Was okay....nothing to write home about, im sorry to say.....they could make it better, maybe....i ordered it because i had read so much about the benefits of SNAIL slime to benefit the skin....Didnt really feel or see a marked difference..Thats not to say that some of the more EXPENSIVE snail cremes wont do the job..After all, i have a Latino friend that has been using a body lotion, from Walmart~YES!...that contains snail slime(its not really SLIME)for her crepey ,cottage cheese legs&lt;br /&gt;and arms for years, and she swears by it !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;M&amp;#62;P&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Useless..not even as good as other moisturizers I have used</li>
            <li> Seems to have a tightening effect. Nice for using around the eye area. Provides a bit of lift to the eyelids. Feels smooth after applying it. Not sure if it is repairing skin though. The price has more than doubled since I bought it three weeks ago from the same company. I paid $16.99 and it is now $39.99. That is too expensive for this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that this cream has become my favorite skin care product. I just love it. First, I was hesitant because of the name, it&#x27;s called Anti- aging snail cream but it&#x27;s very natural. I heard a lot of good things about snail cream as this was already popular in Korea. I use it twice a day, morning and night. I love how my skin feels after I use this, feels so soft and hydrated. I feel like my skin stopped aging ever since I started using this cream. Plus, I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this way. I got this for my mom and mother in law and sister, they all love it great as a gift to,Definitely getting more and recommend to everyone to use this! You&#x27;ll love it.  courtesy of super wholesale .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this is NOT a cream, nor does it moisturize in any way shape or form. If this is why you want to try it, don&#x27;t bother. However, this gel will do the following for you: It will slightly tighten your skin, it will apply smoothly; it will &#x27;feel&#x27; as though it&#x27;s doing something, and it will potentially help clear your blemishes. That being said, I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference. I&#x27;ve read that sunspots disappear...this I can&#x27;t see happening, on my face anyway. I am receiving comments that my skin seems more &#x27;healthy&#x27; but I can&#x27;t honestly say if this is as a result of this gel or the other moisturizer I&#x27;m using, or the fact I&#x27;ve got a little sun lately. Nevertheless, I will continue to use this until the pot I have runs out and see then if there&#x27;s been an obvious change...to me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;One more point...a little goes a long way, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I was excited about buying snail cream since I had read some good reviews about it online; however, I have used it several times and have seen no impact at all. My pores and fine lines are the same as they were before using this product. Also I think shipping fee of almost $12 is too high for this small lightweight item.</li>
            <li> I am using the cream but I don&#x27;t see any improvement yet.  Maybe I need to wait for a couple of months</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am 52 and had visibly noticible results almost instantly.  I will continue to use this product in the future. I particularly love this product for the aging skin on my neck. This product does not have a delightful scent but does not smell bad either.</li>
            <li> A friend of a friend told me about this product &amp; gave it a shot. The results are awesome in such a quick amount of time. Wow, my skin is looking even better now! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product. it feels good on my face.</li>
