            <li>These Color Club Hues are gorgeous - a nice complement set to the original pastel set.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most amazing set of polishes that I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>When you own as many polishes as I do</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own manicures for years, and I love these products.</li>
            <li>Amazing, amazing nail polish, it&#x27;s holographic but not a little, this is full rainbow holographic  nail polish, goes on perfect in 1 coat, lasted 1 week, but I wanted to repaint my nails.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorites are Kismet, Cosmic Fate, and Miss Bliss, but they are all beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are lovely, light polishes when the light isn&#x27;t on them, but when the light hits...POW!!!  </li>
            <li>So very happy a friend shared where she purchased a similar polish collection.</li>
            <li>Nubar is okay</li>
            <li>I like most of there</li>
            <li>Only one coat required - best holo polish I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>In love the colors are gorgeous and worth the money.</li>
            <li>but the 2 sets because want to have more options to choose ...</li>
            <li>Oh, and this may be a no-brainier to most, but don&#x27;t use matte topcoat on these or you *</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get as many colors that are pictured.</li>
            <li>I really like hologram polish and this brand is great.</li>
            <li>The new color covered those corner remnants beautifully, despite being lighter.  </li>
            <li>Love these nail colors because they change with the amount of light around you.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the cool holographic look!</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t require like 4 or more coats, and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Super sparkly!  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as advertised!</li>
            <li>I have to say these are my all time favorite polishes, they go on smoothly, dry quickly, and the holographic color shift is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles for arround $20 because of a buy 2 get 1 free deal)</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The holographic quality is very nice...not gaudy at all, and look so nice and subtle..ladylike.  </li>
            <li>The polishes are amazing and reflect light really well.  </li>
            <li>have tested each polish and they all stamp beautifully, even with intricate designs and my limited skill.</li>
            <li>First time I wished there were more girls in the office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>You can wear this even in a conservative work environment and be ok, but stand out because the colors are so pretty</li>
            <li>It covers completely in two coats, and has a nice, even finish.  </li>
            <li>This polish has a much thicker consistency than most holographics which makes it easier to use, I have used China Glaze</li>
            <li>As  others have said, the effect is strongest under sunlight, but even indoors they are pretty and will show that beautiful &amp;#34;liquid-rainbow&amp;#34; look as long as they are under any kind of direct lighting.</li>
            <li>The formula is wonderful, It&#x27;s thick, but not  tacky or sticky.</li>
            <li>One coat appears to be good enough.</li>
            <li>The effect is so gorgeous it is distracting, especially when I am driving!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I used these to do what is now my absolute favorite mani of all time.</li>
            <li>so I put on 2 coats and had full opacity.</li>
            <li>Everyone who sees these colors on me falls in love with them and wants to know where I got them.</li>
            <li>Without them its super shiny and does not chip.</li>
            <li>Very pretty,</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>This holo effect is very pretty, it resembles a rainbow right at your fingertips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regardless, I feel it was absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li>In the picture there were six distinct colors</li>
            <li>I might buy the other holographic collection later because I was impressed at how this worked.</li>
            <li>First the seller shipped quick.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>When the sun catches the colors just right, it shines with every holographic being.</li>
            <li>As soon as the light (sunlight in particular) hits your nails</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are very pretty and different than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>drys fasts and doesn&#x27;t chip very fast</li>
            <li>They dry quickly, even without a top coat.</li>
            <li>BE AWARE THAT THESE COLORS LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re even looking at it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>And then I did dishes with no gloves in screaming hot water.  </li>
            <li>I love Color Club, ESPECIALLY the halo hues.</li>
            <li>I purchased this collection way back in March but forgot to write a review, which is baffling to me because I LOVE these polishes.</li>
            <li>formula is fantastic, self leveling and with complete coverage in 2 coats.</li>
            <li>Out of the twelve, there are four that are pretty similar, mostly the lightest silvery ones, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Inside, though, they&#x27;re just shiny pretty colors.</li>
            <li>These polishes are a WOW and more WOW!  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t use it to stamp, I have also used a few other products, that claim to be &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; but they are more like 2 tone or a glitter, like Klean Color (I love there holographic polish but its just super fine glitter and doesn&#x27;t have the same look as a TRUE holographic and its a pain to remove it.)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE every single one of these.</li>
            <li>The previous color was easily removed with a mild acetone remover.  </li>
            <li>I bought this really hoping it could be used to stamp my nails</li>
            <li>Just wish the colors weren&#x27;t so much alike.</li>
            <li>(I know, very ladylike.  </li>
            <li>Very holographic.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish and get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really see a difference in the color.</li>
            <li>Any feedback is appreciated.  </li>
            <li>It is true as some people say that some of the colors look almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li>just have to say, I&#x27;m VERY glad my boss wasn&#x27;t around today, because I got VERY little work done, thanks to my new nail polish!  </li>
            <li>I were to even attempt to explain what the polish looks like on the nail I would say there is the primary/basic color of the polish (the primary/basic color for Blue Heaven is blue) which in itself doesn&#x27;t look like a smooth canvas of color, it looks like a cluster of very fine, shiny particles that collectively create the shade of the basic color, and within that primary color you can see a rainbow effect of different colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>normal or low lighting they are pretty, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t take my eyes off them when the sun is shining on them!&lt;br /&gt;There is a VERY subtle difference between 978 Halo-graphic (More Pinkish) and 977 Cloud Nine (more lavender-ish).  </li>
            <li>For example, Klean Kolor has a holo set and while the colors are very pretty when layered over other shades, they don&#x27;t really have a true holo effect.  </li>
            <li>Color is very deep &amp; rich.</li>
            <li>The different color hues that shine through these are fun to look at!  </li>
            <li>so you need several coats, but it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li>Other than that I am satisfied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that some of the colors do look similar, but there is still quite a bit of variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh the main reason why I didn&#x27;t buy that one was price and shipping.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set highly.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>Even just a normal paint job with these gets me tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>I have held them in different lighting  - including natural light - but they are both the exact same color.  </li>
            <li>These 6 colors are lovely, however not as highly pigmented as the other colors in this same collection.</li>
            <li>Whatever you do don&#x27;t look at these while driving, can be very dangerous LOL!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have read that using a top coat over these polishes will dull the holographic effect</li>
            <li>Cheribuc is the most puzzling for me, kind of a light brown/copper/bronze base which is a little more prounounced in dull lighting after 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One coat  is all you need for complete opaque coverage.</li>
            <li>- just wow.  </li>
            <li>completely* lose the holo effect.</li>
            <li>My set has 2 pinks - each with a different color name on the bottom - but they are absolutely identical.  </li>
            <li>I got one mani to last two solid weeks without chipping or peeling (Seche Vite helped, but I use that on most manis and they don&#x27;t all last so long).</li>
            <li>At first glance, It looked like I only got 3 different colors.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is I think I received a duplicate of the light and dark pinks.  </li>
            <li>No base coat no top coat needed.</li>
            <li>But after applying them then looking at my nails in dull office lighting, I can easily see the difference.  </li>
            <li>The colors pretty much all look the same except for the pink hue and even that one almost looks the same.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the colors look way too similar, but I bought the collection for stamping, if I was going to use it more often for painting my nails I would have gone with the darker collection</li>
            <li>wanted to use a different color, hence my trying to abuse the old color off.  </li>
            <li>( I actually have the other 6 colors coming tomorrow too, haha!)</li>
            <li>rainbow effect appears to have a long flame shape or a long \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape, the lighting you are in and the way you move your fingers can cause the colors to look like a different color (red goes into orange which goes into yellow which goes into green that goes into blue) and as you move your nail light hits that new angle of your nail and picks up or exposes the rainbow effect of color in that particular area giving the illusion that the colors are moving across your nail.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>In the office, the effect is very timid, but outside, HOLY COW!  </li>
            <li>goes on fine, I saw the holo effect even with 1 thin coat</li>
            <li>re-stroke a few areas because they were more see through than other areas of my nail, this may or may not be due to me applying such thin and light coats of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The holographic quality is very nice...not gaudy at all, and look so nice and subtle..ladylike.  </li>
            <li> The polishes are amazing and reflect light really well.  </li>
            <li> have tested each polish and they all stamp beautifully, even with intricate designs and my limited skill.</li>
            <li> First time I wished there were more girls in the office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> You can wear this even in a conservative work environment and be ok, but stand out because the colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> It covers completely in two coats, and has a nice, even finish.  </li>
            <li> This polish has a much thicker consistency than most holographics which makes it easier to use, I have used China Glaze</li>
            <li> As  others have said, the effect is strongest under sunlight, but even indoors they are pretty and will show that beautiful &amp;#34;liquid-rainbow&amp;#34; look as long as they are under any kind of direct lighting.</li>
            <li> The formula is wonderful, It&#x27;s thick, but not  tacky or sticky.</li>
            <li> One coat appears to be good enough.</li>
            <li> The effect is so gorgeous it is distracting, especially when I am driving!&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I used these to do what is now my absolute favorite mani of all time.</li>
            <li> so I put on 2 coats and had full opacity.</li>
            <li> Everyone who sees these colors on me falls in love with them and wants to know where I got them.</li>
            <li> Without them its super shiny and does not chip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty,</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> This holo effect is very pretty, it resembles a rainbow right at your fingertips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless, I feel it was absolutely worth the money</li>
            <li> In the picture there were six distinct colors</li>
            <li> I might buy the other holographic collection later because I was impressed at how this worked.</li>
            <li> First the seller shipped quick.  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> When the sun catches the colors just right, it shines with every holographic being.</li>
            <li> As soon as the light (sunlight in particular) hits your nails</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are very pretty and different than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> drys fasts and doesn&#x27;t chip very fast</li>
            <li> They dry quickly, even without a top coat.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE THAT THESE COLORS LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re even looking at it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> And then I did dishes with no gloves in screaming hot water.  </li>
            <li> I love Color Club, ESPECIALLY the halo hues.</li>
            <li> I purchased this collection way back in March but forgot to write a review, which is baffling to me because I LOVE these polishes.</li>
            <li> formula is fantastic, self leveling and with complete coverage in 2 coats.</li>
            <li> Out of the twelve, there are four that are pretty similar, mostly the lightest silvery ones, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Inside, though, they&#x27;re just shiny pretty colors.</li>
            <li> These polishes are a WOW and more WOW!  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t use it to stamp, I have also used a few other products, that claim to be &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; but they are more like 2 tone or a glitter, like Klean Color (I love there holographic polish but its just super fine glitter and doesn&#x27;t have the same look as a TRUE holographic and its a pain to remove it.)</li>
            <li> and I LOVE every single one of these.</li>
            <li> The previous color was easily removed with a mild acetone remover.  </li>
            <li> I bought this really hoping it could be used to stamp my nails</li>
            <li> Just wish the colors weren&#x27;t so much alike.</li>
            <li> (I know, very ladylike.  </li>
            <li> Very holographic.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish and get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really see a difference in the color.</li>
            <li> Any feedback is appreciated.  </li>
            <li> It is true as some people say that some of the colors look almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li> just have to say, I&#x27;m VERY glad my boss wasn&#x27;t around today, because I got VERY little work done, thanks to my new nail polish!  </li>
            <li> I were to even attempt to explain what the polish looks like on the nail I would say there is the primary/basic color of the polish (the primary/basic color for Blue Heaven is blue) which in itself doesn&#x27;t look like a smooth canvas of color, it looks like a cluster of very fine, shiny particles that collectively create the shade of the basic color, and within that primary color you can see a rainbow effect of different colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> normal or low lighting they are pretty, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t take my eyes off them when the sun is shining on them!&lt;br /&gt;There is a VERY subtle difference between 978 Halo-graphic (More Pinkish) and 977 Cloud Nine (more lavender-ish).  </li>
            <li> For example, Klean Kolor has a holo set and while the colors are very pretty when layered over other shades, they don&#x27;t really have a true holo effect.  </li>
            <li> Color is very deep &amp; rich.</li>
            <li> The different color hues that shine through these are fun to look at!  </li>
            <li> so you need several coats, but it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li> Other than that I am satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that some of the colors do look similar, but there is still quite a bit of variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh the main reason why I didn&#x27;t buy that one was price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set highly.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Even just a normal paint job with these gets me tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> I have held them in different lighting  - including natural light - but they are both the exact same color.  </li>
            <li> These 6 colors are lovely, however not as highly pigmented as the other colors in this same collection.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do don&#x27;t look at these while driving, can be very dangerous LOL!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have read that using a top coat over these polishes will dull the holographic effect</li>
            <li> Cheribuc is the most puzzling for me, kind of a light brown/copper/bronze base which is a little more prounounced in dull lighting after 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One coat  is all you need for complete opaque coverage.</li>
            <li> - just wow.  </li>
            <li> completely* lose the holo effect.</li>
            <li> My set has 2 pinks - each with a different color name on the bottom - but they are absolutely identical.  </li>
            <li> I got one mani to last two solid weeks without chipping or peeling (Seche Vite helped, but I use that on most manis and they don&#x27;t all last so long).</li>
            <li> At first glance, It looked like I only got 3 different colors.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is I think I received a duplicate of the light and dark pinks.  </li>
            <li> No base coat no top coat needed.</li>
            <li> But after applying them then looking at my nails in dull office lighting, I can easily see the difference.  </li>
            <li> The colors pretty much all look the same except for the pink hue and even that one almost looks the same.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the colors look way too similar, but I bought the collection for stamping, if I was going to use it more often for painting my nails I would have gone with the darker collection</li>
            <li> wanted to use a different color, hence my trying to abuse the old color off.  </li>
            <li> ( I actually have the other 6 colors coming tomorrow too, haha!)</li>
            <li> rainbow effect appears to have a long flame shape or a long \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape, the lighting you are in and the way you move your fingers can cause the colors to look like a different color (red goes into orange which goes into yellow which goes into green that goes into blue) and as you move your nail light hits that new angle of your nail and picks up or exposes the rainbow effect of color in that particular area giving the illusion that the colors are moving across your nail.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> In the office, the effect is very timid, but outside, HOLY COW!  </li>
            <li> goes on fine, I saw the holo effect even with 1 thin coat</li>
            <li> re-stroke a few areas because they were more see through than other areas of my nail, this may or may not be due to me applying such thin and light coats of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> the first one came off, and made a big gloopy mess, and it was super expensive</li>
            <li> The picture looked like a wide range of shades but blue heaven,angel kiss,and harp on it are all blue &amp; almost the same shade of blue.  </li>
            <li> However, I am only giving 4 stars because there is supposed to be 2 different colors in the pink tone - Halo graphic and Cloud 9.  </li>
            <li> So far, the lilac color (Cloud Nine) wears less durable than the brighter purple (Eternal Beauty).</li>
            <li> And they really stay put with very little chipping compared to other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands holo polishes and none of them compare to the Color Club holos.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing I can say about them other than I can&#x27;t stop looking at them when I wear them!!!!!</li>
            <li> You know how there are some things that can make an otherwise good polish a little annoying to use?  </li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that the colors are not the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> The shades halo-graphic, cloud nine &amp; cherubic are all pink nudes.</li>
            <li> Be careful driving with these colors on</li>
            <li> You can get 6 bottles of this for what you would spend on 2 of other</li>
            <li> There are a few that are a bit close in color: you have to look closely at the silver, blue and teal to see the difference in some lights, and the green isn&#x27;t very green, it has a lot of blue in it</li>
            <li> but I wanted something that would show up well on dark colors for stamping.</li>
            <li> Its thick enough to stamp with, and if you use it as polish (I tested it out on a few nails as an accent)</li>
            <li> I could have just bought one bottle for much less</li>
            <li> It dries smooth and doesn&#x27;t get those annoying little bubbles.  </li>
            <li> they have neat stuff, but there holographic is thin takes multiple coats</li>
            <li> literally just got the package a few minutes ago and swatched one color on one of my nails.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone that loves a little nail shine!</li>
            <li> All of this is with no top</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears hard.  </li>
            <li> (in recent years there last few holographic collections have been awful</li>
            <li> Since I bought them, I have worn every color at least twice.</li>
            <li> It took sticking my nails in my teeth to get a small corner of lift!  </li>
            <li> It is a silver base while 981 Angel Kiss is a green base and 979 Blue Heaven is, well, blue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other holo polishes before and have usually been disappointed..</li>
            <li> I bought the the twelve piece set of these quite some time ago, O.K over a year ago, sorry for the late review</li>
            <li> I have well over 200 bottles of nail polish, addicted?</li>
            <li> (But it&#x27;s my super-original secret, sorry.)</li>
            <li> Eye-catching, and classy without being boring.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a thing wrong with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think a bit too expensive.  </li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the colors - not like that shown.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing. Lighter colors in this set and so beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love these polishes, and not a day goes by without someone commenting to me about how they LOVE my nail polish!</li>
            <li> Super sparkly!  It covers completely in two coats, and has a nice, even finish.  I am obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE THAT THESE COLORS LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE&lt;br /&gt;As others have commented, a lot of these colors are basically the same color and they pass it off as different colors by having different names. But they are the same color. The picture makes it seem like they are all vastly different but they aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful colors, but not as advertised.</li>
            <li> So very happy a friend shared where she purchased a similar polish collection.</li>
            <li> This polish has a much thicker consistency than most holographics which makes it easier to use, I have used China Glaze (in recent years there last few holographic collections have been awful especially this spring&#x27;s collection when you put on the second coat the first one came off, and made a big gloopy mess, and it was super expensive I bought 3 bottles for arround $20 because of a buy 2 get 1 free deal) Nubar is okay I like most of there polish they have neat stuff, but there holographic is thin takes multiple coats and you can&#x27;t use it to stamp, I have also used a few other products, that claim to be &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; but they are more like 2 tone or a glitter, like Klean Color (I love there holographic polish but its just super fine glitter and doesn&#x27;t have the same look as a TRUE holographic and its a pain to remove it.) And I haven&#x27;t used Layla to compare the products but pricewise this is cheaper. And its a lot easier to find/buy/ship than some brands, like Nfu.Oh the main reason why I didn&#x27;t buy that one was price and shipping. I bought this really hoping it could be used to stamp my nails, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Its thick enough to stamp with, and if you use it as polish (I tested it out on a few nails as an accent) it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t require like 4 or more coats, and dries fairly quickly. My only complaint is that the colors look way too similar, but I bought the collection for stamping, if I was going to use it more often for painting my nails I would have gone with the darker collection but I wanted something that would show up well on dark colors for stamping. I might buy the other holographic collection later because I was impressed at how this worked.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing set of polishes that I&#x27;ve ever seen.They are beautiful both in the bottle and most importantly on my nails. It&#x27;s true that some of the colors do look similar, but there is still quite a bit of variety.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve purchased other holo polishes before and have usually been disappointed.. For example, Klean Kolor has a holo set and while the colors are very pretty when layered over other shades, they don&#x27;t really have a true holo effect.  However, Color Club&#x27;s holos are second to none! They have the strongest and prettiest holographic effect I&#x27;ve seen on any polish so far.&lt;br /&gt; As  others have said, the effect is strongest under sunlight, but even indoors they are pretty and will show that beautiful &amp;#34;liquid-rainbow&amp;#34; look as long as they are under any kind of direct lighting. The formula is wonderful, It&#x27;s thick, but not  tacky or sticky. One coat  is all you need for complete opaque coverage. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The colors are incredible !!  And they really stay put with very little chipping compared to other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> First the seller shipped quick.  My problem was that the 6 colors look like just 2.  The picture looked like a wide range of shades but blue heaven,angel kiss,and harp on it are all blue &amp; almost the same shade of blue.  The shades halo-graphic, cloud nine &amp; cherubic are all pink nudes. I went on the picture for the range of colors, look like 6 different shades but somehow I got just 2. No return with this seller will not buy from again. Looks like I got the  3 of2nd and  3 of 4th of the line up.</li>
            <li> Love this so much the Halo effect is awesome. In the sun I can&#x27;t stop looking at it.  Just wish the colors weren&#x27;t so much alike.</li>
            <li> Color is very deep &amp; rich. Only one coat required - best holo polish I&#x27;ve seen. Great for stamping too!</li>
            <li> At first glance, It looked like I only got 3 different colors.  But after applying them then looking at my nails in dull office lighting, I can easily see the difference.  I can&#x27;t stop looking at them!!  In the office, the effect is very timid, but outside, HOLY COW!  Be careful driving with these colors on, I can&#x27;t take my eyes off them when the sun is shining on them!&lt;br /&gt;There is a VERY subtle difference between 978 Halo-graphic (More Pinkish) and 977 Cloud Nine (more lavender-ish).  976 Harp On It is a silver base while 981 Angel Kiss is a green base and 979 Blue Heaven is, well, blue.  980 Cheribuc is the most puzzling for me, kind of a light brown/copper/bronze base which is a little more prounounced in dull lighting after 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;I just have to say, I&#x27;m VERY glad my boss wasn&#x27;t around today, because I got VERY little work done, thanks to my new nail polish!  I&#x27;ve painted all the girls&#x27; nails in the office and tried talking the guys into getting theirs done too, but none would go for it!  First time I wished there were more girls in the office!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! Gotta run, my supervisor is here from the district office, gonna see if he&#x27;ll let me paint HIS nails!</li>
            <li> No base coat no top coat needed. Do not use them. Without them its super shiny and does not chip. In love the colors are gorgeous and worth the money. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Nice colors yes but I get this set and the Halo Hues set too ... well they look like the same colors&lt;br /&gt;and is different from they show here on the picture the colors are pastel and look almost like duplicates&lt;br /&gt;I but the 2 sets because want to have more options to choose ...</li>
            <li> I loved all these polishes, I thought it was a really good deal as well. This polish looks AMAZING in the sun. Very very nice quality polish. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GORG!!!!!  They are lovely, light polishes when the light isn&#x27;t on them, but when the light hits...POW!!!  I would recommend these to anyone that loves a little nail shine!</li>
            <li> What are the colors included?</li>
            <li> You know how there are some things that can make an otherwise good polish a little annoying to use?  This polish has none of these issues.  I can&#x27;t find a thing wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You already know it&#x27;s gorgeous.  That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re even looking at it in the first place.  Wait until you see it in the sun.  Or under fluorescent lighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete coverage only takes 2 coats, no matter the color.  It dries pretty quickly.  It dries smooth and doesn&#x27;t get those annoying little bubbles.  I was skritching the cat within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears hard.  I painted my nails on Saturday night.  On Sunday I did chores and later went out for greasy burgers.  On Monday I went to work, and then lifted weights at the gym.  And then I did dishes with no gloves in screaming hot water.  And then I picked some meat out of my teeth.  It took sticking my nails in my teeth to get a small corner of lift!  (I know, very ladylike.  It was good meat.)  All of this is with no top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use a different color, hence my trying to abuse the old color off.  The previous color was easily removed with a mild acetone remover.  The new color covered those corner remnants beautifully, despite being lighter.  And an hour after putting it on, I&#x27;m typing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s HOLO.  And affordable holo!  You can get 6 bottles of this for what you would spend on 2 of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color Club - just wow.  It&#x27;s SO GOOD.  BRB, adding all Color Club ever to my wishlist.</li>
            <li> These Color Club Hues are gorgeous - a nice complement set to the original pastel set.  Color Club does a great job with superior holographic polishes. I would recommend this set highly.  I am a licensed nail tech.</li>
            <li> I love Color Club, ESPECIALLY the halo hues. Excellent, full coverage, beautiful holographic. These 6 colors are lovely, however not as highly pigmented as the other colors in this same collection.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS,  These colors look as good on your nails as it appears in the bottles!  Maybe even better!  100% satisfied with these colors!!!</li>
            <li> Love these nail colors because they change with the amount of light around you.</li>
            <li> Color Club Hues colection are great holohgraphic polishes! They are opaque after 2 coats. The linear holographic is beautiful. I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the colors - not like that shown.  Ending up giving away.  I will be sticking with Zoya from now on!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy! If you&#x27;re building your polish collection you must have one or all of color club&#x27;s holographic polishes.</li>
            <li> These were recommended by a friend and they don&#x27;t disappoint!  The different color hues that shine through these are fun to look at!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is beautiful, beautiful polish. Very holographic. Shipped very quickly. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> So Beautiful! literally just got the package a few minutes ago and swatched one color on one of my nails. I really cant believe how awesomely holographic it is. It looks best in the sun or flash photography (yes I already took a pic). One coat appears to be good enough. It is true as some people say that some of the colors look almost exactly the same. If you&#x27;re trying to be thrifty, just buy one. Or two very different colors. Of this group of 6 the ones that look similar are as follows: Blue Heaven and Angel Kiss are both blue-ish, Cherub and Harp On-it are both like silvery/gold-ish, and Cloud Nine and Halo-graphic are rosey pink-ish. My photo shows these pairings so you can compare. Fyi, the actual bottles / labels obviously look different from the amazon photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone I know likes it enough I can always give them one of my 6. ( I actually have the other 6 colors coming tomorrow too, haha!) The only one I wont have is the Garnet color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this collection way back in March but forgot to write a review, which is baffling to me because I LOVE these polishes. Since I bought them, I have worn every color at least twice. When you own as many polishes as I do that is quite the compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In normal or low lighting they are pretty, but nothing special. As soon as the light (sunlight in particular) hits your nails an entire glittery, shimmery rainbow appears and dazzles around with every movement of your fingers. The effect is so gorgeous it is distracting, especially when I am driving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is fantastic, self leveling and with complete coverage in 2 coats. They dry quickly, even without a top coat. I have read that using a top coat over these polishes will dull the holographic effect but I sometimes use one out of habit and don&#x27;t notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested each polish and they all stamp beautifully, even with intricate designs and my limited skill.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy. Opaque in two coats. No bubbles. I got one mani to last two solid weeks without chipping or peeling (Seche Vite helped, but I use that on most manis and they don&#x27;t all last so long). Absolutely beautiful holo colors. There are a few that are a bit close in color: you have to look closely at the silver, blue and teal to see the difference in some lights, and the green isn&#x27;t very green, it has a lot of blue in it so I&#x27;m calling it teal. Regardless, I feel it was absolutely worth the money and I LOVE every single one of these. In fact, I used these to do what is now my absolute favorite mani of all time. (But it&#x27;s my super-original secret, sorry.) Even just a normal paint job with these gets me tons of compliments. Oh, and this may be a no-brainier to most, but don&#x27;t use matte topcoat on these or you *completely* lose the holo effect. Eye-catching, and classy without being boring. Lovelovelove.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing I can say about them other than I can&#x27;t stop looking at them when I wear them!!!!!</li>
            <li> This holo effect is very pretty, it resembles a rainbow right at your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;If I were to even attempt to explain what the polish looks like on the nail I would say there is the primary/basic color of the polish (the primary/basic color for Blue Heaven is blue) which in itself doesn&#x27;t look like a smooth canvas of color, it looks like a cluster of very fine, shiny particles that collectively create the shade of the basic color, and within that primary color you can see a rainbow effect of different colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;The rainbow effect appears to have a long flame shape or a long \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape, the lighting you are in and the way you move your fingers can cause the colors to look like a different color (red goes into orange which goes into yellow which goes into green that goes into blue) and as you move your nail light hits that new angle of your nail and picks up or exposes the rainbow effect of color in that particular area giving the illusion that the colors are moving across your nail.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on fine, I saw the holo effect even with 1 thin coat but I saw visible nail line so I put on 2 coats and had full opacity. I also noticed that while putting on the 1st coat I had to go back and re-stroke a few areas because they were more see through than other areas of my nail, this may or may not be due to me applying such thin and light coats of the polish.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that some of the colors look alike.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL in the light. goes on smooth. don&#x27;t need a lot of coats. drys fasts and doesn&#x27;t chip very fast</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own manicures for years, and I love these products. These are extremely beautiful colors! They are quite opaque so you need several coats, but it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li> I am in total awe with this set. When the sun catches the colors just right, it shines with every holographic being. My friends were so impressed and in love with the colors that they themselves purchased the color(s) they were most impressed by. Best purchase ever!!</li>
            <li> beautiful holos. I tried a lot of them, and for me, they are the best ones : great colors and great effects. whatever the color you wear, even without sun, they are gorgeous</li>
            <li> Very pretty, but I think a bit too expensive.  They are gorgeous, and I would buy them again for sure.  Just wish they were not so pricey. The holographic quality is very nice...not gaudy at all, and look so nice and subtle..ladylike.  You can wear this even in a conservative work environment and be ok, but stand out because the colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> The polishes are amazing and reflect light really well.  My only problem is I think I received a duplicate of the light and dark pinks.  Not that big of deal but I didn&#x27;t get as many colors that are pictured.</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing nail polish, it&#x27;s holographic but not a little, this is full rainbow holographic  nail polish, goes on perfect in 1 coat, lasted 1 week, but I wanted to repaint my nails.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that the colors are not the same as the picture. The colors pretty much all look the same except for the pink hue and even that one almost looks the same. In the picture there were six distinct colors and I do not see that at all. Other than that I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I really like this polish and get tons of compliments. However, mine all look like the same color. The bottles have different names on the but you can&#x27;t really see a difference in the color. I could have just bought one bottle for much less</li>
            <li> I bought the the twelve piece set of these quite some time ago, O.K over a year ago, sorry for the late review LOL. I have well over 200 bottles of nail polish, addicted? Not me LOL. I have to say these are my all time favorite polishes, they go on smoothly, dry quickly, and the holographic color shift is beautiful. I have tried several other brands holo polishes and none of them compare to the Color Club holos. Every time I wear these I get a lot of compliments and people grabbing my hands. Out of the twelve, there are four that are pretty similar, mostly the lightest silvery ones, but I don&#x27;t mind. My absolute favorites are Kismet, Cosmic Fate, and Miss Bliss, but they are all beautiful. Whatever you do don&#x27;t look at these while driving, can be very dangerous LOL!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these colors, and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out!  However, I am only giving 4 stars because there is supposed to be 2 different colors in the pink tone - Halo graphic and Cloud 9.  My set has 2 pinks - each with a different color name on the bottom - but they are absolutely identical.  I have held them in different lighting  - including natural light - but they are both the exact same color.  Has anyone else had this issue, or can someone tell me if the pinks you received were noticeably different colors?  Any feedback is appreciated.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish investment ever made.</li>
            <li> These polishes are a WOW and more WOW!  There isn&#x27;t a color in here I don&#x27;t like.  These colors are like molten metal with a gorgeous foil look.  If you&#x27;re a nail polish NUT (like me!), please don&#x27;t pass these up.</li>
            <li> Pretty! So far, the lilac color (Cloud Nine) wears less durable than the brighter purple (Eternal Beauty). The bronze color is great, though. Each captures the sunlight and reflects and creates a dazzling rainbow. Inside, though, they&#x27;re just shiny pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Everyone who sees these colors on me falls in love with them and wants to know where I got them.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are very pretty and different than most I&#x27;ve tried. They are holographic &amp; become more so in the sunlight! I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the cool holographic look!</li>
            <li> One of the best holographic polishes I&#x27;ve tried! Always receive compliments on them when I wear any of the colors.</li>
            <li> I really like hologram polish and this brand is great. Good price and fast shipping</li>
