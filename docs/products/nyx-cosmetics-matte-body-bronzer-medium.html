            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>but this bronzer is so beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>Best bronzer out there</li>
            <li>so you have a flawless fade from your foundation color, to your bronzer color, to the color of your neck</li>
            <li>Great color!</li>
            <li>so this was the perfect bronzer for winter</li>
            <li>So exquisite and love the matte finish!</li>
            <li>great pigmentation.</li>
            <li>it looks great.</li>
            <li>and it will look great.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, the quality is good, and the price even better.</li>
            <li>I keep replacing it and using it which is a good sign</li>
            <li>I decided to test out the product after hearing good things about it.</li>
            <li>love this bronzer!</li>
            <li>Color payoff is nice.</li>
            <li>Its very pigmented and great for contouring!!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t over do it cause this can turn you into a overly toasted bread. :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this bronzer.</li>
            <li>It has more orange than I like.</li>
            <li>we all know when winter kicks in, your skin looses color (pigmentation) and you have to go to a tanning salon, or sprays 9that may turn you yellow) or go with good old fashion bronzers, so this is perfect for my skin tone, if you apply very light portions you will get a nice color......</li>
            <li>Staying power is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I suggest trying this, as medium can be applied lightly for very light skin and more liberally for medium tones.</li>
            <li>Most bronzer&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve bought (even though I have a fairly light skin tone)</li>
            <li>9.5 grams of product not bad at all!</li>
            <li>end up looking nice when I first apply it, but eventually fade.</li>
            <li>Came on time, perfect little bronzer.</li>
            <li>I will say that it can appear a bit orange (not overly orange), but also has a nice &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; undertone that gives for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>My only problem with this bronzer is that the product tends to fly everywhere even when I just touch my brush to the bronzer.</li>
            <li>cheap bc</li>
            <li>Stop right there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very good product to have as an everyday makeup wear</li>
            <li>This is HIGHLY PIGMENTED, so go easy with applying!</li>
            <li>This is a great matte bronzer (shimmer - other than micro-shimmer - is out!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and try.</li>
            <li>Pretty matte color bronzer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty on.</li>
            <li>Love this for contouring and it&#x27;s very big.</li>
            <li>I love the big mirror inside.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer very much.</li>
            <li>This bronzer has lasted me through a whole hot summer day without fading at all.</li>
            <li>So while the product itself is great (extremely pigmented and long-lasting), I would beware if your complexion is similar to mine.</li>
            <li>Hard to find a good matte bronzer for this price.</li>
            <li>NYX really produces high quality products with a lower price tag than the higher end designer brands (never buy Chanel makeup, go for Tom Ford/Bobby Brown/Nars/etc.</li>
            <li>blends very well</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really interfere with the quality of the product for me</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be very helpful....</li>
            <li>I would compare it to the tarte park ave princesses the only reason I give it 4 starts because it just shatter when I was traveling not travel friendly</li>
            <li>everybody can spot a all-over bronzed face a mile a way), but more for framing your face and blending the color down onto your neck</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re going to pay the high price tag -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Good bronzer runs a little dark</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is great because it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>And I wear makeup professionally.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long either, wears off quickly</li>
            <li>Its a little orangy for this but still cool.</li>
            <li>Now, let me say that matte bronzers are not really for &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; color (that&#x27;s really out of vogue anyway,</li>
            <li>As the other left me looking very shiny.</li>
            <li>Slightly orange and very pigmented</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pigmented but can be toned down a little by blending the bronzer very well.</li>

            <li> Great!  I keep replacing it and using it which is a good sign</li>
            <li> Pretty matte color bronzer. It goes a long way! Would&#x27;ve got one shade lighter if I knew it was as dark but it&#x27;s still pretty on.</li>
            <li> love this bronzer! great pigmentation. not too powdery. blends very well</li>
            <li> Hard to find a good matte bronzer for this price. I love this it looks great. Slightly orange and very pigmented so just use a little and it will look great.</li>
            <li> Love this for contouring and it&#x27;s very big. I love the big mirror inside. 9.5 grams of product not bad at all!</li>
            <li> To me, this is not a bronzer. A bronzer should shine at least abit. So it is a matte powder which is as similar color as my blusher. I will try the next time i go out and see what friends say. but i will definately not buy again</li>
            <li> Good bronzer runs a little dark I would compare it to the tarte park ave princesses the only reason I give it 4 starts because it just shatter when I was traveling not travel friendly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pigmented but can be toned down a little by blending the bronzer very well. Most bronzer&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve bought (even though I have a fairly light skin tone) end up looking nice when I first apply it, but eventually fade. This bronzer has lasted me through a whole hot summer day without fading at all. My only problem with this bronzer is that the product tends to fly everywhere even when I just touch my brush to the bronzer. Just a heads up but it doesn&#x27;t really interfere with the quality of the product for me</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue the price here. I have medium skin tone and in the summer it gets just crazy tan. This works just as well in any season. It all depends on how heavy you apply it. Staying power is pretty good. Color payoff is nice. Would recommend this for any size make up collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the worst luck with bronzers... but this bronzer is so beautiful!!! Well worth the price and try. So exquisite and love the matte finish! Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer out there</li>
            <li> This is a great matte bronzer (shimmer - other than micro-shimmer - is out! Don&#x27;t do it ladies! Stop right there! haha). NYX really produces high quality products with a lower price tag than the higher end designer brands (never buy Chanel makeup, go for Tom Ford/Bobby Brown/Nars/etc. if you&#x27;re going to pay the high price tag - but that&#x27;s another story). This is HIGHLY PIGMENTED, so go easy with applying! A little goes a long way, which is great because it will last you a long time. Now, let me say that matte bronzers are not really for &amp;#34;all over&amp;#34; color (that&#x27;s really out of vogue anyway, so you&#x27;ll just look cheap bc everybody can spot a all-over bronzed face a mile a way), but more for framing your face and blending the color down onto your neck so you have a flawless fade from your foundation color, to your bronzer color, to the color of your neck (crucial if you want to look like you know what you&#x27;re doing with makeup). I suggest trying this, as medium can be applied lightly for very light skin and more liberally for medium tones. I will say that it can appear a bit orange (not overly orange), but also has a nice &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; undertone that gives for a more natural look. Tans always have a red undertone because there is burn associated with it. I recommend, so try it out.</li>
            <li> Great color! Came on time, perfect little bronzer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium, cool-toned olive and this did not really work for me. It came off as too red on my skintone. So while the product itself is great (extremely pigmented and long-lasting), I would beware if your complexion is similar to mine.</li>
            <li> I have olive to tan skin (when it&#x27;s summer I turn tan) so this was the perfect bronzer for winter times.&lt;br /&gt;As we all know when winter kicks in, your skin looses color (pigmentation) and you have to go to a tanning salon, or sprays 9that may turn you yellow) or go with good old fashion bronzers, so this is perfect for my skin tone, if you apply very light portions you will get a nice color......just don&#x27;t over do it cause this can turn you into a overly toasted bread. :-)</li>
            <li> I use it to do a little contour. Its a little orangy for this but still cool. I like the texture too</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer very much. The color is perfect, the quality is good, and the price even better. What else can I say? It&#x27;s just a very good product to have as an everyday makeup wear so you save on your more expensive bronzing items. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. SHADES ARE NOT WHAT THEY SAY THEY ARE AND IT LOOKS FAKE ON</li>
            <li> I decided to test out the product after hearing good things about it. I LOVE this bronzer. Its very pigmented and great for contouring!!</li>
            <li> It has more orange than I like. Doesn&#x27;t last long either, wears off quickly</li>
            <li> After getting the shimmery Mac bronzer, I soon realized I needed a MATTE bronzer for my face.... As the other left me looking very shiny. This is an ESSENTIAL item in your makeup inventory. I&#x27;ve found it to be very helpful.... And I wear makeup professionally.</li>
