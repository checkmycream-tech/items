            <li>probably more my fault on that front than anything</li>
            <li>I love this scent peony.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;fine, not big nor small, I&#x27;m a happy buyer! :D</li>
            <li>The tub wouldn&#x27;t even fit a Barbie doll in it</li>
            <li>this was a cute little set for girlfriend birthday - arrived on time - she loved!</li>
            <li>It smells good at least and the bubble bath is nice.</li>
            <li>It was really cute and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>nice decoration for a single woman&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty using for my baby shower prize</li>
            <li>Again it&#x27;s nice but not worth</li>
            <li>Everything is fine with it and such though I didn&#x27;t image</li>
            <li>This is a set I could&#x27;ve put together for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was ok.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is a cute little set but had I known how small it was</li>
            <li>and she thought it was adorable that everything was inside a little tub.</li>
            <li>Much smaller then worth the value.</li>
            <li>So far the people I gave it to do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li>but for almost the $25.00 price tag it certainly isn&#x27;t worth that much to say the least.</li>
            <li>Overall it was very cute but the package was very mistreated and the little bathtub in which they came in was broken</li>

    <ol>
            <li> nice decoration for a single woman&#x27;s bathroom and i love the sea scrub</li>
            <li> This set comes just as presented. Only problem is that I forgot to read the dimensions. The tub wouldn&#x27;t even fit a Barbie doll in it and I thought it was a foot tub so imagine my surprise when I see this little tiny tub. It smells nice and is a cute little set but had I known how small it was I wouldn&#x27;t have paid $24 for it. This is a set I could&#x27;ve put together for much cheaper. In fact I put together a similar one for about $10. I give it three stars because there is nothing wrong with the product it just wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was and that&#x27;s on me and also its a tad overpriced for what you get, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine with it and such though I didn&#x27;t image it would be so small probably more my fault on that front than anything it&#x27;s a nice set but for almost the $25.00 price tag it certainly isn&#x27;t worth that much to say the least. Again it&#x27;s nice but not worth the amount of money it cost.</li>
            <li> Picture is deceiving.  Much smaller then worth the value.</li>
            <li> Great, I gave it to my abuela and she thought it was adorable that everything was inside a little tub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much, but a little something. I got it yesterday,  and my Mama realized the tub was Cracked today. Not good. Other than that, it was ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this set twice for gifts. I give it 4 stars because I have not used it for myself. So far the people I gave it to do not have any complaints. It was really cute and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!! I LOVED IT AND THE PACKAGEING.&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t caked or anything the only thing is its a little small than what I thought but other than that it&#x27;s so pretty using for my baby shower prize</li>
            <li> The plastic tub arrived broken. This is way smaller than I was anticipating. Kindof on the cheaper side, but oh well. It smells good at least and the bubble bath is nice.</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift for a family remember and she liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent peony. Arrived before the time.Would definitely recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> this was a cute little set for girlfriend birthday - arrived on time - she loved!</li>
            <li> This is a very small gift set, I thought it was going to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my sister. She told me that it was very lovely and smelt beautiful. To my surprise the package came in earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected. Looks a little cheaper quality. I think I will buy something else as a gift.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my sister &amp; she loved it, it looked just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Overall it was very cute but the package was very mistreated and the little bathtub in which they came in was broken</li>
            <li> Came along with my other order in one package,&lt;br /&gt;what u see is what u get, not damaged, some of&lt;br /&gt;the buyers say it&#x27;s tiny/small, but for me it is just&lt;br /&gt;fine, not big nor small, I&#x27;m a happy buyer! :D</li>
