            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mederma for about 3-4 weeks now and the redness from using the product has stopped and best of all, the scars on my face caused by acne have been greatly reduced!</li>

            <li>Have used this product before and it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>The gel dries to a film which rubs off your skin and can best be described as looking like dandruff everywhere you had applied it.</li>

            <li>Love it!!</li>

            <li>It is so effective scar!</li>
            <li>And it smells nice!</li>
            <li>im so happy that i found that the mederma scar cream worked so good for me</li>
            <li>but it is a remarkable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i would need to purchase more of the product in order to receive the best results</li>
            <li>I have heard great reviews that it can reduce many scars up to 90%!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it seem to work fair.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>We already use the product, and know it to be good, which is why we ordered online.  </li>
            <li>I understand that it&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li>and I read online that this is a good thing</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I was looking on Amazon for a good scar cream.</li>
            <li>Others have said they think it is peeling the layers of their scar off and thought that was good.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>is healing,She bought sone stuff locally,twice the price and not as good to hide scars.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The price is really good.</li>
            <li>yielded good results.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff along with good delivery.</li>
            <li>Yes yes yes, petroleum may just be as good for the cheapos.</li>
            <li>but if you shop around Amazon has some good price options.</li>
            <li>though it may be doing nothing, it makes me feel good to put the Mederma on every day.</li>
            <li>, the product kinda peels off when you wear it, so it will not do good under makeup (i wear it at night).</li>
            <li>read good feedback about this product and bought for a scar on face of my son (2 yr and 9months).</li>
            <li>good moisturizer,</li>
            <li>You have to use it twice a day for good results of which I am kind of not so good about</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing however you don&#x27;t notice the smell after application.</li>
            <li>BUT: you will be pleased---very, very pleased, indeed.</li>
            <li>BUT: you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product up to this point.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>My mom is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the item and speed of service.</li>
            <li>And the best part is that silicone gel products work great on old scars.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this superior level of service is not something you would expect from a brick-and-mortar retailer so I am quite impressed and would give this seller 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how my scars would have healed without it, but I am glad I used it and didn&#x27;t have to find out!</li>
            <li>I love scar gel!</li>
            <li>Medicated dermatar for your scar(:)!.</li>
            <li>The cream is even better to me, and the SPF in the cream is a Plus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad!</li>
            <li>and I can already see a remarkable difference in a most of my scars.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing results on my scar after having a baby.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps you save money and that you scars heal nicely.</li>
            <li>I do not believe that the skin would have healed like this on its own.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using mederma since August 2010, My surgery was June 23rd 2010, I honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li>It can remove your scar effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I prayed to G-d for help, and one day stumbled upon Mederma by seeking my own intiative.</li>
            <li>It really is amazing how much the scar has changed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the Mederma or just the scar healing on its own.  </li>
            <li>so I thought that was nice, until I realized the coupon expired a year ago.</li>
            <li>I always have some handy.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>I do liked the price, speedy shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe it would have improved on it&#x27;s own anyway...  </li>
            <li>This works well for scars I have used it before and liked it</li>
            <li>You have to continue to use it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I managed to get it to heal on its own</li>
            <li>Meh - KINDA works, the best results were for her new scars.  </li>
            <li>i love this product its great quality and very worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I say it is more effective</li>
            <li>Probably not the best for sensitive</li>
            <li>Scar-Away is just one brand of many, so do your own research to see if one brand is better or cheaper than another.</li>
            <li>Very important, Follow directions.</li>
            <li>the cream absorbs quickly into the scar tissue - applied twice per day promotes healing of surgical incision - good product</li>
            <li>Its a good product and drys quick on the skin.</li>
            <li>Some time ago the baby scar traces of light more now than before!</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see better results.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t scar as I do, so it may be beneficial for them to use on their \\&quot;normal\\&quot; scars.</li>
            <li>That is the mechanism that Mederma, Vitamin E, etc work better than letting the scar heal by itself.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had tried on most of the scar removal products, nothing had worked to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>the results were visibly better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most people never notice it.</li>
            <li>For more details on my experience..read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The downside - the Mederma product instruction/claims are of a much shorter duration in recovery than experienced by me.  </li>
            <li>Another possibility is that the manufacturer meant for the scarring that takes 6 months to heal to be more benign than whatever degree burns I sustained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another possibility is that the manufacturer meant for the scarring that takes 6 months to heal to be more benign than whatever degree burns I sustained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella.</li>
            <li>I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing.</li>
            <li>I think Mederma deserves more than five stars.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic at erasing my scar.  </li>
            <li>So while I am certainly pleased with the outcome, the downside is the expense of it.</li>
            <li>im sure they will eventually go away like</li>
            <li>i have already purchased 3 more tubes  </li>
            <li>I stuck it out for the most part</li>
            <li>I need an unscented version and have not been able to find one.</li>
            <li>I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck</li>
            <li>I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck</li>
            <li>but does do a good job in getting rid of the redness of fresh scars.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 months after a gallblader operation and it has healed the area, taking the redness with it for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I am waiting for another month to pass to see if they will lighten more in color.</li>
            <li>not use,but think it will be perfect, will buy it next time ,</li>
            <li>I think Kelo-cote works better, and I&#x27;m soon going to try</li>
            <li>probably lots more, even tho</li>
            <li>probably lots more, even tho</li>
            <li>it worked as the smell was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Onion juice might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me.</li>
            <li>NewGel + Silicone Scar Treatment works way better than Mederma, at a comparable cost.</li>
            <li>Mederma works, and I&#x27;m pleased with the investment I made via Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Mederma Skin Care For Scars did indeed smooth out my stretch marks, but the places that I used it made my skin darker!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I was able to return it no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 now and my skin is 90% better with the help of Mederma for my scars.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash the area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost year :) I&#x27;ve been seeing results.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this when mine runs out</li>
            <li>I have to tell you that the improvement won&#x27;t be until you use maybe five or more tubes over five months.  </li>
            <li>more normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope to buy more of them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fading any more than it has.</li>
            <li>The scar on my arm is looking better.</li>
            <li>I think it looks better but it will be many months</li>
            <li>Not horrible</li>
            <li>I love Mederma and use it after every cut I get to make sure they wont scar.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue.</li>
            <li>But since they want more letters in order to submit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, Now Hut up Snowflake and stand by for today&#x27;s top Hits&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it mostly how they directed me to use it.  </li>
            <li>and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>The writing on the box suggested the sooner you use it, the better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more costly, but it&#x27;s not supposed to itch.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just got to be a better product.  </li>
            <li>my lovely son rubbed his forehead on some carpet playing .......</li>
            <li>but he looks great an it really works</li>
            <li>No result using more then a month</li>
            <li>This product is great, but must be used at least twice a day for best results</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I able to finish it within one month.</li>
            <li>However, I did use this project about 15 years ago and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and the scars look better already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mederma with sunblock and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>One more thing: the label says to apply 3-4 times a day.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought this product for my acne scars for both sides of my cheeks &amp; the temples of my head.</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this product a try.</li>
            <li>so I am hoping to see much better results in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>How many tubes do you need to use in order for your scars to lighten up.</li>
            <li>scar seems getting better.</li>
            <li>She will use this to make her feel better and looks better.</li>
            <li>Okay, so, before researching this product at all, I was using it, because of all the hype and ads on TV.</li>
            <li>So it just might take more than 4 months to see results, despite the product claims.</li>
            <li>Was in an accident a couple of months ago and decided to try once more.</li>
            <li>You need to apply many times a day and it will work the manic.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days I noticed a reduction in the redness, and one spot where I have a scar seems to look better.  </li>
            <li>When we are done with its application, we should not even be able to tell I had surgery.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I should see more fading of the scar by now</li>
            <li>so I bought mederma and now they are so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>After looking more closely the date on this tube indicates 2009—so</li>
            <li>We will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li>They seem like things in my spice cabinet for the most part, not something to make skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let that stop me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it is that sticky consistency</li>
            <li>Check the expiration date first!!!</li>
            <li>works  and it looks pretty good -- lower cost than Walgreens</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it made a pretty good improvement too, but that came with a price.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months and the darkness of the scars have reduced significantly!</li>
            <li>I purposely waited for my own results from 2 months of use, applying it 3 times a day to try to make the review more useful.  </li>
            <li>it was a quick shipment,very nice package,best price.</li>
            <li>But for certain scars and with persistence, it can have a good effect.</li>
            <li>Very cool.  </li>
            <li>It sits on top of your skin and dries with a high shine--not good on your face.</li>
            <li>The Mederma does work great as the scars are barely there any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly happy so far and frankly, would pay anything to keep that crazy-making itching away.  </li>
            <li>So far I think it&#x27;s not so great.  </li>
            <li>This is a tried and true formula and we purchased here because the pricing was the best we&#x27;d seen locally as well as online.</li>
            <li>Great for use immediately after surgery or before scar tissue forms, however it can also be use on old scars.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had as much success with this as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>it worth the cost and effective.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I found that some areas on my face that have sun damage were much improved with this product.  </li>
            <li>He loved it so much it almost got Rid of his face scars from a fire boo ya baby lions</li>
            <li>Grateful that Amazon makes returning this product so easy.</li>
            <li>It peels off easily and gets on everything.</li>
            <li>and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  </li>
            <li>plan to try Mederma on some older scars and am hoping for good results.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>Used it after a major cut and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Very worthwhile product that really works . . .</li>
            <li>Mederma is definitely the best scar treatment on the market – you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a better one (but let me know if you do, because this product is very expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The person I bought it for said it was just fine.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend it his skin is blending back nice very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I love the effects the scar is fading quickly.</li>
            <li>What a huge difference this has made in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Unless you have huge scars you will probably have this problem too.</li>
            <li>huge they looked like two eyes</li>
            <li>within 4 weeks I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>and I got free S/H.</li>
            <li>Those two scars no longer have indentations, that is to say the skin has \\&quot;filled in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My plastic surgeon recommended this product to me when I had a suspicious mole removed from my face (which fortunately was benign).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this product, it seems to smooth the scar away and makes it look</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason for the cheap price folks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still there but smooth and fading.</li>
            <li>My surgeon recommended I get it after abdominal surgery, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Offering Free Music to all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use it as directed which does require dedication.</li>
            <li>And he wasn&#x27;t as fortunate.</li>
            <li>it is amazing at how much his arm has healed in just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Great price for a bigger tube</li>
            <li>good product it lighten my old cars.</li>
            <li>found this product is good for old scar too, so</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s better than having the scars, right?).  </li>
            <li>Happy,and it really works!!!</li>
            <li>I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m not near as embarrassed in public, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about showing my &#x27;good side&#x27; any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the burns healed really well on their own, but I used this product and it is probably the best healed scar I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I originally intended to buy the advanced one</li>
            <li>, that originally came as gels for burns, and can now be bought as sheets attached to a band-aid like backing.</li>
            <li>Try acupuncture, dermarolling, sesame oil, and maybe lasers if you are rich.</li>
            <li>It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  </li>
            <li>The color did not fade significantly or disappear as the example on the tube suggested it would; however it seems to have improved somewhat.  </li>
            <li>Used it once a day and got significant results.</li>
            <li>He did recommend that I try Eucerin Original Healing - Soothing Repair Creme.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you follow the directions and apply consistently.</li>
            <li>My scars have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>Has significantly diminished my c-section scar.</li>
            <li>spreads clean and has no terrible smell and works very well and very quickly</li>
            <li>In fact, most scars spontaneously reduce in redness and prominence over the course of several months.</li>
            <li>am very happy that Mederma has given me my clear skin back.</li>
            <li>an keep it clean for the gel to do</li>
            <li>An excellent product for an old sore which was healed, but it left a mark which would not go away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are positive reviews on this product, maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>She picked off a scab on her face and the resulting scar was bright red.</li>
            <li>Great Product, work as expected.</li>
            <li>To the person who wrote patroleum jelly is just as good as Mederma, you have a big issue in your theory...</li>
            <li>some applications, it can feel very itchy, but I think that&#x27;s it at work. :)</li>
            <li>a day, my skin looks gorgeous and my pores even look smaller.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t gone completely , you still can see when closer but the color kind of blended in.</li>
            <li>Not too cool.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve used it the full 6 weeks (recommended to see improvement)</li>
            <li>They offered a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Such a good price.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really nervous so this made me more nervous.</li>
            <li>buy the largest tube for full value for money.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve bought a box full at that time.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know yet the full results.  </li>
            <li>However, I began using it on an old scar that I got about 2 years ago and it is fading nicely.</li>
            <li>they were not bad</li>
            <li>My doctor told me about this ointment and it work great my old and new scars.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>this is the best scar product, and this is the best price i have found it for for this big of size since its a very expensive brand in any market</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for you skin and for other scars.</li>
            <li>to what other reviewers have mentioned about it flaking or balling up, I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.  </li>
            <li>They were quick to respond (within 2 days), however they refused to replace my almost-expired product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work super quick and the scars don&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li>I got stretch marks while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But for certain scars and with persistence, it can have a good effect.ll take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar</li>
            <li>Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  </li>
            <li>Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  </li>
            <li>Ok for new scars, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>The scar color has really faded (it can easily be covered with make up now).</li>
            <li>(Pretty!)</li>
            <li>sure this is a great product for those who are not allergic, but just be aware of the fact that you may have a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li>but scar is exactly as it was originally.</li>
            <li>I bought it and to my ASTONISHMENT it stopped the itching the first day!  </li>
            <li>I first bought this, it was $15.99 (Prime), now it&#x27;s over $28!  </li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>It takes some time but its worth it.</li>
            <li>The one thing worth buying is silicone gel treatments like Scar-Away</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and only gel.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The perfume in this product irritated my fresh scars.</li>
            <li>works even better if you catch the scar early on.</li>
            <li>There is, however, a distinct discoloration at the site.</li>
            <li>So far, this seems to work better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It gives me hope and self-esteem to know that I am taking action to better</li>
            <li>Most of the results people get are from the skin naturally healing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue with my regimen for a month + as it recommends, but it really is powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Then I just got some burn blisters on several locations on the top of my feet (HOT food on sandals!!).</li>
            <li>I bought every kind of lotion for it - shea butter, coconut oil, Vitamin E, hand lotions of every variety, special dry skin lotions...</li>
            <li>When my wound healed, I applied Mederma quickly and CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away after the bandages came off.</li>
            <li>came right away</li>
            <li>I got the product right away.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the one downside to this is that it makes my skin itchy right where I applied the cream.</li>
            <li>And this time the itching was unbearable right away.</li>
            <li>I receive the product on time and begin using right away...</li>
            <li>If you use it right away, the scar is gone.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and feel pretty confident that the scar will eventually be nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mine had already expired the same month I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is effective if used consistently, there should just be disclosure regarding expiration.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It has been more than a year from the accident and scar is barely visible.</li>
            <li>I had seen many Doctors, a top dermtologist, a regular dermatologist, other Doctors, asked my parents for help, asked the top Oral Surgeon who performed the surgery for help, and _nothing</li>
            <li>so I really couldn&#x27;t use the full amount.</li>
            <li>Right now it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li>I had a C-Section and hadn&#x27;t exactly started using this product right away.  </li>
            <li>This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don&#x27;t have many stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The price was good because the product&#x27;s expiration date is less than two months from the day I received it.</li>
            <li>problem with Mederma is it really dries out my skin, to the point of causing mild irritation when I use it.</li>
            <li>Have not used the product yet, however have used other products from this manufacturer before and was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I got stitches right below my eyebrow two months before my wedding and thought for sure I&#x27;d have a hideous red scar in all of my pictures.</li>
            <li>I use a vitamin e oil and it seems to be fine, but some may be sensitive to the soy or safflower oils?</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by how quickly it arrived!</li>
            <li>I used it twice daily as recommended and it was okay.</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of months, and running out, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the slow progress I was making.</li>
            <li>The scars appeared to be having some effect by the time first tube was over..</li>
            <li>Yes , it wont work on first tube.</li>
            <li>I lost 70 pounds in 2 months, and 30lbs of it was lost in the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The only therapy that might be better than placebo are silicone gels, pads, etc.</li>
            <li>And I started first using bio oil.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in the first week, and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>I will notify my Dermatologist, and I would like all to know that buyer&#x27;s should be aware that it is not \\&quot;uncommon\\</li>
            <li>Amazon is not at fault; I constantly trust them to provide me with most products I buy;  </li>
            <li>The big tube is a much better value depending on the price</li>
            <li>hope it can be more discount in next time</li>
            <li>This product really works for acne scars!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first heard of Mederma</li>
            <li>I was willing to give anything a shot.</li>
            <li>Be aware that you may be allergic to this product.</li>
            <li>most days I can only do one application (before I go to bed), but on days where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup all day I can do 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this helps you guys ;)</li>
            <li>I love it for the scars on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I used 3 times a day and could see results in the first week.</li>
            <li>my scar became bigger and more swollen please dont buy this scam of a product.</li>
            <li>except that why the heck did my doc not mention this the first time.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with everything about this order except that the product arrived with an expiration date in only a week after which it arrived.</li>
            <li>I would rather buy it there than hassle with the return, not to mention all of the emails to even get a refund in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Also, I think it will take too many weeks before seeing if this is the proper treatment for me.  </li>
            <li>This product absolutely works!</li>
            <li>so I gave up on it after I finished the first tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, but already I can tell that, what should have been a significant scar is now significantly smoother and flatter that I would have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>Every scar I get stays red for years and they never get better.</li>
            <li>I used about 7 tubes to make my first set of scars.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen it first hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the first time, it was ok after applying but at 2nd time, my face got so itch that I couldn&#x27;t even sleep at all.</li>
            <li>I glad I bought it through Amazon instead of twice the price at a local store.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent with using this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty unattractive and sort of embarressing at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually works better than cocoa butter,</li>
            <li>Received on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first 3 weeks I was using Mederma</li>
            <li>also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I leave a comment on Amazon EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I might see more improvement if I&#x27;m patient enough :</li>
            <li>Just be aware of what you are getting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but since you have to apply it a few times a day it has become quite costly.  </li>
            <li>Like others mentioned, it seems to work better on new scars as opposed to old (and in my experience, the newer the scar, the faster the result).</li>
            <li>While I know it will take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar</li>
            <li>From what I read, other brands are just as effective (</li>
            <li>the price is pretty high, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it since I won&#x27;t have a scar.</li>
            <li>That it only might work was good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Mederma is okay but be ready to fork over some big money: they want you to put it on 4 times a day for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I had foot surgery Jan of this year and the scar was pretty long and prominent.</li>
            <li>I used it several times a day and for a good 3 months and still have a ton left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Silicone sheets (and to a lesser extent gels) have really helped my scars and there have been many studies showing their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that I could see results so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Really, you only just need a very rich creme if you want results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve has surgery a little over two months mow and the scar goes from pelvis to pelvis and right now it is like a fine line when it was huge before I could not be happier i will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already noticed positive results.</li>
            <li>The gel didn&#x27;t soak in for a long time and many people asked what it was on my skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much although I used exactly as was instructed on the tube.</li>
            <li>I also bought the new and improved fresh scent formula.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after previously having the kind of mederma that is like a 1.5&amp;#34; carmex tube.</li>
            <li>liked this a lot because it worked on some old scars, but realize that you&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot of money over a long period of time to see any difference.</li>
            <li>I cannot determine how well the product performs because it has such a strong floral scent that I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li>I have a large skin graft on my lower leg that was kept covered by strips that had a petroleum jelly substance on it until it healed.</li>
            <li>But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Also, you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine and only needed to be used once a day.  </li>
            <li>I used it on the scars my acne left and they have faded away so quickly!</li>
            <li>rated very high.  </li>
            <li>Very good, so I can say on what went wrong out of it?</li>
            <li>My face was messed up with this huge, deep scar.</li>
            <li>; It ended up a huge, itching red lump that never went away or turned into a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scar like the rest of the incision.</li>
            <li>I love Mederma and think its really effective I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li>I really like the cream Mederma and bought it after sampling this gel product they offer.  </li>
            <li>So when I went for a refill, I bought the Walgreens store brand instead since it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really like Maderma...</li>
            <li>Mederma works very well, I tried Bio Oil and it just did not work.  </li>
            <li>Of course I would purchase this again,if fact I&#x27;ll be doing that real soon.</li>
            <li>And I have to say, it does absolutely work.</li>
            <li>I guess its proof the stuff is really doing something.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable, and I could tell it was a distraction to people speaking to me.</li>
            <li>This work very well.</li>
            <li>, you may end up with too much.</li>
            <li>I really did not want a scar.</li>
            <li>So for results, follow the directions very closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I still have scars, they aren&#x27;t visible unless you really look closely.</li>
            <li>The texture of my scars have changed, and the color has faded so much that whenever I put makeup on you can&#x27;t even see my scars</li>
            <li>but it cost way too much.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working.  </li>
            <li>I tried to focus on one scar to see If it would do as it is supposed too but couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>I gave it some time, but the redness did not fade readily.</li>
            <li>Thanks to them, my Mederma expires soon</li>
            <li>i dont really know about mederma</li>
            <li>it makes your skin real flaky and it peels off</li>
            <li>The scar is fading thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was going to rip the skin off, I scratched it so much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ridiculous to spend this much money on something that expires so</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say whether it just faded from time, or if the product really worked.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well on healing scars after surgery.  </li>
            <li>Works so fast and well.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>all very serious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper than the one I got from CVS.</li>
            <li>I bought this product two weeks ago to try it out and haven&#x27;t seen much change.  </li>
            <li>At the very beginning, I felt iching.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>It is also too pricey to keep repurchasing to see if it really helps with time</li>
            <li>He has much darker skin as I do.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>am also using this with another scar product that I really like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping Mederma would help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Did not do much for me.</li>
            <li>I think this works very well.  </li>
            <li>Before and after pictures show absolutely noooo change in appearance.</li>
            <li>I used it for 5 months straight as directed and still nothing.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t even see where the scratches were now.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned and stopped applying this</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really works for my case, since it takes a while to find out.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much....</li>
            <li>Product as described and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>, the gel is really watery.  </li>
            <li>She said that this product doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>but it is really helping get rid of the scars.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping does not expire for a year</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so ready for summer.</li>
            <li>I have a scar that I have had for over twenty years that required several stitches, is light in color, but still noticeable, and Mederma did not help.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>Mederma helped to significantly reduce a large scar on my knee from total knee joint replacement.  </li>
            <li>significantly_ not only reduced the appearance of the scar but the actual scarring itself, I would not be able to concentrate enough to have saved many of the lives I have saved in my life, nor would I be without significant pain on a portion of my body that I use constantly.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; white scar (a year old or more) that has begun looking more like the color of my skin, but will probably take a little longer to go</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that i love this product</li>
            <li>For me, it is most effective with dark scars, particularly from burns, in which case I apply Mederma almost immediately (obviously if here is an open wound, one should wait until it is healed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I have seen a good result, the scar is smoother(used to be a tiny bump) and less visible.</li>
            <li>Since Mederma is very light and water based, it doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and seems to soak in quickly to dry skin, but it has also lasted for these last two months with extra in the tube to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The original size of that burn was about the size of nickel, with the most \\&quot;jelly\\&quot; in the middle and less raised in the edges.  </li>
            <li>They are obviously buying old/nearly expired product and passing it on to Amazon customers at full retail prices.  </li>
            <li>However, I did want to warn those with sensitive skin who are interested in using Maderma on their face.</li>
            <li>According to my surgeon this is a must for the GIANT scar he left on me (to be fair, he had to, it was the only way in).</li>
            <li>It seemed to work, but then again she was only 2 - and kids that young heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>have been seeing significantly improvement on my new poison ivy scars (from June) after only 5 or 6 uses!</li>
            <li>now, I think it does seem to help and really doesn&#x27;t hurt new scar formation.</li>
            <li>The new formula is just one treatment per day, which is very convinient.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my new scar.  </li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ll be happy--and it appears to be going in that direction at a steady pace.</li>
            <li>This stuff made the red scar more red.</li>
            <li>I bought the larger 1.76 oz tube after I realized that I was going to use up the smaller size fairly quickly with that many daily applications.  </li>
            <li>For older scars, it&#x27;s substantially longer.</li>
            <li>and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months -</li>
            <li>and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months -</li>
            <li>My surgeon recommended this particular cream.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for older scars.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; should be listed as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li>The scar was starting to blend in with my skin and now after 3 months it has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>so luckily we will likely use it before it expires.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me with older scars.</li>
            <li>I prefer the scent of Pura d&#x27;or more but it is also more expensive.</li>
            <li>I think that I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, but only at home or when I know I won&#x27;t be seen in public. :)</li>
            <li>It is working really well so far thank God!</li>
            <li>Anyways, the expiration date is next month, so apparently Mary&#x27;s Market is buying old or expired goods and selling them at top dollar.  </li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant to use, and actually works.  </li>
            <li>I was miffed at the high price, but had been told by my doctors that this was what I should buy.</li>
            <li>It has a high price for a non-scientific product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product</li>
            <li>Im going to start high school soon</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using the product post surgery to elimiante scaring.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on my new c-section scar and on my mother&#x27;s new burn scar, not so well on another older scar but still trying.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin (he&#x27;s allergic to certain detergents, deodorants, etc) but has had no issues with the Mederma.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noticed a major change the first time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>It was OK in the beginning, but then around week 3, it started to itch a little.</li>
            <li>It works on the new and old scars, certainly diminished visibility, and softened the lumps (adhesions) the older scars had formed.</li>
            <li>The opening of the top is too large for the small amount I normally need to use.</li>
            <li>It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn.</li>
            <li>My wife used this product on new surgical scars and on older scars from moles being removed.</li>
            <li>Not messy and don&#x27;t use too much as it flakes off.  </li>
            <li>but it is working very well so far.</li>
            <li>I gave it a few days before trying it again (just to make sure) and</li>
            <li>You will see noticeable result in 2 weeks and full result in about 6 to 8 weeks on minor scars.</li>
            <li>More severe scars will take a few months to see a change, depending on your body and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only con is the price, but it is well worth</li>
            <li>And a bigger smile.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bear it for more than I few minutes.</li>
            <li>Using the cocoa butter stick has the same exact results and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>So just clean your cut with simple soap and water (anti-bacterial gels and soaps don&#x27;t help other than to make you more resistant to anti-biotics, so they are actually a detriment!!!)</li>
            <li>If this is a new scar, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  </li>
            <li>As I have a lot of product I will continue to apply..  Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  </li>
            <li>really recommend this product to anyone who has a new or an old scar.</li>
            <li>Half the price of the local pharmacy and an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Sure, they haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, but this product has made a substantial difference in half the time frame that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I quickly used the product within a week the scar changed from thick to smooth</li>
            <li>even so I&#x27;m still having to use a 3 pack every month due to the huge area I have to cover.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it is on new scars</li>

            <li>In a live chat with a rep named Stephanie I was directed to the product that needs to be applied two or three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I already can see a reduction in the redness of the new scars.</li>
            <li>I plan to be a cardiovascular surgeon in New York City.</li>

            <li>might try a new method idk...........</li>
            <li>a new scar.</li>
            <li>It does seem to lighten a new scar but doesn&#x27;t take them away like</li>
            <li>She used it on the advise of her Podiatrist for new Bunyan scars.  </li>
            <li>After going online to do some research, I threw out my new tube.</li>
            <li>The directions say for a new scar, use it 3 - 4 times a day for 8 weeks, which I intend to do.</li>
            <li>They also say the only thing that breaks down scar tissue is silicone, and the only good (and affordable) cream that contains this ingredient is Scarzone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several surgeries, I been using Mederma for about 5 years on various scars throughout the years and have seen a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>sure enough I got itchy and pink</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s the price you pay for a tube that will last longer than a month, but that&#x27;s the same price available in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>The info on the box is very clear about the time line to get results.</li>
            <li>It even worked in fading very old (i.e.,15 years)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li>also have a deep scar that is 35 years old right smack on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>The tube is still at least half full and the scar color is dramatically better!  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you understand that it is not magic</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product on the first knee replacement, and will apply it to the scar from a second knee replacement s soon as my doctor clears it.</li>
            <li>I first used this product back in 2005, recommended by my podiatrist, after I had surgery on both of my feet.</li>
            <li>The gel completely got rid of four of the six scars!</li>
            <li>The doctor and his nurse looked at it - red, throbbing, hot, swollen, oozing -- and said, &amp;#34;Just put Neosporin on it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I assume the doctor cut pretty deep, after all, baby gotta come out after all!</li>
            <li>For this reason I&#x27;m not sure I will be able to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The scars look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 1 month I starting to see improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time using this product and it will be my last.</li>
            <li>I got married last December</li>
            <li>We would both say we saw small but noticeable improvement in one week that to us seemed greater than E.  </li>
            <li>I applied a small amount, and once it had soaked into my skin on my face, I applied it once more.</li>
            <li>But, as most things in life, it is not a magical on time use product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like supporting a mom-and-pop business in the digital age.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference, the white spots start looking more as my regular skin color</li>
            <li>I burned my hand in a kitchen oven and the burn scar it left me was pretty unsightly.</li>
            <li>I recently burned my skin and my first instinct was to apply Mederma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on a new injury and it does seem to be softer and hasn&#x27;t developed a scab.</li>
            <li>Old or new scars</li>
            <li>This helps minimize old and new scars and burn marks.</li>
            <li>some old, some new.</li>
            <li>I tried it on some new and old scars.</li>
            <li>leaving two huge brown spots on his forehead the color of black coffee....</li>
            <li>It will however make them smooth and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>They are quite severe stretch marks (they are 8 years old and some are a full inch wide)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin &amp; this was  the first product that has EVER irritated &amp; made my skin red.</li>
            <li>I first tried Mederma back in the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was quite sceptical about this cream because my scar was still bumpy and red and this magical cream took the sweling down and the redness out.</li>
            <li>I was positive I would need stitches, it was quite deep.</li>
            <li>Last week, I got a new pair of glasses, which reinflamed the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I used it on both a new scar and an old one daily for 3 months, it has done absolutely nothing to either scar.</li>
            <li>but  I think it works good for new strength marks ( Still pink or red) not older ones( white and shining).</li>
            <li>I work in a pharmacy, and the general opinion of our pharmacists is that mederma is basically just sunscreen, which aids in the prevention of scarring, but is not for the treatment of older scars.</li>
            <li>Have a scar right under my lower lip, used this every single day, didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.</li>
            <li>I had a large (3\\&quot; by 4\\&quot;),deep scrape on my arm</li>
            <li>I read on one website that you need to rub it in hard and make sure it is fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I managed to skillfully slice a huge hole in my arm.</li>
            <li>and as you can clearly see, that is what&#x27;s happening.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with blemishes, but over the years I&#x27;ve had a few that left marks on my chin,</li>
            <li>Did not use the product as it is not what I expected, therefore, the rating is for Beauty Time, not the product.&lt;br /&gt;The supplier, Beauty Time, posted a picture of a box of ADVANCED mederma in the ad, but sent regular mederma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It help clear my scars</li>
            <li>It does have a slight floral scent but its a clean, lotion type smell.</li>
            <li>Any light pink acne scars or patches have almost totally disappeared.</li>
            <li>So far, she is stisfied with the results</li>
            <li>But so far,  I like it</li>
            <li>Its too early to have a conclusion, but as far as i used Mederma i can say that the results is coming soon.</li>
            <li>Do not use this product if you tend to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>old scars.</li>
            <li>Just softening it so far.</li>
            <li>Maderma works really well with scars and such.</li>
            <li>Googled \\&quot;Mederma causing rash\\&quot; and found that a number of people had developed a rash from using this product.</li>
            <li>if it makes you itchy, don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li>the scar had faded away completely.</li>
            <li>i used 2 tubes so far</li>
            <li>I do like it, it helped me  with my cut a bit I still have more to go, but at least it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve switched to the all natural derma-e scar gel</li>
            <li>If none of this fades the scar completely, I&#x27;ll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>If none of this fades the scar completely, I&#x27;ll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>This product is not messy (which I appreciate because up until I started using it</li>
            <li>Smells like old flowers or something, but it goes away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be working clear up my acne scars.</li>
            <li>YOU PEEL THE JUNK OFF.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE MONEY</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li>not working for old one.</li>
            <li>Far too smelly to apply once a day let alone 3-4 times recommended.</li>
            <li>My mother uses this often as she burns herself frequently at work.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s nearly two weeks</li>
            <li>Somewhat late delivery, but ok.</li>
            <li>and i dont really feel different</li>
            <li>After a year of using this cream my scar has gone away completely.</li>
            <li>and the scar is completely gone</li>
            <li>my skipped times and stopping early had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it was too old of scar.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for several weeks and found the mark much</li>
            <li>Will try it on old scars when I finish with this one.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li>How can this cream work for old scars within  3 months?</li>
            <li>So far, there&#x27;s been no sign of a keloid or rippling of the skin at the site of the wounds.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>After a month, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>my scar is nearly gone</li>
            <li>Maybe my scar is too old, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Old cream.</li>
            <li>Or how about old fashion lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me or my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far not working.</li>
            <li>old, and she is 12 years old now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received item undamaged and on time as far as delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Would use seller again.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, it&#x27;s too soon for me to rate its effectiveness</li>
            <li>This makes it soft again and stops the hurt.</li>
            <li>Whenever I had a big scar or one I wanted to fade fast</li>
            <li>It does work, don&#x27;t expect it completely remove scars.</li>
            <li>Would rather the advanced version that you only apply 1x daily vs this which is 3x daily.</li>
            <li>but it does take time to get rid of it completely</li>
            <li>a day later it got really itchy.  </li>
            <li>The marks from the thread used to sew his arm are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>Because of how well it has worked so far for him, I intend to purchase some of the stretch mark cream once my baby is born in February.</li>
            <li>I think it does take time on old ones.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see them, I can barley feel them and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for a month on scars that i developed from my childhood.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat expensive, but I shopped around and got it at good prices.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see how my scars will look in a few months time of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lastly, yes it is true scars will heal the same without the help of beauty products or over the counter products, but then you will be left with a scar still.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not CRAZY itchiness, like other reviewers have said,</li>
            <li>I scar easily and despite Neosporin and Biafine this turned into a scaly red mess that took weeks to fade.</li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had many small scars in various places from the liposuction and started using Scar Reducing Herbal Creme just for those scars.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the low-down on Mederma if one is not an avid user like myself: Mederma takes time to reduce the appearance of the scar, it must be applied religiously 3-4 times a day, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough</li>
            <li>I have been using this pretty religiously (4 times a day) for the last 7 days</li>
            <li>this major surgery scar does now!  </li>
            <li>I am almost positive it will be completely gone (OR PRETTY CLOSE) in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li>The scar has bothered me since I was 19, where as I grew, the tightness grew more and more painful, such that I could not fully concentrate to the degree</li>
            <li>I also tried it on an old scar from last summer, but haven&#x27;t really seen anything different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not that long ago that doctors were telling people that scars were for life and that there was nothing that could be done about them, so one has to have reasonable expectations when dealing with a scar.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend it if you just want to get the color back to normal.</li>
            <li>I can testify that this definitely works on new scars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have been using it once a day; also, if I apply too much at once, it tends to dry out and peel up.</li>
            <li>Mederma slows the progression of the condition, but I don&#x27;t plan to use it my entire life, so ultimately it will progress and end wherever it wants.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not under the illusion that they will completely vanish, but if they even turn grey and blend in with the skin like normal stretch marks</li>
            <li>- the product works with MULTIPLE DAILY applications and it takes MONTHS for the results to show, much longer than what the Mederma manufacturer states</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than at local drugstores and arrived in very short time.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works--I got scratched on the entire left side of my face by my cat, to the point where everyone who noticed my scars had a horrified reaction and warned me that the scarring would probably never go away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that gives total relief from intense itching.</li>
            <li>i seen results major results in size and color  </li>
            <li>Ordered it for my friend who had major surgery.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think there is anything out that will remove major scars in a month.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not the first time they sent out the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14, read other people&#x27;s reviews, those people also had received the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14.</li>
            <li>Mederma was a subject of a scientific study (citation below), and it was found to be no more effective than petroleum jelly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  </li>
            <li>I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  </li>
            <li>It has almost completey hidden the right scar &amp;</li>
            <li>The tube is not that large and it doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li>What used to be dark red and highly visible across the room is now light pink and only visible if viewed up close</li>
            <li>Massage in general does depending on location.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The scar tissue is now barely raised and is flexible.</li>
            <li>im 22 yr old male</li>
            <li>Within two weeks it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It had to be fixed by plastic surgeon, however that left him with the 5cm scar on his forehead.</li>
            <li>They are not as red and some have gone away completely.</li>
            <li>The surgical scar on my chest has gone from an itchy, swollen welt to barely there.</li>
            <li>I used this product on it for about 4 months and now the scars are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>and it barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li>It is too early in the process to know how it will actually work.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who used Mederma for 3 years on his scar and now you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>i swear by this, and although others say that there are natural remedies that beat mederma, i have used countless products that work this well.  </li>
            <li>and now I can barely  see them.</li>
            <li>I am on day 3 of using this and my cut has already gone from blatantly obvious to something that looks months old.</li>
            <li>Again, it is a GEL and leaves a white, sticky-looking residue but dries completely after a minute</li>
            <li>room for 007&lt;br /&gt;(or a sour kraut Hot Dawg with Mustard or relish!)&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>an during the day I used cocoa butter now you can hardly notice them it really really&lt;br /&gt;Works !!!</li>
            <li>My main goal with using this or any other product is to reduce the redness brought on by the severe acne I&#x27;ve had through my teens and early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My new wounds stretch from hip to hip and essentially armpit to armpit (under each breast to try to conceal it as much as possible).</li>
            <li>The scars were fresh, and they responded extremely well to the product, especially when I applied it twice daily</li>
            <li>Having said that I must also say that my scar was right down the middle of my nose.</li>
            <li>It was an age spot, or dead skin, a blotch, on my right cheekbone, the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li>, most likely due to the clusters of little red bumps I noticed were surrounding the area.</li>
            <li>I also used it as a daily facial moisturizer  and noticed it quickly made my acne dark spots disappear!</li>
            <li>It was after their own ridiculous mailing deadline of two weeks for a product less than two ounces.  </li>
            <li>This stuff helped fade them and actually made them soft and feel like my regular skin again.</li>
            <li>It works well so far on smaller scars, but one of my larger scars, does not seem to be lightening at all!!</li>
            <li>I SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS ORDER LAST TIME.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have had several burn scars disappear almost entirely with the help of Mederma, although I did exfoliate the area (once the injury was completely healed) in addition to using the product.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of deep red scratch scars (about 6 months old), and after 7 days the color is lighter, the edges \\&quot;softer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Let me say at first I was a little upset my son an</li>
            <li>I am now into my fourth day into using it, and there has been major change to the appearance to my face.</li>
            <li>I spent $$$ on Mederma with high hopes to no avail.  </li>
            <li>It has now become evident that the Hypertrophic part of the scar on my knee (the upper half of the scar) is not benefiting from using Mederma.</li>
            <li>After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application.</li>
            <li>And I never noticed a difference; scars took just as long to fade with Mederma or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to put it bluntly, there have been very few trials with Mederma and of those, one found no significant difference of Mederma vs. placebo, and one found effective results...</li>
            <li>My complaint is that the last time I ordered I received a product called \\&quot;Mederma Advanced Scar Gel\\&quot; that stipulated both on the box and on the 50g tube:  \\&quot;only 1X daily\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I tried other creams and lotions but Mederma has been the only one that is really working.</li>
            <li>Getting this far has taken a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I havent used it long enuff to know whether they will eventually be gone completely, tho.</li>
            <li>Now 4 months later, scar is barely visible...</li>
            <li>I used this stuff religiously after my surgery and now you can barely see my scar.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the smaller acne scars were almost completely unnoticeable, the larger scars were only a bit distorted, but still the product was affective on them.</li>
            <li>So Ive been using this pretty faithfully for a few weeks now (in conjunction with microdermabrasion by neutrogena)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s considered a fresh scent in Germany(where</li>
            <li>I also tried on my son who had a small fresh scar just from a scratch on his face and that didnt work either.</li>
            <li>I did use it everyday when I first received it and see no changes in the scar.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to say, no one even notices I had a pretty bad gash on my forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received product fast, but when I opened the box I noticed the product had less than a month until it expires.</li>
            <li>The first few times I applied it, I got a red rash.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use, no odor, or sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li>And it really takes SO LITTLE</li>
            <li>thought it would be good idea to try StriVectin on my stomach (just above the tummy tuck scar) since I had bad stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Obviously this seems to work well for some; unfortunately, I am one of those that experienced a negative reaction.</li>

            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> very effective in removing scars but requires prolonged use, twice a day.</li>
            <li> It is so effective scar!</li>
            <li> And it smells nice!</li>
            <li> im so happy that i found that the mederma scar cream worked so good for me</li>
            <li> but it is a remarkable difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i would need to purchase more of the product in order to receive the best results</li>
            <li> I have heard great reviews that it can reduce many scars up to 90%!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it seem to work fair.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> We already use the product, and know it to be good, which is why we ordered online.  </li>
            <li> I understand that it&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> and I read online that this is a good thing</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I was looking on Amazon for a good scar cream.</li>
            <li> Others have said they think it is peeling the layers of their scar off and thought that was good.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> is healing,She bought sone stuff locally,twice the price and not as good to hide scars.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The price is really good.</li>
            <li> yielded good results.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff along with good delivery.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes, petroleum may just be as good for the cheapos.</li>
            <li> but if you shop around Amazon has some good price options.</li>
            <li> though it may be doing nothing, it makes me feel good to put the Mederma on every day.</li>
            <li> , the product kinda peels off when you wear it, so it will not do good under makeup (i wear it at night).</li>
            <li> read good feedback about this product and bought for a scar on face of my son (2 yr and 9months).</li>
            <li> good moisturizer,</li>
            <li> You have to use it twice a day for good results of which I am kind of not so good about</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing however you don&#x27;t notice the smell after application.</li>
            <li> BUT: you will be pleased---very, very pleased, indeed.</li>
            <li> BUT: you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product up to this point.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> My mom is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the item and speed of service.</li>
            <li> And the best part is that silicone gel products work great on old scars.</li>
            <li> I really feel that this superior level of service is not something you would expect from a brick-and-mortar retailer so I am quite impressed and would give this seller 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my scars would have healed without it, but I am glad I used it and didn&#x27;t have to find out!</li>
            <li> I love scar gel!</li>
            <li> Medicated dermatar for your scar(:)!.</li>
            <li> The cream is even better to me, and the SPF in the cream is a Plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad!</li>
            <li> and I can already see a remarkable difference in a most of my scars.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing results on my scar after having a baby.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps you save money and that you scars heal nicely.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that the skin would have healed like this on its own.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mederma since August 2010, My surgery was June 23rd 2010, I honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li> It can remove your scar effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I prayed to G-d for help, and one day stumbled upon Mederma by seeking my own intiative.</li>
            <li> It really is amazing how much the scar has changed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the Mederma or just the scar healing on its own.  </li>
            <li> so I thought that was nice, until I realized the coupon expired a year ago.</li>
            <li> I always have some handy.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> I do liked the price, speedy shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe it would have improved on it&#x27;s own anyway...  </li>
            <li> This works well for scars I have used it before and liked it</li>
            <li> You have to continue to use it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I managed to get it to heal on its own</li>
            <li> Meh - KINDA works, the best results were for her new scars.  </li>
            <li> i love this product its great quality and very worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I say it is more effective</li>
            <li> Probably not the best for sensitive</li>
            <li> Scar-Away is just one brand of many, so do your own research to see if one brand is better or cheaper than another.</li>
            <li> Very important, Follow directions.</li>
            <li> the cream absorbs quickly into the scar tissue - applied twice per day promotes healing of surgical incision - good product</li>
            <li> Its a good product and drys quick on the skin.</li>
            <li> Some time ago the baby scar traces of light more now than before!</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see better results.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t scar as I do, so it may be beneficial for them to use on their \\&quot;normal\\&quot; scars.</li>
            <li> That is the mechanism that Mederma, Vitamin E, etc work better than letting the scar heal by itself.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had tried on most of the scar removal products, nothing had worked to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> the results were visibly better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Most people never notice it.</li>
            <li> For more details on my experience..read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The downside - the Mederma product instruction/claims are of a much shorter duration in recovery than experienced by me.  </li>
            <li> Another possibility is that the manufacturer meant for the scarring that takes 6 months to heal to be more benign than whatever degree burns I sustained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella.</li>
            <li> I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing.</li>
            <li> I think Mederma deserves more than five stars.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic at erasing my scar.  </li>
            <li> So while I am certainly pleased with the outcome, the downside is the expense of it.</li>
            <li> im sure they will eventually go away like</li>
            <li> i have already purchased 3 more tubes  </li>
            <li> I stuck it out for the most part</li>
            <li> I need an unscented version and have not been able to find one.</li>
            <li> I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck</li>
            <li> I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck</li>
            <li> but does do a good job in getting rid of the redness of fresh scars.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months after a gallblader operation and it has healed the area, taking the redness with it for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting for another month to pass to see if they will lighten more in color.</li>
            <li> not use,but think it will be perfect, will buy it next time ,</li>
            <li> I think Kelo-cote works better, and I&#x27;m soon going to try</li>
            <li> probably lots more, even tho</li>
            <li> probably lots more, even tho</li>
            <li> it worked as the smell was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Onion juice might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me.</li>
            <li> NewGel + Silicone Scar Treatment works way better than Mederma, at a comparable cost.</li>
            <li> Mederma works, and I&#x27;m pleased with the investment I made via Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Mederma Skin Care For Scars did indeed smooth out my stretch marks, but the places that I used it made my skin darker!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I was able to return it no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 now and my skin is 90% better with the help of Mederma for my scars.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash the area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost year :) I&#x27;ve been seeing results.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this when mine runs out</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that the improvement won&#x27;t be until you use maybe five or more tubes over five months.  </li>
            <li> more normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope to buy more of them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fading any more than it has.</li>
            <li> The scar on my arm is looking better.</li>
            <li> I think it looks better but it will be many months</li>
            <li> Not horrible</li>
            <li> I love Mederma and use it after every cut I get to make sure they wont scar.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue.</li>
            <li> But since they want more letters in order to submit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, Now Hut up Snowflake and stand by for today&#x27;s top Hits&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it mostly how they directed me to use it.  </li>
            <li> and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> The writing on the box suggested the sooner you use it, the better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more costly, but it&#x27;s not supposed to itch.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just got to be a better product.  </li>
            <li> my lovely son rubbed his forehead on some carpet playing .......</li>
            <li> but he looks great an it really works</li>
            <li> No result using more then a month</li>
            <li> This product is great, but must be used at least twice a day for best results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I able to finish it within one month.</li>
            <li> However, I did use this project about 15 years ago and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and the scars look better already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma with sunblock and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> One more thing: the label says to apply 3-4 times a day.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this product for my acne scars for both sides of my cheeks &amp; the temples of my head.</li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this product a try.</li>
            <li> so I am hoping to see much better results in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> How many tubes do you need to use in order for your scars to lighten up.</li>
            <li> scar seems getting better.</li>
            <li> She will use this to make her feel better and looks better.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, before researching this product at all, I was using it, because of all the hype and ads on TV.</li>
            <li> So it just might take more than 4 months to see results, despite the product claims.</li>
            <li> Was in an accident a couple of months ago and decided to try once more.</li>
            <li> You need to apply many times a day and it will work the manic.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days I noticed a reduction in the redness, and one spot where I have a scar seems to look better.  </li>
            <li> When we are done with its application, we should not even be able to tell I had surgery.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I should see more fading of the scar by now</li>
            <li> so I bought mederma and now they are so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> After looking more closely the date on this tube indicates 2009—so</li>
            <li> We will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> They seem like things in my spice cabinet for the most part, not something to make skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let that stop me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it is that sticky consistency</li>
            <li> Check the expiration date first!!!</li>
            <li> works  and it looks pretty good -- lower cost than Walgreens</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it made a pretty good improvement too, but that came with a price.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months and the darkness of the scars have reduced significantly!</li>
            <li> I purposely waited for my own results from 2 months of use, applying it 3 times a day to try to make the review more useful.  </li>
            <li> it was a quick shipment,very nice package,best price.</li>
            <li> But for certain scars and with persistence, it can have a good effect.</li>
            <li> Very cool.  </li>
            <li> It sits on top of your skin and dries with a high shine--not good on your face.</li>
            <li> The Mederma does work great as the scars are barely there any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly happy so far and frankly, would pay anything to keep that crazy-making itching away.  </li>
            <li> So far I think it&#x27;s not so great.  </li>
            <li> This is a tried and true formula and we purchased here because the pricing was the best we&#x27;d seen locally as well as online.</li>
            <li> Great for use immediately after surgery or before scar tissue forms, however it can also be use on old scars.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had as much success with this as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> it worth the cost and effective.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I found that some areas on my face that have sun damage were much improved with this product.  </li>
            <li> He loved it so much it almost got Rid of his face scars from a fire boo ya baby lions</li>
            <li> Grateful that Amazon makes returning this product so easy.</li>
            <li> It peels off easily and gets on everything.</li>
            <li> and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  </li>
            <li> plan to try Mederma on some older scars and am hoping for good results.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> Used it after a major cut and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> Very worthwhile product that really works . . .</li>
            <li> Mederma is definitely the best scar treatment on the market – you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a better one (but let me know if you do, because this product is very expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for said it was just fine.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend it his skin is blending back nice very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li> seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I love the effects the scar is fading quickly.</li>
            <li> What a huge difference this has made in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unless you have huge scars you will probably have this problem too.</li>
            <li> huge they looked like two eyes</li>
            <li> within 4 weeks I noticed a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> and I got free S/H.</li>
            <li> Those two scars no longer have indentations, that is to say the skin has \\&quot;filled in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this product to me when I had a suspicious mole removed from my face (which fortunately was benign).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product, it seems to smooth the scar away and makes it look</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for the cheap price folks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still there but smooth and fading.</li>
            <li> My surgeon recommended I get it after abdominal surgery, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Offering Free Music to all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use it as directed which does require dedication.</li>
            <li> And he wasn&#x27;t as fortunate.</li>
            <li> it is amazing at how much his arm has healed in just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Great price for a bigger tube</li>
            <li> good product it lighten my old cars.</li>
            <li> found this product is good for old scar too, so</li>
            <li> so far, so good.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s better than having the scars, right?).  </li>
            <li> Happy,and it really works!!!</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m not near as embarrassed in public, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about showing my &#x27;good side&#x27; any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the burns healed really well on their own, but I used this product and it is probably the best healed scar I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I originally intended to buy the advanced one</li>
            <li> , that originally came as gels for burns, and can now be bought as sheets attached to a band-aid like backing.</li>
            <li> Try acupuncture, dermarolling, sesame oil, and maybe lasers if you are rich.</li>
            <li> It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  </li>
            <li> The color did not fade significantly or disappear as the example on the tube suggested it would; however it seems to have improved somewhat.  </li>
            <li> Used it once a day and got significant results.</li>
            <li> He did recommend that I try Eucerin Original Healing - Soothing Repair Creme.  </li>
            <li> You just have to make sure you follow the directions and apply consistently.</li>
            <li> My scars have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> Has significantly diminished my c-section scar.</li>
            <li> spreads clean and has no terrible smell and works very well and very quickly</li>
            <li> In fact, most scars spontaneously reduce in redness and prominence over the course of several months.</li>
            <li> am very happy that Mederma has given me my clear skin back.</li>
            <li> an keep it clean for the gel to do</li>
            <li> An excellent product for an old sore which was healed, but it left a mark which would not go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are positive reviews on this product, maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> She picked off a scab on her face and the resulting scar was bright red.</li>
            <li> Great Product, work as expected.</li>
            <li> To the person who wrote patroleum jelly is just as good as Mederma, you have a big issue in your theory...</li>
            <li> some applications, it can feel very itchy, but I think that&#x27;s it at work. :)</li>
            <li> a day, my skin looks gorgeous and my pores even look smaller.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t gone completely , you still can see when closer but the color kind of blended in.</li>
            <li> Not too cool.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve used it the full 6 weeks (recommended to see improvement)</li>
            <li> They offered a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Such a good price.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really nervous so this made me more nervous.</li>
            <li> buy the largest tube for full value for money.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve bought a box full at that time.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know yet the full results.  </li>
            <li> However, I began using it on an old scar that I got about 2 years ago and it is fading nicely.</li>
            <li> they were not bad</li>
            <li> My doctor told me about this ointment and it work great my old and new scars.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> this is the best scar product, and this is the best price i have found it for for this big of size since its a very expensive brand in any market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for you skin and for other scars.</li>
            <li> to what other reviewers have mentioned about it flaking or balling up, I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.  </li>
            <li> They were quick to respond (within 2 days), however they refused to replace my almost-expired product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work super quick and the scars don&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> I got stretch marks while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But for certain scars and with persistence, it can have a good effect.ll take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar</li>
            <li> Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  </li>
            <li> Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  </li>
            <li> Ok for new scars, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> The scar color has really faded (it can easily be covered with make up now).</li>
            <li> (Pretty!)</li>
            <li> sure this is a great product for those who are not allergic, but just be aware of the fact that you may have a negative reaction to it.</li>
            <li> but scar is exactly as it was originally.</li>
            <li> I bought it and to my ASTONISHMENT it stopped the itching the first day!  </li>
            <li> I first bought this, it was $15.99 (Prime), now it&#x27;s over $28!  </li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> It takes some time but its worth it.</li>
            <li> The one thing worth buying is silicone gel treatments like Scar-Away</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and only gel.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The perfume in this product irritated my fresh scars.</li>
            <li> works even better if you catch the scar early on.</li>
            <li> There is, however, a distinct discoloration at the site.</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to work better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It gives me hope and self-esteem to know that I am taking action to better</li>
            <li> Most of the results people get are from the skin naturally healing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue with my regimen for a month + as it recommends, but it really is powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> Then I just got some burn blisters on several locations on the top of my feet (HOT food on sandals!!).</li>
            <li> I bought every kind of lotion for it - shea butter, coconut oil, Vitamin E, hand lotions of every variety, special dry skin lotions...</li>
            <li> When my wound healed, I applied Mederma quickly and CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away after the bandages came off.</li>
            <li> came right away</li>
            <li> I got the product right away.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the one downside to this is that it makes my skin itchy right where I applied the cream.</li>
            <li> And this time the itching was unbearable right away.</li>
            <li> I receive the product on time and begin using right away...</li>
            <li> If you use it right away, the scar is gone.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and feel pretty confident that the scar will eventually be nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mine had already expired the same month I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is effective if used consistently, there should just be disclosure regarding expiration.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It has been more than a year from the accident and scar is barely visible.</li>
            <li> I had seen many Doctors, a top dermtologist, a regular dermatologist, other Doctors, asked my parents for help, asked the top Oral Surgeon who performed the surgery for help, and _nothing</li>
            <li> so I really couldn&#x27;t use the full amount.</li>
            <li> Right now it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> I had a C-Section and hadn&#x27;t exactly started using this product right away.  </li>
            <li> This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don&#x27;t have many stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The price was good because the product&#x27;s expiration date is less than two months from the day I received it.</li>
            <li> problem with Mederma is it really dries out my skin, to the point of causing mild irritation when I use it.</li>
            <li> Have not used the product yet, however have used other products from this manufacturer before and was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I got stitches right below my eyebrow two months before my wedding and thought for sure I&#x27;d have a hideous red scar in all of my pictures.</li>
            <li> I use a vitamin e oil and it seems to be fine, but some may be sensitive to the soy or safflower oils?</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by how quickly it arrived!</li>
            <li> I used it twice daily as recommended and it was okay.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of months, and running out, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the slow progress I was making.</li>
            <li> The scars appeared to be having some effect by the time first tube was over..</li>
            <li> Yes , it wont work on first tube.</li>
            <li> I lost 70 pounds in 2 months, and 30lbs of it was lost in the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The only therapy that might be better than placebo are silicone gels, pads, etc.</li>
            <li> And I started first using bio oil.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in the first week, and it seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> I will notify my Dermatologist, and I would like all to know that buyer&#x27;s should be aware that it is not \\&quot;uncommon\\</li>
            <li> Amazon is not at fault; I constantly trust them to provide me with most products I buy;  </li>
            <li> The big tube is a much better value depending on the price</li>
            <li> hope it can be more discount in next time</li>
            <li> This product really works for acne scars!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first heard of Mederma</li>
            <li> I was willing to give anything a shot.</li>
            <li> Be aware that you may be allergic to this product.</li>
            <li> most days I can only do one application (before I go to bed), but on days where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup all day I can do 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this helps you guys ;)</li>
            <li> I love it for the scars on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I used 3 times a day and could see results in the first week.</li>
            <li> my scar became bigger and more swollen please dont buy this scam of a product.</li>
            <li> except that why the heck did my doc not mention this the first time.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with everything about this order except that the product arrived with an expiration date in only a week after which it arrived.</li>
            <li> I would rather buy it there than hassle with the return, not to mention all of the emails to even get a refund in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Also, I think it will take too many weeks before seeing if this is the proper treatment for me.  </li>
            <li> This product absolutely works!</li>
            <li> so I gave up on it after I finished the first tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, but already I can tell that, what should have been a significant scar is now significantly smoother and flatter that I would have ever imagined.</li>
            <li> Every scar I get stays red for years and they never get better.</li>
            <li> I used about 7 tubes to make my first set of scars.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen it first hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the first time, it was ok after applying but at 2nd time, my face got so itch that I couldn&#x27;t even sleep at all.</li>
            <li> I glad I bought it through Amazon instead of twice the price at a local store.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with using this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty unattractive and sort of embarressing at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually works better than cocoa butter,</li>
            <li> Received on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The first 3 weeks I was using Mederma</li>
            <li> also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I leave a comment on Amazon EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I might see more improvement if I&#x27;m patient enough :</li>
            <li> Just be aware of what you are getting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but since you have to apply it a few times a day it has become quite costly.  </li>
            <li> Like others mentioned, it seems to work better on new scars as opposed to old (and in my experience, the newer the scar, the faster the result).</li>
            <li> While I know it will take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar</li>
            <li> From what I read, other brands are just as effective (</li>
            <li> the price is pretty high, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it since I won&#x27;t have a scar.</li>
            <li> That it only might work was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Mederma is okay but be ready to fork over some big money: they want you to put it on 4 times a day for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I had foot surgery Jan of this year and the scar was pretty long and prominent.</li>
            <li> I used it several times a day and for a good 3 months and still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Silicone sheets (and to a lesser extent gels) have really helped my scars and there have been many studies showing their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised that I could see results so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Really, you only just need a very rich creme if you want results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has surgery a little over two months mow and the scar goes from pelvis to pelvis and right now it is like a fine line when it was huge before I could not be happier i will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed positive results.</li>
            <li> The gel didn&#x27;t soak in for a long time and many people asked what it was on my skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much although I used exactly as was instructed on the tube.</li>
            <li> I also bought the new and improved fresh scent formula.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after previously having the kind of mederma that is like a 1.5&amp;#34; carmex tube.</li>
            <li> liked this a lot because it worked on some old scars, but realize that you&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot of money over a long period of time to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot determine how well the product performs because it has such a strong floral scent that I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> I have a large skin graft on my lower leg that was kept covered by strips that had a petroleum jelly substance on it until it healed.</li>
            <li> But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Also, you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine and only needed to be used once a day.  </li>
            <li> I used it on the scars my acne left and they have faded away so quickly!</li>
            <li> rated very high.  </li>
            <li> Very good, so I can say on what went wrong out of it?</li>
            <li> My face was messed up with this huge, deep scar.</li>
            <li> ; It ended up a huge, itching red lump that never went away or turned into a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scar like the rest of the incision.</li>
            <li> I love Mederma and think its really effective I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like the cream Mederma and bought it after sampling this gel product they offer.  </li>
            <li> So when I went for a refill, I bought the Walgreens store brand instead since it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like Maderma...</li>
            <li> Mederma works very well, I tried Bio Oil and it just did not work.  </li>
            <li> Of course I would purchase this again,if fact I&#x27;ll be doing that real soon.</li>
            <li> And I have to say, it does absolutely work.</li>
            <li> I guess its proof the stuff is really doing something.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable, and I could tell it was a distraction to people speaking to me.</li>
            <li> This work very well.</li>
            <li> , you may end up with too much.</li>
            <li> I really did not want a scar.</li>
            <li> So for results, follow the directions very closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I still have scars, they aren&#x27;t visible unless you really look closely.</li>
            <li> The texture of my scars have changed, and the color has faded so much that whenever I put makeup on you can&#x27;t even see my scars</li>
            <li> but it cost way too much.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working.  </li>
            <li> I tried to focus on one scar to see If it would do as it is supposed too but couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> I gave it some time, but the redness did not fade readily.</li>
            <li> Thanks to them, my Mederma expires soon</li>
            <li> i dont really know about mederma</li>
            <li> it makes your skin real flaky and it peels off</li>
            <li> The scar is fading thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was going to rip the skin off, I scratched it so much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ridiculous to spend this much money on something that expires so</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say whether it just faded from time, or if the product really worked.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well on healing scars after surgery.  </li>
            <li> Works so fast and well.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> all very serious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is much cheaper than the one I got from CVS.</li>
            <li> I bought this product two weeks ago to try it out and haven&#x27;t seen much change.  </li>
            <li> At the very beginning, I felt iching.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> It is also too pricey to keep repurchasing to see if it really helps with time</li>
            <li> He has much darker skin as I do.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> am also using this with another scar product that I really like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping Mederma would help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Did not do much for me.</li>
            <li> I think this works very well.  </li>
            <li> Before and after pictures show absolutely noooo change in appearance.</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 months straight as directed and still nothing.  </li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t even see where the scratches were now.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned and stopped applying this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works for my case, since it takes a while to find out.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> , the gel is really watery.  </li>
            <li> She said that this product doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> but it is really helping get rid of the scars.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping does not expire for a year</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I have a scar that I have had for over twenty years that required several stitches, is light in color, but still noticeable, and Mederma did not help.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> Mederma helped to significantly reduce a large scar on my knee from total knee joint replacement.  </li>
            <li> significantly_ not only reduced the appearance of the scar but the actual scarring itself, I would not be able to concentrate enough to have saved many of the lives I have saved in my life, nor would I be without significant pain on a portion of my body that I use constantly.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; white scar (a year old or more) that has begun looking more like the color of my skin, but will probably take a little longer to go</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that i love this product</li>
            <li> For me, it is most effective with dark scars, particularly from burns, in which case I apply Mederma almost immediately (obviously if here is an open wound, one should wait until it is healed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I have seen a good result, the scar is smoother(used to be a tiny bump) and less visible.</li>
            <li> Since Mederma is very light and water based, it doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and seems to soak in quickly to dry skin, but it has also lasted for these last two months with extra in the tube to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The original size of that burn was about the size of nickel, with the most \\&quot;jelly\\&quot; in the middle and less raised in the edges.  </li>
            <li> They are obviously buying old/nearly expired product and passing it on to Amazon customers at full retail prices.  </li>
            <li> However, I did want to warn those with sensitive skin who are interested in using Maderma on their face.</li>
            <li> According to my surgeon this is a must for the GIANT scar he left on me (to be fair, he had to, it was the only way in).</li>
            <li> It seemed to work, but then again she was only 2 - and kids that young heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> have been seeing significantly improvement on my new poison ivy scars (from June) after only 5 or 6 uses!</li>
            <li> now, I think it does seem to help and really doesn&#x27;t hurt new scar formation.</li>
            <li> The new formula is just one treatment per day, which is very convinient.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my new scar.  </li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll be happy--and it appears to be going in that direction at a steady pace.</li>
            <li> This stuff made the red scar more red.</li>
            <li> I bought the larger 1.76 oz tube after I realized that I was going to use up the smaller size fairly quickly with that many daily applications.  </li>
            <li> For older scars, it&#x27;s substantially longer.</li>
            <li> and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months -</li>
            <li> and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months -</li>
            <li> My surgeon recommended this particular cream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for older scars.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; should be listed as the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> The scar was starting to blend in with my skin and now after 3 months it has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> so luckily we will likely use it before it expires.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me with older scars.</li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of Pura d&#x27;or more but it is also more expensive.</li>
            <li> I think that I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, but only at home or when I know I won&#x27;t be seen in public. :)</li>
            <li> It is working really well so far thank God!</li>
            <li> Anyways, the expiration date is next month, so apparently Mary&#x27;s Market is buying old or expired goods and selling them at top dollar.  </li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant to use, and actually works.  </li>
            <li> I was miffed at the high price, but had been told by my doctors that this was what I should buy.</li>
            <li> It has a high price for a non-scientific product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product</li>
            <li> Im going to start high school soon</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using the product post surgery to elimiante scaring.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my new c-section scar and on my mother&#x27;s new burn scar, not so well on another older scar but still trying.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin (he&#x27;s allergic to certain detergents, deodorants, etc) but has had no issues with the Mederma.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed a major change the first time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It was OK in the beginning, but then around week 3, it started to itch a little.</li>
            <li> It works on the new and old scars, certainly diminished visibility, and softened the lumps (adhesions) the older scars had formed.</li>
            <li> The opening of the top is too large for the small amount I normally need to use.</li>
            <li> It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product on new surgical scars and on older scars from moles being removed.</li>
            <li> Not messy and don&#x27;t use too much as it flakes off.  </li>
            <li> but it is working very well so far.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few days before trying it again (just to make sure) and</li>
            <li> You will see noticeable result in 2 weeks and full result in about 6 to 8 weeks on minor scars.</li>
            <li> More severe scars will take a few months to see a change, depending on your body and skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only con is the price, but it is well worth</li>
            <li> And a bigger smile.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear it for more than I few minutes.</li>
            <li> Using the cocoa butter stick has the same exact results and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> So just clean your cut with simple soap and water (anti-bacterial gels and soaps don&#x27;t help other than to make you more resistant to anti-biotics, so they are actually a detriment!!!)</li>
            <li> If this is a new scar, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  </li>
            <li> As I have a lot of product I will continue to apply..  Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  </li>
            <li> really recommend this product to anyone who has a new or an old scar.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the local pharmacy and an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Sure, they haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, but this product has made a substantial difference in half the time frame that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I quickly used the product within a week the scar changed from thick to smooth</li>
            <li> even so I&#x27;m still having to use a 3 pack every month due to the huge area I have to cover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is on new scars</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Onion extract gel versus petrolatum emollient on new surgical scars: prospective double-blinded study\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> In a live chat with a rep named Stephanie I was directed to the product that needs to be applied two or three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I already can see a reduction in the redness of the new scars.</li>
            <li> I plan to be a cardiovascular surgeon in New York City.</li>
            <li> Growing new skin?</li>
            <li> might try a new method idk...........</li>
            <li> a new scar.</li>
            <li> It does seem to lighten a new scar but doesn&#x27;t take them away like</li>
            <li> She used it on the advise of her Podiatrist for new Bunyan scars.  </li>
            <li> After going online to do some research, I threw out my new tube.</li>
            <li> The directions say for a new scar, use it 3 - 4 times a day for 8 weeks, which I intend to do.</li>
            <li> They also say the only thing that breaks down scar tissue is silicone, and the only good (and affordable) cream that contains this ingredient is Scarzone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several surgeries, I been using Mederma for about 5 years on various scars throughout the years and have seen a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> sure enough I got itchy and pink</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the price you pay for a tube that will last longer than a month, but that&#x27;s the same price available in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> The info on the box is very clear about the time line to get results.</li>
            <li> It even worked in fading very old (i.e.,15 years)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin....</li>
            <li> also have a deep scar that is 35 years old right smack on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> The tube is still at least half full and the scar color is dramatically better!  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you understand that it is not magic</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product on the first knee replacement, and will apply it to the scar from a second knee replacement s soon as my doctor clears it.</li>
            <li> I first used this product back in 2005, recommended by my podiatrist, after I had surgery on both of my feet.</li>
            <li> The gel completely got rid of four of the six scars!</li>
            <li> The doctor and his nurse looked at it - red, throbbing, hot, swollen, oozing -- and said, &amp;#34;Just put Neosporin on it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I assume the doctor cut pretty deep, after all, baby gotta come out after all!</li>
            <li> For this reason I&#x27;m not sure I will be able to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The scars look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 1 month I starting to see improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time using this product and it will be my last.</li>
            <li> I got married last December</li>
            <li> We would both say we saw small but noticeable improvement in one week that to us seemed greater than E.  </li>
            <li> I applied a small amount, and once it had soaked into my skin on my face, I applied it once more.</li>
            <li> But, as most things in life, it is not a magical on time use product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like supporting a mom-and-pop business in the digital age.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference, the white spots start looking more as my regular skin color</li>
            <li> I burned my hand in a kitchen oven and the burn scar it left me was pretty unsightly.</li>
            <li> I recently burned my skin and my first instinct was to apply Mederma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on a new injury and it does seem to be softer and hasn&#x27;t developed a scab.</li>
            <li> Old or new scars</li>
            <li> This helps minimize old and new scars and burn marks.</li>
            <li> some old, some new.</li>
            <li> I tried it on some new and old scars.</li>
            <li> leaving two huge brown spots on his forehead the color of black coffee....</li>
            <li> It will however make them smooth and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> They are quite severe stretch marks (they are 8 years old and some are a full inch wide)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin &amp; this was  the first product that has EVER irritated &amp; made my skin red.</li>
            <li> I first tried Mederma back in the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was quite sceptical about this cream because my scar was still bumpy and red and this magical cream took the sweling down and the redness out.</li>
            <li> I was positive I would need stitches, it was quite deep.</li>
            <li> Last week, I got a new pair of glasses, which reinflamed the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I used it on both a new scar and an old one daily for 3 months, it has done absolutely nothing to either scar.</li>
            <li> but  I think it works good for new strength marks ( Still pink or red) not older ones( white and shining).</li>
            <li> I work in a pharmacy, and the general opinion of our pharmacists is that mederma is basically just sunscreen, which aids in the prevention of scarring, but is not for the treatment of older scars.</li>
            <li> Have a scar right under my lower lip, used this every single day, didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I had a large (3\\&quot; by 4\\&quot;),deep scrape on my arm</li>
            <li> I read on one website that you need to rub it in hard and make sure it is fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I managed to skillfully slice a huge hole in my arm.</li>
            <li> and as you can clearly see, that is what&#x27;s happening.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with blemishes, but over the years I&#x27;ve had a few that left marks on my chin,</li>
            <li> Did not use the product as it is not what I expected, therefore, the rating is for Beauty Time, not the product.&lt;br /&gt;The supplier, Beauty Time, posted a picture of a box of ADVANCED mederma in the ad, but sent regular mederma.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It help clear my scars</li>
            <li> It does have a slight floral scent but its a clean, lotion type smell.</li>
            <li> Any light pink acne scars or patches have almost totally disappeared.</li>
            <li> So far, she is stisfied with the results</li>
            <li> But so far,  I like it</li>
            <li> Its too early to have a conclusion, but as far as i used Mederma i can say that the results is coming soon.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product if you tend to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> old scars.</li>
            <li> Just softening it so far.</li>
            <li> Maderma works really well with scars and such.</li>
            <li> Googled \\&quot;Mederma causing rash\\&quot; and found that a number of people had developed a rash from using this product.</li>
            <li> if it makes you itchy, don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> the scar had faded away completely.</li>
            <li> i used 2 tubes so far</li>
            <li> I do like it, it helped me  with my cut a bit I still have more to go, but at least it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve switched to the all natural derma-e scar gel</li>
            <li> If none of this fades the scar completely, I&#x27;ll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> If none of this fades the scar completely, I&#x27;ll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> This product is not messy (which I appreciate because up until I started using it</li>
            <li> Smells like old flowers or something, but it goes away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be working clear up my acne scars.</li>
            <li> YOU PEEL THE JUNK OFF.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE MONEY</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> not working for old one.</li>
            <li> Far too smelly to apply once a day let alone 3-4 times recommended.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this often as she burns herself frequently at work.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s nearly two weeks</li>
            <li> Somewhat late delivery, but ok.</li>
            <li> and i dont really feel different</li>
            <li> After a year of using this cream my scar has gone away completely.</li>
            <li> and the scar is completely gone</li>
            <li> my skipped times and stopping early had something to do with it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was too old of scar.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks and found the mark much</li>
            <li> Will try it on old scars when I finish with this one.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li> How can this cream work for old scars within  3 months?</li>
            <li> So far, there&#x27;s been no sign of a keloid or rippling of the skin at the site of the wounds.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> After a month, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> my scar is nearly gone</li>
            <li> Maybe my scar is too old, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Old cream.</li>
            <li> Or how about old fashion lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me or my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far not working.</li>
            <li> old, and she is 12 years old now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received item undamaged and on time as far as delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Would use seller again.</li>
            <li> As far as the product, it&#x27;s too soon for me to rate its effectiveness</li>
            <li> This makes it soft again and stops the hurt.</li>
            <li> Whenever I had a big scar or one I wanted to fade fast</li>
            <li> It does work, don&#x27;t expect it completely remove scars.</li>
            <li> Would rather the advanced version that you only apply 1x daily vs this which is 3x daily.</li>
            <li> but it does take time to get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> a day later it got really itchy.  </li>
            <li> The marks from the thread used to sew his arm are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Because of how well it has worked so far for him, I intend to purchase some of the stretch mark cream once my baby is born in February.</li>
            <li> I think it does take time on old ones.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see them, I can barley feel them and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a month on scars that i developed from my childhood.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat expensive, but I shopped around and got it at good prices.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see how my scars will look in a few months time of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lastly, yes it is true scars will heal the same without the help of beauty products or over the counter products, but then you will be left with a scar still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not CRAZY itchiness, like other reviewers have said,</li>
            <li> I scar easily and despite Neosporin and Biafine this turned into a scaly red mess that took weeks to fade.</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had many small scars in various places from the liposuction and started using Scar Reducing Herbal Creme just for those scars.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the low-down on Mederma if one is not an avid user like myself: Mederma takes time to reduce the appearance of the scar, it must be applied religiously 3-4 times a day, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough</li>
            <li> I have been using this pretty religiously (4 times a day) for the last 7 days</li>
            <li> this major surgery scar does now!  </li>
            <li> I am almost positive it will be completely gone (OR PRETTY CLOSE) in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> The scar has bothered me since I was 19, where as I grew, the tightness grew more and more painful, such that I could not fully concentrate to the degree</li>
            <li> I also tried it on an old scar from last summer, but haven&#x27;t really seen anything different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not that long ago that doctors were telling people that scars were for life and that there was nothing that could be done about them, so one has to have reasonable expectations when dealing with a scar.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it if you just want to get the color back to normal.</li>
            <li> I can testify that this definitely works on new scars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have been using it once a day; also, if I apply too much at once, it tends to dry out and peel up.</li>
            <li> Mederma slows the progression of the condition, but I don&#x27;t plan to use it my entire life, so ultimately it will progress and end wherever it wants.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not under the illusion that they will completely vanish, but if they even turn grey and blend in with the skin like normal stretch marks</li>
            <li> - the product works with MULTIPLE DAILY applications and it takes MONTHS for the results to show, much longer than what the Mederma manufacturer states</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than at local drugstores and arrived in very short time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works--I got scratched on the entire left side of my face by my cat, to the point where everyone who noticed my scars had a horrified reaction and warned me that the scarring would probably never go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that gives total relief from intense itching.</li>
            <li> i seen results major results in size and color  </li>
            <li> Ordered it for my friend who had major surgery.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think there is anything out that will remove major scars in a month.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not the first time they sent out the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14, read other people&#x27;s reviews, those people also had received the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14.</li>
            <li> Mederma was a subject of a scientific study (citation below), and it was found to be no more effective than petroleum jelly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  </li>
            <li> I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  </li>
            <li> It has almost completey hidden the right scar &amp;</li>
            <li> The tube is not that large and it doesn&#x27;t last all that long.</li>
            <li> What used to be dark red and highly visible across the room is now light pink and only visible if viewed up close</li>
            <li> Massage in general does depending on location.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The scar tissue is now barely raised and is flexible.</li>
            <li> im 22 yr old male</li>
            <li> Within two weeks it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It had to be fixed by plastic surgeon, however that left him with the 5cm scar on his forehead.</li>
            <li> They are not as red and some have gone away completely.</li>
            <li> The surgical scar on my chest has gone from an itchy, swollen welt to barely there.</li>
            <li> I used this product on it for about 4 months and now the scars are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it barely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It is too early in the process to know how it will actually work.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who used Mederma for 3 years on his scar and now you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> i swear by this, and although others say that there are natural remedies that beat mederma, i have used countless products that work this well.  </li>
            <li> and now I can barely  see them.</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 of using this and my cut has already gone from blatantly obvious to something that looks months old.</li>
            <li> Again, it is a GEL and leaves a white, sticky-looking residue but dries completely after a minute</li>
            <li> room for 007&lt;br /&gt;(or a sour kraut Hot Dawg with Mustard or relish!)&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> an during the day I used cocoa butter now you can hardly notice them it really really&lt;br /&gt;Works !!!</li>
            <li> My main goal with using this or any other product is to reduce the redness brought on by the severe acne I&#x27;ve had through my teens and early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My new wounds stretch from hip to hip and essentially armpit to armpit (under each breast to try to conceal it as much as possible).</li>
            <li> The scars were fresh, and they responded extremely well to the product, especially when I applied it twice daily</li>
            <li> Having said that I must also say that my scar was right down the middle of my nose.</li>
            <li> It was an age spot, or dead skin, a blotch, on my right cheekbone, the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> , most likely due to the clusters of little red bumps I noticed were surrounding the area.</li>
            <li> I also used it as a daily facial moisturizer  and noticed it quickly made my acne dark spots disappear!</li>
            <li> It was after their own ridiculous mailing deadline of two weeks for a product less than two ounces.  </li>
            <li> This stuff helped fade them and actually made them soft and feel like my regular skin again.</li>
            <li> It works well so far on smaller scars, but one of my larger scars, does not seem to be lightening at all!!</li>
            <li> I SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS ORDER LAST TIME.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had several burn scars disappear almost entirely with the help of Mederma, although I did exfoliate the area (once the injury was completely healed) in addition to using the product.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of deep red scratch scars (about 6 months old), and after 7 days the color is lighter, the edges \\&quot;softer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Let me say at first I was a little upset my son an</li>
            <li> I am now into my fourth day into using it, and there has been major change to the appearance to my face.</li>
            <li> I spent $$$ on Mederma with high hopes to no avail.  </li>
            <li> It has now become evident that the Hypertrophic part of the scar on my knee (the upper half of the scar) is not benefiting from using Mederma.</li>
            <li> After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application.</li>
            <li> And I never noticed a difference; scars took just as long to fade with Mederma or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to put it bluntly, there have been very few trials with Mederma and of those, one found no significant difference of Mederma vs. placebo, and one found effective results...</li>
            <li> My complaint is that the last time I ordered I received a product called \\&quot;Mederma Advanced Scar Gel\\&quot; that stipulated both on the box and on the 50g tube:  \\&quot;only 1X daily\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I tried other creams and lotions but Mederma has been the only one that is really working.</li>
            <li> Getting this far has taken a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I havent used it long enuff to know whether they will eventually be gone completely, tho.</li>
            <li> Now 4 months later, scar is barely visible...</li>
            <li> I used this stuff religiously after my surgery and now you can barely see my scar.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the smaller acne scars were almost completely unnoticeable, the larger scars were only a bit distorted, but still the product was affective on them.</li>
            <li> So Ive been using this pretty faithfully for a few weeks now (in conjunction with microdermabrasion by neutrogena)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s considered a fresh scent in Germany(where</li>
            <li> I also tried on my son who had a small fresh scar just from a scratch on his face and that didnt work either.</li>
            <li> I did use it everyday when I first received it and see no changes in the scar.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to say, no one even notices I had a pretty bad gash on my forehead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received product fast, but when I opened the box I noticed the product had less than a month until it expires.</li>
            <li> The first few times I applied it, I got a red rash.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use, no odor, or sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li> And it really takes SO LITTLE</li>
            <li> thought it would be good idea to try StriVectin on my stomach (just above the tummy tuck scar) since I had bad stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Obviously this seems to work well for some; unfortunately, I am one of those that experienced a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> After the first few days I thought my scar was actually fading, but by the 5th day of use, the scar felt strange, almost raised</li>
            <li> Studies clearly show no benefit in using scar products (with one exception - silicone gel) versus plain old petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I have a major scar on my hand that gets very dry and sore.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly recommended for acne scars, which I have, on a few different web pages I searched.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell though as I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a week.</li>
            <li> Good thing is it absorbs fast, bad thing is that it&#x27;s hard to target the spot of my small-ish burn scars.  </li>
            <li> and if you apply too much it may leave a mark (because it changes the physical composition of previously damaged skin by causing re-organization of the collagen and other components of the scar</li>
            <li> This works well the only down side is it must be applied for several months for major results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma in the past and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> After using Maderma for a few days on a scar on my forehead (curling iron!), the area now becomes very itchy whenever the product dries after application.</li>
            <li> (This has actually been known for a long time and is not the point of my review.</li>
            <li> this product has had a lot of hype behind it and as much as i wish it was backed up by personal results, I still can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m completely displeased.</li>
            <li> The price keeps escalating and the tube does not last long.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes new products cause a little rashing, so</li>
            <li> I ordered this large tube on Amazon, and I immediately exchanged the store brand for another tube of Mederma, and the scar is back on track for a slow resolution.</li>
            <li> When this stuff dries, a little clear film it left on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was deathly ill and couldn&#x27;t get any treatment for it and after regaining the weight I now have a belly full of probably 50 major scars from my thighs to my lower chest.</li>
            <li> Has the same awesome results and active ingredient without all the nasty chemicals AND no itch, no film, no hassle.</li>
            <li> So far, two of the three scars seem to much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A small amount really does go a long way but</li>
            <li> Now 3 weeks later, the furious red gumball-sized nodule of the scar looks a milder shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Used religiously morning and night until entire tube was empty.</li>
            <li> - I think the bottle will last a long, long</li>
            <li> It is just a waste of money and time....and even worse it caused a flare in my acne, hence giving me more scars.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from pure vitamin e, to other scar reduction creams, laser, hydroquinone cream 6% from my dermatologist, just to name a few.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another negative observation is that I can still see some of the burns that were very superficial - they healed like regular scars and I still have much darker skin in that area (note that I apply the Mederma with the same schedule/intensity as I apply it to the serious burn scars).  </li>

            <li> I am of Russian and Germany decent, so I am very white and have super bad skin.</li>
            <li> I keloid and have found that regular Vit-E works way better and way less expensive.</li>
            <li> I had liposuction along with a tummy tuck with excellant results except for the scar from one end of my abdomen to the other -- actually wrapping around my tummy to my back.  </li>
            <li> I asked my doctor and he indicated that Mederma was only distinguished from other basic lotions by its marketing.</li>
            <li> Apparently the active ingredient is derived from onion.</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s helping minimize the ugliness of said scar.</li>
            <li> i have been using this scar for a really long time every since i was 12 or 13 and im 20</li>
            <li> Just had surgery and have an enormously long scar I will get to work on after the stitches are gone.</li>
            <li> but I never lasted as long as I should..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long, noticible scar.  </li>
            <li> These were not old scars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it changes my skin because I didn&#x27;t use it for long.</li>
            <li> not sure if it actually works, or if my skin just naturally healed and scars faded since it took a long time to fade.</li>
            <li> I purchased Scar Away patches for roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> At this moment I only can talk about delivery because the results of the teatment are expected in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do not know how long it should take to see any results.</li>
            <li> It was really strange experience for me.</li>
            <li> so even if it works it does take a long long time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone whose skin has not quite healed though I do not know about long term or surgery scars.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that it was very helpful for the normal part of the scar - the part that didn&#x27;t go Hypertrophic at the outset - but ultimately failed to reverse the Hypertrophic condition.</li>
            <li> Whereby my previous tube (different supplier, same price point) indicates 1X (as in the commercials).</li>
            <li> Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  </li>
            <li> I had a two-plus year old scar from an old burn, and I put this stuff on and it has been slowly disappearing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, I would recommend trying an aloe gel first, I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Same with Vitamin E and all the other products.</li>
            <li> I saw results after 15 days as I have extensive scarring from having my larynx removed due to cancer.</li>
            <li> The other two scars are still visible, but like I said, only when you are looking closely at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I would say that this product may work differently with other skin types.</li>
            <li> After couple of days his face turned red due to allergic reaction of this cream.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered the other Mederma that you only apply once a day.</li>
            <li> The gel has left a very dark spot in the middle of my forehead</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the item for very long</li>
            <li> However, it does over dry the face a lot</li>
            <li> It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have some serious scars on the front of my leg from a December treadmill accident and this stuff has really faded them out alot.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this with store brands of scar gel (I had bought the name brand on Amazon because it was a comparable price to the store brands), so maybe the itchiness is just a Mederma characteristic?</li>
            <li> I have not really seen any major results but maybe some slight results i am questioning if even that but using it for a while</li>
            <li> so I would not recommend using it every single day.</li>
            <li> Instead of being raised and hard, it is flat and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin till this past December</li>
            <li> It was a bite that he scratched continuously and it left a dark scar.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Mederma daily for 4 months and see very little if any improvement in the appearance of my numerous scars.</li>
            <li> and it made very clear that Mederma and all the other products (with one exception-silicone gel) worked no better than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Two and a half months ago, I had a mole removed from my upper lipline.</li>
            <li> I had surgery recently and used this product has directed for about a month and half and stopped after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for it short of Accutane, and in less than a week, using this product 4x</li>
            <li> A lot less red acne spots.</li>
            <li> , it seems less noticeable and is starting to blend</li>
            <li> Used to over time the color and dimension of scar becomes less obvious.</li>
            <li> So I can use it only for less than 2 months?</li>
            <li> This was my second surgery and the scar is much less noticeable since using mederma.</li>
            <li> I find its odor to be non-offensive and vaguely lemony and once the product rubs into the skin (which is quickly)</li>
            <li> This product actually helped to make my scars a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> so it takes time and repeated applications and, if it is a large scar, such as my graft, it is expensive.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, I wouldn&#x27;t call it appealing, but it doesn&#x27;t stay or anything.</li>
            <li> There is still a scar but it has lost most of the ugly, snarled appearance it started off with.</li>
            <li> just as well only difference is you must apply it at least 3 times daily but after getting used to it that is no problem.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, the scar was worsening - growing in both height and width.</li>
            <li> sustained burns on my legs, one of which was quite deep and infected, it required heavy duty oral antibiotics (Augmentin) for weeks to heal.  </li>
            <li> When applying the gel just be careful to not get it on the non scarred skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days &amp; my scar looks &amp; feels softer.</li>
            <li> also read a report that tries to compare Mederma to the use of Petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> After using this product 1 month, the scar turn to a pink one.</li>
            <li> it was a total waste of money</li>
            <li> My scars were red when I started applying mederma, but now they&#x27;ve diminished to a point where they&#x27;re not that stark anymore.</li>
            <li> In the tradition of Bruce Lee and the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, Pink Floyd,&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This may not be a big deal if you only apply a small amount to a small scar, but take larger scars, and it is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying this product for a couple months, I noticed no visible difference with my scarring and the rough patch of skin didn&#x27;t soften up at all.  </li>
            <li> In just two weeks, my rough patch became softer.</li>
            <li> I usually use Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector, which I love, but was getting a bit too expensive for me at the time.</li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s itchy, I inevitably scratch or rub the area, which results in the product FLAKING off like dead skin.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $25。</li>
            <li> I had a few burns from three months ago that weren&#x27;t disappearing a month later</li>
            <li> Last night my husband commented how clear my skin looks (without makeup) - seriously, after a week!</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and helps the scar heal without any unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I also think the dark pigmentation is starting to get lighter, but as I obsessively look at the scars daily that sort of progress is hard to gage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like it, but my scar is very large and this stuff is expensive.</li>
            <li> I paid less than half what the pharmacy stores wanted for the same size.</li>
            <li> I began applying it to my surgery scars on my arm, and after a few days of following the instructions, my scars became extremely itchy and extremely pinkish-red.</li>
            <li> Scar Reducing Creme uses Olive Oil so it&#x27;s easier to spread and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit does go a long way)</li>
            <li> a little bit does go a long way)</li>
            <li> I bought a small tube of this after having total knee replacement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mix the cremes by applying one over the other but applied each of the three to separate parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day or every three days, depending on how my skin is doing.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had read the other reviews warning people of Mary&#x27;s Market.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small drop and massage in the area and leave it alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this after three days because like the other reviewer my face turned reddish and discolered on the areas I used this gel.  </li>
            <li> Since it is 3&amp;#34; above my belly button, my constant scratching looked weird in public.  </li>
            <li> my scar is faded and the other side is not.  </li>
            <li> I was encouraged to use mederma due to having had surgery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sitting in our cupboard for over a year, and it occurred to me the other day to use it on myself.  </li>
            <li> Next day he had a lot of small bumps around the area where it was applied and kept on growing in size and area.</li>
            <li> (my dermatologist recommended no more than twice daily).</li>
            <li> I treat other non-keloid scars and it worked.</li>
            <li> It made other scars look lighter and evened out the skin complexion in its surrounding.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product that did nothing to help my post surgical scars or a large rough patch of skin.  </li>
            <li> My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the active ingredient (the onion extract) or the vehicle</li>
            <li> active ingredient in Mederma is called allium cepa, which is onion extract that is found to have anti-bacterial as well as anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> Two months later, the scar is now part of my facial features and I am not happy about this.</li>
            <li> in rabbits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the active ingredient in Mederma is onion.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I am actively doing something about this problem (my scars).</li>
            <li> I have been applying it on a few small scars for a couple of weeks now, and now I have a wide spread rash encompassing the entire area!  </li>
            <li> I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small, look far worse than</li>
            <li> and yes the scar is lightening up day by day, but I am also dark in complexion and the skin around my scar is also lightening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already complained to Amazon - hopefully they will remove Mary&#x27;s Market as a third party seller.</li>
            <li> Now I have to use another product to lighten the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t optimistic, but I was desperate and it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tan skin with dark scars.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing to your dark spots.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of dark spots, buy Ambi.</li>
            <li> The dark color fades a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried to get over that uncomfortable feeling and began sleeping with the serum on my face, but in the morning I would wake up with a very irritated face and breakouts on my cheek</li>
            <li> : I have extremely sensitive skin and did not find this product at all irritating.</li>
            <li> I saw no signs of improvement after careful application everyday.  </li>
            <li> The scar itself is a pale pink color.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m one week down</li>
            <li> and I went down.</li>
            <li> and if you mix it with other cleaners and skin products it can cause burning - so follow the directions!)</li>
            <li> Silicone, on the other hand, is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
            <li> Be careful!!</li>
            <li> I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  </li>
            <li> but if you are self-concious about some scars or just would like them to be less noticeable (like me) I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also did not like the thick film it left after the application dried.</li>
            <li> Less redness than at the start,</li>
            <li> The scar seems smoother and with less coloration since using Mederma.</li>
            <li> I was deeply skeptical of a product I could buy OTC, but none of the prescription medications I have (including Biafine, which is more expensive even with insurance) had worked, either.</li>
            <li> A day later, after having applied Mederma four times, both scars were noticeably paler, smaller, and less angry.</li>
            <li> My face acne hair is less visible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In addition to onion extract, aloe is added to Mederma in order to soften the scar, making the wound less pronounced on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> they getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> have noticed slight scar reduction</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not received a less than 2oz tube of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an odd stickiness after applying to the scar.  </li>
            <li> I also think it smells a bit odd</li>
            <li> seems to be working,and is  half the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a 16 ounce jar of Eucerin for half the price of 1.76 ounces of Mederma.  </li>
            <li> I bought two of the medermas and I haven&#x27;t even gone through half of a tube of one</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were lighter, softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use half of my tube.</li>
            <li> I had a roughly 6 inch long scar on my are from trying to get my cat out of a fight that was super dark and ugly!</li>
            <li> Since I saw no difference, I was getting cortizone shots from my surgeon which would make the scars go down for a little bit</li>
            <li> I had been using Neosporin and wrapping the oily mess under gauze to keep it from making grease stains on my clothes and just wiping off) and it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all after I apply it.</li>
            <li> conclusion I draw from my experience is that perhaps Mederma will give painfully slow results to those seeking to lighten minor scars?  </li>
            <li> conclusion I draw from my experience is that perhaps Mederma will give painfully slow results to those seeking to lighten minor scars?  </li>
            <li> It is also a little pricey in my opinion (I paid $18 for a tube of less than one ounce</li>
            <li> It is also a little pricey in my opinion (I paid $18 for a tube of less than one ounce</li>
            <li> next to worse burns are two other scars which healed with indentations and very dark pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or irritated well at least for me it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month,and again it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> It is a little cheaper, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it expired with the month I recieved it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make it disappear, but I can see a little difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I was using it for about nine months with little to no result.</li>
            <li> I wish the price was a little lower though</li>
            <li> The one change I think I may be seeing is that my scars seem to be looking a little darker (closer to my skin</li>
            <li> It dries to your skin a little and within a few minutes you can peel it off.</li>
            <li> I may be a little impatient here, but I am not seeing any results</li>
            <li> I would purchase Mederma, use it for a few months straight, and quit in disappointment.</li>
            <li> My wife is using this on the scar from her knee replacement surgery and in only a couple of weeks the scar has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Neosporin and the like are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the process is not a fast one, but it IS working (and I&#x27;ve witnessed the slow contraction of the scar over the months).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> never worked on my acne scars waste of time.</li>
            <li> I had surgery a few months ago and ended up with 3 incisions on my belly.</li>
            <li> A few days after the stitches were removed, I started applying Mederma 2 to 3 times per day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few tubes of this</li>
            <li> I have had scars on the side of my head from acne for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mederma for years, and I have noticed that a few of my raised scars have flattened.  </li>
            <li> I applied it EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my hip from a motorcycle accident a few months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A Kennelog injection actually made things worse.</li>
            <li> the scar is already softer and almost invisible from a few areas.</li>
            <li> Two years ago, part of a vertical abdominal incision got infected a few days after I had surgery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> When I received this product,I think it has no effect in a few days.</li>
            <li> I was not happy, but the package had a coupon for $4 off next purchase</li>
            <li> and I was using this product everyday for 3 months before the wedding.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference at all, a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> I am still using Mederma and hopefully in few months the scars will be gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bumps went away after few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> have read posts where people complain that their C-section scars did not disappear after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> That said, using (waste not to—and returning a hassle) but will not reorder from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I fell and scraped my knee a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I fell down some stairs and scrapped up my face pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical when I bought it, and was half expecting to be disappointed again, but I find myself pleasantly surprised by the fact that Mederma may  actually be helping my pox scars fade!</li>
            <li> but if you are self-concious about some scars or just would like them to be less noticeable (like me) I would recommend this product.low the directions!)</li>
            <li> it has a slight onion smell, i can get past it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Plus, I think a little of the coloring has gone down, but it is hard to tell.</li>
            <li> This stiff is all peely after you start rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> I would like to point out I have generally terrible skin that scars and gets stretchmarks very easily.</li>
            <li> I did not see any change at all in my small little scars however the skin around it was turning lighter (just around the scars) not the scar itself.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been applying it 3 times a day for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> Since scar tissue forms a protective barrier over the skin, the allium cepa in Mederma means that the skin has less hard tissue to produce while the wound is fully healing.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do!</li>
            <li> Very little scaring</li>
            <li> i have bad scars from psoriasis and this stuff really helped fade them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since I had two small surgical procedures by my chest</li>
            <li> According to the article (which quotes recent studies), its merely the fact that all these products keep the scar moist.</li>
            <li> Bought the cream one with the SPF this past summer and returned it.</li>
            <li> I had a c-section pregnancy and have been using this twice a day for the past 5months.  </li>
            <li> Only downside item is, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> so I just ended up keeping the small tube at work.  </li>
            <li> and this helped them go away in time this past summer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Also the tube is rather small.</li>
            <li> and when I remember, guess not more than three times a day.</li>
            <li> I had a small surgery scar on my face.  </li>
            <li> past its sell-by date， when i get it , its almost colse to the validity date .</li>
            <li> No need to use alot just a small amout works well.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied at all with the product.</li>
            <li> I used this on a small scar on my face that had about 5 stiches a while ago.  </li>
            <li> I used Mederma after my first operation the scars weren&#x27;t horrible but they were enough to make me stop wearing a two piece bathing suit.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I do see some small improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this did anything to remove/reduce the scar that I was working on.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it&#x27;s expensive, but really no more so than a lot of beauty products.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I decided to try Mederma on the small scars that remained after an appendectomy.</li>
            <li> but my face dosent have any change .i am not sure it will remove any scar so far,but i stop&lt;</li>
            <li> Bottle kinda small if u use it 3 to 5 times a day asrecomended.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my neck that left a long and nasty scar.</li>
            <li> Like to pay less for same product, but too bad it&#x27;s too close to be expired when I got it.</li>
            <li> The burn is now about half the size of a dime, what is left is still quite ugly but changing.  </li>
            <li> My scar was invisible in my pictures and is hardly noticable in person.</li>
            <li> But lest assured at least there is a product that works...</li>
            <li> In time the scar went from raised, dark, and ugly to a thin, pail line that is barely raised.</li>
            <li> Scents also irritate my throat, negatively affecting my voice.  </li>
            <li> I googled around and this seems to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> Late January I slipped on ice and cut my chin, received 7 stitches.</li>
            <li> and it was traumatizing to say the least.</li>
            <li> product visibly reduced my scars at least 50% and even eliminated a LOT of them.  </li>
            <li> used it at least once at night and sometimes in the morning too.  </li>
            <li> Repeat at least every 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They need to ship the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of at least 1/15, since this product is supposed to diminish scars within 8 weeks-6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least 6 months to a year, and then re-evaluate the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is there a negative rating option ??</li>
            <li> I have some old acne scars and redness) and I am SHOCKED at the difference it has made already.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of the scars and has the luxury of time and doesn&#x27;t mind some investments to get rid of the annoying scars.</li>
            <li> and now i have two scars thanks to using this crap.</li>
            <li> The gel does not soak in and dries slowly.</li>
            <li> Because I hate this scar so much, I decided to stick with it.  </li>
            <li> got a terrible rash that ended up spreading and making my skin a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before I bought Mederma and was disappointed that several people felt qualified to place a review after just a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I hate the dark red scar on my leg.</li>
            <li> I decided to try to tough it out til my skin grew accustomed to it, but it only got worse and worse, and it seems to be making my scars darker!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about old scars, but if your scars are fairly recent like mine (stupid chicken pox), then this product SHOULD make a difference.</li>
            <li> I used the product as directed and by the time I fully healed, my scars were very small.</li>
            <li> I am an African American and I was very disappointed after having made this purchase that it did not work.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey IMO, tube is very small.</li>
            <li> If you are a Black woman, like me, and prone to hyperpigmentation, do not use this product!!!</li>
            <li> worst burn initially healed with a jelly-like puckered up texture - nothing like regular skin, purplish in color.  </li>
            <li> Upon reading about burn scars, the type of scar I described can be dealt with by surgically removing the weird skin and sawing up the skin around it (read expensive cosmetic procedure, and you&#x27;re still left with the scar from bringing the skin</li>
            <li> But this time they give me an address so they might be serious.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> : This causes some serious itchiness when applied.</li>
            <li> Going back to vitamin E, even though it smells bad,</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the product is close to expire.</li>
            <li> When it dries it becomes like an extra skin peeling off so it looks bad in front of others.</li>
            <li> I have to go to freshman orientation looking like a ugly pimple face with red marks on my face...</li>
            <li> I put it on other scars on my face from chicken pox</li>
            <li> Since this is somewhat expensive, I hate wasting it when too much comes out.</li>
            <li> I had a extremely horrible reaction after applying the product according to it&#x27;s instructions, my skin burned in the scar site, exactly where you don&#x27;t want a problem you had to have surgery for in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Works slowly--you have to put on at least 3/day and use for months, but it does work!</li>
            <li> Got into a pretty bad bike accident and scraped my face really bad.</li>
            <li> , now i have a very ugly dark spot in the center of my forehead that i can&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> Dries and scale after 15 mins of applying and very slow healing process</li>
            <li> (itch really Is not that bad)</li>
            <li> Well I walked into a dumpster (stupid story) and it had cut my nose open and the side of my face</li>
            <li> So for my second operation that happen this October (stupid gallbladder)I got another tube</li>
            <li> If so, that is a poor way to build customer relations.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I also wonder about just using something like a thin coating of Bacitracin.  </li>
            <li> Then, after putting it thinly on wound, iches disappear.</li>
            <li> But on week two it made my face worse.....</li>
            <li> This smells horrible and didn&#x27;t help too much with my scar.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my finger which got broken and ripped up when my motorcycle hit gravel</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews but for me this only made my skin worse; it made my face extremely itchy</li>
            <li> but I hate this scar!didn&#x27;t mix the cremes by applying one over the other but applied each of the three to separate parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I am a male who served in Iraq and I got very sick after being out in the dust storms and caught pneumonia.</li>
            <li> My wife took a bad spill several weeks ago leaving a really bad gash along her arm.  </li>
            <li> It smells like bad breath if it goes past its date.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife a few years after a bad cut left a nasty scar.  </li>
            <li> Until recently it was a terribly embarassing sight, but after 3 months they are noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li> this product is an expensive joke.</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day for one year to get the desired results has been terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I bought this to use on a scar on my sons forehead.  </li>
            <li> Last year in July my son had a terrible accident.</li>
            <li> It looked awful, and sometimes in the middle of my workday I would feel it bleeding.</li>
            <li> It did&#x27;t reduce my scar appearance at all and now not only do i still have a very horrible scar</li>
            <li> My advice is don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap</li>
            <li> I burned the side of my face up terribly a while back</li>
            <li> I have been using Mederma on a nasty scar I have and it is definitely working well.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for no results.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I am not impressed!</li>
            <li> Not about the product, since I am unable to use it, but in the seller Knockout Bargains.</li>
            <li> This is so wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible outbreak of rosacea this spring, and it has left a lot of scarring and redness.  </li>
            <li> I have laser burns all over my legs as a result of a laser hair removal session that went wrong.</li>
            <li> I was unable to wear a skirt or bathing suit for months.</li>
            <li> I was not happy!</li>
            <li> but I knew that left unattended, it would leave a terrible scar.</li>
            <li> Very thin gel.</li>
            <li> I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a severe sensitivity to scents causing  my sinuses to go crazy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t apply Mederma to dirty skin &amp; don&#x27;t cake it on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made) but this stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Very annoying and messy.</li>
            <li> or if I am Wolverine and can just heal crazy well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would reduce the visibility of the scars that I&#x27;ve had for years, but I was so sick of seeing myself as &#x27;scarface&#x27; when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li> SO MAD</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this expensive product.</li>
            <li> So lame!</li>
            <li> You will have to keep buying it to keep them covered up - plus the gel stinks... like, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> at least I know it wont cause horrible side effects!</li>
            <li> As you can see, I scar badly.</li>
            <li> sooo bad .  </li>

            <li> It has helped me heal from both a burn and a bad cut.</li>
            <li> and I knew the scarring would be bad.  </li>
            <li> Once I woke up, I went to the mirror to evaluate, and I was shocked.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> No wonder why their name is Knockout Bargains, they sell crap that is going to expire the month after you buy it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> My co-workers, family, and friends were completely shocked because they truly believed that they would not go away because of how awful they looked.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bough it for my daughter and she requested it by name. So far, she is stisfied with the results</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it seem to work fair.  It takes some time but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since I had two small surgical procedures by my chest and I noticed the scars are just starting diminishing a tiny bit. I am hoping to see better results. But so far,  I like it</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I used it on the scars my acne left and they have faded away so quickly! I googled ways to remove scarring and my dr. recommended this product! Plus Amazon had the cheapest price for the same product!</li>
            <li> My doctor told me about this ointment and it work great my old and new scars. I will recommen this ointment to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like the cream Mederma and bought it after sampling this gel product they offer.  The gel didn&#x27;t soak in for a long time and many people asked what it was on my skin.</li>
            <li> Had total knee replacement the 1st. of March, had 37 staples, started using product with recommendation of friend and I must say if you follow the directions, my scar is starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> My wife is using this on the scar from her knee replacement surgery and in only a couple of weeks the scar has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Its too early to have a conclusion, but as far as i used Mederma i can say that the results is coming soon.</li>
            <li> I used it twice daily as recommended and it was okay. I bought bio oil which I have used before and I think it is better.&lt;br /&gt;But I keep the bio oil in one room and the mederma in another. The price was very good and I got free S/H.</li>
            <li> Mederma is definitely the best scar treatment on the market – you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a better one (but let me know if you do, because this product is very expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this a lot because it worked on some old scars, but realize that you&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot of money over a long period of time to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I bought a small tube of this after having total knee replacement. I was miffed at the high price, but had been told by my doctors that this was what I should buy. After using it for a couple of months, and running out, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the slow progress I was making. So when I went for a refill, I bought the Walgreens store brand instead since it was much cheaper. After only a few days, the scar was worsening - growing in both height and width. I ordered this large tube on Amazon, and I immediately exchanged the store brand for another tube of Mederma, and the scar is back on track for a slow resolution. My doctor said to be patient; the larger the scar, the longer the treatment time will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Oct. 14, 2010:  I&#x27;m uploading a picture today so everyone can see the progress of my scar. As you can see, I scar badly. My doctor told me that using Mederma, it would start at one end and zip up like a zipper - and as you can clearly see, that is what&#x27;s happening. Getting this far has taken a LONG time. I&#x27;ve been using it liberally for about 5 months now, and spent $60 on the stuff so far. Before this thing is over, I will have invested a lot of time, money, and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 14, 2011:  It has now become evident that the Hypertrophic part of the scar on my knee (the upper half of the scar) is not benefiting from using Mederma. Mederma slows the progression of the condition, but I don&#x27;t plan to use it my entire life, so ultimately it will progress and end wherever it wants. My conclusion is that it was very helpful for the normal part of the scar - the part that didn&#x27;t go Hypertrophic at the outset - but ultimately failed to reverse the Hypertrophic condition. Most people don&#x27;t scar as I do, so it may be beneficial for them to use on their \\&quot;normal\\&quot; scars.</li>
            <li> I just read an article in the LATIMES ([...] from April 17, 2011 and it made very clear that Mederma and all the other products (with one exception-silicone gel) worked no better than petroleum jelly. Same with Vitamin E and all the other products. According to the article (which quotes recent studies), its merely the fact that all these products keep the scar moist. That is the mechanism that Mederma, Vitamin E, etc work better than letting the scar heal by itself. Studies clearly show no benefit in using scar products (with one exception - silicone gel) versus plain old petroleum jelly. So just clean your cut with simple soap and water (anti-bacterial gels and soaps don&#x27;t help other than to make you more resistant to anti-biotics, so they are actually a detriment!!!) and put petroleum jelly on it followed by a band-aid. Neosporin and the like are a waste of money. (This has actually been known for a long time and is not the point of my review. There&#x27;s plenty of science to back this point up if you research it.) The one thing worth buying is silicone gel treatments like Scar-Away, that originally came as gels for burns, and can now be bought as sheets attached to a band-aid like backing. And the best part is that silicone gel products work great on old scars. Scar-Away is just one brand of many, so do your own research to see if one brand is better or cheaper than another. I hope this helps you save money and that you scars heal nicely.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product if you tend to have sensitive skin.  I have been applying it on a few small scars for a couple of weeks now, and now I have a wide spread rash encompassing the entire area!  Sometimes new products cause a little rashing, so I decided to try to tough it out til my skin grew accustomed to it, but it only got worse and worse, and it seems to be making my scars darker!  Going back to vitamin E, even though it smells bad, at least I know it wont cause horrible side effects!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and worked great. Bought the cream one with the SPF this past summer and returned it. And ended up buying the gel again. Works everything. Love it.</li>
            <li> I had tried on most of the scar removal products, nothing had worked to my satisfaction. Decided to try this one. The scars appeared to be having some effect by the time first tube was over.. and by the time I was up with the fourth tube the results were visibly better. It also works great on stretch marks. Yes , it wont work on first tube. It does work but needs a bit of patience. The scar removal process does take time. But lest assured at least there is a product that works... Would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of the scars and has the luxury of time and doesn&#x27;t mind some investments to get rid of the annoying scars. Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> I got this in the summer.  It is now November; No change on 20-30 yr. old scars. I don&#x27;t know how it is on new scars</li>
            <li> I love this product. A small amount really does go a long way but even so I&#x27;m still having to use a 3 pack every month due to the huge area I have to cover. I am a male who served in Iraq and I got very sick after being out in the dust storms and caught pneumonia. I lost 70 pounds in 2 months, and 30lbs of it was lost in the first 2 weeks. I was deathly ill and couldn&#x27;t get any treatment for it and after regaining the weight I now have a belly full of probably 50 major scars from my thighs to my lower chest. Until recently it was a terribly embarassing sight, but after 3 months they are noticeably lighter. What used to be dark red and highly visible across the room is now light pink and only visible if viewed up close or if I stretch them out. I&#x27;m hoping at the end of the 6 months that they will be all but gone and I trust I will be Very happy with my investment. They are quite severe stretch marks (they are 8 years old and some are a full inch wide) so I&#x27;m not under the illusion that they will completely vanish, but if they even turn grey and blend in with the skin like normal stretch marks do then I&#x27;ll be happy--and it appears to be going in that direction at a steady pace.</li>
            <li> To the person who wrote patroleum jelly is just as good as Mederma, you have a big issue in your theory...mederma is not advertised to put on an open wound to keep a scar from forming, it is to put on a healed up scar. I have a large skin graft on my lower leg that was kept covered by strips that had a petroleum jelly substance on it until it healed. Even with that, there is a scar and petroleum jelly isn&#x27;t going to lighten it! I had a roughly 6 inch long scar on my are from trying to get my cat out of a fight that was super dark and ugly! I started putting mederma on it, like another person said, you have to keep at it! In time the scar went from raised, dark, and ugly to a thin, pail line that is barely raised. Most people never notice it. This product DOES work! Just make sure you understand that it is not magic so it takes time and repeated applications and, if it is a large scar, such as my graft, it is expensive. The info on the box is very clear about the time line to get results. I have tried cheaper things but all they have done is soften the scar when my hope is to flatten some of the edges and lighten it up some.</li>
            <li> i have been using this scar for a really long time every since i was 12 or 13 and im 20 now i used it once continuously and stopped after like 2 years .. it did nothing .. but my sisters still use it and i see no difference in their scars as well and shes been using it for like 6 years ...</li>
            <li> I noticed stretch marks on abdomen got lighter and less noticeable. It doesn&#x27;t take them away. It is very true that stretch marks are permanent because your middle layer of skin has actually torn. This product can be pricey but it is worth the money especially if you don&#x27;t have many stretch marks. But if you have a lot of large ones You can try a TCA chemical peel. I have noticed that they strengthen the skin by improving collagen and elastin production which in proper amts keeps the skin from tearing.</li>
            <li> I really like Maderma...it&#x27;s been helping me with my multitude of scars for years. The price is a killer though. Still, I save up so I can use it. Just had surgery and have an enormously long scar I will get to work on after the stitches are gone. Mederma is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> BOTTOM LINE - the product works with MULTIPLE DAILY applications and it takes MONTHS for the results to show, much longer than what the Mederma manufacturer states (It will probably be well over a year by the time my scars fully resolve - but that&#x27;s better than having the scars, right?).  For more details on my experience..read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sustained burns on my legs, one of which was quite deep and infected, it required heavy duty oral antibiotics (Augmentin) for weeks to heal.  For context, I have an olive skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst burn initially healed with a jelly-like puckered up texture - nothing like regular skin, purplish in color.  The original size of that burn was about the size of nickel, with the most \\&quot;jelly\\&quot; in the middle and less raised in the edges.  The burn is now about half the size of a dime, what is left is still quite ugly but changing.  I&#x27;ve been conscientiously applying Mederma TWICE (2x) per day - morning and night - and I rub it in when I apply it.  I&#x27;ve been doing this now for NINE (9) months, so the process is not a fast one, but it IS working (and I&#x27;ve witnessed the slow contraction of the scar over the months).  I do not believe that the skin would have healed like this on its own.  Upon reading about burn scars, the type of scar I described can be dealt with by surgically removing the weird skin and sawing up the skin around it (read expensive cosmetic procedure, and you&#x27;re still left with the scar from bringing the skin together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next to worse burns are two other scars which healed with indentations and very dark pigmentation.  Those two scars no longer have indentations, that is to say the skin has \\&quot;filled in\\&quot;.  I also think the dark pigmentation is starting to get lighter, but as I obsessively look at the scars daily that sort of progress is hard to gage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?  The downside - the Mederma product instruction/claims are of a much shorter duration in recovery than experienced by me.  Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!  Note that the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions recommend applying Mederma 3-4x/day and for practical reasons I apply the Mederma only 2Xs per day; so there&#x27;s the possibility that I would have healed faster had I used it that often?  Another possibility is that the manufacturer meant for the scarring that takes 6 months to heal to be more benign than whatever degree burns I sustained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another negative observation is that I can still see some of the burns that were very superficial - they healed like regular scars and I still have much darker skin in that area (note that I apply the Mederma with the same schedule/intensity as I apply it to the serious burn scars).  As I mentioned before I&#x27;m olive skinned, so perhaps people with lighter pigments will experience a faster fading of their scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A conclusion I draw from my experience is that perhaps Mederma will give painfully slow results to those seeking to lighten minor scars?  As I have a lot of product I will continue to apply..  Nine months (and ongoing) is NOT the 8 weeks promised for new scars, it&#x27;s not even the 6 months promised for old scars!!

            <li> Mederma was a subject of a scientific study (citation below), and it was found to be no more effective than petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people whose scars have improved over months of using Mederma would have seen the same results if they left the scars alone or applied petroleum jelly. In fact, most scars spontaneously reduce in redness and prominence over the course of several months. The only therapy that might be better than placebo are silicone gels, pads, etc. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chung VQ, Kelley L, Marra D, Jiang SB (February 2006). \\&quot;Onion extract gel versus petrolatum emollient on new surgical scars: prospective double-blinded study\\&quot;.

            <li> No, no. Try acupuncture, dermarolling, sesame oil, and maybe lasers if you are rich. That is what helped me- this product is an expensive joke.</li>
            <li> I had a mole removed off my back for the second time now because of it being cancerous. And I started first using bio oil. And I got pimples all around it. So we switched to this. We&#x27;re in the first week, and it seems to be helping. Just softening it so far. Will update when I notice both color and size.</li>
            <li> Very good, so I can say on what went wrong out of it? No! It is so effective scar! Some time ago the baby scar traces of light more now than before!</li>
            <li> I used it for 12 weeks on my c-section scar. Started using it about 2 weeks after the surgery. Never saw any results.</li>
            <li> Mederma works very well, I tried Bio Oil and it just did not work.  I saw results after 15 days as I have extensive scarring from having my larynx removed due to cancer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well, I&#x27;ve had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month,and again it&#x27;s working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again,if fact I&#x27;ll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars.</li>
            <li> I have a scar that is red. It is not raised or enlarged, it&#x27;s just discolored. This stuff made the red scar more red. I do not recommend it if you just want to get the color back to normal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I got a terrible rash that ended up spreading and making my skin a hot mess. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Maderma works really well with scars and such. I thought that I had ordered the cream but it turned out it was the gel. It dries to your skin a little and within a few minutes you can peel it off. I would recommend not peeling it though. After leaving it and washing it the next morning, this is how the scar is removed. It is working really well so far thank God!</li>
            <li> never worked on my acne scars waste of time.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about 2 weeks now and yes the scar is lightening up day by day, but I am also dark in complexion and the skin around my scar is also lightening. When applying the gel just be careful to not get it on the non scarred skin.</li>
            <li> I had a c-section pregnancy and have been using this twice a day for the past 5months.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my scar isn&#x27;t as red or puffy as they day I came home from the hospital.  I believe if I keep at it Mederma will do it&#x27;s magic at erasing my scar.  I&#x27;ve heard it takes several months and applications.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this cream for my 1&#x27;x1/2\\&quot; wrist scar (next time, I will let the grilled salmon, instead of my arm, burn). After seeing the great reviews, decided to purchase. After the first few days I thought my scar was actually fading, but by the 5th day of use, the scar felt strange, almost raised, most likely due to the clusters of little red bumps I noticed were surrounding the area. Googled \\&quot;Mederma causing rash\\&quot; and found that a number of people had developed a rash from using this product. Obviously this seems to work well for some; unfortunately, I am one of those that experienced a negative reaction. Grateful that Amazon makes returning this product so easy.</li>
            <li> I had surgery a few months ago and ended up with 3 incisions on my belly. I wanted this stuff to work before bikini season but every time I try it I brake out. It starts out as just itching and before I know it, hives all over my stomach. I do see the smallest hint of the scars starting to lighten though!</li>
            <li> I work in a pharmacy, and the general opinion of our pharmacists is that mederma is basically just sunscreen, which aids in the prevention of scarring, but is not for the treatment of older scars. They also say the only thing that breaks down scar tissue is silicone, and the only good (and affordable) cream that contains this ingredient is Scarzone. Mederma does not contain this ingredient.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product per a recommendation from my Doctor after surgery on my face for a basel cell.BUYER BEWARE! I had a extremely horrible reaction after applying the product according to it&#x27;s instructions, my skin burned in the scar site, exactly where you don&#x27;t want a problem you had to have surgery for in the beginning.  I have called Mederma and all they have done is take my name...etc. I will notify my Dermatologist, and I would like all to know that buyer&#x27;s should be aware that it is not \\&quot;uncommon\\&quot; (Mederma&#x27;s quote) for a person to have a reaction from the product according to the company. Amazon is not at fault; I constantly trust them to provide me with most products I buy;  but I would recommend they stop selling the products of Mederma!</li>
            <li> Two and a half months ago, I had a mole removed from my upper lipline. Removal involved a vertical incision and six stiches. A few days after the stitches were removed, I started applying Mederma 2 to 3 times per day. I&#x27;ve used it for just over two months now. The scar color has really faded (it can easily be covered with make up now). The scar tissue is now barely raised and is flexible. I will continue to use it and feel pretty confident that the scar will eventually be nearly invisible.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try Mederma on some older scars and am hoping for good results.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have extremely sensitive skin and did not find this product at all irritating.</li>
            <li> Well I walked into a dumpster (stupid story) and it had cut my nose open and the side of my face and I had two scars on my face they were not bad but i still wanted to get rid of them and this worked over time just be patient and ignore the itch and you will be happy (itch really Is not that bad)</li>
            <li> My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don&#x27;t give 5 stars because I don&#x27;t see it as a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;must buy&amp;#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be.</li>
            <li> We already use the product, and know it to be good, which is why we ordered online.  I was quite surprised by how quickly it arrived!</li>
            <li> The product works, and works well.  I have purchased four tubes for my wife who was scarred when she was dragged during a motorbike robbery.  My complaint is that the last time I ordered I received a product called \\&quot;Mederma Advanced Scar Gel\\&quot; that stipulated both on the box and on the 50g tube:  \\&quot;only 1X daily\\&quot;.  It worked fine and only needed to be used once a day.  NOW, I can&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  In a live chat with a rep named Stephanie I was directed to the product that needs to be applied two or three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want the 3X a day product.  Seems like Amazon found the sales dropped and maybe they discontinued carrying the once a day scar gel.  If so, that is a poor way to build customer relations.  Now I need to look at Walgreens, WalMart, CVS, or then turn to the manufacturer in Germany via Merz Pharmaceuticals in Greensboro, NC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see if it will improve overall healing of my scar.  I won&#x27;t know for several months but my initial experience with this product is mediocre.  Only a tiny amount may be applied without having a flaking mess on my skin after it dries.  The box says that it is must be rubbed in well and even that does not keep the flaking away unless only a tiny amount is used at a time.  It forms a film on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had ordered the mederma with spf in it because whenever I leave the house I have to apply spf anyway.  Consider that when you buy.  Also, you will not need a lot of this product unless you have a large scar to cover.  Consider the smaller tube.</li>
            <li> Mederma is a great product and when applied it will reduce the scaring and marks of a cut or surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Mederma helped to significantly reduce a large scar on my knee from total knee joint replacement.  I will continue to use this product on the first knee replacement, and will apply it to the scar from a second knee replacement s soon as my doctor clears it.</li>
            <li> So Ive been using this pretty faithfully for a few weeks now (in conjunction with microdermabrasion by neutrogena) And I have to say, it does absolutely work. Its not going to be an overnight miracle fix (nothing is) but if u stick with it, you will see scars gradually diminish. I havent used it long enuff to know whether they will eventually be gone completely, tho. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... if it makes you itchy, don&#x27;t be surprised. When I use it, it makes me itchy everywhere it touches. Ive read lots of ppl having the same issue, so its not an allergy. I guess its proof the stuff is really doing something.</li>
            <li> this is the best scar product, and this is the best price i have found it for for this big of size since its a very expensive brand in any market</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this product to me when I had a suspicious mole removed from my face (which fortunately was benign).  It definitely reduces the scarring incurred from such surgery.  It is not unpleasant to use, and actually works.  Only downside item is, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often follow use instructions to the letter but I did here because of the location of the facial scar I had. It was an age spot, or dead skin, a blotch, on my right cheekbone, the size of a quarter. Very noticeable, and I could tell it was a distraction to people speaking to me. Six to seven weeks using as directed and the scar had faded away completely. Gone.</li>
            <li> this product made me itch uncontrollably on the second day.  had to switch to the spf version which doesn&#x27;t itch.  still waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> I had surgery recently and used this product has directed for about a month and half and stopped after that. I did not see any change at all in my small little scars however the skin around it was turning lighter (just around the scars) not the scar itself.</li>
            <li> I am using Mederma for scars on my legs. The Mederma does work great as the scars are barely there any more. However, it has taken about one year of using Mederma to get these results. So while I am certainly pleased with the outcome, the downside is the expense of it. Using it twice a day for one year to get the desired results has been terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> im 22 yr old male and i have stretch marks from working out and from gaining and loosing weight i used 2 tubes so far and it works wonders i will definately keep using it over time im sure they will eventually go away like i seen results major results in size and color  i have already purchased 3 more tubes  im not just using it on one stretch mark i have them on my arms and sides laying out in the sun helps i hope this help</li>
            <li> I do like it, it helped me  with my cut a bit I still have more to go, but at least it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product about two weeks but I am so happy with it! I started using it on a scar from a recent surgery and a surgery from 2 years ago and I can already see a big diference!</li>
            <li> works  and it looks pretty good -- lower cost than Walgreens</li>
            <li> I have used Mederma for years. It definitely improved the look of all the different scars I&#x27;ve used it on (from abrasions to cuts and acne, everything). I&#x27;d say it made a pretty good improvement too, but that came with a price. When this stuff dries, a little clear film it left on your skin. The worst part about it is the itching. It didn&#x27;t itch everywhere I put it but when fighting a massive scar on my chest- it just got to be unbearable. Because it&#x27;s like this, I&#x27;d apply it in the morning after my shower. Film-y stuff forms. Itch starts an hour later. Then I had to reapply mid-day. Another film-y layer forms... Ugh and it continued. I stuck it out for the most part but I never lasted as long as I should.. it was just unbearable. So I&#x27;ve switched to the all natural derma-e scar gel and it&#x27;s amazing. Has the same awesome results and active ingredient without all the nasty chemicals AND no itch, no film, no hassle.</li>
            <li> I cannot determine how well the product performs because it has such a strong floral scent that I cannot use it.  I have a severe sensitivity to scents causing  my sinuses to go crazy.  Scents also irritate my throat, negatively affecting my voice.  I understand that it&#x27;s a good product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  I need an unscented version and have not been able to find one.</li>
            <li> I had liposuction along with a tummy tuck with excellant results except for the scar from one end of my abdomen to the other -- actually wrapping around my tummy to my back.  It&#x27;s a long, noticible scar.  I read reviews before I bought Mederma and was disappointed that several people felt qualified to place a review after just a few days of use.  I purposely waited for my own results from 2 months of use, applying it 3 times a day to try to make the review more useful.  My initial scar was a deep redish/purple color and it has now faded to a medium-dark redish color.  The color did not fade significantly or disappear as the example on the tube suggested it would; however it seems to have improved somewhat.  I don&#x27;t know what the scar would have looked like had I not used any Mederma but simply waited for time to heal the scar, but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances.  I bought the larger 1.76 oz tube after I realized that I was going to use up the smaller size fairly quickly with that many daily applications.  The big tube is a much better value depending on the price so I just ended up keeping the small tube at work.  This made it easier to apply Mederma 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had many small scars in various places from the liposuction and started using Scar Reducing Herbal Creme just for those scars.  I have used that product for about 6 weeks.  My two main scars were the size of quarters and are now half the size of a dime and definitely faded.  Scar Reducing Creme uses Olive Oil so it&#x27;s easier to spread and a little goes a long way. Since Mederma is very light and water based, it doesn&#x27;t spread as easily and seems to soak in quickly to dry skin, but it has also lasted for these last two months with extra in the tube to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be good idea to try StriVectin on my stomach (just above the tummy tuck scar) since I had bad stretch marks.  I figured I could put all the cremes on at the same time since it&#x27;s such a ritual anyway.  I didn&#x27;t mix the cremes by applying one over the other but applied each of the three to separate parts of my body.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the stretch marks at first and probably missed a few applications for this reason, but my husband started telling me that he really noticed a difference so I&#x27;m back using it again. Now looking at my stomach I think I agree with him, the marks are less noticeable than right after the procedure.  Now that it&#x27;s been 2 months, I plan to start rotating different scar cremes such as Scarzone along with the Mederma.  Another review said that silicone may work better so I will give this a try while the scar is still relatively new.  If none of this fades the scar completely, I&#x27;ll make an appointment with a dermatologist to try laser or chemical peels.  I love the results of the lipo/tummy tuck but I hate this scar!didn&#x27;t mix the cremes by applying one over the other but applied each of the three to separate parts of my body.

            <li> This work very well. I had some scares on my legs and I wear shorts a lot and this helped them go away in time this past summer. I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It severally irritated my skin.  Had a burning and itchy feeling when applied.  I applied it for a couple of days on the scar and area around the scar got very red.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks. I have not noticed any change yet. Also be carful when you squeeze out the gel, you may end up with too much. It clogs up the opening as well.</li>
            <li> Not a mirical cream but does do a good job in getting rid of the redness of fresh scars.  Does reduce the appearance. I have been using it for 2 months after a gallblader operation and it has healed the area, taking the redness with it for the most part.  The only area that still is darker red is where the 2 incisions for the scopes were cut.  However I have seen an improvement.  I am waiting for another month to pass to see if they will lighten more in color.</li>
            <li> Have a scar right under my lower lip, used this every single day, didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> not use,but think it will be perfect, will buy it next time ,hope it can be more discount in next time</li>
            <li> Got into a pretty bad bike accident and scraped my face really bad. I really did not want a scar. When my wound healed, I applied Mederma quickly and CONSISTENTLY. I am glad to say, no one even notices I had a pretty bad gash on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read the directions for your gel. The key to this as with getting results in the gym, studies, or life for that matter is consistency. I had to apply mine for 6 weeks, three times a day. For older scars, it&#x27;s substantially longer. I&#x27;ve heard people say it never worked for them and when I ask if they applied it as instructed, they say no. So for results, follow the directions very closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On some applications, it can feel very itchy, but I think that&#x27;s it at work. :)</li>
            <li> I paid less than half what the pharmacy stores wanted for the same size. It&#x27;s only been a few days &amp; my scar looks &amp; feels softer. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mederma since August 2010, My surgery was June 23rd 2010, I honestly see no difference. I was using it daily. Since I saw no difference, I was getting cortizone shots from my surgeon which would make the scars go down for a little bit and then they would raise again, those were a hassle, because I had to go in every 2 weeks. I think Kelo-cote works better, and I&#x27;m soon going to try Scarprin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like how Mederma dries. It dries almost like how Elmer&#x27;s glue dries. It peels off easily and gets on everything. Kelo-cote dries like a sticky adheasive (which I also didn&#x27;t like).</li>
            <li> I recently had abdominal and chest surgery and my doctor recommended Mederma once the wounds had healed and all of the stitches were out (6 weeks post-op). My new wounds stretch from hip to hip and essentially armpit to armpit (under each breast to try to conceal it as much as possible). I decided to also apply Mederma to some old scars I have (a few stretch marks on my belly and an old piercing scar in my navel). I have only been using it for three days and I already can see a reduction in the redness of the new scars. My skin has also begun peeling which doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and I read online that this is a good thing; it means the skin is renewing itself. I find its odor to be non-offensive and vaguely lemony and once the product rubs into the skin (which is quickly) it goes away altogether. This product is not messy (which I appreciate because up until I started using it I had been using Neosporin and wrapping the oily mess under gauze to keep it from making grease stains on my clothes and just wiping off) and it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch at all after I apply it. I have heard great reviews that it can reduce many scars up to 90%! I am excited to see how my scars will look in a few months time of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read a report that tries to compare Mederma to the use of Petroleum jelly and they just don&#x27;t compare, the method of effectiveness as well as the physical properties of the two are completely different and I stated as such in a response to that review similar to what I am stating here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that some people are allergic to this product. I don&#x27;t know if it is the active ingredient (the onion extract) or the vehicle (I notice that it contains PEG-4) and if you apply too much it may leave a mark (because it changes the physical composition of previously damaged skin by causing re-organization of the collagen and other components of the scar and if you mix it with other cleaners and skin products it can cause burning - so follow the directions!) It is also a little pricey in my opinion (I paid $18 for a tube of less than one ounce and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months - probably lots more, even tho a little bit does go a long way) but if you are self-concious about some scars or just would like them to be less noticeable (like me) I would recommend this product.low the directions!) It is also a little pricey in my opinion (I paid $18 for a tube of less than one ounce and I know I will be buying more if I am going to be using it on such big scars for 2-6 months - probably lots more, even tho a little bit does go a long way) but if you are self-concious about some scars or just would like them to be less noticeable (like me) I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Mederma made my scar itch so I had to stop using it.  I also did not like the thick film it left after the application dried.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product.  I waited 6 months to give it a chance, but the scars still show!  Less redness than at the start, but this would probably have happened all by itself.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I bought this to use on a scar on my sons forehead.  It was a bite that he scratched continuously and it left a dark scar.  Within two weeks it is barely noticeable.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Last year in July my son had a terrible accident. He fell of the bike and hit the metal pole with his head. He was conciouss all the time, but wound was terrible to look at. It had to be fixed by plastic surgeon, however that left him with the 5cm scar on his forehead. We started to use Mederma after a month and we used it for 6 months. It has been more than a year from the accident and scar is barely visible.</li>
            <li> Been using it for my surgery scar and I believe it works. The scar seems smoother and with less coloration since using Mederma.</li>
            <li> No noticeable changes after two months.</li>
            <li> This product really works for acne scars! I&#x27;ve gone through a few tubes of this and I&#x27;ve noticed that my scars have lessened quite a bit. They are not as red and some have gone away completely. I put it on at night before bed and when i wash my face in the morning my skin looks brighter and clearer. However, it does over dry the face a lot so I would not recommend using it every single day. I use it every other day or every three days, depending on how my skin is doing. It works but it also has its drawbacks. Either way, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have seen my scars fading and am very happy with this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I first used this product back in 2005, recommended by my podiatrist, after I had surgery on both of my feet. While I still have scars, they aren&#x27;t visible unless you really look closely. I used the product as directed and by the time I fully healed, my scars were very small. The gel completely got rid of four of the six scars! The other two scars are still visible, but like I said, only when you are looking closely at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this product again after having an appendectomy. I started using it right away after the bandages came off. So far, two of the three scars seem to much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I just hurt my leg this May. I hate the dark red scar on my leg. After using this product 1 month, the scar turn to a pink one. And I can dress a skirt again. Lol. It has a nice smell and only gel. It can remove your scar effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Not sure how we&#x27;ll it worked as the smell was overwhelming. Having said that I must also say that my scar was right down the middle of my nose.</li>
            <li> Three months ago I scraped the bridge of my nose on a brick as I pushed a smoky log back into the fireplace. I scar easily and despite Neosporin and Biafine this turned into a scaly red mess that took weeks to fade. Last week, I got a new pair of glasses, which reinflamed the whole thing. It looked awful, and sometimes in the middle of my workday I would feel it bleeding. (Pretty!) I was deeply skeptical of a product I could buy OTC, but none of the prescription medications I have (including Biafine, which is more expensive even with insurance) had worked, either. Six nights ago I bought some Mederma at the drugstore. I rubbed it liberally on my nose, as well as on a mole I recently had removed on my chest. A day later, after having applied Mederma four times, both scars were noticeably paler, smaller, and less angry. The scrape on my nose is reduced to a pin prick, and it was easly 3/4 of an inch just last week. The surgical scar on my chest has gone from an itchy, swollen welt to barely there. I have oily skin that flares with hormones, and I often break out on my nose and chin. I&#x27;ve tried everything for it short of Accutane, and in less than a week, using this product 4x a day, my skin looks gorgeous and my pores even look smaller. Onion juice might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my scars from my acl repair surgery and it works great. The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing however you don&#x27;t notice the smell after application. Also the tube is rather small. Other than that i love this product and I use it on all my scars.</li>
            <li> I know this product may work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I followed the directions and used the gel 3 times on scar on my forehead. The gel has left a very dark spot in the middle of my forehead so i had to stop using it. It did&#x27;t reduce my scar appearance at all and now not only do i still have a very horrible scar, now i have a very ugly dark spot in the center of my forehead that i can&#x27;t get rid of. My advice is don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap it was a total waste of money and now i have two scars thanks to using this crap.</li>
            <li> The product that I received had an expiration date within two months.  I have heard that these type of products that are purchased through the internet are often close to expiring upon shipment.  There should be some guidelines on this issue.</li>
            <li> Product is great - I just wish I had read the other reviews warning people of Mary&#x27;s Market.  I received Mederma that was within weeks of the expiration date just like others did.  They are obviously buying old/nearly expired product and passing it on to Amazon customers at full retail prices.  I&#x27;ve already complained to Amazon - hopefully they will remove Mary&#x27;s Market as a third party seller.</li>
            <li> NewGel + Silicone Scar Treatment works way better than Mederma, at a comparable cost.</li>
            <li> Happy,and it really works!!!</li>
            <li> I have had scars on the side of my head from acne for a few years now. When I first heard of Mederma I was skeptical that it would reduce the visibility of the scars that I&#x27;ve had for years, but I was so sick of seeing myself as &#x27;scarface&#x27; when I looked in the mirror I was willing to give anything a shot. After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application. I&#x27;ve been using Mederma for about 3-4 weeks now and the redness from using the product has stopped and best of all, the scars on my face caused by acne have been greatly reduced! I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I&#x27;m proud to say I&#x27;m not near as embarrassed in public, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about showing my &#x27;good side&#x27; any more. Mederma works, and I&#x27;m pleased with the investment I made via Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> After discouraging results from kelo-cote, scar-away silicone scar sheets, I decided to give Mederma a shot. I was sceptical when I bought it, and was half expecting to be disappointed again, but I find myself pleasantly surprised by the fact that Mederma may  actually be helping my pox scars fade! Surprise, surprise....here&#x27;s a product that seems to work. My scars were red when I started applying mederma, but now they&#x27;ve diminished to a point where they&#x27;re not that stark anymore. Sure, they haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, but this product has made a substantial difference in half the time frame that I was expecting. I don&#x27;t know about old scars, but if your scars are fairly recent like mine (stupid chicken pox), then this product SHOULD make a difference. Try it!</li>
            <li> Like to pay less for same product, but too bad it&#x27;s too close to be expired when I got it.</li>
            <li> Mederma Skin Care For Scars did indeed smooth out my stretch marks, but the places that I used it made my skin darker!  Now I have to use another product to lighten the dark spots.  If you are a Black woman, like me, and prone to hyperpigmentation, do not use this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month but I have noticed that the gel tends to slide off. I&#x27;m using it on a new injury and it does seem to be softer and hasn&#x27;t developed a scab. Still I&#x27;ve decided to order the cream.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended buying this product to help a scar heal and it seems to be working.  We&#x27;ve been applying it 3 times a day for the past few weeks and we are happy with how it is helping the scar heal.</li>
            <li> I burn my self in the stomach area and it look like never happend. It&#x27;s a great product for you skin and for other scars.</li>
            <li> I have used this for one month and it seems it works! My face acne hair is less visible.&lt;br /&gt;I am continuing using this.</li>
            <li> Be aware that you may be allergic to this product. I began applying it to my surgery scars on my arm, and after a few days of following the instructions, my scars became extremely itchy and extremely pinkish-red. This would not go away unless I stopped using it. I gave it a few days before trying it again (just to make sure) and sure enough I got itchy and pink again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is a great product for those who are not allergic, but just be aware of the fact that you may have a negative reaction to it. I googled around and this seems to be a common problem. (May have something to do with the onion extract).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I was able to return it no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on burn scars and have been working very good. It&#x27;s look like it is going away. My only criticism is that it takes time.</li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin till this past December I broke out with horrible acne on both sides of my face. It finally went away after taking a 2 month cycle of acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was left with scars on both sides of my face from me picking and popping pimples. I assumed that after a month or two that these scars would fade away. Not so! I tried to cover them with makeup, but that wasn&#x27;t working so I turned to Mederma.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t optimistic, but I was desperate and it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 weeks, and I have seen quite an improvement already. The texture of my scars have changed, and the color has faded so much that whenever I put makeup on you can&#x27;t even see my scars anymore.&lt;br /&gt;On most days I can only do one application (before I go to bed), but on days where I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup all day I can do 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with the smell, especially it being so close to my nose. Smells like old flowers or something, but it goes away after a couple of minutes. I also have no problems with itching. I read on one website that you need to rub it in hard and make sure it is fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;I also started wearing sun block on my face spf70 when I go outside.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that Mederma has given me my clear skin back.</li>
            <li> Mederma does work and I will explain how and why below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) You can&#x27; not expect result in one day or a week! You will see noticeable result in 2 weeks and full result in about 6 to 8 weeks on minor scars. Old or new scars, Mederma personal has worked for me and has been my trick for getting rid of acne scars I had from a teenage. I&#x27;m 24 now and my skin is 90% better with the help of Mederma for my scars. More severe scars will take a few months to see a change, depending on your body and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Make sure you wash the area an keep it clean for the gel to do it&#x27;s best work, don&#x27;t apply Mederma to dirty skin &amp; don&#x27;t cake it on. You only need a small drop and massage in the area and leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)The active ingredient in Mederma is called allium cepa, which is onion extract that is found to have anti-bacterial as well as anti-inflammatory properties. Since scar tissue forms a protective barrier over the skin, the allium cepa in Mederma means that the skin has less hard tissue to produce while the wound is fully healing. In addition to onion extract, aloe is added to Mederma in order to soften the scar, making the wound less pronounced on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Lastly, yes it is true scars will heal the same without the help of beauty products or over the counter products, but then you will be left with a scar still. Mederma helps get rid of scars and it does work from my personal experience. My only con is the price, but it is well worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you guys ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now (3-5 times a day application).  My scare has reduced in color and it&#x27;s starting to blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost year :) I&#x27;ve been seeing results. I will buy more of this when mine runs out but it cost way too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mederma for years, and I have noticed that a few of my raised scars have flattened.  I continue to order it through Amazon regularly.</li>
            <li> My surgeon recommended this particular cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was highly recommended for acne scars, which I have, on a few different web pages I searched. I had to stop using this after three days because like the other reviewer my face turned reddish and discolered on the areas I used this gel.  I&#x27;m trying to take attention away from problem areas on my face not to it. I also bought the new and improved fresh scent formula. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s considered a fresh scent in Germany(where it&#x27;s made) but this stuff stinks. I&#x27;m going to try it on the stretch marks on my arms where I don&#x27;t mind it being red but never on my face again.</li>
            <li> You will definitely see an improvement in your scars.  I repeat that again with emphasis:  you will see an improvement.  I have to tell you that the improvement won&#x27;t be until you use maybe five or more tubes over five months.  The tube is not that large and it doesn&#x27;t last all that long. It is costly, no matter where you buy it--the Internet or your local store.  But, it is the only scar product I have tried that does what it says it will do---so for the third time:  don&#x27;t expect your scars to be 100% gone, even after five or six tubes. BUT: you will be pleased---very, very pleased, indeed. I would say a 90% improvement, and that is wonderful.  But not from one tube.  I do recommend it and I like it. Not messy and don&#x27;t use too much as it flakes off.  Follow directions.  It is a fine product, but buy in bulk!!!</li>
            <li> Science journals have reported on Mederma compared to petroleum jelly for treating scars, and they concluded there was no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shih, Richard, and Joshua Waltzman. \\&quot;Review of Over-the-Counter Topical Scar Treatment Products.\\&quot; Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007): 1091-5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zurada, Joanna, David Kriegel, and Ira Davis. \\&quot;Topical treatments for hypertrophic scars.\\&quot; Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 55(2006): 1024-31.</li>
            <li> The expiration date was only one moth away from &amp;#34;expiring&amp;#34; when it was sent to me. I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to be working.  No noticeable difference after a couple of months.  I&#x27;ll keep trying, but if it doesn&#x27;t start working soon, I will stop any further purchase</li>
            <li> So far this seems to be working clear up my acne scars. Its easy to use, no odor, or sticky residue left behind.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had as much success with this as I would have liked. I tried to focus on one scar to see If it would do as it is supposed too but couldn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li> Because I bought this product in January 2014, but the expiration date for the product is April 2014; it too close.</li>
            <li> Late January I slipped on ice and cut my chin, received 7 stitches. I thought I will have an obvious scar and will need tons of makeup to cover it up. Researched online and found Mederma. I applied it EVERYDAY. Now 4 months later, scar is barely visible...no make-up needed to cover up. I recommend this product...really does work!!!</li>
            <li> I was in a car accident and i have used Mederma on my face for my scars from glass. i have used it for about 7 months now and it has diminished the, reduced redness, and made them shrink. i beleive they will go away completly without surgery. mederma has done wonders for me. thank you mederma!</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my hip from a motorcycle accident a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, it seems to smooth the scar away and makes it look more normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to lighten the skin and blend it up with the surrounding area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love it for the scars on my upper lip. They are starting to mend already. Thank you</li>
            <li> IT IS LIKE YOU PUT ON SOME PASTE . IT DOES NOT GO INTO SKIN BUT LAYS THERE UNTIL YUOUR SO MAD YOU PEEL THE JUNK OFF.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS I ALREADY DID FOR YOU</li>
            <li> A great product. Used it once a day and got significant results.</li>
            <li> Like it, but my scar is very large and this stuff is expensive.</li>
            <li> I think this has an ingredient I have an allergy to.It makes my skin very red. Maybe the preservative, methylparabin. I use a vitamin e oil and it seems to be fine, but some may be sensitive to the soy or safflower oils? I do not seem to be. It does not make scars go away but keeps the skin moist. I would not order again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> i love this product its great quality and very worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;I hope to buy more of them thx</li>
            <li> I came when it was supposd to deliver. But I haven&#x27;t seen a change on my skin. Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> I plan to be a cardiovascular surgeon in New York City. I have a scar on my lower lip from the removal of a beauty mark that was potentially cancerous from when I was 13. I had seen many Doctors, a top dermtologist, a regular dermatologist, other Doctors, asked my parents for help, asked the top Oral Surgeon who performed the surgery for help, and _nothing_ truly helped. A Kennelog injection actually made things worse. I prayed to G-d for help, and one day stumbled upon Mederma by seeking my own intiative. The scar has bothered me since I was 19, where as I grew, the tightness grew more and more painful, such that I could not fully concentrate to the degree I once could. Without my persistent use of Mederma, which has _significantly_ not only reduced the appearance of the scar but the actual scarring itself, I would not be able to concentrate enough to have saved many of the lives I have saved in my life, nor would I be without significant pain on a portion of my body that I use constantly. Thank G-d for Mederma, and thank you Merz Pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li> Amazing results on my scar after having a baby. I used 3 times a day and could see results in the first week.</li>
            <li> the reason that I give the product 4 stars because I have used it for about a month. And I have seen a good result, the scar is smoother(used to be a tiny bump) and less visible.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for the cheap price folks.  Mine had already expired the same month I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is effective if used consistently, there should just be disclosure regarding expiration.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d even take 3 months to expiration.</li>
            <li> I fell down some stairs and scrapped up my face pretty bad. I used neosporen while the open wounds were healing. Then I used mederma on the remaining scars. Now there are no remaining scars. I can testify that this definitely works on new scars. I can&#x27;t speak for older scars. But I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> My daughter got a scar on her face. She picked off a scab on her face and the resulting scar was bright red. I gave it some time, but the redness did not fade readily. I understand scars can fade over time, especially on kids; but since it was on her face, I did not want to take any chances. That it only might work was good enough for me. I&#x27;ve used Mederma regularly on her face for about a month and it is definitely faded, not so noticeable anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a deep scar that is 35 years old right smack on the bridge of my nose. It&#x27;s not fading any more than it has. I decided to try it on that and also a recent burn scar on my arm. The scar on my arm is looking better. It&#x27;s still there but smooth and fading. The one on the bridge of my nose is deep. I think it looks better but it will be many months before I think I&#x27;ll truly know. I&#x27;ll be back to update at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I think it does seem to help and really doesn&#x27;t hurt new scar formation.</li>
            <li> I used mederma for strength marks. not working for old one. I lost weight and notice strength marks showed on upper arms. I applied it twice morning and night and when I remember, guess not more than three times a day. and only a week. they getting less noticeable. They didn&#x27;t gone completely , you still can see when closer but the color kind of blended in. I felt itchy too. I think may be that&#x27;s how it works? Growing new skin? I don&#x27;t know. but  I think it works good for new strength marks ( Still pink or red) not older ones( white and shining). hope helps.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; should be listed as the main ingredient. Far too smelly to apply once a day let alone 3-4 times recommended. I&#x27;ll never know if works on scars because I can&#x27;t take the headache from the smell.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this often as she burns herself frequently at work. This helps minimize old and new scars and burn marks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results</li>
            <li> this product has had a lot of hype behind it and as much as i wish it was backed up by personal results, I still can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m completely displeased. have noticed slight scar reduction</li>
            <li> i use this for my scars that i&#x27;v gotten from warts and such. i&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months and the darkness of the scars have reduced significantly!</li>
            <li> I burned the side of my face up terribly a while back and it was traumatizing to say the least. I used this product on it for about 4 months and now the scars are barely noticeable. I would like to point out I have generally terrible skin that scars and gets stretchmarks very easily. I&#x27;m not sure if the burns healed really well on their own, but I used this product and it is probably the best healed scar I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Mederma is okay but be ready to fork over some big money: they want you to put it on 4 times a day for 6 months.  I&#x27;ve been averaging about a 1.76oz tube every two weeks at about $17 a tube that&#x27;s a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it looks like Amazon cut a deal with Mederma&#x27;s competitor, Kelo-Cote so it no longer sells this product as Prime so you&#x27;re at the mercy of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Third-Party\\&quot; sellers, who take forever and a day to ship the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dealt with Mary&#x27;s Market which is awful: it&#x27;s nearly two weeks and I&#x27;ve not received a less than 2oz tube of this stuff.  Amazon start selling this yourself, Prime, or otherwise I&#x27;ll buy this locally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I received the item over two weeks later from Mary&#x27;s Market.  It was after their own ridiculous mailing deadline of two weeks for a product less than two ounces.  Anyways, the expiration date is next month, so apparently Mary&#x27;s Market is buying old or expired goods and selling them at top dollar.  Amazon please get rid of this unscrupulous seller!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  My surgeon recommended I get it after abdominal surgery, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money.  I have only been using it once a day for about 2 months.  The tube is still at least half full and the scar color is dramatically better!  (The box recommend use 2-3x a day). It really is amazing how much the scar has changed!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product it do not work this product is a scam i used the product for 5 months and it made my scar worst my scar became bigger and more swollen please dont buy this scam of a product.</li>
            <li> I may be a little impatient here, but I am not seeing any results&lt;br /&gt;for the last two months.  I will persist until the tube is done.</li>
            <li> Good price. Somewhat late delivery, but ok. Seems to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> dont work . i used it for like 1year but scar is exactly as it was originally.</li>
            <li> I must share this with you! A couple of months ago, I was playing with my dog (Beagle/Pointer mixed) when I picked him up to take in the back yard his paw snagged my face. I was devastated! Not knowing what to do and I had to work that same night. My face was messed up with this huge, deep scar. Two months later, the scar is now part of my facial features and I am not happy about this. Again it was a substantial scar and I was self conscience about my appearance. I was looking on Amazon for a good scar cream. I purchased Mederma and once I received the package (in two days) I quickly used the product within a week the scar changed from thick to smooth I am still working on this scar, but I feel beautiful again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone who is post BK amputation and had it recommended by his surgeon.  He uses it every day/night.</li>
            <li> I received my Mederma in the mail shortly after I ordered it.  However, the expiration date was only 24 days from the time I received the item!  I felt like caused the item to be defective, because there was no way I would go through the entire tube in 24 days.  I contacted customer service and requested a replacement.  They were quick to respond (within 2 days), however they refused to replace my almost-expired product.  Instead, they offered me a 20% refund.  Thanks to them, my Mederma expires soon and I only received $2.05 back.</li>
            <li> I had a small surgery scar on my face.  It seemed to help but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was the Mederma or just the scar healing on its own.  After a couple of weeks, I had a reaction and my skin started to turn red from it.  Not horrible but it was there and went away a couple of days after I stopped using the Mederma.</li>
            <li> i dont really know about mederma im like on my 6th tube and i dont really feel different it it lightening up a bit but not 10 percent it stings my face after a while too and itches it makes your skin real flaky and it peels off im  a look for a different scar cream after this tube</li>
            <li> past its sell-by date， when i get it , its almost colse to the validity date . wont buy again... sooo bad .  how can i return , PLZ</li>
            <li> What can I say about Mederma? except that why the heck did my doc not mention this the first time. I had foot surgery Jan of this year and the scar was pretty long and prominent. She tells me to use Neosoren and I use that religiously for months and it barely makes a difference. So i started looking and came across this. What a huge difference this has made in just 2 weeks. the scar is already softer and almost invisible from a few areas. I do apply it 4 - 5 times a day and massage it for a minute or two every application. I am almost positive it will be completely gone (OR PRETTY CLOSE) in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after previously having the kind of mederma that is like a 1.5&amp;#34; carmex tube. This is a much larger squirt-tube which is about the size of my hand. The opening of the top is too large for the small amount I normally need to use. Unless you have huge scars you will probably have this problem too. Since this is somewhat expensive, I hate wasting it when too much comes out.</li>
            <li> Very good product and deliver service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with everything about this order except that the product arrived with an expiration date in only a week after which it arrived. The product is supposed to last 6 weeks, and it will have been expired for 5 of those weeks. Not too cool.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and helps the scar heal without any unpleasant scent.  No need to use alot just a small amout works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mederma on a nasty scar I have and it is definitely working well.  The scar is fading thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li> After a year of using this cream my scar has gone away completely. I love Mederma and use it after every cut I get to make sure they wont scar.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen ANY improvements!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the item for very long but it is working very well so far. Thank you Mederma.</li>
            <li> great product for a great price&lt;br /&gt;you can see you results in 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;no greasy feeling on your skin</li>
            <li> came right away jus started using,hope it starts working soon i wanna wakeup and the scar is completely gone might try a new method idk...........</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for said it was just fine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</li>
            <li> He did nothing to get rid of my scars. I thought this would actually work, but it didn&#x27;t. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Two years ago, part of a vertical abdominal incision got infected a few days after I had surgery. The doctor and his nurse looked at it - red, throbbing, hot, swollen, oozing -- and said, &amp;#34;Just put Neosporin on it.&amp;#34; It ended up a huge, itching red lump that never went away or turned into a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; scar like the rest of the incision. The itching was SO terrible I fantasized about poking it with needles or a knife tip or something to somehow make it stop. I felt like I was going to rip the skin off, I scratched it so much.  Since it is 3&amp;#34; above my belly button, my constant scratching looked weird in public.  I bought every kind of lotion for it - shea butter, coconut oil, Vitamin E, hand lotions of every variety, special dry skin lotions...all to no avail.  The doctor&#x27;s office thought I was exaggerating...I&#x27;m not...the itching was driving me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Mederma while I was looking for a different product.  I didn&#x27;t even know it existed!  I bought it and to my ASTONISHMENT it stopped the itching the first day!  Now 3 weeks later, the furious red gumball-sized nodule of the scar looks a milder shade of pink. (I realize this could be because it isn&#x27;t being scratched 24/7!)  I&#x27;m incredibly happy so far and frankly, would pay anything to keep that crazy-making itching away.  I was thinking I&#x27;d have to have another surgery to repair this eventually - I believe Mederma saved me from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, as it warns on the package, it won&#x27;t take away the scar. When I&#x27;ve used it the full 6 weeks (recommended to see improvement) I may come back and upgrade this rating.</li>
            <li> I had a C-Section and hadn&#x27;t exactly started using this product right away.  Half my scar is faded and the other side is not.  I assume the doctor cut pretty deep, after all, baby gotta come out after all!</li>
            <li> Just got this and didn&#x27;t check the expiration date before I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It expires NEXT month!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous to spend this much money on something that expires so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 (June 12):  They sent me an offer to save 20% off on my NEXT purchase.  I told them that was not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 (June 13):  They offered a full refund.  I submitted claim in Amazon, but as of June 16, they haven&#x27;t acted on it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Update 3 (June 16):  They sent me an offer to save 20% off on my next purchase.  It must be GroundHog Day!&lt;br /&gt;Update 4 (June 18):  Another email, another offer to refund my purchase price once I sent it back.  But this time they give me an address so they might be serious.  But I have to pay to send the tube back (padded envelope plus postage plus hassle of going to Post Office).&lt;br /&gt;Update 5 (June 23):  Today they refunded the purchase amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought this, it was $15.99 (Prime), now it&#x27;s over $28!  Maybe that&#x27;s the price you pay for a tube that will last longer than a month, but that&#x27;s the same price available in the grocery store.  I would rather buy it there than hassle with the return, not to mention all of the emails to even get a refund in the first place.  They never approved my return through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews - lots of folks get soon to expire medicine.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvements on my scar. The only bad thing is that the product is close to expire.</li>
            <li> Great Product, work as expected.</li>
            <li> This stiff is all peely after you start rubbing it in.  Very annoying and messy.</li>
            <li> good product it lighten my old cars. it worth the cost and effective. Like to use it until was scars was unoticeable.</li>
            <li> I had a hip replaced and my doctor had recommended this product to help reduce scarring since I scar easily.  I had a fairy long and nasty looking scar so I decided to give this a try.  Here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1.  The cream is easy to apply and goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  2.  The cream does soften the skin area and makes it itch less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3.  After 3 months my scar has reduced noticeably.  Instead of being raised and hard, it is flat and soft.  There is still a red line, but that is fading in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product is definitely not an instant fix, it does work!  I have several scars that I have acquired through the years that while small, look far worse than this major surgery scar does now!  I am quite happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to reduce the amount of scar tissue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>

            <li> I used it for about 2 months; no noticeable change in my skin. It has a high price for a non-scientific product.</li>
            <li> It appears to be healing faster where i use the cream, will take months to know.  I will only use two tubes.</li>
            <li> i have bad scars from psoriasis and this stuff really helped fade them. I got rid of my psoriasis by eating flaxseed meal every morning but i was left with scars. This stuff helped fade them and actually made them soft and feel like my regular skin again.</li>
            <li> Item is as advertised.  It takes time but it seems to be working on my sons second degree burn scar.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year and have seen results with my scars and stretch marks! it does in fact take a while to work and can be quite costy if needed in several spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as directed and it really works.  It is reducing my scarring.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for no results.  let nature do what it does.</li>
            <li> Such a good price.  Ordered it for my friend who had major surgery.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be helping my recent surgery scar. It is too early in the process to know how it will actually work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several surgeries, I been using Mederma for about 5 years on various scars throughout the years and have seen a HUGE difference. My Scars have smoothed out and have faded away. I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product to anyone who has a new or an old scar. It WORKS.</li>
            <li> The product expires in 5 months, the coupon inside the box expired in December 2013.  I was not satisfied at all with the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes.  I used this on a small scar on my face that had about 5 stiches a while ago.  I used it mostly how they directed me to use it.  I might have forgot a couple times to apply it and didnt finish using it.  I stopped using it because it didnt work.  I give it 2 stars instead of one just in case my skipped times and stopping early had something to do with it.  Maybe it was too old of scar.  I also tried on my son who had a small fresh scar just from a scratch on his face and that didnt work either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but since you have to apply it a few times a day it has become quite costly.  The price keeps escalating and the tube does not last long.  For this reason I&#x27;m not sure I will be able to continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> No noticeable effectiveness after 10+ weeks use.</li>
            <li> It works well so far on smaller scars, but one of my larger scars, does not seem to be lightening at all!! It&#x27;s been 2-3 months so I&#x27;ll keep applying and see what happens after the recommended 6 months! I also do not think once a day application seems to be enough...just my opinion!</li>
            <li> Very worthwhile product that really works . . . just keep using it and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> It is a little cheaper, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it expired with the month I recieved it. I recieved on April and expired on April.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put on a mark left from a curling iron burn.  I have been using it for several weeks and found the mark much lighter- but not gone.  I cannot say whether it just faded from time, or if the product really worked.  Surprisingly, I found that some areas on my face that have sun damage were much improved with this product.  I applied once at the end of each day and noticed within about 10 days that there was a difference in the redness.  I have used it on my face for about 4 weeks now and can say there is such an improvement to the tone.  It takes patience for results- but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for 4 months and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I&#x27;ve been applying it to a burn scar on my wrist and a scrape scar on my elbow. These were not old scars. I started using this product as soon as the wounds were healed. The writing on the box suggested the sooner you use it, the better. The scars look exactly the same. I am so disappointed in this expensive product.</li>
            <li> Not for me!  Dries and scale after 15 mins of applying and very slow healing process</li>
            <li> helped with my surgical scars</li>
            <li> A little dab will do! And it smells nice! I have only started on my scar from knee surgery.... a new scar. Can already see some changes after a week. Will try it on old scars when I finish with this one.</li>
            <li> 7 months ago i had knee surgery, leaving a 8 inch scar on my left leg. A friend recommended me this product and I have now been using for 3 months. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 1 month I starting to see improvement. The scar was starting to blend in with my skin and now after 3 months it has improved tremendously. My daughter just started using the product a couple weeks ago and am looking forward to see the results. I highly recommend the product</li>
            <li> I bought this product after hearing friends rave about it. Well, I have been using it for a while now and dislike it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The perfume in this product irritated my fresh scars. I was sore and itchy. (There were no open wounds)&lt;br /&gt;- The gel dries to a film which rubs off your skin and can best be described as looking like dandruff everywhere you had applied it. This may not be a big deal if you only apply a small amount to a small scar, but take larger scars, and it is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using this product and it will be my last. For the price, I am not impressed!</li>
            <li> I have a surgerical scar under my chin and started using Mederma yesterday as suggested by my surgeon.  So far I think it&#x27;s not so great.  It&#x27;s watery and dries to a film that starts to flake, looks hidious, and peels off. Just what I need while I&#x27;m trying to not bring attention to that area. Others have said they think it is peeling the layers of their scar off and thought that was good.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s peeling the scar layers ... it&#x27;s only the Mederma flaking off. Also, I think it will take too many weeks before seeing if this is the proper treatment for me.  Today, I&#x27;m going to order a product called Scarprin which has silicone in it.  It&#x27;s also supposed to help with pain at the site.  It&#x27;s more costly, but it&#x27;s not supposed to itch.  There&#x27;s just got to be a better product.  I also wonder about just using something like a thin coating of Bacitracin.  Keep you posted.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely works! I don&#x27;t really have a huge problem with blemishes, but over the years I&#x27;ve had a few that left marks on my chin, some old, some new. Within a week of using this, I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in the scars, the color has lightened, and they&#x27;re getting smaller. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon.  Worked very well on healing scars after surgery.  It does have a bit of an odd stickiness after applying to the scar.  I also think it smells a bit odd but it did do what it said.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product on new surgical scars and on older scars from moles being removed. It works on the new and old scars, certainly diminished visibility, and softened the lumps (adhesions) the older scars had formed.</li>
            <li> Works so fast and well. I had a burn scar in my hand and its gone after using this gel for just two weeks only twice a day. Loved it. I recommend to buy this.</li>
            <li> the cream absorbs quickly into the scar tissue - applied twice per day promotes healing of surgical incision - good product</li>
            <li> I had bad pock marks and acne scars.  Not only did I pick at my face, I scarred it up too.&lt;br /&gt;This product visibly reduced my scars at least 50% and even eliminated a LOT of them.  I no longer feel ashamed  of my face.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd tube I just bought to see if I can reduce them any more.&lt;br /&gt;I used it at least once at night and sometimes in the morning too.  It took about 3 months to get the results mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Let me say at first I was a little upset my son an I are African American an we are a beautiful shade of caramel brown my lovely son rubbed his forehead on some carpet playing .......leaving two huge brown spots on his forehead the color of black coffee....huge they looked like two eyes I brought some mederma an applyed it every night for 2 months an during the day I used cocoa butter now you can hardly notice them it really really&lt;br /&gt;Works !!! It takes time its not a overnight treatment but I would recommend it his skin is blending back nice very satisfied with the product.I still apply it at night because being a mom I still notice it but he looks great an it really works keep using it if it worked on his rug burn it will work on anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m agree, you will definitely see an improvement in your scars. &amp;#34;you will see an improvement&amp;#34;. BUT: you will be very pleased. I would say a 90% improvement. Very important, Follow directions.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile and it has improved the appearance of my scars.  They are not gone but improved.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell and it dries my skin more than making it moist and supple.  Very thin gel.</li>
            <li> My wife began use this producto 1 month ago.  It works well, and she notes that the scar is clearing.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked for me. I will purchase this product again. I even used it after I had surgery. It really works well.</li>
            <li> works even better if you catch the scar early on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use it as directed which does require dedication. It has helped me heal from both a burn and a bad cut. Both are virtually undetectable now....but it does take time.</li>
            <li> No result using more then a month</li>
            <li> I bought this in February but it&#x27;s going to expire in April. How can this cream work for old scars within  3 months?</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.Because the product will expire in one month.When I received this product,I think it has no effect in a few days.</li>
            <li> I started using Mederma immediately after my double knee replacement last November. It has almost completey hidden the right scar &amp; the left is coming along also. This product is great, but must be used at least twice a day for best results</li>
            <li> This thing does not work at all. I used it after a relative recommended it to me. It is just a waste of money and time....and even worse it caused a flare in my acne, hence giving me more scars.....</li>
            <li> My daughter recently fell on a multi tyne auger in my barn,she received multiple lateral lacerations to her arm,none fatal(thank god),but all very serious.&lt;br /&gt;She is healing,She bought sone stuff locally,twice the price and not as good to hide scars.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be working,and is  half the price.&lt;br /&gt;If it helps my daughter I will give it 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;  BOB</li>
            <li> Received product fast, but when I opened the box I noticed the product had less than a month until it expires. I was not happy, but the package had a coupon for $4 off next purchase so I thought that was nice, until I realized the coupon expired a year ago. However, using the actual product I can tell a difference in my scar appearance. My scar is lighter in color and smoother.</li>
            <li> I bought the product in June, but the expiration is July. I don&#x27;t think I able to finish it within one month.</li>
            <li> Very good product, and sold at a good price. The price was good because the product&#x27;s expiration date is less than two months from the day I received it. My husband had knee surgery so luckily we will likely use it before it expires.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product on three recent scars. It takes 3 months to do it&#x27;s work, so I do not have a current opinion on this. However, I did use this project about 15 years ago and was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My wife took a bad spill several weeks ago leaving a really bad gash along her arm.  She&#x27;s been applying this since then.  So far, there&#x27;s been no sign of a keloid or rippling of the skin at the site of the wounds.  There is, however, a distinct discoloration at the site.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for an old sore which was healed, but it left a mark which would not go away.</li>
            <li> When it dries it becomes like an extra skin peeling off so it looks bad in front of others. I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it changes my skin because I didn&#x27;t use it for long.</li>
            <li> The price is really good. My doctor recommend it for me. The price is much cheaper than the one I got from CVS.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my acne scars.  I got married last December and I was using this product everyday for 3 months before the wedding.  I have tan skin with dark scars.  This product actually helped to make my scars a little lighter.  It didn&#x27;t make it disappear, but I can see a little difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have Mediterranean skin and fairly deep acne \\&quot;pitting\\&quot;.  My main goal with using this or any other product is to reduce the redness brought on by the severe acne I&#x27;ve had through my teens and early 20&#x27;s.  I bought this product two weeks ago to try it out and haven&#x27;t seen much change.  Also every time I use it I experience a burning/itching sensation on my skin.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and this product isn&#x27;t for me.  I did read a study that said using petroleum jelly vs mederma yielded good results.  I&#x27;m going to try that - just not a fan of how \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; petroleum jelly makes my face. I may also try \\&quot;Boots Expert Scare Care\\&quot; - I&#x27;ve heard it yields results.</li>
            <li> I use this to diminish my acne scarring. It even worked in fading very old (i.e.,15 years) acne scars I&#x27;ve had. If used immediately, my scars will go away within a week or so. I always have some handy.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product that did nothing to help my post surgical scars or a large rough patch of skin.  I spent $$$ on Mederma with high hopes to no avail.  I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews.  After applying this product for a couple months, I noticed no visible difference with my scarring and the rough patch of skin didn&#x27;t soften up at all.  I asked my doctor and he indicated that Mederma was only distinguished from other basic lotions by its marketing. He did recommend that I try Eucerin Original Healing - Soothing Repair Creme.  In just two weeks, my rough patch became softer. After a month, it is completely gone. I was amazed. My scars also show visible results.  Really, you only just need a very rich creme if you want results.  I bought a 16 ounce jar of Eucerin for half the price of 1.76 ounces of Mederma.  Save your money - Mederma is snake oil in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Mederma&#x27;s horrible. Does nothing to your dark spots. Bought this product and it did nothing. Plus, it was close to expiring so I really couldn&#x27;t use the full amount. Would not recommend to anyone. Two thumbs down. If you want to get rid of dark spots, buy Ambi.</li>
            <li> The new formula is just one treatment per day, which is very convinient. I used this cream for four months after the wounds close. It works. The dark color fades a lot. At the very beginning, I felt iching. Then, after putting it thinly on wound, iches disappear. Thanks to Mederma.</li>
            <li> Ok for new scars, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. It does seem to lighten a new scar but doesn&#x27;t take them away like the ads say. Just fades them a bit which a lot of people only need. Didn&#x27;t work for me with older scars.</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to work better than anything else I have tried.  I have severe ache scars.</li>
            <li> not sure if it actually works, or if my skin just naturally healed and scars faded since it took a long time to fade.</li>
            <li> im so happy that i found that the mederma scar cream worked so good for me my scar is nearly gone</li>
            <li> This works well the only down side is it must be applied for several months for major results. i don&#x27;t think there is anything out that will remove major scars in a month.</li>
            <li> Peter, in one of the 1-star reviews says save your money and use vaseline or vitamin E.  A comment on his thread questions whether he even used Mederma.  My wife and I have used vitamin E squeezed out of oral gel caps. She used it on the advise of her Podiatrist for new Bunyan scars.  I tried it on some new and old scars. Meh - KINDA works, the best results were for her new scars.  Then I just got some burn blisters on several locations on the top of my feet (HOT food on sandals!!). Started E, just as soon as the wounds healed.  Still Meh.  Switched to Mederma after one week as my wife&#x27;s Dermatologist recommended it for one of her scars.  We would both say we saw small but noticeable improvement in one week that to us seemed greater than E.  We understand and others have said you might need to keep at it for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I went to CVS for a 2nd tube of 20g.  TWENTY-SIX BUCKS???!!!!!!!????  Still a Hose with the CVS ubiquitous 25% coupon! Googled Best Price and landed here @ 50g for Twelve!!!  My God, Do Not Pay Retail for this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I think the smartest advice that I plan to start trying is in the &#x27;Peter - 1 star&#x27; Thread, because Peter and others said the key is keeping the scar moist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World&#x27;s Greatest says:&lt;br /&gt;You want the best option?&lt;br /&gt;1. Moisten scar with water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Mederma, wait for it to absorb in.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cover with petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;4. Repeat at least every 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;5. Take your multivitamin and drink plenty of water.&lt;br /&gt;  Posted on May 7, 2012 6:19:02 PM PDT</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my nose from picking a pimple and I wanted to get rid of it. So I got Mederma for $20. I used it for a week and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. But on week two it made my face worse.....I put it on other scars on my face from chicken pox and I broke out!!! I have very sensitive skin....Im going to start high school soon and I&#x27;m really nervous so this made me more nervous. I have to go to freshman orientation looking like a ugly pimple face with red marks on my face...nice...don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I started to use mederma cream  15 months after C section.I was quite sceptical about this cream because my scar was still bumpy and red and this magical cream took the sweling down and the redness out. I would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I keloid and have found that regular Vit-E works way better and way less expensive.</li>
            <li> This smells horrible and didn&#x27;t help too much with my scar.  It is also too pricey to keep repurchasing to see if it really helps with time so I gave up on it after I finished the first tube.</li>
            <li> Not on time. but very good product</li>
            <li> I have been through two tubes of this stuff. I was using it for about nine months with little to no result. After going online to do some research, I threw out my new tube. Apparently the active ingredient is derived from onion. There is no research that suggests this even works. They&#x27;re charging $20-$25 (I purchased everything at CVS) for a glorified snake oil treatment. Silicone, on the other hand, is where it&#x27;s at! I purchased Scar Away patches for roughly the same price. I got the results I wanted in about two weeks. From what I read, other brands are just as effective (Scar Guard etc.)</li>
            <li> I had a large (3\\&quot; by 4\\&quot;),deep scrape on my arm and I knew the scarring would be bad.  I began using Mederma as soon as it healed.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, but already I can tell that, what should have been a significant scar is now significantly smoother and flatter that I would have ever imagined. I am very surprised that I could see results so quickly.  The directions say for a new scar, use it 3 - 4 times a day for 8 weeks, which I intend to do.</li>
            <li> I have used Mederma on several scars and it diminished the scar to where it was almost invisible.  Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> At this moment I only can talk about delivery because the results of the teatment are expected in 8 weeks. I received the product in excelent conditions and on time</li>
            <li> it was a quick shipment,very nice package,best price.I just start using the product.hopefully it will work,probably will need buy more,will defanitely work with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I am of Russian and Germany decent, so I am very white and have super bad skin. Every scar I get stays red for years and they never get better. I used Mederma after my first operation the scars weren&#x27;t horrible but they were enough to make me stop wearing a two piece bathing suit. My friend gave me a tube of Mederma for my birthday in January and by July my scars were even with my skin tone. So for my second operation that happen this October (stupid gallbladder)I got another tube so I won&#x27;t have to miss beach season. It doesn&#x27;t work super quick and the scars don&#x27;t go away but it does take the noticeably out. I used about 7 tubes to make my first set of scars. This time I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m one week down and the scars look better already.</li>
            <li> Great for softening scars and excellent price.  Much cheaper here than at local drugstores and arrived in very short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mederma with sunblock and it&#x27;s much better. The gel does not soak in and dries slowly. It sits on top of your skin and dries with a high shine--not good on your face. One more thing: the label says to apply 3-4 times a day. Fat chance!</li>
            <li> Have not used the product yet, however have used other products from this manufacturer before and was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> very effective in removing scars but requires prolonged use, twice a day. buy the largest tube for full value for money.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true formula and we purchased here because the pricing was the best we&#x27;d seen locally as well as online.</li>
            <li> Este art&amp;iacute;culo es muy bueno, yo qued&amp;eacute; muy satisfecho con &amp;eacute;sta compra, creo que la relaci&amp;oacute;n costo-beneficio es excelente, por lo tanto recomiendo este producto.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> This product works great on all types of scars.  You just have to make sure you follow the directions and apply consistently.</li>
            <li> I had plastic surgery and this was recommended to me by my Dr. to use on my scars.  I used it faithfully every day and had great results with my scars.  It is somewhat expensive, but I shopped around and got it at good prices.  I don&#x27;t know how my scars would have healed without it, but I am glad I used it and didn&#x27;t have to find out!</li>
            <li> I love Mederma and think its really effective I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I once found it for seven dollars on Amazon and didn&#x27;t realize what a gem I had found. I should&#x27;ve bought a box full at that time. Now at $20 a pop I just can&#x27;t afford it. I&#x27;m going to sit and wait and watch for another deal. But if you&#x27;re looking for something that works. This does.</li>
            <li> recommend excellent product, excellent service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a good product, is seen to have great strength, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I was encouraged to use mederma due to having had surgery.  I saw no signs of improvement after careful application everyday.  I am an African American and I was very disappointed after having made this purchase that it did not work. The gel only left an itchy feeling afterwards and a scaly cast on the skin.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the product right away. I&#x27;m still in the process of using it. I will keep everyone posted after I&#x27;ve used it up. I bought for my finger which got broken and ripped up when my motorcycle hit gravel and I went down. A patch of skin came off of my arm too tho not a deep wound so we&#x27;ll see if that goes away as well....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the cream yet. However, I received today and the item shows an expiration date of 4/2014. This must have been sitting in a warehouse for some time. The instructions suggest use for 8 weeks before seeing results. This cream will be expired before the 8 weeks. I wish that I would have paid the extra $5 to buy from Wal-Mart. I checked today and their stock list a 10/2015 expiration.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this product for my acne scars for both sides of my cheeks &amp; the temples of my head. I used it as directed &amp; applied it 2 times a day but after a day or two, my skin became irritated &amp; red from it. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin &amp; this was  the first product that has EVER irritated &amp; made my skin red. I was not satisfied with this product. I definitely had to return it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my scar is too old, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. Idk yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the Mederma or if I am Wolverine and can just heal crazy well. I used this stuff religiously after my surgery and now you can barely see my scar. The 1.76 oz tube was plenty for my two inch scar. I used it several times a day and for a good 3 months and still have a ton left.</li>
            <li> Old cream. Leaves residue all over face. Does not rub in at all and has not visibly helped with scarring.</li>
            <li> this product didnt work for me like I thought it would</li>
            <li> Almost expire when I received it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff along with good delivery.</li>
            <li> Look at the others recommend to buy.Friend accidentally injured, hope this will have the effect.&lt;br /&gt;Now time is short, temporary can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> it seems to do what it promises.  also us bio-oil w/it.  they make a great combo. i still continue to use both.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my acne scars. I used the product the same day I received it in the mail. I applied a small amount, and once it had soaked into my skin on my face, I applied it once more. About two hours I wanted to check on it for results. I hadn&#x27;t noticed a major change the first time I looked in the mirror. But, as most things in life, it is not a magical on time use product. The second day I used it was before I went to sleep the next night. I let it soak into my face while I was sleeping. Once I woke up, I went to the mirror to evaluate, and I was shocked. I noticed that the smaller acne scars were almost completely unnoticeable, the larger scars were only a bit distorted, but still the product was affective on them. I am now into my fourth day into using it, and there has been major change to the appearance to my face. A lot less red acne spots. And a bigger smile. I am glad I gave this product a try. Although my friend has also ordered this same product, for the same reason I had. And he wasn&#x27;t as fortunate. He has much darker skin as I do. So, I would say that this product may work differently with other skin types. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes, petroleum may just be as good for the cheapos. Or how about old fashion lotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was formulated especially for scars so I say it is more effective and I&#x27;ve seen it first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a scar for my C-section and been using this product (and another product) for about 3 months and I&#x27;ve seen noticeable differences in the color and tone of my scar, it seems less noticeable and is starting to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using this with another scar product that I really like [[ASIN:B0058K508O Pura d&#x27;or Scar Treatment Solution (2 fl. oz.)]] . I use Mederma in the morning and Pura d&#x27;or at night. I prefer the scent of Pura d&#x27;or more but it is also more expensive.</li>
            <li> I must admit I have not been using the product daily for a while.  My attention was on the problems we faced during Sandy.  I did use it everyday when I first received it and see no changes in the scar.  I do not know how long it should take to see any results.</li>
            <li> Bought 4 mederma skin care for scars, and they all will expire in May 2014, how can I used all them up in 4 month? If you want to considering purchasing this product, just bewared you might get almost expired product and have to use them up before the expiration date. This is quite inconsiderate.</li>
            <li> I love scar gel! I had a two-plus year old scar from an old burn, and I put this stuff on and it has been slowly disappearing! Perhaps the one downside to this is that it makes my skin itchy right where I applied the cream. I didn&#x27;t notice this with store brands of scar gel (I had bought the name brand on Amazon because it was a comparable price to the store brands), so maybe the itchiness is just a Mederma characteristic? Not sure. Definitely helps get rid of my scar, though!</li>
            <li> The product says it could take 3 months to work.  I am only using it about a month so I don&#x27;t know yet the full results.  I do see some small improvement so I am hoping to see much better results in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Bought this product and it is great I originally intended to buy the advanced one but this just the job just as well only difference is you must apply it at least 3 times daily but after getting used to it that is no problem. I&#x27;ve has surgery a little over two months mow and the scar goes from pelvis to pelvis and right now it is like a fine line when it was huge before I could not be happier i will continue to use and recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was really strange experience for me. At the first time, it was ok after applying but at 2nd time, my face got so itch that I couldn&#x27;t even sleep at all. After that night, I do not use this anymore. Maybe it&#x27;s just me or my sensitive skin. I do liked the price, speedy shipping but this wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the local pharmacy and an amazing product.  Highly recommend using the product post surgery to elimiante scaring.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist did not recommend this product but I did a review of scar products and Merderma rated very high.  I am very pleased with the product up to this point.  I plan to use it another month or so.</li>
            <li> How many tubes do you need to use in order for your scars to lighten up. So far not working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this did anything to remove/reduce the scar that I was working on.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my neck that left a long and nasty scar. I am not that worried over my looks but it is very noticeable. Someone told me about Mederma so I bought a tube. You do have to use it several times a day for several weeks but it is a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest it will take 4-5 tubes but if you shop around Amazon has some good price options.</li>
            <li> There are results using Mederma but you need to religiously use it for 4-6 months. Its a good product and drys quick on the skin.</li>
            <li> I usually use Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector, which I love, but was getting a bit too expensive for me at the time. I was really hoping Mederma would help with my acne scars. I hate giving bad reviews but for me this only made my skin worse; it made my face extremely itchy I couldn&#x27;t bear it for more than I few minutes. I tried to get over that uncomfortable feeling and began sleeping with the serum on my face, but in the morning I would wake up with a very irritated face and breakouts on my cheek (I usually only broke out on the t-zone). This product just was not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a recent surgery scar. It has worked wonders. I apply it every day in the AM</li>
            <li> Medicated dermatar for your scar(:)!. Feels like peel-off mask, but isn&#x27;t oily and Works well after apricot scrab; retains the hydrated effect.</li>
            <li> It drys my skin. It makes my skin itchy.  This just wasn&#x27;t for me.  perhap for someone else. May next time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference at all, a waste of money.  I glad I bought it through Amazon instead of twice the price at a local store.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my scar after my thyroidectomy (after it healed of course). It was OK in the beginning, but then around week 3, it started to itch a little. I stopped after week 4 because the itching was really starting to be bothersome. I don&#x27;t think it did anything for my scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking to a friend, who said I had to do it for the entire 2 months, I started again. And this time the itching was unbearable right away. Like another poster said, it itched for a day after I washed it off. It was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now trying the Curad scar therapy, and have been using it for 4 days and have not itched at all. Plus, I think a little of the coloring has gone down, but it is hard to tell.</li>
            <li> My daughter had open heart surgery when she was 6 mos. old, and she is 12 years old now.&lt;br /&gt;I found this product is good for old scar too, so she starts using it for 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Her scar seems getting better. She will use this to make her feel better and looks better.</li>
            <li> Surgical scars on face and neck.  The surgeon recommended Mederma but only for a couple of months.  He said he has seen no evidence that scarring appearance improved after about two months&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I received item undamaged and on time as far as delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Would use seller again. The roller pen for scars compliment this Mederma. Massage in general does depending on location.&lt;br /&gt;This gel was used for after surgery with no hypotrophic scars were exhibited. Used to over time the color and dimension of scar becomes less obvious.</li>
            <li> Did wonders on my scar!</li>
            <li> Did not do much for me.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d. item, but too soon to tell how well it will work.</li>
            <li> I initially gave this seller 3 stars based on the fact that the product was received damaged.  Subsequently, the seller reached out and offered to exchange the item.  I really feel that this superior level of service is not something you would expect from a brick-and-mortar retailer so I am quite impressed and would give this seller 5 stars.  It&#x27;s like supporting a mom-and-pop business in the digital age.  Very cool.  No Target, WalMart, CVS...I am all for that!!  As far as the product, it&#x27;s too soon for me to rate its effectiveness so I will defer my rating on the product for later...</li>
            <li> it helps reduce the redness of acne and the appearance of acne scare that i have.</li>
            <li> YOU MUST Ask for the expiration date!!!!</li>
            <li> I think this works very well.  I have a major scar on my hand that gets very dry and sore.  This makes it soft again and stops the hurt.I wish the price was a little lower though</li>
            <li> I bought it on February and expiration date is in April same year. So I can use it only for less than 2 months? It is not even 8 weeks as stated in the instructions. So lame!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works--I got scratched on the entire left side of my face by my cat, to the point where everyone who noticed my scars had a horrified reaction and warned me that the scarring would probably never go away. I started using mederma on it once it was healed and scabbed over, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 months now (3-5 times a day) and my scars are practically invisible. My co-workers, family, and friends were completely shocked because they truly believed that they would not go away because of how awful they looked. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> did not work.  if anything, made my skin appear darker in the area i put it on.  don&#x27;t waste money</li>
            <li> Okay, so, before researching this product at all, I was using it, because of all the hype and ads on TV. Whenever I had a big scar or one I wanted to fade fast I would purchase Mederma, use it for a few months straight, and quit in disappointment. And I never noticed a difference; scars took just as long to fade with Mederma or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, to put it bluntly, there have been very few trials with Mederma and of those, one found no significant difference of Mederma vs. placebo, and one found effective results... in rabbits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the active ingredient in Mederma is onion. So, maybe save your money and apply diluted onion juice !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silicone sheets (and to a lesser extent gels) have really helped my scars and there have been many studies showing their effectiveness. Vitamin E, Mederma, etc though  are just snake oil.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a solution for stretch marks and scars. Used religiously morning and night until entire tube was empty. Before and after pictures show absolutely noooo change in appearance. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I receive the product on time and begin using right away...it&#x27;s all gone now but It does work doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or irritated well at least for me it didn&#x27;t but I would defiantly purchase it again</li>
            <li> Just getting started using it.  Will comment further after using for a couple of weeks.  Right now it is easy to apply and not messy.</li>
            <li> This product requires long-term use to see a difference but there definitely is one. Great for curling iron burns like mine!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Not about the product, since I am unable to use it, but in the seller Knockout Bargains. I ordered this product last week and just received the Mederma Scar Gel in the mail yesterday. I noticed that the expiration date is 07/14! Are you freaking kidding me? I spend $21 on a product that is going to expire next month! This is so wrong. They need to get some glasses and take some reading classes to see that shipping out a 07/14 expiration date product is unacceptable. They need to ship the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of at least 1/15, since this product is supposed to diminish scars within 8 weeks-6 months. I emailed Knockout Bargains and demanded a refund and another Mederma Scar Gel at no expense. We&#x27;ll see if they do anything. No wonder why their name is Knockout Bargains, they sell crap that is going to expire the month after you buy it. And it&#x27;s not the first time they sent out the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14, read other people&#x27;s reviews, those people also had received the Mederma Scar Gel with an expiration date of 07/14. I am a very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I get Mederma after my surgery last year.  It did absolutely nothing for my new scar.  I used it for 5 months straight as directed and still nothing.  However, I began using it on an old scar that I got about 2 years ago and it is fading nicely. Who knows???</li>
            <li> I bought this when I got several scratches on my hand from a cat.  You have to be consistent with using this but it does make the scar fade.  I used it for probably 6 weeks or so.  You really can&#x27;t even see where the scratches were now.</li>
            <li> Is definitely fading scars. Works slowly--you have to put on at least 3/day and use for months, but it does work!</li>
            <li> Great product was recommended by a friend to prevent scars.  Used it after a major cut and it worked great.  Very little scaring</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my new c-section scar and on my mother&#x27;s new burn scar, not so well on another older scar but still trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness. However, I did want to warn those with sensitive skin who are interested in using Maderma on their face. After using Maderma for a few days on a scar on my forehead (curling iron!), the area now becomes very itchy whenever the product dries after application. And because it&#x27;s itchy, I inevitably scratch or rub the area, which results in the product FLAKING off like dead skin. It&#x27;s pretty unattractive and sort of embarressing at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not CRAZY itchiness, like other reviewers have said, but it&#x27;s annoying. I think that I&#x27;ll probably keep using it, but only at home or when I know I won&#x27;t be seen in public. :)</li>
            <li> I have not really seen any major results but maybe some slight results i am questioning if even that but using it for a while so even if it works it does take a long long time</li>
            <li> I used it on both a new scar and an old one daily for 3 months, it has done absolutely nothing to either scar. Total waste of $25。</li>
            <li> I have been using Mederma daily for 4 months and see very little if any improvement in the appearance of my numerous scars. The one change I think I may be seeing is that my scars seem to be looking a little darker (closer to my skin tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these lack of results I will continue to use Mederma. I have a friend who used Mederma for 3 years on his scar and now you can barely see it. So it just might take more than 4 months to see results, despite the product claims. I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least 6 months to a year, and then re-evaluate the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it may be doing nothing, it makes me feel good to put the Mederma on every day. It makes me feel like I am actively doing something about this problem (my scars). It gives me hope and self-esteem to know that I am taking action to better myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with Mederma is it really dries out my skin, to the point of causing mild irritation when I use it. To combat this dryness I also use [[ASIN:B004AI97MA Bio-oil 4.2oz]] which is another scar treatment that also moisturizes the skin. Using this combination of products takes care of the dryness issue.</li>
            <li> I first tried Mederma back in the early 2000&#x27;s. It didn&#x27;t do much although I used exactly as was instructed on the tube. Was in an accident a couple of months ago and decided to try once more. No improvement. Using the cocoa butter stick has the same exact results and much cheaper. Save your money and just buy a cocoa butter stick or use Vitamin E oil.  Same result.</li>
            <li> If you use it right away, the scar is gone. You need to apply many times a day and it will work the manic.</li>
            <li> it is for people who want to cover up scars. You will have to keep buying it to keep them covered up - plus the gel stinks... like, it smells bad. It does work, but it will take some time for you to see the results.</li>
            <li> It does work, don&#x27;t expect it completely remove scars. It will however make them smooth and less noticeable. Also you must give it time to work (months.) Would rather the advanced version that you only apply 1x daily vs this which is 3x daily.</li>
            <li> way cheaper then the stores and it works great scar is getting smaller but it does take time to get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> When I use the product I get a rash around the entire area of the scar. Cannot use the product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this that long and I&#x27;ve already noticed positive results. It actually works better than cocoa butter,</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT HELP ME WITH MY SCAR AT ALL. I SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THIS ORDER LAST TIME. I WISH CAN RETURN IT BACK TO THE SELLER.</li>
            <li> According to my surgeon this is a must for the GIANT scar he left on me (to be fair, he had to, it was the only way in). I really think it&#x27;s helping minimize the ugliness of said scar. One note, DO NOT use this stuff after it expires. Just throw it out. It smells like bad breath if it goes past its date. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year for my daughter, after she fell and had to have stitches on her forehead.  It seemed to work, but then again she was only 2 - and kids that young heal pretty quickly.  It&#x27;s been sitting in our cupboard for over a year, and it occurred to me the other day to use it on myself.  I have had a terrible outbreak of rosacea this spring, and it has left a lot of scarring and redness.  No joke - I saw an improvement almost immediately!  Within 2 days I noticed a reduction in the redness, and one spot where I have a scar seems to look better.  Who knows, maybe it would have improved on it&#x27;s own anyway...  I doubt it though.  It hadn&#x27;t improved the tiniest bit in 2 months.  What the heck, I&#x27;m going to keep using it!  Plus it has an SPF 30.  Since sun exposure is a contributing factor to rosacea, this is a double bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to what other reviewers have mentioned about it flaking or balling up, I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all.  It goes on smooth and spreads easily.  My only issue is that it&#x27;s expensive, but really no more so than a lot of beauty products.</li>
            <li> Received on time and was exactly as described. This works well for scars I have used it before and liked it</li>
            <li> The product expire date id July 2014, I bought two. The costumer need ti know this information in the moment to buy the product</li>
            <li> He loved it so much it almost got Rid of his face scars from a fire boo ya baby lions</li>
            <li> Hubby has used this product on trauma induced scars, skin conditions on hands. It&#x27;s the only product that gives total relief from intense itching.</li>
            <li> You have to continue to use it for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> i have used this off and on for about a year and every time i am using it, it makes my smaller red acne scars go away in days and the larger ones in a couple weeks.  i swear by this, and although others say that there are natural remedies that beat mederma, i have used countless products that work this well.  two things about this product though, the product kinda peels off when you wear it, so it will not do good under makeup (i wear it at night). it has a slight onion smell, i can get past it because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I have laser burns all over my legs as a result of a laser hair removal session that went wrong. I tried other creams and lotions but Mederma has been the only one that is really working. My scars were big white circle-shape spots all over my legs. I was unable to wear a skirt or bathing suit for months. The first 3 weeks I was using Mederma I noticed a big difference, the white spots start looking more as my regular skin color and now I can barely  see them. I am still using Mederma and hopefully in few months the scars will be gone.</li>
            <li> Is there a negative rating option ?? -1000000000000 rating from my end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read good feedback about this product and bought for a scar on face of my son (2 yr and 9months). I applied as directed once a day. Next day he had a lot of small bumps around the area where it was applied and kept on growing in size and area. After couple of days his face turned red due to allergic reaction of this cream. I was very concerned and stopped applying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;The bumps went away after few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t apply this cream even on my scars....</li>
            <li> At this point, I can only rate it 5 stars for the price.  Don&#x27;t know if it really works for my case, since it takes a while to find out.  The price is great! It is about 1/3 or even 1/4 of the price when you buy it from retail store.</li>
            <li> Be careful!! Check the expiration date first!!! Dont be teased by price!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use on a thyroidectomy scar immediately after surgery. I used it for a year before giving up. It did provide some relief to the itchy dry feeling of a healing wound but it did nothing to diminish the scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a scar left from severe acne immediately when it was safe to use. It actually made it worse. My scar became beat red. I discontinued use and began to apply aloe gel to the scar. Within one day the redness was gone and the scar began to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are positive reviews on this product, maybe it will work better for you. It&#x27;s very expensive, I would recommend trying an aloe gel first, I purchased a large bottle for $3 at Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Did not use the product as it is not what I expected, therefore, the rating is for Beauty Time, not the product.&lt;br /&gt;The supplier, Beauty Time, posted a picture of a box of ADVANCED mederma in the ad, but sent regular mederma.&lt;br /&gt;Advanced mederma is applied once a day, regular mederma, a different product, is applied 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;The product was returned to Beauty Time using the return label sent, but was never acknowledged by Beauty Time,&lt;br /&gt;nor was any money refunded by Beauty Time.  Amazon credited my account for the amount paid. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...I was advised to use this after my surgery by a nurse friend of mine......Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, it worked Great on my stretch marks after my children. I also used it as a daily facial moisturizer  and noticed it quickly made my acne dark spots disappear! Yet the liquid tends to peel if massaged in. It&#x27;s a Great product line. The cream is even better to me, and the SPF in the cream is a Plus!</li>
            <li> Excelente Seller! Product as described and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I got stitches right below my eyebrow two months before my wedding and thought for sure I&#x27;d have a hideous red scar in all of my pictures. As soon as the cut healed, I started using this stuff a couple times a day. My scar was invisible in my pictures and is hardly noticable in person. I definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery on my lumbar spine. Mederma is helping to cover up the scar that was left after surgery. When we are done with its application, we should not even be able to tell I had surgery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife a few years after a bad cut left a nasty scar.  I was very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> The first few times I applied it, I got a red rash.  Because I hate this scar so much, I decided to stick with it.  a day later it got really itchy.  Probably not the best for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gel is really watery.  Good thing is it absorbs fast, bad thing is that it&#x27;s hard to target the spot of my small-ish burn scars.  This was a problem because of the itch mentioned above.  However, it might not be a problem for those who have larger scars.</li>
            <li> Great for use immediately after surgery or before scar tissue forms, however it can also be use on old scars.</li>
            <li> I swear by Mederma! Scars disappear before your eyes!</li>
            <li> It help clear my scars</li>
            <li> good moisturizer, but I feel like I should see more fading of the scar by now ... will continue to use as directed, hoping for continued fading</li>
            <li> At 9:30 a.m. Thanksgiving day I was bit in the face by a family dog.  It was an accident, but this product was recommended by my doctor and seems to be helping with the scarring and healing.</li>
            <li> I wish we had taken before shots to show the severe damage/scar my husband had on his forearm from a construction accident. He had to have 11 stitches. He started applying Mederma the same day his stitches were removed and it is amazing at how much his arm has healed in just two weeks of use. There is still a scar but it has lost most of the ugly, snarled appearance it started off with. The marks from the thread used to sew his arm are nearly gone. The scar itself is a pale pink color. You can definitely still see the injury but I am totally sold on this product. Because of how well it has worked so far for him, I intend to purchase some of the stretch mark cream once my baby is born in February. I will also post updates as his arm continues to heal. Also, the cream is supposed to be applied liberally, several times a day and my husband follows that religiously. It does have a slight floral scent but its a clean, lotion type smell. Not overwhelming at all. My husband has sensitive skin (he&#x27;s allergic to certain detergents, deodorants, etc) but has had no issues with the Mederma.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I decided to try Mederma on the small scars that remained after an appendectomy. The scars were fresh, and they responded extremely well to the product, especially when I applied it twice daily (my dermatologist recommended no more than twice daily). My scars have faded significantly. I also tried a silicone scar strip on the nastiest of the scars; it was raised, and the skin seemed a bit puckers. I wore the scar strip around the clock for a couple of weeks, removing and washing it when I showered (they are reusable), and that worked wonders. Between the two products, I&#x27;m very happy with the way my scars have healed.</li>
            <li> Went to a dermatologist to have a mole removed, and also asked about my still healing scar from a laceration (5 stitches). She said that this product doesn&#x27;t really work. Most of the results people get are from the skin naturally healing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for probably 1 1/2 to 2 months now and there has definitely been an improvement. I bought two of the medermas and I haven&#x27;t even gone through half of a tube of one and I use the amount they say to daily. I had a few burns from three months ago that weren&#x27;t disappearing a month later so I bought mederma and now they are so much better. The color has lightened and it is not noticeable anymore. The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, I wouldn&#x27;t call it appealing, but it doesn&#x27;t stay or anything. I would recommend this to anyone whose skin has not quite healed though I do not know about long term or surgery scars.</li>
            <li> I have some serious scars on the front of my leg from a December treadmill accident and this stuff has really faded them out alot.  You have to use it twice a day for good results of which I am kind of not so good about but it is really helping get rid of the scars.  I love this stuff and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Try something else. I had the lightest scar and it couldn&#x27;t even fade it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I leave a comment on Amazon EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been seeing significantly improvement on my new poison ivy scars (from June) after only 5 or 6 uses! I&#x27;m SO glad! I also tried it on an old scar from last summer, but haven&#x27;t really seen anything different. I think it does take time on old ones. I might see more improvement if I&#x27;m patient enough :P.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have been using it once a day; also, if I apply too much at once, it tends to dry out and peel up. I don&#x27;t know why, but maybe when I apply too much, the extra just goes to waste. In all, I am very happy with the results and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping does not expire for a year</li>
            <li> My husband bought me the big tube of Mederma for Christmas. I had just had a baby 6 months before this. I got stretch marks while I was pregnant. I was not happy! I started using Mederma and within 4 weeks I noticed a HUGE difference. My stretch marks were lighter, softer and less noticeable. Now (using Mederma for 3 months) My stretch marks are GONE. Seriously. I can&#x27;t see them, I can barley feel them and my skin is so soft. I love it and I&#x27;m so ready for summer. I don&#x27;t use it anymore and my stomach looks great! I didn&#x27;t even use half of my tube. I will buy it again with my next child!</li>
            <li> i  ues this a couple time but my face dosent have any change .i am not sure it will remove any scar so far,but i stop&lt;br /&gt;to ues it coz my skin dosent feel right&lt;br /&gt;when i apply it</li>
            <li> Used after surgery for about 7-8 months and saw a substantial decline in redness and scarring.</li>
            <li> Really works!! Has significantly diminished my c-section scar. This was my second surgery and the scar is much less noticeable since using mederma.</li>
            <li> I burned my hand in a kitchen oven and the burn scar it left me was pretty unsightly. The Mederma creamed worked to the point where the scar had faded and my burn mark is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a month on scars that i developed from my childhood. i have notices some results but i would need to purchase more of the product in order to receive the best results</li>
            <li> seems to work fine. bought it for wife for surgery scar. so far, so good. Bottle kinda small if u use it 3 to 5 times a day asrecomended.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mederma off and on for the last eight years or so. I have brown skin that is prone to hyperpigmentation. I recently burned my skin and my first instinct was to apply Mederma. Here&#x27;s the low-down on Mederma if one is not an avid user like myself: Mederma takes time to reduce the appearance of the scar, it must be applied religiously 3-4 times a day, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough--it takes A LOT of patience. Over the years I have had several burn scars disappear almost entirely with the help of Mederma, although I did exfoliate the area (once the injury was completely healed) in addition to using the product. I will add that I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating a scar without the aide of Mederma and it was not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read posts where people complain that their C-section scars did not disappear after a few months of using it. I will attest that my one-inch burn mark takes longer than that with Mederma and exfoliating. If I didn&#x27;t use Mederma, it would takes years, and the reduction of the scar would not be as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not that long ago that doctors were telling people that scars were for life and that there was nothing that could be done about them, so one has to have reasonable expectations when dealing with a scar. I have a scar that I have had for over twenty years that required several stitches, is light in color, but still noticeable, and Mederma did not help. For me, it is most effective with dark scars, particularly from burns, in which case I apply Mederma almost immediately (obviously if here is an open wound, one should wait until it is healed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, if you&#x27;ve never tried it, give it a shot. It&#x27;s probably the best chance you have at reducing the appearance of a scar. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from pure vitamin e, to other scar reduction creams, laser, hydroquinone cream 6% from my dermatologist, just to name a few. As a result, I always turn to Mederma for my burns. While I know it will take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Mederma 4 stars instead of five because it is not a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; application and it does take time. But for certain scars and with persistence, it can have a good effect.ll take some time and diligence, I am almost certain that the scar will eventually disappear (almost entirely), and that is much better than doing nothing and living with an unsightly scar indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Mederma 4 stars instead of five because it is not a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; application and it does take time.

            <li> The box and packaging are similar—but directions differ. The product received indicates the need to apply multiple times per day. Whereby my previous tube (different supplier, same price point) indicates 1X (as in the commercials). After looking more closely the date on this tube indicates 2009—so I am assuming this has been sitting on the shelf somewhere. That said, using (waste not to—and returning a hassle) but will not reorder from this supplier. Just be aware of what you are getting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now. Had injuries and started using this asap. It seems to be working. Not greasy or smelly, will keep using it until no sign of scarring disappears. Love it!!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful deal. My husband&#x27;s knee surgeon suggested to use Mederma. He said it not only helps the scare but the tissues around the scare. He also said to try Amazon. Great price for a bigger tube then I can get at the store. We will be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> buy for friends, who uses it and works</li>
            <li> I treat other non-keloid scars and it worked. I wished it worked on keloid scars, but it&#x27;s not working at all. It made other scars look lighter and evened out the skin complexion in its surrounding.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered the other Mederma that you only apply once a day. This must be applied 3-4 times a day, and I don&#x27;t remember to do that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who had shoulder surgery last year. It smoothed out her scar incision and reduced the scarring. My mom is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this on my incisions from surgery following an accident. I am hopeful it will help with the scar tissue. Too early to tell though as I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a week.</li>
            <li> I fell and scraped my knee a few weeks ago and it wasn&#x27;t healing well, so my doctor recommended this product.  After 5 days of use, I already notice a difference.  I will say that I am probably going to go through the tube in about 3 weeks, so the price is pretty high, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it since I won&#x27;t have a scar.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I managed to skillfully slice a huge hole in my arm. I was positive I would need stitches, it was quite deep. I managed to get it to heal on its own but I knew that left unattended, it would leave a terrible scar. Everyone I knew recommended I use Mederma. Reading the ingredients, I was hesitant. They seem like things in my spice cabinet for the most part, not something to make skin heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I didn&#x27;t let that stop me. I am on day 3 of using this and my cut has already gone from blatantly obvious to something that looks months old. If this is a new scar, I HIGHLY recommend this product. Definitely get it as soon as your wound scabs over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: This causes some serious itchiness when applied.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my scars.</li>
            <li> The product says it takes 6 months to heal scars, I used it for 3. I did not see much of an improvement. A bit pricey IMO, tube is very small. Probably will not recommend.</li>
            <li> Use several times. You can see the result but  the scar is still obvious. Maybe I need use it for longer time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the item and speed of service. The item was exactly as described and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pretty religiously (4 times a day) for the last 7 days and I can already see a remarkable difference in a most of my scars. Like others mentioned, it seems to work better on new scars as opposed to old (and in my experience, the newer the scar, the faster the result). I have had a couple of deep red scratch scars (about 6 months old), and after 7 days the color is lighter, the edges \\&quot;softer\\&quot;. I had a pretty \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; white scar (a year old or more) that has begun looking more like the color of my skin, but will probably take a little longer to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have been in front of the mirror dabbing this all over myself, I started rubbing the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; gel onto my chin (without makeup I have some old acne scars and redness) and I am SHOCKED at the difference it has made already. Any light pink acne scars or patches have almost totally disappeared. Last night my husband commented how clear my skin looks (without makeup) - seriously, after a week! And it really takes SO LITTLE - I think the bottle will last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with my regimen for a month + as it recommends, but it really is powerful stuff. Again, it is a GEL and leaves a white, sticky-looking residue but dries completely after a minute and you can put clothes on and go. I&#x27;m glad it is that sticky consistency so I know it is staying on and doing its job even when I am dressed and out the door.</li>
            <li> spreads clean and has no terrible smell and works very well and very quickly I love the effects the scar is fading quickly.</li>
