            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR MEN FACE, I have been using this product for 30 years every morning and night. leave my face fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It is interesting to observe that face wash did well in wash clean faces. Other items may not work as well in cleaning facial residues.</li>
            <li> This is a really great cleanser. No blemishes and my skin is radiant. I also bought the exfoliator and it works well with the face wash.</li>
            <li> But the use of concessions, the price is moderate, really is the value&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good, quality is also good, my family loves. It is also very convenient</li>
            <li> leaves the face moist and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;i had issues with other brands that do well on cleaning but leave the face all dry.&lt;br /&gt;this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Excellent for men with an oily complection.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product, at my suggestion.  So, every time we place an order, I&#x27;m asked to give it a review.  So, again .... it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wash, I&#x27;ve used it for years. My friend loved it so much she started using it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans effectively without drying out my skin&lt;br /&gt;- The Gel nature of the face wash is very pleasant in terms of texture. Feels silky and washes off very easily&lt;br /&gt;- Tube lasts a while, only need a dime drop to wash the face&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome blue colored face wash gel</li>
            <li> Smells great very pleasant makes u smile in the morning when u first jump in the shower with a grumpy face, works like a charm :) go for it guys</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m a guy and have no particular skin concern I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with many cleansers out there. The main problem with cheaper or less expensive cleansers is that they are usually drying. Now one should moisturize but your cleanser should not strip your skin in the first place...your skin should feel balanced after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I was running low on my current cleanser(clinique men regular) and decided to try clarins active wash based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser actually feels very good on the skin and almost has a milky texture. It smells amazing and did not leave my face dry.&lt;br /&gt;So why only 3 stars? Because it kinda irritated my skin. My skin got some minor redness around my cheeks and the cleanser left a bit of residue. I&#x27;m guessing it might be the fragrance or something else in the cleanser causing the minor issues. I switched back to clinique but bought the bar this time(I definitely wanted to try something different no matter what...I&#x27;m just like that) and like it better than this cleanser. Not a bad cleanser at all but the other products are working better for me.</li>
            <li> Only face wash I will use!</li>
            <li> Little bit strong but works good</li>
            <li> I love this face wash is so good that after using them you &#x27;wont feel the same with other drugstore brands, they clean your face great</li>
