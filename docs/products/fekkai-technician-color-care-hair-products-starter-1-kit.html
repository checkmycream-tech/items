            <li>bottles, perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>Hair products are subjective so what works well for me may not be the best solution for you.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers well and has a delicious fruity scent.  </li>
            <li>I have not been to a salon for some time so that is perfect.</li>
            <li>it smooths my hair and it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Fekkai is awesome.  </li>
            <li>My hair always feels so wonderful after I use it.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are the perfect size for travel, too.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is the best..</li>
            <li>i need color products and this makes my hair acutally  look like i have GOOD HAIR!!</li>
            <li>I tested out their products for colored hair and have been impressed.</li>
            <li>The smell, condition of my hair and shine is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very nice products!</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my hair and have always received compliments for it.</li>
            <li>What else would one expect from legendary Mr. Fekkai than luxurious products that work great.</li>
            <li>products are really great for color treated/ highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, along with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is a great starter set for the Fekkai color care line.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for colored or processed hair.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I never tried Fekkai before and this seemed like a great way to start.</li>
            <li>Great product, helps retain color.  </li>
            <li>My heart looks and feels great with this product.</li>
            <li>All Fekkai products that I have tried have been great, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo which is also great</li>
            <li>My hair felt amazing!</li>
            <li>And the best part (as so many have pointed out) is the three-minute mask.  </li>
            <li>Loving these products!</li>
            <li>Each has a pleasant fruity/floral scent,not surprising since peach and apricot extracts are listed among the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and it kept her blond (colored) hair bright and blond.    </li>
            <li>But if you use cheapo drugstore dye often like I do, this will probably not do you much good.</li>
            <li>Did not use the balm but still noticed the hair looked good.</li>
            <li>The box set is really nice and would make a really great gift.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed that the product protects my hair from fading but to be fair</li>
            <li>My hair looks gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>loved the way this made my hair smell.  </li>
            <li>I got this product from Influenster to try, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>The sizes are perfect for travel (and sampling), adequate to assess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this Fekkai set works well for some hair, perhaps it will be just great if you use higher-quality salon dye.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I have been very satisfied with the condition of my hair since I have been using these products.  </li>
            <li>While I do love a good hair product with a pleasant aroma, this was a plus for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Lovely!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this trial kit!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Fekkai products and have used the conditioner before which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>three products smell good, but are very lightly scented, so you won&#x27;t be overpowered with perfumes when you use them.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to try salon quality products for a super price!</li>
            <li>The conditioner made my hair feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I just used this today, and let me just say again, Amazing.  </li>
            <li>The mask is AMAZING -</li>
            <li>The shampoo I initially liked</li>
            <li>Leaves hair in really good condition, shiny, manageable, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Not because it made my hair color stay in longer, but I liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, I LOVED the hair mask.  </li>
            <li>Given this factor along with the expense of this kit, I would not re-purchase it on my own.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo forms a rich lather, and I was impressed with how well it seemed to add body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My wife really enjoyed these products and the feel and texture while using these right after coloring were awesome!  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no noticeable fading on the grays which is pretty incredible in my book.      </li>
            <li>However, I was most impressed with the mask as it really helped repair the damaged ends of my hair when I used it.</li>
            <li>The best shampoo and conditioner, which I think I prefer to this, comes in a brilliant green bottle and is known for its line of hair dyes.</li>
            <li>It make your hair soft and silky, and gives it a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, and it leaves my hair wonderfully silky but not limp.  </li>
            <li>One of the Most effective hair care products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After styling, I was even more thrilled with the products.</li>
            <li>NO Frizz which my hair always has - I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to order the full size bottles!!  </li>
            <li>Love love love I!</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great and cleans well, with a good but not excessive lather.  </li>
            <li>At $20, I find this an amazing easy to use alternative to Keratin.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>Purchased seperately, the items are much more exspensive...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the shampoo, conditioner, and most of all the hair mask/deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>However I am confident that anyone receiving this kit will be satisfied by the quality.</li>
            <li>The mask is to be used once a week to keep hair healthy.    </li>
            <li>I love Frederic Fekkai so could not pass up the chance to review this color care kit.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE the mask..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo conditioner is just ok and you can replace them with your favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>But with Fekkai, it&#x27;s much better behaved.  </li>
            <li>I love the mask -</li>
            <li>I realise that most brands these days do contain Parabens</li>
            <li>However, for someone who does not mind paying more for their hair care products, I would recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>and I believe that most of the credit goes to Fekkai.</li>
            <li>I have used the glossing products also and love them.  </li>
            <li>I said I was, only for him to say it was not at its best.</li>
            <li>Must be the shampoo :)</li>
            <li>Love Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li>but if you love your hair, this is the product line for you,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I was given a sample of these products and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>The conditioner also smells nice, and rinses out cleanly.    </li>
            <li>At first use, I loved the product.  </li>
            <li>have given it four stars anyway, primarily because the final product of the three, the treatment in the jar, which you can see on the cover, is excellent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore I was very excited to be receiving this Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter kit, which is NOT small and is packaged very nicely, to try on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>I really like the bright fruity scent.</li>
            <li>No frizz or fly aways, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild and sweet, but leaves a nice clean scent for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the Fekkai set feels good on the hair and smells nice, the shampoo lather especially feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and it kind of has a glow to it now!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine.  </li>
            <li>I think they all could be a great part of a regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of these products free from Influenster.</li>
            <li>This product leaves hair silky, smooth, and glossy.  </li>
            <li>If hair care products are not something you feel comfortable splurging on, then this line is not for you.</li>
            <li>After trying the shampoo and conditioner, I like the light scent, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair color fading for any extended length of time.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is wonderful and not too harsh.  </li>
            <li>This kit is a great way to sample before investing in a larger supply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The products really do work best together, using only the shampoo will not leave your hair protected the way using the conditioner and the mask will.</li>
            <li>agree that the deep treatment is a bonus that is good for any kind of hair and may be worth the price of the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the creme rose scent so much that they all have because it smells fresh and clean without being overly perfumy.</li>
            <li>like this shampoo and conditioner because it gives my fine hair body and helps it to feel clean.</li>
            <li>Great starter kit if you want to try out these products - there is enough for about 1 week of hair washing, and a few deep conditioning treatments - also great for if you&#x27;re going on a trip and want to make sure your hair looks great (and your hair color stays)</li>
            <li>Normally, my hair has a mind of its own.  </li>
            <li>The Fekkai color care line smells great, is gentle on your hair, and leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>nothing special...</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this is a good and</li>
            <li>and you think how much you love the scent of the hair products?</li>
            <li>The formulas are a nice consistency and left my hair feeling soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>My initial reaction was, love, love, love, now after some time using it I&#x27;m really sold on 2/3 of this starter kit.  </li>
            <li>They smell great and each of the individual items worked really well.</li>
            <li>It actually felt more healthy.</li>
            <li>That is ok; I really wanted to try them and see if they were worth the investment</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has dry hair and it really soaked up the conditioner and mask to give her a wonderful less frizzy feeling and look, accompanied by a nice light fruity scent that lingered after the wash and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that it is already better than my normal color care line.    </li>
            <li>I liked the smell of the shampoo and the conditioner, They left my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>The green (glossing) formula works great</li>
            <li>After using these products, my hair felt very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is not only smells amazing</li>
            <li>But the 3-Minute Mask is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and i did find it prolonged the color from fading and dulling) and the scent is fresh and melon like.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using Fekkai products for years and have always found them to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>The product has a Tangerine or Apricot type of a scent which I liked at first, but after a while I find it to be sickeningly sweet to the point where I want to put my hair back to keep it from wafting in my face.  </li>
            <li>Wrap hair in towel, turban style, till excess water is absorbed.</li>
            <li>(this dryer is worth every penny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all if you spend this kind of money on hair care then this product is competitive and equal to the salon brands.</li>
            <li>totally worth the price</li>
            <li>Although pricey, they are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered just enough that I was able to get my hair feeling nice and clean and the conditioner definitely softened my hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s good salon-quality hair care.</li>
            <li>If you buy drug store brands and are not willing to spend to get superior treatment, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>It may work better on someone younger with more natural oil in their hair.</li>
            <li>I loved getting free samples to test from influenster and plan to possibly get some myself next time</li>
            <li>Others who have hard water would have to use more soap no matter what kind.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding and superior to other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>This kit keeps my blonde hair looking awesome, all year round.</li>
            <li>After using the product a few times, I have to say that it is better than most store bought brands.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this is a good product - it will leave your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells fantastic but not perfumey as I&#x27;m very sensitive to that.</li>
            <li>This product is expensive and runs out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color care products work best over time.</li>
            <li>I know you can&#x27;t judge the product based on the container, it speaks quite a bit about the quality the manufacturer is willing to put in.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>The harsh winter weather usually played havoc with my wife&#x27;s hair but these combined products really helped her look her best and feel her best this past month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>first thing I remember was the scent.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair tangle free but not too soft where it depletes the body.</li>
            <li>The mask has the rich consistency of a body butter, and it definitely feels like a special treat when I use</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it was not over conditioned, flat or greasy.</li>
            <li>It just continues to look vibrant and colorful between colorings.  </li>
            <li>(I have noticed that some brands are a lot more watery and require more product to achieve a thick lather).  </li>
            <li>In fact, the way it wakes up is pretty much the way it&#x27;s going to stay all day.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>The product smells nice and has a silky feel at first, but it really dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is left shiny, healthy and soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and I actually think the price is good given how much you get of the mask especially!!</li>
            <li>It kept my color vibrant until time to visit the hair salon again!</li>
            <li>I use very good products, expensive.</li>
            <li>This set is particularly great for blondes as it prevents a green tinge that can develop over time in blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In heat, humidity, rain, cold, or snow; I know my hair is going to look awesome thanks to Fekkai.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All I can really do with this set is tell you the basics and</li>
            <li>I began to find it very drying and stopped using it.</li>
            <li>The products are gentle on my hair and scalp and rinse</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and grows fast</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  MEF</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling really silky.  </li>
            <li>(given how much you get) reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it does sometimes.</li>
            <li>This product has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>B001P6DOCY L&#x27;Oreal Professionnel Expert Serie - Intense Repair Masque - 500ml/16.9oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Gentle and protects and extends color.</li>
            <li>three products put together really made a difference</li>
            <li>I just \\&quot;stuck my finger in a light socket\\&quot; as the editor of the magazine I write for commented about a recent photo of me I sent her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a gentle peach aroma that stayed with me through out</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner might work well for someone with very oily hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the conditioner and masque</li>
            <li>I hate to say it, but the best product I&#x27;ve found so far for healthy colored hair is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Although the shampoo and conditioner are pleasant, I can&#x27;t say they are superior to significantly less expensive products and therefore cannot justify the cost.  </li>
            <li>There are many other products on the market that will work just as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two days I noticed that my hair was more dry than normal and didn&#x27;t have as much volume as normal.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this kit for about 2 weeks, and I really can&#x27;t say that I notice much of a difference with my color compared to when I used my normal hair care items.  </li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and actually had to Google how to use a hair mask (my first time).</li>
            <li>The product itself had a light herbal scent, but as it dried a strong floral perfume developed.  </li>
            <li>I did not have enough of the sample products to use long term to see if they prolonged my color, but they definitely left my hair feeling soft and supple and it looked great.</li>
            <li>After about a month, I think the salon color is still vibrant.  </li>
            <li>my hair just soaked it up and left my hair super shiny and</li>
            <li>Similarly, I tend to use inexpensive shampoo and conditioner products, so I was very interested to see if using this designer-brand kit would make a difference in preserving my color longer as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t give me a sense of using some high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people who have to color hair often to hide grays.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Fekkai for anyone looking for a lower cost alternative to helping control their color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since bought a big bottle, left my hair very clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>The scent of course is a personal preference but beware that it is sweet and a little overwhelming if you are sensitive to smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this kit on my professionally colored hair let me go an extra month before I had to get a full color redo.</li>
            <li>The second thing that I am not crazy about is the scent.  </li>
            <li>This may be a great product for women that don&#x27;t have long thick hair, which I have</li>
            <li>Although i can&#x27;t really judge how good it is at maintaining color in the long term (because the sample I received was small), I enjoyed using the product and likely will again after i get my grey hairs colored in at the salon.</li>
            <li>It did an adequate job of cleaning and coupled with the conditioner, left my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>*finally* found the right shampoo and conditioner for me.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was &#x27;ok&#x27; but didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special, especially considering the above average cost.</li>
            <li>I live in the South, so this is a problem at times with all the humidity.</li>
            <li>As a woman that colors her hair quite frequently (every 6 to 8 weeks) I am always on the prowl for a product that will protect the condition of my hair and help keep the color vibrant.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, I have stopped experimenting with more expensive hair color brands and have stuck with one of the cheapest ones available, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick and does a nice job of leaving my hair soft without over-conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say they protected my color as my sample was not large enough for more than 2 washes and 1 conditioning use.  </li>
            <li>For the days that I use a regular shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to give this product line</li>
            <li>The mask treatment, used weekly is like a small piece of heaven, my hair is more manageable and the softness blows me away every time.  </li>
            <li>and it has grown nearly to my waist!</li>
            <li>All three products have a pleasant, orange-y scent (the mask is less subtle) that I like very much.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice idea, but the bottles are simply too small to be considered anything but a sampler.</li>
            <li>so my wife will more than likely purchase those less costly items and work within our budget.  </li>
            <li>Of course that&#x27;s not the main benefit--the main benefit is that with Fekkai my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to look washed out after several showers.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it definitely protects the color and minimizes fading (and I like to dye it bright red, which is very prone to fading), but it just doesn&#x27;t look shiny and healthy if I don&#x27;t add a bunch of other expensive balms and shine spray afterward.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late fifties and have hair to my shoulders, I really need a powerful and consistent product to keep my hair from flying straight up into a total frizz ball and looking like</li>
            <li>I did notice less fading, and at $___ a pop for color, this was a significant savings -- extended my color</li>
            <li>I usually use, but if price were not an object, this would likely edge out my next favorite, Biolage, due to prettier packaging and a better smell.</li>
            <li>- left my hair feeling soft, and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>For the blonde to brunette color range, it will probably prevent fading very well.</li>
            <li>My mother used it in her hair - she has mature, color treated hair - and both of us were amazed with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you have colored hair and really want it to shine, I recommend Kroma Saver Balm by Kemon (a salon product) which really helps out even the cheapest shampoo/conditioner, but only for shiny appearance and not necessarily hair health.  </li>
            <li>It did an admirable job of leaving my hair soft and manageable but</li>
            <li>do not have to use a lot of the shampoo and conditioner because I have a soft water filtration system.</li>
            <li>That is an advantage of soft water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really comment on how well it protected my color since the sample I was sent only lasted for two</li>
            <li>The real treat is the deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and this product made my hair soft, and still maintained the luster from the coloring.</li>
            <li>Although it may be a bit more expensive than store brands, these products are worth it.    </li>
            <li>The shampoo is thick and lathers well, and the conditioner seems very rich.</li>
            <li>If you continue to take care of your hair using the color kit, then you will notice that your color not only stays vibrant, but your hair will have a luscious feel to it.</li>
            <li>The bottles are small which is great for packing and travel, but not quite small enough to be used for carry-on(the two bottles are 4oz each.)</li>
            <li>My stylist actually commented that my hair felt healthier than normal.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and long, and I simply would need much more product in order to tell if it really helped with fading.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what I want, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash it to get it to look respectable.  </li>
            <li>Most I give away after giving them a few tries,  but the Fekkai is a keeper.  </li>
            <li>My hair was fine after the one-time use, but not much different than with my usual Kirkland brand shampoo.</li>
            <li>But there are so many other brands offering color-protection in larger bottles for half the price.</li>
            <li>I use, the color generally starts to fade after about a month.  </li>
            <li>And it left my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I will say that it left my hair soft and shiny, and I had no problems styling or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>regimen (every other day or more)- Shampoo Fekkai as usual, then condition and add treatment to ends.</li>
            <li>Recently my hair has been feeling a bit dry, but these products really seemed to help with that (especially to ultra conditioning color creme).</li>
            <li>I did like the deep conditioning mask, it left my hair soft and my color shiny.  </li>
            <li>After using this kit for nearly a year, I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in the thickness, softness and overall appearance of my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to purchase and use these regularly due to the price point, but all three are definitely going on my holiday</li>
            <li>- I live in New England and have not been out in the sun to test this factor out since it has been snowing just about everyday.  </li>
            <li>I have blond highlights and my regrowth is typically accelerated, plus I live near sun and sea salt.</li>
            <li>Leave on at least ten minutes before rinsing off with cool water.</li>
            <li>She would like to try them again if the price were to come down on the kit, but at this time the cost per wash it too high to justify the use.</li>

            <li> bottles, perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Hair products are subjective so what works well for me may not be the best solution for you.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well and has a delicious fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> I have not been to a salon for some time so that is perfect.</li>
            <li> it smooths my hair and it feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Fekkai is awesome.  </li>
            <li> My hair always feels so wonderful after I use it.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are the perfect size for travel, too.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is the best..</li>
            <li> i need color products and this makes my hair acutally  look like i have GOOD HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I tested out their products for colored hair and have been impressed.</li>
            <li> The smell, condition of my hair and shine is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very nice products!</li>
            <li> I take very good care of my hair and have always received compliments for it.</li>
            <li> What else would one expect from legendary Mr. Fekkai than luxurious products that work great.</li>
            <li> products are really great for color treated/ highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, along with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is a great starter set for the Fekkai color care line.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great for colored or processed hair.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I never tried Fekkai before and this seemed like a great way to start.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps retain color.  </li>
            <li> My heart looks and feels great with this product.</li>
            <li> All Fekkai products that I have tried have been great, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo which is also great</li>
            <li> My hair felt amazing!</li>
            <li> And the best part (as so many have pointed out) is the three-minute mask.  </li>
            <li> Loving these products!</li>
            <li> Each has a pleasant fruity/floral scent,not surprising since peach and apricot extracts are listed among the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and it kept her blond (colored) hair bright and blond.    </li>
            <li> But if you use cheapo drugstore dye often like I do, this will probably not do you much good.</li>
            <li> Did not use the balm but still noticed the hair looked good.</li>
            <li> The box set is really nice and would make a really great gift.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that the product protects my hair from fading but to be fair</li>
            <li> My hair looks gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> loved the way this made my hair smell.  </li>
            <li> I got this product from Influenster to try, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The sizes are perfect for travel (and sampling), adequate to assess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this Fekkai set works well for some hair, perhaps it will be just great if you use higher-quality salon dye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have been very satisfied with the condition of my hair since I have been using these products.  </li>
            <li> While I do love a good hair product with a pleasant aroma, this was a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Lovely!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this trial kit!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Fekkai products and have used the conditioner before which I LOVE!</li>
            <li> three products smell good, but are very lightly scented, so you won&#x27;t be overpowered with perfumes when you use them.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try salon quality products for a super price!</li>
            <li> The conditioner made my hair feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I just used this today, and let me just say again, Amazing.  </li>
            <li> The mask is AMAZING -</li>
            <li> The shampoo I initially liked</li>
            <li> Leaves hair in really good condition, shiny, manageable, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Not because it made my hair color stay in longer, but I liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, I LOVED the hair mask.  </li>
            <li> Given this factor along with the expense of this kit, I would not re-purchase it on my own.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo forms a rich lather, and I was impressed with how well it seemed to add body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife really enjoyed these products and the feel and texture while using these right after coloring were awesome!  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no noticeable fading on the grays which is pretty incredible in my book.      </li>
            <li> However, I was most impressed with the mask as it really helped repair the damaged ends of my hair when I used it.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner, which I think I prefer to this, comes in a brilliant green bottle and is known for its line of hair dyes.</li>
            <li> It make your hair soft and silky, and gives it a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, and it leaves my hair wonderfully silky but not limp.  </li>
            <li> One of the Most effective hair care products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After styling, I was even more thrilled with the products.</li>
            <li> NO Frizz which my hair always has - I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to order the full size bottles!!  </li>
            <li> Love love love I!</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great and cleans well, with a good but not excessive lather.  </li>
            <li> At $20, I find this an amazing easy to use alternative to Keratin.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> Purchased seperately, the items are much more exspensive...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the shampoo, conditioner, and most of all the hair mask/deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> However I am confident that anyone receiving this kit will be satisfied by the quality.</li>
            <li> The mask is to be used once a week to keep hair healthy.    </li>
            <li> I love Frederic Fekkai so could not pass up the chance to review this color care kit.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE the mask..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo conditioner is just ok and you can replace them with your favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> But with Fekkai, it&#x27;s much better behaved.  </li>
            <li> I love the mask -</li>
            <li> I realise that most brands these days do contain Parabens</li>
            <li> However, for someone who does not mind paying more for their hair care products, I would recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> and I believe that most of the credit goes to Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I have used the glossing products also and love them.  </li>
            <li> I said I was, only for him to say it was not at its best.</li>
            <li> Must be the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Love Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> but if you love your hair, this is the product line for you,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I was given a sample of these products and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> The conditioner also smells nice, and rinses out cleanly.    </li>
            <li> At first use, I loved the product.  </li>
            <li> have given it four stars anyway, primarily because the final product of the three, the treatment in the jar, which you can see on the cover, is excellent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore I was very excited to be receiving this Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter kit, which is NOT small and is packaged very nicely, to try on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> I really like the bright fruity scent.</li>
            <li> No frizz or fly aways, shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild and sweet, but leaves a nice clean scent for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the Fekkai set feels good on the hair and smells nice, the shampoo lather especially feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and it kind of has a glow to it now!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was fine.  </li>
            <li> I think they all could be a great part of a regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these products free from Influenster.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair silky, smooth, and glossy.  </li>
            <li> If hair care products are not something you feel comfortable splurging on, then this line is not for you.</li>
            <li> After trying the shampoo and conditioner, I like the light scent, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair color fading for any extended length of time.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is wonderful and not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> This kit is a great way to sample before investing in a larger supply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products really do work best together, using only the shampoo will not leave your hair protected the way using the conditioner and the mask will.</li>
            <li> agree that the deep treatment is a bonus that is good for any kind of hair and may be worth the price of the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the creme rose scent so much that they all have because it smells fresh and clean without being overly perfumy.</li>
            <li> like this shampoo and conditioner because it gives my fine hair body and helps it to feel clean.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit if you want to try out these products - there is enough for about 1 week of hair washing, and a few deep conditioning treatments - also great for if you&#x27;re going on a trip and want to make sure your hair looks great (and your hair color stays)</li>
            <li> Normally, my hair has a mind of its own.  </li>
            <li> The Fekkai color care line smells great, is gentle on your hair, and leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> nothing special...</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this is a good and</li>
            <li> and you think how much you love the scent of the hair products?</li>
            <li> The formulas are a nice consistency and left my hair feeling soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was, love, love, love, now after some time using it I&#x27;m really sold on 2/3 of this starter kit.  </li>
            <li> They smell great and each of the individual items worked really well.</li>
            <li> It actually felt more healthy.</li>
            <li> That is ok; I really wanted to try them and see if they were worth the investment</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has dry hair and it really soaked up the conditioner and mask to give her a wonderful less frizzy feeling and look, accompanied by a nice light fruity scent that lingered after the wash and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that it is already better than my normal color care line.    </li>
            <li> I liked the smell of the shampoo and the conditioner, They left my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> The green (glossing) formula works great</li>
            <li> After using these products, my hair felt very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not only smells amazing</li>
            <li> But the 3-Minute Mask is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> and i did find it prolonged the color from fading and dulling) and the scent is fresh and melon like.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products for years and have always found them to be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> The product has a Tangerine or Apricot type of a scent which I liked at first, but after a while I find it to be sickeningly sweet to the point where I want to put my hair back to keep it from wafting in my face.  </li>
            <li> Wrap hair in towel, turban style, till excess water is absorbed.</li>
            <li> (this dryer is worth every penny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all if you spend this kind of money on hair care then this product is competitive and equal to the salon brands.</li>
            <li> totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Although pricey, they are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered just enough that I was able to get my hair feeling nice and clean and the conditioner definitely softened my hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s good salon-quality hair care.</li>
            <li> If you buy drug store brands and are not willing to spend to get superior treatment, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> It may work better on someone younger with more natural oil in their hair.</li>
            <li> I loved getting free samples to test from influenster and plan to possibly get some myself next time</li>
            <li> Others who have hard water would have to use more soap no matter what kind.</li>
            <li> It is outstanding and superior to other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li> This kit keeps my blonde hair looking awesome, all year round.</li>
            <li> After using the product a few times, I have to say that it is better than most store bought brands.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this is a good product - it will leave your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells fantastic but not perfumey as I&#x27;m very sensitive to that.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and runs out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color care products work best over time.</li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t judge the product based on the container, it speaks quite a bit about the quality the manufacturer is willing to put in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The harsh winter weather usually played havoc with my wife&#x27;s hair but these combined products really helped her look her best and feel her best this past month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> first thing I remember was the scent.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair tangle free but not too soft where it depletes the body.</li>
            <li> The mask has the rich consistency of a body butter, and it definitely feels like a special treat when I use</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it was not over conditioned, flat or greasy.</li>
            <li> It just continues to look vibrant and colorful between colorings.  </li>
            <li> (I have noticed that some brands are a lot more watery and require more product to achieve a thick lather).  </li>
            <li> In fact, the way it wakes up is pretty much the way it&#x27;s going to stay all day.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> The product smells nice and has a silky feel at first, but it really dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is left shiny, healthy and soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and I actually think the price is good given how much you get of the mask especially!!</li>
            <li> It kept my color vibrant until time to visit the hair salon again!</li>
            <li> I use very good products, expensive.</li>
            <li> This set is particularly great for blondes as it prevents a green tinge that can develop over time in blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In heat, humidity, rain, cold, or snow; I know my hair is going to look awesome thanks to Fekkai.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> All I can really do with this set is tell you the basics and</li>
            <li> I began to find it very drying and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> The products are gentle on my hair and scalp and rinse</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and grows fast</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  MEF</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling really silky.  </li>
            <li> (given how much you get) reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it does sometimes.</li>
            <li> This product has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> B001P6DOCY L&#x27;Oreal Professionnel Expert Serie - Intense Repair Masque - 500ml/16.9oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Gentle and protects and extends color.</li>
            <li> three products put together really made a difference</li>
            <li> I just \\&quot;stuck my finger in a light socket\\&quot; as the editor of the magazine I write for commented about a recent photo of me I sent her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a gentle peach aroma that stayed with me through out</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner might work well for someone with very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the conditioner and masque</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but the best product I&#x27;ve found so far for healthy colored hair is the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Although the shampoo and conditioner are pleasant, I can&#x27;t say they are superior to significantly less expensive products and therefore cannot justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> There are many other products on the market that will work just as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two days I noticed that my hair was more dry than normal and didn&#x27;t have as much volume as normal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for about 2 weeks, and I really can&#x27;t say that I notice much of a difference with my color compared to when I used my normal hair care items.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and actually had to Google how to use a hair mask (my first time).</li>
            <li> The product itself had a light herbal scent, but as it dried a strong floral perfume developed.  </li>
            <li> I did not have enough of the sample products to use long term to see if they prolonged my color, but they definitely left my hair feeling soft and supple and it looked great.</li>
            <li> After about a month, I think the salon color is still vibrant.  </li>
            <li> my hair just soaked it up and left my hair super shiny and</li>
            <li> Similarly, I tend to use inexpensive shampoo and conditioner products, so I was very interested to see if using this designer-brand kit would make a difference in preserving my color longer as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t give me a sense of using some high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people who have to color hair often to hide grays.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Fekkai for anyone looking for a lower cost alternative to helping control their color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since bought a big bottle, left my hair very clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> The scent of course is a personal preference but beware that it is sweet and a little overwhelming if you are sensitive to smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this kit on my professionally colored hair let me go an extra month before I had to get a full color redo.</li>
            <li> The second thing that I am not crazy about is the scent.  </li>
            <li> This may be a great product for women that don&#x27;t have long thick hair, which I have</li>
            <li> Although i can&#x27;t really judge how good it is at maintaining color in the long term (because the sample I received was small), I enjoyed using the product and likely will again after i get my grey hairs colored in at the salon.</li>
            <li> It did an adequate job of cleaning and coupled with the conditioner, left my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> *finally* found the right shampoo and conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was &#x27;ok&#x27; but didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special, especially considering the above average cost.</li>
            <li> I live in the South, so this is a problem at times with all the humidity.</li>
            <li> As a woman that colors her hair quite frequently (every 6 to 8 weeks) I am always on the prowl for a product that will protect the condition of my hair and help keep the color vibrant.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, I have stopped experimenting with more expensive hair color brands and have stuck with one of the cheapest ones available, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and does a nice job of leaving my hair soft without over-conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say they protected my color as my sample was not large enough for more than 2 washes and 1 conditioning use.  </li>
            <li> For the days that I use a regular shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to give this product line</li>
            <li> The mask treatment, used weekly is like a small piece of heaven, my hair is more manageable and the softness blows me away every time.  </li>
            <li> and it has grown nearly to my waist!</li>
            <li> All three products have a pleasant, orange-y scent (the mask is less subtle) that I like very much.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice idea, but the bottles are simply too small to be considered anything but a sampler.</li>
            <li> so my wife will more than likely purchase those less costly items and work within our budget.  </li>
            <li> Of course that&#x27;s not the main benefit--the main benefit is that with Fekkai my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to look washed out after several showers.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it definitely protects the color and minimizes fading (and I like to dye it bright red, which is very prone to fading), but it just doesn&#x27;t look shiny and healthy if I don&#x27;t add a bunch of other expensive balms and shine spray afterward.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties and have hair to my shoulders, I really need a powerful and consistent product to keep my hair from flying straight up into a total frizz ball and looking like</li>
            <li> I did notice less fading, and at $___ a pop for color, this was a significant savings -- extended my color</li>
            <li> I usually use, but if price were not an object, this would likely edge out my next favorite, Biolage, due to prettier packaging and a better smell.</li>
            <li> - left my hair feeling soft, and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> For the blonde to brunette color range, it will probably prevent fading very well.</li>
            <li> My mother used it in her hair - she has mature, color treated hair - and both of us were amazed with the results.  </li>
            <li> If you have colored hair and really want it to shine, I recommend Kroma Saver Balm by Kemon (a salon product) which really helps out even the cheapest shampoo/conditioner, but only for shiny appearance and not necessarily hair health.  </li>
            <li> It did an admirable job of leaving my hair soft and manageable but</li>
            <li> do not have to use a lot of the shampoo and conditioner because I have a soft water filtration system.</li>
            <li> That is an advantage of soft water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on how well it protected my color since the sample I was sent only lasted for two</li>
            <li> The real treat is the deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and this product made my hair soft, and still maintained the luster from the coloring.</li>
            <li> Although it may be a bit more expensive than store brands, these products are worth it.    </li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and lathers well, and the conditioner seems very rich.</li>
            <li> If you continue to take care of your hair using the color kit, then you will notice that your color not only stays vibrant, but your hair will have a luscious feel to it.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small which is great for packing and travel, but not quite small enough to be used for carry-on(the two bottles are 4oz each.)</li>
            <li> My stylist actually commented that my hair felt healthier than normal.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long, and I simply would need much more product in order to tell if it really helped with fading.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what I want, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash it to get it to look respectable.  </li>
            <li> Most I give away after giving them a few tries,  but the Fekkai is a keeper.  </li>
            <li> My hair was fine after the one-time use, but not much different than with my usual Kirkland brand shampoo.</li>
            <li> But there are so many other brands offering color-protection in larger bottles for half the price.</li>
            <li> I use, the color generally starts to fade after about a month.  </li>
            <li> And it left my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I will say that it left my hair soft and shiny, and I had no problems styling or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> regimen (every other day or more)- Shampoo Fekkai as usual, then condition and add treatment to ends.</li>
            <li> Recently my hair has been feeling a bit dry, but these products really seemed to help with that (especially to ultra conditioning color creme).</li>
            <li> I did like the deep conditioning mask, it left my hair soft and my color shiny.  </li>
            <li> After using this kit for nearly a year, I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in the thickness, softness and overall appearance of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to purchase and use these regularly due to the price point, but all three are definitely going on my holiday</li>
            <li> - I live in New England and have not been out in the sun to test this factor out since it has been snowing just about everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have blond highlights and my regrowth is typically accelerated, plus I live near sun and sea salt.</li>
            <li> Leave on at least ten minutes before rinsing off with cool water.</li>
            <li> She would like to try them again if the price were to come down on the kit, but at this time the cost per wash it too high to justify the use.</li>
            <li> Very convenient sizes for trips of over a week long, when 3 oz or less hair products won&#x27;t suffice.</li>
            <li> The mask almost solid and goes a long way, but again, it&#x27;s not going to last long enough for me to tell you whether this product will prevent my hair from fading.</li>

            <li> I want to state that first my hair has a tendency to wave and frizz at the least amount of air humidity.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know.</li>
            <li> After coloring, my hair is harsh and rough; the conditioner made my hair feel natural and soft again.  </li>
            <li> the dye on the gray hairs has faded and is slightly lighter than the rest of my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I regularly color my hair, so between that and aging, it&#x27;s gotten dry.</li>
            <li> Sunlight and other harsh conditions as well as how much minerals are in your water play a role in damaging your hair too.</li>

            <li> mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think after I finish the Fekkai trio, unless it begins to improve my hair drastically, I will go on looking for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot;: a line of hair care products which makes my hair look like it did when I was 16 and had long, shiny, silky, once again.</li>
            <li> Might be costly if you have long hair</li>

            <li> I left it on a little longer than the directed 3 minutes, since I have such long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but not good enough to justify the price.    </li>
            <li> And unless you use this day-after-day (which you can&#x27;t do with such little bottles), you&#x27;re not going to see any different results regardless which brand you use.</li>

            <li> But for several years now I have been unable to grow my long blonde (highlighted) hair past a certain point on my back.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner worked much as I expected they would.</li>
            <li> The color of the product is a sort of muted pink that reminded me of what manufacturers thought women wanted in the 1960s.   </li>
            <li> Then comb out using wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> The problem with shampoos that protect color treated hair is that we do not really know if they alone are protecting the hair.</li>
            <li> So if I had to narrow it down, I would probably pay the extra money for the 3 minute mask, but not for the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used both Salon Brands and brands that are sold in such stores as Target and Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I bought the small kit to try and will buy larger bottles.</li>
            <li> The ends always seemed to be a little dry and thinner than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately after several uses my hair looks just as dull and flyaway as ever.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned in that time, it&#x27;s that with red, a color deposit shampoo and/or conditioner at least twice a week is a must.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help retain my dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few salon conditioners trying to tame my dry, wavy, thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> However, it is unlikely that this kit will help my color to last longer, as it has been about three weeks now and all three products are almost gone (using the shampoo and conditioner once daily, the mask twice per week as recommended).  </li>

            <li> At the very least, try the shampoo.    </li>
            <li> It does feel and smell expensive when using it in the shower, but my hair looks about on par with mid-range drugstore shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I would bring it up in case there are some people that are wary of Parabens.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to say that I really enjoyed using them. They smell great and each of the individual items worked really well. The shampoo lathered just enough that I was able to get my hair feeling nice and clean and the conditioner definitely softened my hair. However, I was most impressed with the mask as it really helped repair the damaged ends of my hair when I used it. I think they all could be a great part of a regular hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try salon quality products for a super price! Purchased seperately, the items are much more exspensive...products are really great for color treated/ highlighted hair. You&#x27;ll love the shampoo, conditioner, and most of all the hair mask/deep conditioner. It make your hair soft and silky, and gives it a beautiful shine! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter Kit&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo and Conditioners are in little, 4oz. bottles, perfect for traveling. But the 3-Minute Mask is by far my favorite. I left it on a little longer than the directed 3 minutes, since I have such long hair. And it left my hair extremely soft and manageable. If the price were lower, I&#x27;d recommend this product. But there are so many other brands offering color-protection in larger bottles for half the price. And unless you use this day-after-day (which you can&#x27;t do with such little bottles), you&#x27;re not going to see any different results regardless which brand you use. This is a nice idea, but the bottles are simply too small to be considered anything but a sampler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair various shades of red for fifteen years. If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned in that time, it&#x27;s that with red, a color deposit shampoo and/or conditioner at least twice a week is a must. I&#x27;m generally very skeptical of product lines that claim to protect and prolong hair color, especially reds, if they do not deposit color. For the days that I use a regular shampoo and conditioner, I was willing to give this product line a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not enough product here for me to evaluate whether or not it will keep my hair color from fading over time, especially the tiny jar with the hair mask. My hair is thick and long, and I simply would need much more product in order to tell if it really helped with fading. All I can really do with this set is tell you the basics and how I felt my hair looked after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three products smell good, but are very lightly scented, so you won&#x27;t be overpowered with perfumes when you use them. While I do love a good hair product with a pleasant aroma, this was a plus for me. The shampoo and conditioner worked much as I expected they would. The shampoo is thick and lathers well, and the conditioner seems very rich. The mask almost solid and goes a long way, but again, it&#x27;s not going to last long enough for me to tell you whether this product will prevent my hair from fading. I will say that it left my hair soft and shiny, and I had no problems styling or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these products for anyone who chemically processes their hair on a regular basis. For the blonde to brunette color range, it will probably prevent fading very well. I would urge redheads who want to try this product to supplement it with color deposit products a couple of times a week. Other than that, it&#x27;s good salon-quality hair care.</li>
            <li> Hair products are subjective so what works well for me may not be the best solution for you. I held off for months before putting up my review. My initial reaction was, love, love, love, now after some time using it I&#x27;m really sold on 2/3 of this starter kit.  The conditioner is thick and a little goes a long way (I have colored treated hair and i did find it prolonged the color from fading and dulling) and the scent is fresh and melon like. It leaves my hair full-bodied and soft.  The mask treatment, used weekly is like a small piece of heaven, my hair is more manageable and the softness blows me away every time.  The shampoo I initially liked but after a continual use (I did purchase the larger sizes) I began to find it very drying and stopped using it. The only other quibble and rather annoying if you&#x27;re going to spring for the large sizes since they aren&#x27;t inexpensive is the product is darn difficult to get out of the containers.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these products free from Influenster. I liked the smell of the shampoo and the conditioner, They left my hair clean.  I cannot say they protected my color as my sample was not large enough for more than 2 washes and 1 conditioning use.  I did like the deep conditioning mask, it left my hair soft and my color shiny.  I do think it&#x27;s too expensive to buy on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Although I have used this product before, this packaging is misleading as it does not note what the ounces are on each bottle.  It is pricey for the size you buy.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair silky, smooth, and glossy.  My mother used it in her hair - she has mature, color treated hair - and both of us were amazed with the results.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products for years and have always found them to be well worth the money. If hair care products are not something you feel comfortable splurging on, then this line is not for you. This product is expensive and runs out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color care products work best over time. If you continue to take care of your hair using the color kit, then you will notice that your color not only stays vibrant, but your hair will have a luscious feel to it. This set is particularly great for blondes as it prevents a green tinge that can develop over time in blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products really do work best together, using only the shampoo will not leave your hair protected the way using the conditioner and the mask will. The shampoo is formulated to prevent color washout, while the conditioner and mask are formulated to protect and soften your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this kit on my professionally colored hair let me go an extra month before I had to get a full color redo.</li>
            <li> What else would one expect from legendary Mr. Fekkai than luxurious products that work great. I did notice less fading, and at $___ a pop for color, this was a significant savings -- extended my color an extra two weeks (no greys, but reds fade quicker).</li>
            <li> I have salon colored hair and fading and texture are always an issue.  I received this kit the day after a salon visit and was eager to give it a try.  The set contains a small shampoo, conditioner and three minute mask.  The sizes are perfect for travel (and sampling), adequate to assess. Each has a pleasant fruity/floral scent,not surprising since peach and apricot extracts are listed among the ingredients.  The scent is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is definitely low lather.  It did an adequate job of cleaning and coupled with the conditioner, left my hair soft and shiny.  The mask however was divine.  The difference was noticeable.  My hair was soft,silky but still manageable.  I was pleased that it was not over conditioned, flat or greasy. After about a month, I think the salon color is still vibrant.  The products are gentle on my hair and scalp and rinse cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase the mask again.  It is outstanding and superior to other similar products I have used.  Although the shampoo and conditioner are pleasant, I can&#x27;t say they are superior to significantly less expensive products and therefore cannot justify the cost.  However I am confident that anyone receiving this kit will be satisfied by the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shampoos &amp; conditioners, from expensive salon stuff to the cheapest thing at Walgreens.  My hair is colored and grows fast so I have to color it often (every three weeks), so I tend to use drugstore hair dye because otherwise I&#x27;d go bankrupt!  Or, heaven forbid, GRAY!    Anyway, the Fekkai set feels good on the hair and smells nice, the shampoo lather especially feels luxurious.  I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately after several uses my hair looks just as dull and flyaway as ever.  On the plus side, it definitely protects the color and minimizes fading (and I like to dye it bright red, which is very prone to fading), but it just doesn&#x27;t look shiny and healthy if I don&#x27;t add a bunch of other expensive balms and shine spray afterward.  It does feel and smell expensive when using it in the shower, but my hair looks about on par with mid-range drugstore shampoo/conditioner.  It&#x27;s a decent product, but not good enough to justify the price.    If you have colored hair and really want it to shine, I recommend Kroma Saver Balm by Kemon (a salon product) which really helps out even the cheapest shampoo/conditioner, but only for shiny appearance and not necessarily hair health.  I hate to say it, but the best product I&#x27;ve found so far for healthy colored hair is the [[ASIN:B0006Q3NTS WEN® Fig Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] from the infomercials!  I&#x27;m sure this Fekkai set works well for some hair, perhaps it will be just great if you use higher-quality salon dye.  But if you use cheapo drugstore dye often like I do, this will probably not do you much good.</li>
            <li> This set contains shampoo, conditioner and mask.    The shampoo is great, along with the conditioner.  Leaves hair in really good condition, shiny, manageable, and healthy.  It does seem to help retain my dark brown color.  I had my friend try it and it kept her blond (colored) hair bright and blond.    The mask is to be used once a week to keep hair healthy.    Although it may be a bit more expensive than store brands, these products are worth it.    At the very least, try the shampoo.    Highly Recommended!  MEF</li>
            <li> The Fekkai Color Care Starter Kit was a real disappointment.  I tried the shampoo two times before discarding the remainder.  Both times it left my hair feeling gummy.  The scent is maybe supposed to be grapefruit but it smells artificial and a bit of a chemical salon odor.  The ink on the bottle had already come off by the second time I used it.  I felt that didn&#x27;t bode well for what it was doing to my hair.  On the other hand, the condition seemed to do a terrific job of restoring moisture to my hair.  The mask is so-so.  It seems to just be a thicker version of the conditioner.  The color of the product is a sort of muted pink that reminded me of what manufacturers thought women wanted in the 1960s.   I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.  I can&#x27;t comment if it lives up to its claims of making the color stay truer longer and so on.  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to know.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for about 2 weeks, and I really can&#x27;t say that I notice much of a difference with my color compared to when I used my normal hair care items.  However, I do like the products.  The shampoo lathers well and has a delicious fruity scent.  The conditioner also smells nice, and rinses out cleanly.    The crowning jewel in this kit is the 3 minute mask.  I use it once a week, and it leaves my hair wonderfully silky but not limp.  I am not sure if the mask is sold separately, or just in the kit.  If it is in fact sold by itself, I plan on buying a larger container of it.</li>
            <li> I love Frederic Fekkai so could not pass up the chance to review this color care kit. I have blond highlights and my regrowth is typically accelerated, plus I live near sun and sea salt. So I always am looking to extend the life of my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First washing: Used the shampoo, conditioner and balm. With the application of the shampoo and conditioner, I left them on for a minute before rinsing. I also applied shampoo heavily to the roots. The color looked improved for the 2-3 days in between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second washing: Same procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third washing: Same procedure. I noticed that when I combed my scalp the color even concealed the regrowth a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth washing: Did not use the balm but still noticed the hair looked good. You only use the balm twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It kept my color vibrant until time to visit the hair salon again! I have not been to a salon for some time so that is perfect. My hair seems silkier and healthier.</li>
            <li> After trying the shampoo and conditioner, I like the light scent, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair color fading for any extended length of time. However, I did like the 3 minute mask. Not because it made my hair color stay in longer, but I liked the way it made my hair feel. It actually felt more healthy. So if I had to narrow it down, I would probably pay the extra money for the 3 minute mask, but not for the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d suggest buy the mask alone separately.. like rest of teh reviewers.. LOVE the mask.. can skip the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo conditioner is just ok and you can replace them with your favorite drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter set for the Fekkai color care line.  I actually just dyed my hair two days before it arrived and have been using it since and I&#x27;ve noticed that it is already better than my normal color care line.    I dye my hair with a semi-permanent gloss to cover grays and usually within a few days the dye on the gray hairs has faded and is slightly lighter than the rest of my natural hair.  It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and there&#x27;s no noticeable fading on the grays which is pretty incredible in my book.      The fragrance is very mild and sweet, but leaves a nice clean scent for the rest of the day.  The box set is really nice and would make a really great gift. The bottles are small which is great for packing and travel, but not quite small enough to be used for carry-on(the two bottles are 4oz each.)</li>
            <li> Normally, my hair has a mind of its own.  In fact, the way it wakes up is pretty much the way it&#x27;s going to stay all day.  But with Fekkai, it&#x27;s much better behaved.  It still doesn&#x27;t necessarily do what I want, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash it to get it to look respectable.  Of course that&#x27;s not the main benefit--the main benefit is that with Fekkai my hair doesn&#x27;t begin to look washed out after several showers.  It just continues to look vibrant and colorful between colorings.  And the best part (as so many have pointed out) is the three-minute mask.  It leaves your hair feeling really silky.  Overall, I would say this is a good and (given how much you get) reasonably priced product.  Definitely worth trying.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This kit keeps my blonde hair looking awesome, all year round. In heat, humidity, rain, cold, or snow; I know my hair is going to look awesome thanks to Fekkai.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter Kit smells like candy.  So it doesn&#x27;t give me a sense of using some high quality product.  The prints on the bottle wears away before it is used up, even though the bottle is small.  I know you can&#x27;t judge the product based on the container, it speaks quite a bit about the quality the manufacturer is willing to put in.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter Kit gives you small bottles for you to try their product. I highlight my hair at the salon every few months, and it definitely keeps it from fading so fast.  The shampoo lathers great and I like the fragrance, same goes for the conditioner. It&#x27;s on par with the shampoo and conditioner I buy from the salon. I love the mask - it smooths my hair and it feels wonderful. My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much as it does sometimes. I live in the South, so this is a problem at times with all the humidity. Very nice products!</li>
            <li> The product smells nice and has a silky feel at first, but it really dried out my hair.  In addition, it seemed that instead of helping the color last longer, it actually faded faster than without it.  At least that was my experience on my hair.  I&#x27;m in my fifties and my hair tends to be dry anyway.  It may work better on someone younger with more natural oil in their hair.</li>
            <li> As a woman that colors her hair quite frequently (every 6 to 8 weeks) I am always on the prowl for a product that will protect the condition of my hair and help keep the color vibrant.  In the past, I have used both Salon Brands and brands that are sold in such stores as Target and Walmart.  I think that the Salon Quality brands do usually outpeform the brands that you can buy at any old store.  Which brings me to my review of the Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter Kit.  At first use, I loved the product.  The Shampoo goes on rather thick so you can feel it lathering in your hair (I have noticed that some brands are a lot more watery and require more product to achieve a thick lather).  The conditioner made my hair feel amazing.  To top it all off, I LOVED the hair mask.  After using the product a few times, I have to say that it is better than most store bought brands.  However, there are some things that I don&#x27;t necessarily like about the product.  For starters, the product contains Parabens.  I realise that most brands these days do contain Parabens but I thought I would bring it up in case there are some people that are wary of Parabens.  The second thing that I am not crazy about is the scent.  The product has a Tangerine or Apricot type of a scent which I liked at first, but after a while I find it to be sickeningly sweet to the point where I want to put my hair back to keep it from wafting in my face.  The scent of course is a personal preference but beware that it is sweet and a little overwhelming if you are sensitive to smell.  I have not noticed that the product protects my hair from fading but to be fair - I live in New England and have not been out in the sun to test this factor out since it has been snowing just about everyday.  Overall, I would say this is a good product - it will leave your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly at home, and I have noticed that no matter what hair color brand I use, the color generally starts to fade after about a month.  For this reason, I have stopped experimenting with more expensive hair color brands and have stuck with one of the cheapest ones available, [[ASIN:B0038TK262 Revlon ColorSilk Hair Color - Dark Soft Brown 33/3WB]].  Similarly, I tend to use inexpensive shampoo and conditioner products, so I was very interested to see if using this designer-brand kit would make a difference in preserving my color longer as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have been using this kit--which includes shampoo, conditioner, and 3-minute conditioning \\&quot;mask\\&quot; (a deep conditioner designed to be used about twice a week)--since my last at-home color.  All three products have a pleasant, orange-y scent (the mask is less subtle) that I like very much.  The shampoo forms a rich lather, and I was impressed with how well it seemed to add body to my fine hair.  The conditioner is thick and does a nice job of leaving my hair soft without over-conditioning.  The mask has the rich consistency of a body butter, and it definitely feels like a special treat when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been very satisfied with the condition of my hair since I have been using these products.  However, it is unlikely that this kit will help my color to last longer, as it has been about three weeks now and all three products are almost gone (using the shampoo and conditioner once daily, the mask twice per week as recommended).  Given this factor along with the expense of this kit, I would not re-purchase it on my own.  However, for someone who does not mind paying more for their hair care products, I would recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> This product has worked really well for me. I take very good care of my hair and have always received compliments for it. But for several years now I have been unable to grow my long blonde (highlighted) hair past a certain point on my back. The ends always seemed to be a little dry and thinner than the rest of my hair. So I have always had to cut them. After using this kit for nearly a year, I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in the thickness, softness and overall appearance of my hair and it has grown nearly to my waist! Anyone with bleach treated hair knows how difficult that is and I believe that most of the credit goes to Fekkai. Great product. The green (glossing) formula works great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen (every other day or more)- Shampoo Fekkai as usual, then condition and add treatment to ends. Leave on at least ten minutes before rinsing off with cool water. Wrap hair in towel, turban style, till excess water is absorbed. Add a small amount of [[ASIN:B000TKH6G2 It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product, 4-Ounces]] OR [[ASIN:B003E23HGU Miracle Styling Serum Serum Unisex by It&#x27;S A 10, 4 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B003OW8H38 AVEDA by Aveda: DAMAGE REMEDY DAILY HAIR REPAIR 3.4 OZ]]. Work into hair, concentrating on ends and avoiding scalp. Leave hair alone for another ten minutes. Then comb out using wide tooth comb. Dry with [[ASIN:B000VAHAQ6 T3 Micro Featherweight Hair Dryer]] (this dryer is worth every penny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip- I have found this product in larger sizes, at half the price, at Mar#$%lls and TJ*&amp;%ax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other hair car products that I use occasionally for a change up-&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0018209PU WEN® Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner 32oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001P6DOCY L&#x27;Oreal Professionnel Expert Serie - Intense Repair Masque - 500ml/16.9oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001F51PXA Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist Deeeeep Liquid Conditioner, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001JQLNRS Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Shampoo, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]] &amp; [[ASIN:B001JQLNS2 Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Conditioner, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]01JQLNS2 Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Conditioner, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and full of body.  I bought the small kit to try and will buy larger bottles. Great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I used for over a month, doesn&#x27;t take much, plus the heavy moisturizer in jar I still have over 1/2 left.&lt;br /&gt;Really conditions hair.  This is a must buy product.</li>
            <li> Very convenient sizes for trips of over a week long, when 3 oz or less hair products won&#x27;t suffice. I use the products regularly at home too. Great for colored or processed hair. Gentle and protects and extends color.</li>
            <li> One of the Most effective hair care products I have ever used. My hair is left shiny, healthy and soft after the first use. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Fekkai is awesome.  My hair always feels so wonderful after I use it.  I would buy it all the time if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  lol</li>
            <li> I never tried Fekkai before and this seemed like a great way to start. I absolutely love these! The bottles are the perfect size for travel, too. I have really thick hair so this set only lasted me about 3 weeks. That is ok; I really wanted to try them and see if they were worth the investment and they are!</li>
            <li> I have used the glossing products also and love them.  I just used this today, and let me just say again, Amazing.  My hair looks gorgeous.  No frizz or fly aways, shiny and soft.  Oh you can not go wrong with this product.  Love love love I!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a black that is not even found in the outer reaches of space so to maintain it I use very good products, expensive. This isn&#x27;t a fave of mine. It did an admirable job of leaving my hair soft and manageable but the deal breaker for me was when my husband asked if I was doing something to different to my hair. Expecting a compliment I said I was, only for him to say it was not at its best. This may be a great product for women that don&#x27;t have long thick hair, which I have, I didn&#x27;t have enough product left to use for a second round.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great and cleans well, with a good but not excessive lather.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few salon conditioners trying to tame my dry, wavy, thick coarse hair.  Most I give away after giving them a few tries,  but the Fekkai is a keeper.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading of color.  For the price, I&#x27;m not sure I prefer it over the Pantene for colored hair I usually use, but if price were not an object, this would likely edge out my next favorite, Biolage, due to prettier packaging and a better smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps retain color.  Works well to repair damage.  Highly recommend for people who have to color hair often to hide grays.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoyed these products and the feel and texture while using these right after coloring were awesome!  The harsh winter weather usually played havoc with my wife&#x27;s hair but these combined products really helped her look her best and feel her best this past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has dry hair and it really soaked up the conditioner and mask to give her a wonderful less frizzy feeling and look, accompanied by a nice light fruity scent that lingered after the wash and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three products put together really made a difference but not enough to justify the cost for the size and amount of product.  There are many other products on the market that will work just as well so my wife will more than likely purchase those less costly items and work within our budget.  She would like to try them again if the price were to come down on the kit, but at this time the cost per wash it too high to justify the use.</li>
            <li> I like Fekkai products, and have used them before. However I haven&#x27;t previously tried this particular collection. I think that uniformally the Fekkai line is quite above average and accomplishes what it claims it will.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I was very excited to be receiving this Fekkai Technician Color Care Starter kit, which is NOT small and is packaged very nicely, to try on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However it just couldn&#x27;t do the job it claimed it could do.&lt;br /&gt;I have given it four stars anyway, primarily because the final product of the three, the treatment in the jar, which you can see on the cover, is excellent. It ALMOST helped my hair, which is dreadfully damaged from overenthusiatic home color treating with whatever hair dye suits my mood.&lt;br /&gt;As I am in my late fifties and have hair to my shoulders, I really need a powerful and consistent product to keep my hair from flying straight up into a total frizz ball and looking like I just \\&quot;stuck my finger in a light socket\\&quot; as the editor of the magazine I write for commented about a recent photo of me I sent her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried plenty of upscale shampoos and conditioners, and pharmacy products, as well, to tame my hair. The best shampoo and conditioner, which I think I prefer to this, comes in a brilliant green bottle and is known for its line of hair dyes. It has a serum as well. People like me NEED hair serum. You CAN get it at the pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I plan to finish this set up because it isn&#x27;t bad. Four stars because frankly it might do the trick for those of you with less damaged hair than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think after I finish the Fekkai trio, unless it begins to improve my hair drastically, I will go on looking for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot;: a line of hair care products which makes my hair look like it did when I was 16 and had long, shiny, silky, once again. I don&#x27;t think it is going to happen, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!</li>
            <li> The problem with shampoos that protect color treated hair is that we do not really know if they alone are protecting the hair. Sunlight and other harsh conditions as well as how much minerals are in your water play a role in damaging your hair too. These are variables with each person. Genetics are a variable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo and conditioner because it gives my fine hair body and helps it to feel clean. There is no residue that is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the deep treatment is a bonus that is good for any kind of hair and may be worth the price of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have to use a lot of the shampoo and conditioner because I have a soft water filtration system. Others who have hard water would have to use more soap no matter what kind. That is an advantage of soft water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you spend this kind of money on hair care then this product is competitive and equal to the salon brands. If you buy drug store brands and are not willing to spend to get superior treatment, then this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> My heart looks and feels great with this product. LOVE IT! Definitely salon quality. My stylist actually commented that my hair felt healthier than normal. Must be the shampoo :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this color care collection in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the way this made my hair smell.  It has a gentle peach aroma that stayed with me through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on how well it protected my color since the sample I was sent only lasted for two washes.&lt;br /&gt;After two days I noticed that my hair was more dry than normal and didn&#x27;t have as much volume as normal.  This shampoo/conditioner might work well for someone with very oily hair.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo, conditioner, and color masque samples that I got recently in my Fekkai VoxBox from Influenster. I love the creme rose scent so much that they all have because it smells fresh and clean without being overly perfumy. After using these products, my hair felt very silky and smooth. Recently my hair has been feeling a bit dry, but these products really seemed to help with that (especially to ultra conditioning color creme). I did not have enough of the sample products to use long term to see if they prolonged my color, but they definitely left my hair feeling soft and supple and it looked great.</li>
            <li> All Fekkai products that I have tried have been great, and this is no exception.  The shampoo is wonderful and not too harsh.  The conditioner was fine.  The real treat is the deep conditioner.  After coloring, my hair is harsh and rough; the conditioner made my hair feel natural and soft again.  Although i can&#x27;t really judge how good it is at maintaining color in the long term (because the sample I received was small), I enjoyed using the product and likely will again after i get my grey hairs colored in at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of color care shampoos and conditioners, and with the Fekkai line, feel like I&#x27;ve finally found one that works -- and won&#x27;t break the bank. Loving these products! One thing no one tells you about aging: your hair gets dry. I regularly color my hair, so between that and aging, it&#x27;s gotten dry. The Fekkai color care line smells great, is gentle on your hair, and leaves it feeling soft and clean. I still have to use additional products post-shower,  but I feel that I&#x27;ve *finally* found the right shampoo and conditioner for me. P.S. This kit is a great way to sample before investing in a larger supply.</li>
            <li> I want to state that first my hair has a tendency to wave and frizz at the least amount of air humidity. After years of purchasing costly Keratin treatments, I saw this Fekkai technician Hair Color Care kit and thought I would give it a try. At $20, I find this an amazing easy to use alternative to Keratin. My hair was soft and frizz free. I highly recommend the Fekkai for anyone looking for a lower cost alternative to helping control their color treated hair.</li>
            <li> i have used everything...and this stuff is the best..i have short hair cause its typical white girl hair nothing special...but i do get it colored and highlighted so i need color products and this makes my hair acutally  look like i have GOOD HAIR!! totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I tested out their products for colored hair and have been impressed. My hair feels so soft and it kind of has a glow to it now! I loved getting free samples to test from influenster and plan to possibly get some myself next time I run out of my current regime of hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see my comments here. https://www.facebook.com/SpaTravelGal/posts/864102583609505</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and actually had to Google how to use a hair mask (my first time). Now, I feel like I&#x27;m spoiled forever! Never has my hair felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had colored my hair probably about 2-3 weeks prior to using this sample and my hair had been feeling quite dry/brittle -- especially at the ends. I applied the mask and left on for 3-5 minutes before using the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I remember was the scent. Lovely! (You know how it smells when you&#x27;re in the salon, having your hair washed and you think how much you love the scent of the hair products? It&#x27;s like that.) Then, the lather. It seriously feels like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After styling, I was even more thrilled with the products. My hair felt amazing! Not a hint of the dry/brittle feeling I&#x27;d been experiencing. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to purchase and use these regularly due to the price point, but all three are definitely going on my holiday wish list!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of the shampoo and masque.  The product itself had a light herbal scent, but as it dried a strong floral perfume developed.  After about 6 hours I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore, but the next day it reappeared in the shower.  My skin also reacted with a slight itchy burning feeling. My hair was fine after the one-time use, but not much different than with my usual Kirkland brand shampoo.</li>
            <li> I received a sample package for review purposes from Influenster.  I really like the conditioner and masque - left my hair feeling soft, and very shiny.  Unfortunately, the sample sizes were not enough to form an opinion on whether it actually would help keep my color longer.  The shampoo was &#x27;ok&#x27; but didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special, especially considering the above average cost.</li>
            <li> I got to sample these through an influenster campaign. I really like the bright fruity scent. The formulas are a nice consistency and left my hair feeling soft and smelling really good. I definitely recommend these for your color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Have been a Fekkai fanatic since receiving samples of the shampoo and conditioner and intensive conditioner at a trade show.  Love Fekkai products.  Although pricey, they are well worth the money.  Might be costly if you have long hair but if you love your hair, this is the product line for you,</li>
            <li> Great starter kit if you want to try out these products - there is enough for about 1 week of hair washing, and a few deep conditioning treatments - also great for if you&#x27;re going on a trip and want to make sure your hair looks great (and your hair color stays)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this trial kit!  I cant wait to order the full size bottles!!  This is not only smells amazing but it does everything for my hair I hoped it was going to!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Given I have color treated hair, I&#x27;m always looking for products that will protect, enhance and repair my hair from all the damage. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Fekkai products and have used the conditioner before which I LOVE! It&#x27;s smells fantastic but not perfumey as I&#x27;m very sensitive to that. The conditioner leaves my hair tangle free but not too soft where it depletes the body. It&#x27;s my favorite conditioner and I always have a bottle in the shower. The mask is AMAZING - my hair just soaked it up and left my hair super shiny and NO Frizz which my hair always has - I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. The shampoo which is also great and I&#x27;ve since bought a big bottle, left my hair very clean but not stripped. I highly recommend and I actually think the price is good given how much you get of the mask especially!!</li>
            <li> I got this product from Influenster to try, and I loved it. I have a pixie cut and I also color it often and this product made my hair soft, and still maintained the luster from the coloring. I would recommend to anyone that has color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I was given a sample of these products and absolutely love them. The smell, condition of my hair and shine is perfect. They brought my hair back to life as a result of a previous shampoo not working for me.&amp;#34;</li>
