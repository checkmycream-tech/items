    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for the user who has a 6 months to a year of successful DE shaving!!!</li>
            <li>no cuts - best shave I ever got!</li>
            <li>It is just a great razor!!</li>
            <li>The razor was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>That said, this razor gives a superb shave, but one has to be patient when using it, and if you try to rush the process, you will nick yourself.</li>
            <li>This razor is awesome.</li>
            <li>Wonderful seller!</li>
            <li>Excellent shaving experience!  </li>
            <li>And though I have tried lots of others, this the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers have cautioned the slant head may not be the perfect &#x27;beginner&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li>Great razor!  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great razor that produces a great shave.  </li>
            <li>This is great razor.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>Great razor and great construction.</li>
            <li>It is very effective in removing beard hair but one needs to be experienced to use it, ie regards to angle and pressure.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Merkur 34C for 6 years and have absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>stay away from the once superior Merkur.  </li>
            <li>Fairly aggressive shaver, so you need some experience.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li>The razor itself is very handsome and built like a tank.</li>
            <li>No nicks, or cuts, just one smooth shave!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The comb feels strangely good on your skin as well because it has rivets in the top of he head as well.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight, I use the weight of the razor to shave.  </li>
            <li>I also own a Feather and an Edwin</li>
            <li>One of the best razors at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor, but there is a learning curve when first using a double-edged safety razor, and this slant bar razor is a more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; razor compared to others.  </li>
            <li>A great shave, always very comfortable (Astra Superior Platinums help with that too), and an overall well-made product</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve actually enjoyed shaving all this time and saved a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it really gave that great a shave until I shaved my head with it.</li>
            <li>I call this an instrument because it is more like a surgical tool rather than a razor.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I still love it and it remains one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>However...one must make sure the blade is inserted with the correct amount of exposure, i.e. even on all parts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously a more aggressive shave, but</li>
            <li>Could definitely be better</li>
            <li>but then you&#x27;d have to pay more.</li>
            <li>Love  it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Merkur slant for many years.</li>
            <li>It survives because there is nothing better at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many &amp;#34;snobbish&amp;#34; users will claim the virtues and excellence of Merkur products vs. the &amp;#34;sub par&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this thing and use it every day .</li>
            <li>It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.  </li>
            <li>Close and comfortable first time out of the box, with good control and no nicks.</li>
            <li>The one good thing about the high blade exposure is that you know where the blade is at all times because you can feel it on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li>but once you do you&#x27;ll have a closer shave and actually enjoy the process.</li>
            <li>and if you can get it cheap</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>: Close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>so I finally pulled the trigger and went with the razor that most resembled my beloved 34C.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m here to tell you that the Parkers that I own are FAR AND AWAY better quality.  </li>
            <li>a Jagger, both of which are far superior in fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I reserve it for monday morning use where I have a two day growth, and it is very effective especially with a Feather blade.  </li>
            <li>No matter what anyone tells you, a double edge safety razor will not give you as good or comfortable shave as a Mach III.&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li>Does a very nice job shaving my head even when I skip a few days and have more than just stubble.</li>
            <li>The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much.</li>
            <li>This razor was recommended as a good second razor, primarily because it should NOT BE YOUR FIRST.  </li>
            <li>The slant is more aggressive than a regular de and even more so in my case as I use Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>Very aggressive razor, however, only needed 1-2 passes to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as your first razor, but if you already have experience go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made with chrome plated cast metal, but shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Also the danger level makes it fun to use as well.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hesitate, it is worth the price</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend getting if you enjoy shaving with a DE safety razor, and are at all interested in this one</li>
            <li>It mowed right through on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re a novice safety razor user for only a few days -- after that, you&#x27;ll appreciate a razor that performs perfectly year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor will give you a close, smooth, comfortable shave - but it can cut you if you do not treat it like an open comb</li>
            <li>There is no need to apply very much pressure to the razor.</li>
            <li>My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target.</li>
            <li>When I first recieved this razor I thought it had been run over by the delivery truck, but then remembered the slant.  </li>
            <li>I now mostly use it for the first pass and with the grain (of facial hair).  </li>
            <li>Absolutely!  </li>
            <li>Use with feather blades and you have a VERY close shave!</li>
            <li>I have heard it dubbed such things as the \\&quot;Devil&#x27;s Razor\\&quot; because you can cut yourself easily with it.</li>
            <li>I am coming from a Merkur 34C, which I also love very much, but the 37C is in a whole other league in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The slicing action of the razor seems to work very well but one needs to make sure that you keep the pressure low and let the razor do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see why - the machines don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s slanted or straight.</li>
            <li>I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve perfected the straight edge).  </li>
            <li>I tried a Feather but that was much too aggressive for my face.</li>
            <li>it is a very aggressive razor and perhaps not one for a beginner.</li>
            <li>I own several Merkurs and several Parkers</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this razor for someone with familiar with de shaving looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>but I think I took a few too many layers of skin off my face with it.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin I need to get more done in less passes and this razor fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as I already have a Edwin Jagger de and was looking to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I recommend the Mantic59 videos on shaving if you are new to the \\&quot;art of shaving.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I decided to get it out and use it again armed with new  my new knowledge of the slant bar razor.</li>
            <li>This razor needs a very soft touch.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather &#x3D; suicide - relax, you&#x27;ll be fine :)  </li>
            <li>I believe you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find much better quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Merkur makes them just right, sharp enough but not scary.</li>
            <li>I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling.</li>
            <li>My trouble areas now shave smooth.</li>
            <li>design is about 100 years old.</li>
            <li>Key is first applying shaving oil, then shaving cream with a badger brush, and then using a feather-light touch with multiple passes--first with the grain, then across, and against the grain.  </li>
            <li>My first razor returning to wet, DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to agree with that statement, because really I think it has a much larger learning curve for any newbie DE shaver, but still does what it wa made to do and well.</li>
            <li>They are wonderfully consistent and sharp enough.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been shaving with a DE razor for several years.  I use this for my daily razor.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves several days growth off with ease.  With my normal DE, several days growth would be a painful experience due to pulling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I already have a Edwin Jagger de and was looking to try something new.  I think this is a great razor that produces a great shave.  The slant is more aggressive than a regular de and even more so in my case as I use Feather blades.  Overall I would recommend this razor for someone with familiar with de shaving looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> No matter what anyone tells you, a double edge safety razor will not give you as good or comfortable shave as a Mach III.&lt;br /&gt;this is the fifth double edge razor I have bought over a period of several months. None of them can match a Mach III.</li>
            <li> The only downside to these was hearing about them after a 20 year military career.  I could&#x27;ve actually enjoyed shaving all this time and saved a ton of money.  I use mine with the feather blades and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Takes a couple of weeks to get used to it but once you do you&#x27;ll have a closer shave and actually enjoy the process.</li>
            <li> This is great razor.  It is very effective in removing beard hair but one needs to be experienced to use it, ie regards to angle and pressure.  I have found that I get BBS shaves with it in fewer passes than with my regular EJDE89.  I reserve it for monday morning use where I have a two day growth, and it is very effective especially with a Feather blade.  The slicing action of the razor seems to work very well but one needs to make sure that you keep the pressure low and let the razor do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for the user who has a 6 months to a year of successful DE shaving!!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE - 06/03/2015. I also just tried a Feather blade with this razor. The first shave was great and very smooth, the second - not so much. I am thinking that the Feathers are a one-shave blade. But if you are afraid that this razor + Feather &#x3D; suicide - relax, you&#x27;ll be fine :)  I decided to give 4 stars, because it is more expensive and I don&#x27;t see why - the machines don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s slanted or straight. The configuration gets 5 stars, but the overall value - 4.  I started getting into straight edge shaving a couple of years ago, but because it takes a bit of time and care still fell back on cartridge razors when I was in a hurry or traveling. Then I switched to DE and never went back. My first razor was a Van Der Hagen from Target. It&#x27;s just fine and if you can get it cheap it&#x27;s great. It was the perfect compromise between convenience, portability and quality - much better shave than cartridge and much easier/faster than straight edge.  Then I needed something for thicker beard. I usually shave on Mondays and Saturdays, and recently had an even longer beard, so I tried the SLANT.  Wow! It mowed right through on the first pass. I only did additional passes afterwards to make it feel smooth to touch in all directions.  I don&#x27;t know if I have a great technique, but it felt almost no different than a regular DE. Mind you, I read the scare stories and was being careful, but about as careful as I am with a regular DE anyway. They do take a touch more attention than cartridge, but that&#x27;s about it.  FWIW I used Proraso pre shave cream, then Proraso shaving soap with Astra SP blades, finished with alum and then aftershave lotion. NO irritation, no bumps, no razor burn, no nicks, no cuts - best shave I ever got! (I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve perfected the straight edge).  You may be a &amp;#34;newbie&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; with double edge, but you are not a child. This may be the last razor you need. But I know it won&#x27;t stop you from having several, guys like to have a&amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; (or a fleet, as the case may be).</li>
            <li> I have heard it dubbed such things as the \\&quot;Devil&#x27;s Razor\\&quot; because you can cut yourself easily with it. I don&#x27;t think it deserves this bad reputation. It is just a great razor!! Wasn&#x27;t sure it really gave that great a shave until I shaved my head with it. No nicks, or cuts, just one smooth shave!! Would highly recommend getting if you enjoy shaving with a DE safety razor, and are at all interested in this one</li>
            <li> When I first recieved this razor I thought it had been run over by the delivery truck, but then remembered the slant.  The razor was in perfect condition.  After wet shaving now for almost three months with another razor, this one still is a challenge to use without cutting myself a few times.  I now mostly use it for the first pass and with the grain (of facial hair).  I think it might also not be bad for touch ups, but you must be super careful as it is an unforgiving razor.  This razor was recommended as a good second razor, primarily because it should NOT BE YOUR FIRST.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to agree with that statement, because really I think it has a much larger learning curve for any newbie DE shaver, but still does what it wa made to do and well.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, but there is a learning curve when first using a double-edged safety razor, and this slant bar razor is a more \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; razor compared to others.  Key is first applying shaving oil, then shaving cream with a badger brush, and then using a feather-light touch with multiple passes--first with the grain, then across, and against the grain.  I recommend the Mantic59 videos on shaving if you are new to the \\&quot;art of shaving.\\&quot;  That said, this razor gives a superb shave, but one has to be patient when using it, and if you try to rush the process, you will nick yourself.</li>
            <li> I call this an instrument because it is more like a surgical tool rather than a razor. I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 2 months now. The first few times I used were somewhat painful. I did not cut myself with it but I think I took a few too many layers of skin off my face with it. I took it out of my rotation and moved on with life. Recently though I started reading about it in blogs and watching some you tube videos about the dreaded slant bar. I decided to get it out and use it again armed with new  my new knowledge of the slant bar razor. Wow! What a difference. This razor is awesome. Very smooth shave and no irritation. If you are thinking about getting one of these, go for it! Just know that you need to watch a video or two and go to B&amp;B and get some pointers. This razor needs a very soft touch. Let the weight of the razor do the work. There is no need to apply very much pressure to the razor. I would also recommend you use a medium aggressive blade like Blue Birds (that&#x27;s just what I use) or one that you have. I tried a Feather but that was much too aggressive for my face. Slow and steady strokes with a minimum of pressure will get you a BBS shave. The razor itself is very handsome and built like a tank. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Close and comfortable first time out of the box, with good control and no nicks. I&#x27;ll add the standard disclaimers about hydrating well, going slow, and not making this your first-ever DE razor. (That&#x27;s what a Weishi is for.) Closest thing to a barbershop shave I&#x27;ll probably ever get.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Wonderful seller!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving experience!  Very aggressive razor, however, only needed 1-2 passes to get a great shave.  Net results, less time on the face &#x3D; minimal or no razor burn or irritation!!!</li>
            <li> A solid razor that performs well. Don&#x27;t be afraid, it doesn&#x27;t bite! My trouble areas now shave smooth. It&#x27;s my daily driver.</li>
            <li> Overly aggressive, as are all Merkur razors that I&#x27;ve used. Maybe it&#x27;s placebo, but I think the slant makes things hurt a little less.</li>
            <li> My first razor returning to wet, DE shaving. The reviews are correct...it is a very aggressive razor and perhaps not one for a beginner. I still love it and it remains one of my favorites. However...one must make sure the blade is inserted with the correct amount of exposure, i.e. even on all parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Merkur 34C for 6 years and have absolutely loved it. A great shave, always very comfortable (Astra Superior Platinums help with that too), and an overall well-made product so the thought of needing another razor didn&#x27;t cross my mind. I&#x27;d always been curious about the other types of razors so I finally pulled the trigger and went with the razor that most resembled my beloved 34C. Now that I have it, I&#x27;m upset with myself for not trying it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously a more aggressive shave, but with a thick beard like mine, this means a closer shave with few strokes. This also means a potentially uncomfortable shave for the untrained but I&#x27;ve found the 37C to be surprisingly easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is similar to other Merkur razors in this price range. Could definitely be better but then you&#x27;d have to pay more. I believe you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find much better quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, solid product.</li>
            <li> How have I not reviewed this yet?  This was my second razor and is now my go-to daily razor.  I thoroughly enjoy using it.  Having sensitive skin I need to get more done in less passes and this razor fits the bill.  Is it aggressive?  Absolutely!  But that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re going to cut your face to shreds, it just means the blade is very exposed.  The one good thing about the high blade exposure is that you know where the blade is at all times because you can feel it on your face.  Also the danger level makes it fun to use as well.  The comb feels strangely good on your skin as well because it has rivets in the top of he head as well.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as your first razor, but if you already have experience go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> Love  it.  Nice weight, I use the weight of the razor to shave.  Great razor and great construction.</li>
            <li> One of the best razors at a decent price. Use with feather blades and you have a VERY close shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Merkur slant for many years. And though I have tried lots of others, this the best. Solid, sturdy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have cautioned the slant head may not be the perfect &#x27;beginner&#x27; razor. Why not? You&#x27;re a novice safety razor user for only a few days -- after that, you&#x27;ll appreciate a razor that performs perfectly year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a slant head, I find it unnecessary to &#x27;reshave&#x27; my face up and down and crossways. This razor does the job in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is about 100 years old. It survives because there is nothing better at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it with Merkur blades. They are wonderfully consistent and sharp enough. Some competitor&#x27;s blades may actually be sharper, but is that what you want on your neck? Merkur makes them just right, sharp enough but not scary.</li>
            <li> This razor will give you a close, smooth, comfortable shave - but it can cut you if you do not treat it like an open comb razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Close, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Although not technically an open comb razor, it must be handled with the same caution as an open comb, or it will cut you just like a Fatip Grande or similar razors.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made with chrome plated cast metal, but shaves very well.</li>
            <li> For what is supposedly one of the finest manufacturers of double edged razors, I must say that I am disappointed in the Merkur Slant.  Grinding marks, machining marks, blistered chrome, and sharp/unchamfored edges.  Many &amp;#34;snobbish&amp;#34; users will claim the virtues and excellence of Merkur products vs. the &amp;#34;sub par&amp;#34; Parker brand.  I own several Merkurs and several Parkers and I&#x27;m here to tell you that the Parkers that I own are FAR AND AWAY better quality.  I also own a Feather and an Edwin a Jagger, both of which are far superior in fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read all the reviews for all three brands and only through purchasing examples of each have I come to my conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quality product, go with a Jagger or Parker... stay away from the once superior Merkur.  Their quality does NOT live up to their reputation.</li>
            <li> This is the safety razor that will replace your Gillette or Schick cartridge razor . It may look a little strange with the angled edge but it shaves as close as any Gillette  and it does not give razor burn  like other safety razors . I love this thing and use it every day . don&#x27;t hesitate, it is worth the price I guarantee it</li>
            <li> Fairly aggressive shaver, so you need some experience. Definitely not for beginners. Does a very nice job shaving my head even when I skip a few days and have more than just stubble.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s not for the inexperienced shaver though. 😊 It will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!! I have an extremely dense, bristly beard and the 37C undoubtedly provides me with the closest, least irritating shave I have ever had.  I am coming from a Merkur 34C, which I also love very much, but the 37C is in a whole other league in my opinion.  I use with a Feather blade and have almost no irritation whatsoever.  Don&#x27;t believe the hype about this razor being a &amp;#34;widow maker&amp;#34;.  It does take a time or two of using it to get used to it, but after that you&#x27;ll be shaving as if you&#x27;ve always used it.  Great razor!  My daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; now.</li>
