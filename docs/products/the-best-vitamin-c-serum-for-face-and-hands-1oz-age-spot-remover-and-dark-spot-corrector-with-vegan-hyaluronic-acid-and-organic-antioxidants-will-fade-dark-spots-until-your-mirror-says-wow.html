            <li>Could not tell any difference, so I switched to another kind.</li>
            <li>I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I truly believe and in my honest opinion</li>
            <li>I liked the product just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li>this is a really nice vit c serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look nice and glows.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>and I prefer it to hydroquinone, which is another popular pigmentation fading product.  </li>
            <li>This was a nice product.</li>
            <li>I like the way the product goes on, it absorbs very easily and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super attractive).</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt and looked more amazing.</li>
            <li>product appears to be more effective than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this has so many 5 star reviews, but I can only tell you my experience, and it is as effective as putting water on your face and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>Did not cause any breakouts, but did make skin more oily.</li>
            <li>My face seems more radiant...</li>
            <li>(Please note that this product was sent to me for Free in exchange for an honest review.)  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>(as this serum can make your skin more susceptible to sunburn—keep that in mind).</li>
            <li>and i love my skin already</li>
            <li>Love love love this serum.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>none of these products work I have used so many of them and never saw any results, it may soften your skin but it WILL NOT REMOVE BROWN SPOTS, FRECKLES ETC.  </li>
            <li>Also your skin will feel better than it ever has.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, but not the results it promised.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid, combined with the Vitamin C and MSM work together in this serum making the results so much better than any of these ingredients alone.</li>
            <li>I love it; what it difference it made to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I got to be sporting healthy looking feet to.</li>
            <li>i would repurchase this for sure</li>
            <li>I am used  my face more radiant</li>
            <li>This product does nothing , more than 30 days using it.</li>
            <li>I love that it uses Vitamins C &amp; E</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly satisfied with how well the product works and the affordable price.the product works and the affordable price.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum is my favorite out of all the serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works better than Lancome.  </li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>This product worked better than MANY others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this serum for my face.</li>
            <li>I found if I put it in my hands and then put it on my face, it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent combination that when mixed together gives users healthier more youthful appearance by helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with continued use to see fine lines diminish :)</li>
            <li>Clarigenics Vitamic C Serum 20% is &amp;#34;just what the doctor ordered.&amp;#34; I love the way it goes on, silky and smooth without being sticky.</li>
            <li>did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Easy to use too.</li>
            <li>The bottle has glass dropper which makes application easy.</li>
            <li>Received this product very quickly.</li>
            <li>Loved this serum, it felt great going on, rubbed in smooth other than taking a little while was a perfect product!</li>
            <li>It was like watching a baby fall in love with its mother for the first time!</li>
            <li>Caution this is the most powerful 20% acid on the market.</li>
            <li>It has minimized the scarring on my face as well as pimples and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it on my hands only as the skin is tougher there than on my face and hope for great results.</li>
            <li>It is important that you follow directions for use closely for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I love fresh scents.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this on someone who needs a fresh face. :)</li>
            <li>Since it is something used on the hands and face, you want something that is going to have no scent or a light scent that is not going to overtake your senses.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my make up right over this without it smudging or changing the way my make up is applied.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Vitamin C Serum if you are dealing with any kind of hyperpigmentation issues, it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle</li>
            <li>I was so excited it have a dropper.</li>
            <li>That is what has impressed me over this past month.</li>
            <li>works well with my other skincare products and absorbs into the skin very quickly which is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li>Apply this after a shower, with a clean face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered this serum and others in the same vein, because my face just looks so amazing.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and has a nice soft feeling after absorbed.</li>
            <li>I has really given me a lovely glow</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Cannot review any long term results as have only used short time but happy with product and ingredients impressive also.</li>
            <li>It has really helped me feel a lot better about my skin.</li>
            <li>This way you get the full effect of the Vitamin C with nothing in between it and your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an ideal choice for those with different skin types whether oily, sensitive, acne prone, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While your results may not be exactly like mine, I believe you will enjoy using this serum as I</li>
            <li>They are smooth and they really have improved alot!</li>
            <li>I love my new vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I used for about two months did not work as promise, I actually have more brown spots than before, I will not recommended this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Title of product is exact!</li>
            <li>Not all gone but definitely faded which is great as dark spots were very visible on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Very thick and fresh-smelling citrus serum that has a superb effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li>They say that most of the ingredients are organic or natural.  </li>
            <li>I think lavander would be such a nice scent to put into the serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will leave your skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated and give you a younger-looking appearance with continued use.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>This is great for extreme temperatures like the whole countrt has been.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, smells nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth, and tight.</li>
            <li>This serum is supposed to fight age spots and minimize pores, which is what we all want right?</li>
            <li>so I’ve been going easy with my new Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>Also, because my skin has been perpetually dry, I noticed that I have been developing fine lines on the sides of my nose - which bugged me more than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>The versatility ranges from tackling with age spots, dry patchy skin, enlarged pores, sun damage, and much more!</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my shin quickly and has kept it very moisturized.</li>
            <li>The medicine dropper makes it easy to put on just the right amount and not waste any.</li>
            <li>There is a dramatic change in my appearance thanks to this very impressive Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>Visible improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>and I did see them going within first week</li>
            <li>first one was yellow-ish liquid and smells a bit of medicine like.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have the dry patches around my eye area that I have been constantly plagued with but most importantly, it has been working miracles on the fine lines that I have started to develop on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer:I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>but you do have to use it consistently every day in order to see the results.</li>
            <li>I get an exact amount by using the dropper in the bottle.</li>
            <li>product packaging is simple and crudem,looked cheap and not be sealed!</li>
            <li>I like to apply this before wearing make up and following with my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s inevitable that I will get more.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>There is a slight rose scent that disappears as the serum is absorbed.</li>
            <li>It’s great for winter months when the air is dry and also because we are not outside taking in so much sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve took note of my breaking out with acne far less since use and love that my skin seems to have a really healthy glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin to be more radiant and the darkness under my eyes fade away quite a bit!</li>
            <li>Used whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like that the bottle comes with a \\&quot;eye dropper\\&quot;</li>
            <li>nothing really to rave home about</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels on my skin , just waiting for results...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn’t think it was doing much.  </li>
            <li>received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t really see any result...</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much for the face and hands.</li>
            <li>But that fades very quicky.</li>
            <li>and I used the whole bottle as recommended.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I apply to my skin</li>
            <li>There really isnt a smell to the serum.</li>
            <li>It would help you fall asleep at night and make you also feel very relaxed at night.</li>
            <li>Of course most Hyaluronic Acid serums contain a bit of Vitamin C, but not much.  </li>
            <li>I was sent this Vitamin C Serum by Clarigenics to review for my blog, GlamRiver and it has really helped with my on-going battle with Melasma and that makes me really happy!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum as part of my a.m. skincare routine and applying it on my face, around my eyes, neck, decollete and shoulders</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very lightweight formula</li>
            <li>has really helped fade the lingering Melasma on my face, neck and decollete.  </li>
            <li>I am a real client.  </li>
            <li>It really helps get the Vitamin C in my skin and helps remove age spots.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I wanted to clear some spots on my face and this is helping, its not instant more gradual, but with time I&#x27;m on them being gone.</li>
            <li>and I really like using it both without makeup all on its own (meaning I don’t need to buy or put other products on top of it which saves money) and under makeup (where it creates a nice, even, smooth base.)  </li>
            <li>so I use any new product &#x27;gently&#x27; at first</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest using just a small amount because you honestly don&#x27;t need a lot of serum in order to do your face, neck and hands.    </li>
            <li>The full overall appearance of my face has improved.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this serum ensures that my skin is less problematic and gets hydrated.</li>
            <li>but this works fast to clean up the skin of dry patches</li>
            <li>while the texture of this product is decent, not oily or anything, the smell of it is off putting.</li>
            <li>give this product and brand two thumbs up and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Then not using it for a few weeks, I found my face was breaking out more and just didn’t feel or look good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin lately.</li>
            <li>This will make your skin feel more firm and give it that shine and glow that we all want.  </li>
            <li>Plus, with a Vitamin C Serum you get all the other added benefits like, reduced fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration and smoother</li>
            <li>After only using it for a week I could tell the fine lines around my face cheeks and eyes are already starting to go away.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>After using serums like this one with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Antioxidants for nearly a year, it appears as if much of the damage is reversed.</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li>It certainly did exactly what it was supposed to do and removed some bad spots whilst minimizing my pores so that my skin just felt amazing!</li>
            <li>Now, I just got the third bottle, and this is like the first one I got, yellow-ish with medicine smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a considerable difference in their appearance since using this serum!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if this removed dark spot because I don&#x27;t have any on my hands but the over all health of my hands are as smooth as my face.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel smooth, but I see no difference in dark spots in the skin lighter.  </li>
            <li>And the simple application just made it an all the way positive experience for me.</li>
            <li>Significantly reduced my dark marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to use a product that is non evasive to get rid of small lines around their face eyes neck and mouth.</li>
            <li>The very moment I applied it to my newly washed and deep cleaned pores, my face drank it in like it was water!</li>
            <li>Whereas I&#x27;m sure the 20% vitamin C serum is good for your skin, after using just shy of the entire bottle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved any of the dark blemishes (age spots, sun spots --</li>
            <li>The fine lines are disappearing everyday.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it.</li>
            <li>I started using this serum to “feed” my skin cells some vital vitamin c but also to get the layers to turn over faster.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see all 5 stars..</li>
            <li>It states that the product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li>This  made in the USA product is complied of 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients and is never tested on</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I do not waste the product and I can use it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this serum I recognize and already use many alone such as witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil to name just a few.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of Vitamin C and liked them all, and this one did not let me down!  </li>
            <li>company stand behind their product and offers a worry free full 365 day money back guarantee no questions asked!</li>
            <li>I would give you a higher rating, combined with other products this one is making a difference in removing my dark spot, I&#x27;m very consistent used it every day.</li>
            <li>and it is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, especially considering the reviews; however, it dried out my skin and that says a lot considering my skin is oily.  </li>
            <li>if you want to see change and improvement to your skin you have to keep using the serum for at least 3 to 4 months and be consistent in order to see a real change or improvement to your skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe my face is just ultra sensitive, but this serum actually irritated my face...</li>
            <li>Only been using for a week, but it has made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>67 year old female...</li>
            <li>complaint was that the squirter top made it hard to aim it in the right spot.</li>
            <li>You can usually see it plain as day but since using the serum I honestly have to be so close to the mirror</li>
            <li>well so there is no oil or residue on your face, then apply the Vitamin C serum, rub it in very well and then use moisturizures or other creams.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about serums in general since I have oily skin, but to my surprise I went through the whole day with just a little shine.  </li>
            <li>Use half of a dropperful for the whole face or hands.</li>
            <li>Let the Vitamin C Serum dry completely, then apply your regular make up routine.</li>
            <li>so you can take little or as much serum</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I truly believe and in my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I liked the product just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> this is a really nice vit c serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look nice and glows.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> and I prefer it to hydroquinone, which is another popular pigmentation fading product.  </li>
            <li> This was a nice product.</li>
            <li> I like the way the product goes on, it absorbs very easily and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super attractive).</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt and looked more amazing.</li>
            <li> product appears to be more effective than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this has so many 5 star reviews, but I can only tell you my experience, and it is as effective as putting water on your face and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> Did not cause any breakouts, but did make skin more oily.</li>
            <li> My face seems more radiant...</li>
            <li> (Please note that this product was sent to me for Free in exchange for an honest review.)  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> (as this serum can make your skin more susceptible to sunburn—keep that in mind).</li>
            <li> and i love my skin already</li>
            <li> Love love love this serum.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> none of these products work I have used so many of them and never saw any results, it may soften your skin but it WILL NOT REMOVE BROWN SPOTS, FRECKLES ETC.  </li>
            <li> Also your skin will feel better than it ever has.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, but not the results it promised.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid, combined with the Vitamin C and MSM work together in this serum making the results so much better than any of these ingredients alone.</li>
            <li> I love it; what it difference it made to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I got to be sporting healthy looking feet to.</li>
            <li> i would repurchase this for sure</li>
            <li> I am used  my face more radiant</li>
            <li> This product does nothing , more than 30 days using it.</li>
            <li> I love that it uses Vitamins C &amp; E</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly satisfied with how well the product works and the affordable price.the product works and the affordable price.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is my favorite out of all the serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works better than Lancome.  </li>
            <li> I love that is</li>
            <li> This product worked better than MANY others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this serum for my face.</li>
            <li> I found if I put it in my hands and then put it on my face, it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent combination that when mixed together gives users healthier more youthful appearance by helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with continued use to see fine lines diminish :)</li>
            <li> Clarigenics Vitamic C Serum 20% is &amp;#34;just what the doctor ordered.&amp;#34; I love the way it goes on, silky and smooth without being sticky.</li>
            <li> did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> The bottle has glass dropper which makes application easy.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly.</li>
            <li> Loved this serum, it felt great going on, rubbed in smooth other than taking a little while was a perfect product!</li>
            <li> It was like watching a baby fall in love with its mother for the first time!</li>
            <li> Caution this is the most powerful 20% acid on the market.</li>
            <li> It has minimized the scarring on my face as well as pimples and leaves my face smooth.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it on my hands only as the skin is tougher there than on my face and hope for great results.</li>
            <li> It is important that you follow directions for use closely for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I love fresh scents.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this on someone who needs a fresh face. :)</li>
            <li> Since it is something used on the hands and face, you want something that is going to have no scent or a light scent that is not going to overtake your senses.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply my make up right over this without it smudging or changing the way my make up is applied.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Vitamin C Serum if you are dealing with any kind of hyperpigmentation issues, it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle</li>
            <li> I was so excited it have a dropper.</li>
            <li> That is what has impressed me over this past month.</li>
            <li> works well with my other skincare products and absorbs into the skin very quickly which is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> Apply this after a shower, with a clean face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered this serum and others in the same vein, because my face just looks so amazing.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and has a nice soft feeling after absorbed.</li>
            <li> I has really given me a lovely glow</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Cannot review any long term results as have only used short time but happy with product and ingredients impressive also.</li>
            <li> It has really helped me feel a lot better about my skin.</li>
            <li> This way you get the full effect of the Vitamin C with nothing in between it and your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also an ideal choice for those with different skin types whether oily, sensitive, acne prone, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While your results may not be exactly like mine, I believe you will enjoy using this serum as I</li>
            <li> They are smooth and they really have improved alot!</li>
            <li> I love my new vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I used for about two months did not work as promise, I actually have more brown spots than before, I will not recommended this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Title of product is exact!</li>
            <li> Not all gone but definitely faded which is great as dark spots were very visible on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Very thick and fresh-smelling citrus serum that has a superb effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li> They say that most of the ingredients are organic or natural.  </li>
            <li> I think lavander would be such a nice scent to put into the serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will leave your skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated and give you a younger-looking appearance with continued use.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> This is great for extreme temperatures like the whole countrt has been.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, smells nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth, and tight.</li>
            <li> This serum is supposed to fight age spots and minimize pores, which is what we all want right?</li>
            <li> so I’ve been going easy with my new Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Also, because my skin has been perpetually dry, I noticed that I have been developing fine lines on the sides of my nose - which bugged me more than I care to admit.</li>
            <li> The versatility ranges from tackling with age spots, dry patchy skin, enlarged pores, sun damage, and much more!</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my shin quickly and has kept it very moisturized.</li>
            <li> The medicine dropper makes it easy to put on just the right amount and not waste any.</li>
            <li> There is a dramatic change in my appearance thanks to this very impressive Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Visible improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> and I did see them going within first week</li>
            <li> first one was yellow-ish liquid and smells a bit of medicine like.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have the dry patches around my eye area that I have been constantly plagued with but most importantly, it has been working miracles on the fine lines that I have started to develop on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer:I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> but you do have to use it consistently every day in order to see the results.</li>
            <li> I get an exact amount by using the dropper in the bottle.</li>
            <li> product packaging is simple and crudem,looked cheap and not be sealed!</li>
            <li> I like to apply this before wearing make up and following with my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s inevitable that I will get more.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> There is a slight rose scent that disappears as the serum is absorbed.</li>
            <li> It’s great for winter months when the air is dry and also because we are not outside taking in so much sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve took note of my breaking out with acne far less since use and love that my skin seems to have a really healthy glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin to be more radiant and the darkness under my eyes fade away quite a bit!</li>
            <li> Used whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like that the bottle comes with a \\&quot;eye dropper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> nothing really to rave home about</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my skin , just waiting for results...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn’t think it was doing much.  </li>
            <li> received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t really see any result...</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for the face and hands.</li>
            <li> But that fades very quicky.</li>
            <li> and I used the whole bottle as recommended.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I apply to my skin</li>
            <li> There really isnt a smell to the serum.</li>
            <li> It would help you fall asleep at night and make you also feel very relaxed at night.</li>
            <li> Of course most Hyaluronic Acid serums contain a bit of Vitamin C, but not much.  </li>
            <li> I was sent this Vitamin C Serum by Clarigenics to review for my blog, GlamRiver and it has really helped with my on-going battle with Melasma and that makes me really happy!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum as part of my a.m. skincare routine and applying it on my face, around my eyes, neck, decollete and shoulders</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very lightweight formula</li>
            <li> has really helped fade the lingering Melasma on my face, neck and decollete.  </li>
            <li> I am a real client.  </li>
            <li> It really helps get the Vitamin C in my skin and helps remove age spots.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I wanted to clear some spots on my face and this is helping, its not instant more gradual, but with time I&#x27;m on them being gone.</li>
            <li> and I really like using it both without makeup all on its own (meaning I don’t need to buy or put other products on top of it which saves money) and under makeup (where it creates a nice, even, smooth base.)  </li>
            <li> so I use any new product &#x27;gently&#x27; at first</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> but I would suggest using just a small amount because you honestly don&#x27;t need a lot of serum in order to do your face, neck and hands.    </li>
            <li> The full overall appearance of my face has improved.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this serum ensures that my skin is less problematic and gets hydrated.</li>
            <li> but this works fast to clean up the skin of dry patches</li>
            <li> while the texture of this product is decent, not oily or anything, the smell of it is off putting.</li>
            <li> give this product and brand two thumbs up and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Then not using it for a few weeks, I found my face was breaking out more and just didn’t feel or look good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin lately.</li>
            <li> This will make your skin feel more firm and give it that shine and glow that we all want.  </li>
            <li> Plus, with a Vitamin C Serum you get all the other added benefits like, reduced fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration and smoother</li>
            <li> After only using it for a week I could tell the fine lines around my face cheeks and eyes are already starting to go away.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> After using serums like this one with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Antioxidants for nearly a year, it appears as if much of the damage is reversed.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li> It certainly did exactly what it was supposed to do and removed some bad spots whilst minimizing my pores so that my skin just felt amazing!</li>
            <li> Now, I just got the third bottle, and this is like the first one I got, yellow-ish with medicine smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a considerable difference in their appearance since using this serum!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this removed dark spot because I don&#x27;t have any on my hands but the over all health of my hands are as smooth as my face.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel smooth, but I see no difference in dark spots in the skin lighter.  </li>
            <li> And the simple application just made it an all the way positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> Significantly reduced my dark marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to use a product that is non evasive to get rid of small lines around their face eyes neck and mouth.</li>
            <li> The very moment I applied it to my newly washed and deep cleaned pores, my face drank it in like it was water!</li>
            <li> Whereas I&#x27;m sure the 20% vitamin C serum is good for your skin, after using just shy of the entire bottle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved any of the dark blemishes (age spots, sun spots --</li>
            <li> The fine lines are disappearing everyday.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum to “feed” my skin cells some vital vitamin c but also to get the layers to turn over faster.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see all 5 stars..</li>
            <li> It states that the product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li> This  made in the USA product is complied of 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients and is never tested on</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I do not waste the product and I can use it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this serum I recognize and already use many alone such as witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil to name just a few.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Vitamin C and liked them all, and this one did not let me down!  </li>
            <li> company stand behind their product and offers a worry free full 365 day money back guarantee no questions asked!</li>
            <li> I would give you a higher rating, combined with other products this one is making a difference in removing my dark spot, I&#x27;m very consistent used it every day.</li>
            <li> and it is getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, especially considering the reviews; however, it dried out my skin and that says a lot considering my skin is oily.  </li>
            <li> if you want to see change and improvement to your skin you have to keep using the serum for at least 3 to 4 months and be consistent in order to see a real change or improvement to your skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe my face is just ultra sensitive, but this serum actually irritated my face...</li>
            <li> Only been using for a week, but it has made my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> 67 year old female...</li>
            <li> complaint was that the squirter top made it hard to aim it in the right spot.</li>
            <li> You can usually see it plain as day but since using the serum I honestly have to be so close to the mirror</li>
            <li> well so there is no oil or residue on your face, then apply the Vitamin C serum, rub it in very well and then use moisturizures or other creams.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about serums in general since I have oily skin, but to my surprise I went through the whole day with just a little shine.  </li>
            <li> Use half of a dropperful for the whole face or hands.</li>
            <li> Let the Vitamin C Serum dry completely, then apply your regular make up routine.</li>
            <li> so you can take little or as much serum</li>
            <li> I usually am scared of using new products on my skin since it is sensitive</li>
            <li> At first i was leery because this seems a little thick for the fast</li>
            <li> I love that it helps my skin to feel so nice, stopping that awful tight dryness that happens in this winter season.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients also work to firm up skin, smoothing tiny wrinkles and lines.</li>
            <li> Pores appear smaller, my skin is considerably softer and shows less lines - a plus for us 65+ ladies!  </li>
            <li> Smells like beef jerky, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing the long term effects.</li>
            <li> so anything with parabens, phthlates, or any other toxins is a big no-no.</li>
            <li> It has been awfully dry though</li>
            <li> When I first got this product for some reason I thought it was going to smell like oranges, probably because I associate Vitamin C with Oranges but sadly this product does not smell like oranges, actually it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff had absolutely ZERO effect on my skin, and did nothing to even slightly lighten the one or two small dark spots on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this serum if you have acne scars or just dull, dry skin that is missing it</li>
            <li> I must unfortunately report back that it really did not do anything.  </li>
            <li> these last few applications.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this product until the bottle was empty on brown spots caused by sun damage.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived as expected and I have been using it on my face for two months.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops a day to rub on your face -</li>
            <li> Received in pale yellow condition.</li>
            <li> There is a slight exfoliant effect which removes dry skin upon cleansing the face or body.</li>
            <li> like that a little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a small red vein on the side of my nose (just like a spider vain you have on your legs</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> This is not like other Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li> and I have had absolutely no problem with this!  </li>
            <li> then that I have noticed 1 other small change like the small but less dark age spots on my face are slowly fading, slowly but surely,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I&#x27;m sure putting vitamin C on your face everyday isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> The second bottle was clear, no smell to it, I was wondering if that was .... a fake one?</li>
            <li> Does nothing for dark spots - been using for over 30 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 weeks now and have seen improvement in dark age spots fading in my temporal area.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> this point, I would say the dark spots have faded about 50 percent.</li>
            <li> I know vitamin c serum has antioxidants that help fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> Aside from tackling my dark eye circles and under the eye puffiness, this can be used on the face, neck, body, and hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a readhead, so I have sun damage, dark spots, wrinkles, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen just a slight lightening of sun spots.  </li>
            <li> this product help a little with the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Good-makes my face a little dry,though.</li>
            <li> just a little powder and I&#x27;m off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt it have a little floral smell.</li>
            <li> This product just dried out my face.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my vitamin C serum a few months ago I didn’t think twice about it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> My dog follows me around for a few minutes after I put it on because for some reason it smells like beef jerky.</li>
            <li> Playing in the sun during my childhood and teens made for a few spots that were there too soon for comfort.</li>
            <li> I have several age spots on my hands and really hated how they make me look so much older.</li>
            <li> Saw results after a few days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad as I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as thick as I usually expect a serum to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the product works the scent is hard to get passed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works on my dark spots!!!</li>
            <li> This product is dangerous and should be labeled as such.</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not for everyone else, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you have Melasma like I do then you know it&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of completely since it&#x27;s triggered by the sun and even though I wear sunscreen everyday I am not reapplying it throughout the day</li>
            <li> The smell is not pleasant after it has been opened for a while.  </li>
            <li> but I always end up so frustrated because the dry patches in my skin never goes away.</li>
            <li> I put on twice a day, thin layer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry hate writing bad reviews but this product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve seen no difference at all.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not loaded with a bunch of artificial fragrance, I will never understand why cosmetic companies feel the need to put fragrance in everything, I don&#x27;t want that on my skin!</li>
            <li> Absorbs well no greasy feel or unpleasant odor hydrates skin well.</li>
            <li> Bad item</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed ...</li>
            <li> I have brown sun spots on my face that I hate!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> from what i can tell it is lightening up the age spots</li>
            <li> Used whole bottle. Could not tell any difference, so I switched to another kind. I do think it is something that is necessary, so I went with 22 percent. Did not cause any breakouts, but did make skin more oily.</li>
            <li> gave this as a gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I feel younger already . Great product . Makes my skin feel healthier .</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product works the scent is hard to get passed.  It reminds me of the house later in the afternoon after frying bacon for breakfast.  If the scent could be changed then it would be amazing!</li>
            <li> Caution this is the most powerful 20% acid on the market. There are no cautions labels on this product but beware that one application will remove four layers of skin. You will continue to peel for two days before scabbing begins. I had this product tested and the acid content is 90% not 20%. This product is dangerous and should be labeled as such. The good side is that it will remove age spots wrinkles and smoothen your skin.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this product. My face seems more radiant...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical.spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
            <li> (Please note that this product was sent to me for Free in exchange for an honest review.)  When I first got this product for some reason I thought it was going to smell like oranges, probably because I associate Vitamin C with Oranges but sadly this product does not smell like oranges, actually it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all. I really like that the bottle comes with a \\&quot;eye dropper\\&quot; so you can take little or as much serum you want but I would suggest using just a small amount because you honestly don&#x27;t need a lot of serum in order to do your face, neck and hands.    After only using this product for about a month, I have noticed 1 big change. I have a small red vein on the side of my nose (just like a spider vain you have on your legs but mine is on my face and yeah it&#x27;s super attractive). You can usually see it plain as day but since using the serum I honestly have to be so close to the mirror that I&#x27;m literally squishing my face against it in order to find the vein, so I guess the serum is working!? Other then that I have noticed 1 other small change like the small but less dark age spots on my face are slowly fading, slowly but surely, nothing really to rave home about but I thought I would mention it. I realized that I have only had this product for about a month and I truly believe and in my honest opinion if you want to see change and improvement to your skin you have to keep using the serum for at least 3 to 4 months and be consistent in order to see a real change or improvement to your skin.</li>
            <li> Works great! Saw results after a few days!</li>
            <li> Save your money.  This product does not work.  At least not for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels on my skin , just waiting for results... I&#x27;ll keep you posted 😁</li>
            <li> Very nice quality Vitamin C Serum. Works very well. I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it. Visible improvement after the first use. Very nice!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> using for 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen just a slight lightening of sun spots.  will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> So my lovely face has been doing great. Lol. I’ve been sticking to my candida cleanse diet and it is getting back to normal. It has been awfully dry though so I’ve been going easy with my new Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. I started using this serum to “feed” my skin cells some vital vitamin c but also to get the layers to turn over faster. I has really given me a lovely glow these last few applications.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum if you have acne scars or just dull, dry skin that is missing it’s glow. It’s great for winter months when the air is dry and also because we are not outside taking in so much sun (as this serum can make your skin more susceptible to sunburn—keep that in mind).</li>
            <li> Does nothing for dark spots - been using for over 30 days. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, especially considering the reviews; however, it dried out my skin and that says a lot considering my skin is oily.  It&#x27;s too bad as I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> It appears to be working.</li>
            <li> I have only use this product for just a week and i love my skin already</li>
            <li> This product just dried out my face. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my complexion which is why I had purchased it. I would not purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it definitely works. It has minimized the scarring on my face as well as pimples and leaves my face smooth. I love it ! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I started to see pores on my face recently so wanted to give it a try and I did see them going within first week and it does change your color to brownish when applied so try it in the evenings.</li>
            <li> Love love love this serum. Age spots are vanishing and wrinkles are too!  So glad I tried this product. Have reordered. Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> none of these products work I have used so many of them and never saw any results, it may soften your skin but it WILL NOT REMOVE BROWN SPOTS, FRECKLES ETC.  try using lemon juice twice a day takes a couple months but that is what worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have purchased (3) bottles so for.&lt;br /&gt;The first one was yellow-ish liquid and smells a bit of medicine like.  The second bottle was clear, no smell to it, I was wondering if that was .... a fake one? but, I used it all anyway.  Now, I just got the third bottle, and this is like the first one I got, yellow-ish with medicine smell.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I see no difference on my age spots at all, but my daughter likes it, and she said it is working for her acne scars.</li>
            <li> Good-makes my face a little dry,though.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all over several weeks use for &#x27;brown &#x27; spots on my hands and lower arms; no lightening up at all.</li>
            <li> You will see your age spots and lines start to go away. Also your skin will feel better than it ever has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this serum ensures that my skin is less problematic and gets hydrated. Before I learned about this product, I only use moisturizers and creams but I always end up so frustrated because the dry patches in my skin never goes away. Also, because my skin has been perpetually dry, I noticed that I have been developing fine lines on the sides of my nose - which bugged me more than I care to admit. I am happy to share with all of you that since using this serum under my morning moisturizer in the morning and under my repair cream at night, my skin has been looking hydrated! I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have the dry patches around my eye area that I have been constantly plagued with but most importantly, it has been working miracles on the fine lines that I have started to develop on the sides of my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Whereas I&#x27;m sure the 20% vitamin C serum is good for your skin, after using just shy of the entire bottle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved any of the dark blemishes (age spots, sun spots -- whatever) that I had been applying it to twice a day for almost 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I&#x27;m sure putting vitamin C on your face everyday isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I actually have seen no difference since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I can seen a big difference but I am also drinking the Amino Collagen C in addition to this.  Seems to be getting good results.  I have been doing vitamin c serum for about 5 wks and the amino collagen drink for 8.</li>
            <li> Received in pale yellow condition. I was surprised to see all 5 stars.. which is y i switched from oz. now I am throwing this as i feel like it might damage my skin..and going back to oz naturals.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my vitamin C serum a few months ago I didn’t think twice about it. I didn’t think it was doing much.  Then not using it for a few weeks, I found my face was breaking out more and just didn’t feel or look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum and when it came, I started using it the next day.  I was concerned about serums in general since I have oily skin, but to my surprise I went through the whole day with just a little shine.  My face was clearing up again and I really like using it both without makeup all on its own (meaning I don’t need to buy or put other products on top of it which saves money) and under makeup (where it creates a nice, even, smooth base.)  They say that most of the ingredients are organic or natural.  All seem to be so that makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product and brand two thumbs up and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked the product just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell this product help a little with the dark circles under my eyes but I stop using because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, no results.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. This stuff had absolutely ZERO effect on my skin, and did nothing to even slightly lighten the one or two small dark spots on my cheek.  I have no idea how this has so many 5 star reviews, but I can only tell you my experience, and it is as effective as putting water on your face and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not the results it promised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Bad item</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 months and I have noticed a difference in my age spots.  They are lighter in color but you do have to use it consistently every day in order to see the results.</li>
            <li> i just didn&#x27;t see that it did any good...so why???</li>
            <li> Smells like beef jerky, but lasts a long time. I have used for about three weeks and see no difference, but i will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I used this product until the bottle was empty on brown spots caused by sun damage.  There was no change whatsoever in the spots.  It may benefit you but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I would give you a higher rating, combined with other products this one is making a difference in removing my dark spot, I&#x27;m very consistent used it every day.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> As for this product I have not seen any great improvement.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Organic Herbal Infustion, Organic Aloe, Vitamin C, MSM, Botanic Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Amino Acid, Carbomer, Organic Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product:The product comes in an amber glass bottle with eyedropper and is made in the USA. It states that the product is 98% Natural and 72% Organic. The amber glass bottle protects against oxidation of the serum by environmental factors. Use half of a dropperful for the whole face or hands. This serum is a soothing liquid. Immediately after application the skin feels cooled and smoothed. I love that it helps my skin to feel so nice, stopping that awful tight dryness that happens in this winter season. There is a slight rose scent that disappears as the serum is absorbed. The serum absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft and smooth. I used this daily to keep my skin hydrated. Hyaluronic acid, combined with the Vitamin C and MSM work together in this serum making the results so much better than any of these ingredients alone. There is a slight exfoliant effect which removes dry skin upon cleansing the face or body. The natural ingredients also work to firm up skin, smoothing tiny wrinkles and lines. Because it absorbs so well, it can be worn under sunscreen and makeup without any smearing or oiliness. It freshens the face, giving it a younger appearance. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I believe you will enjoy using this serum as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Clarigenics Vitamic C Serum 20% is &amp;#34;just what the doctor ordered.&amp;#34; I love the way it goes on, silky and smooth without being sticky. It also has a nice smell and makes your skin feel great. I can see a lot of difference in my skin from using this product and I think you will too.</li>
            <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought this to lighten dark spots.  It does work.  This is not a &#x27;work overnight, intermittent use&#x27; product.  I put on twice a day, thin layer.  I&#x27;ve been using a couple of months and notice the darkness has faded.  Not all gone but definitely faded which is great as dark spots were very visible on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Claims to be the best and guess what? IT IS! Easy to use too. I get an exact amount by using the dropper in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Maybe my face is just ultra sensitive, but this serum actually irritated my face...I broke out in hives after using it just 2 times. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not for everyone else, just not for me. I will continue to use it on my hands only as the skin is tougher there than on my face and hope for great results.</li>
            <li> I have brown sun spots on my face that I hate!!  Ater  3 weeks i did see a differencwe, they are not gone.... but they definatly did lighten up!</li>
            <li> I wanted to clear some spots on my face and this is helping, its not instant more gradual, but with time I&#x27;m on them being gone. Iwould recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it; what it difference it made to my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works on my dark spots!!! I have a couple of dark spots on my face and I have noticed a considerable difference in their appearance since using this serum! I am so excited to find something that works!!!</li>
            <li> good for the forehead  and undereye that&#x27;s the only place I put it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know... Been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t really see any result...</li>
            <li> Not as immediate results as you would think</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for the face and hands.</li>
            <li> Hope it delivers, used it only once!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt and looked more amazing. My dog follows me around for a few minutes after I put it on because for some reason it smells like beef jerky. lol! But that fades very quicky. At least it&#x27;s not loaded with a bunch of artificial fragrance, I will never understand why cosmetic companies feel the need to put fragrance in everything, I don&#x27;t want that on my skin! I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I used it diligently for a month...no changes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the great reviews.  The product arrived as expected and I have been using it on my face for two months.  I apply the serum in the morning before I put on moisturizer and some times at night after I have washed my face.  I have some sun spots and they have not changed in appearance.  I will use up the bottle, but won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok. I&#x27;ve given this product 3 months to fade and remove my age spots. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve seen no difference at all. I&#x27;m still using concealer on the same spots, and when you&#x27;ve lived with age spots, you KNOW they are still there! My mirror does not say &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;, as advertised. Very Disappointed ...</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry hate writing bad reviews but this product did absolutely nothing. Every brown spot on my forehead is still there and I used the whole bottle as recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 3 weeks now and have seen improvement in dark age spots fading in my temporal area.&lt;br /&gt;This product appears to be more effective than others I have tried. It is important that you follow directions for use closely for maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I would say the dark spots have faded about 50 percent. I recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> product packaging is simple and crudem,looked cheap and not be sealed!</li>
            <li> I used for about two months did not work as promise, I actually have more brown spots than before, I will not recommended this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Well I got this at the end of March and beings it said for hands and or face I used it only on my hands. I wash my hands alot at work and use hand foam sanitizer. That causes a beating on you skin! It dries my hands out and somedays my knuckles are red like chapped lips get. I only used this on my hands hoping they would feel softer and smoother and hydrated per say. I use a drop in each palm 2 times a day. They feel like silk. They are smooth and they really have improved alot! I can&#x27;t say if this removed dark spot because I don&#x27;t have any on my hands but the over all health of my hands are as smooth as my face. I am now using it on my feet, hey it&#x27;s flip flop time and I got to be sporting healthy looking feet to. they are smoother and over all I love it on my hands and feet!</li>
            <li> Great product. Significantly reduced my dark marks. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have some aging spots around my face and hands.  I know vitamin c serum has antioxidants that help fade dark spots. I like the way the product goes on, it absorbs very easily and has a nice scent.  The medicine dropper makes it easy to put on just the right amount and not waste any.</li>
            <li> This is great for extreme temperatures like the whole countrt has been. At first i was leery because this seems a little thick for the fast but this works fast to clean up the skin of dry patches</li>
            <li> This feels amazing! This is not like other Vitamin C Serums. This goes on smoothly and has a nice soft feeling after absorbed. I was able to apply my make up right over this without it smudging or changing the way my make up is applied. I have also noticed a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin lately. There is a dramatic change in my appearance thanks to this very impressive Vitamin C Serum. The fine lines are disappearing everyday. The darker spots are lessoned every day. The full overall appearance of my face has improved. Apply this after a shower, with a clean face. Let the Vitamin C Serum dry completely, then apply your regular make up routine. This works! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice vit c serum. works well with my other skincare products and absorbs into the skin very quickly which is great. doesn&#x27;t have a smell either. i would repurchase this for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered this serum and others in the same vein, because my face just looks so amazing. Playing in the sun during my childhood and teens made for a few spots that were there too soon for comfort. After using serums like this one with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Antioxidants for nearly a year, it appears as if much of the damage is reversed. I don&#x27;t even have to bother with foundation; just a little powder and I&#x27;m off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel smooth, but I see no difference in dark spots in the skin lighter.  The smell is not pleasant after it has been opened for a while.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am used  my face more radiant</li>
            <li> This product does nothing , more than 30 days using it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, smells nice, leaves my skin feeling smooth, and tight. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use to see fine lines diminish :)</li>
            <li> very excellent vitamin C</li>
            <li> If anyt product actually got rid of age spots,  you wouldn&#x27;t need to look for it on the Internet.</li>
            <li> applied it for a month and i didn&#x27;t see any difference. still have my brown spots.</li>
            <li> I started using this Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum about too weeks ago. It wasn&#x27;t as thick as I usually expect a serum to be. It absorbed into my shin quickly and has kept it very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look nice and glows.</li>
            <li> Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum can add a youthful look and radiant glow to ones appearance without the use of any harmful chemicals. I&#x27;m very picky about what I apply to my skin so anything with parabens, phthlates, or any other toxins is a big no-no. This  made in the USA product is complied of 98% natural and 72% organic ingredients and is never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this serum I recognize and already use many alone such as witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil to name just a few. It&#x27;s an excellent combination that when mixed together gives users healthier more youthful appearance by helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s also an ideal choice for those with different skin types whether oily, sensitive, acne prone, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that a little bit of this goes a long way. The bottle has glass dropper which makes application easy. I can&#x27;t quite place the smell but it&#x27;s not off putting. The consistency is somewhere in the middle of liquid and gel. It has a somewhat silky feel and absorbs soon after application.  I like to apply this before wearing make up and following with my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin to be more radiant and the darkness under my eyes fade away quite a bit! Aside from tackling my dark eye circles and under the eye puffiness, this can be used on the face, neck, body, and hands. I&#x27;ve took note of my breaking out with acne far less since use and love that my skin seems to have a really healthy glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t quite utilized all the benefits of this product but am very impressed with what it helps with. The versatility ranges from tackling with age spots, dry patchy skin, enlarged pores, sun damage, and much more! I love that it uses Vitamins C &amp; E which are great for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company stand behind their product and offers a worry free full 365 day money back guarantee no questions asked! I&#x27;m certainly satisfied with how well the product works and the affordable price.the product works and the affordable price.</li>
            <li> This product is a total life-saver. I have several age spots on my hands and really hated how they make me look so much older. I have been using this Vitamin C Serum from Clarigenics and the spots have all but vanished. My hands look so much younger and in turn make me feel much younger as well. Great product</li>
            <li> This serum is supposed to fight age spots and minimize pores, which is what we all want right? Well, after having used the Vitamin C Serum 20% for my face for about two weeks, I started noticing its incredible powers. It certainly did exactly what it was supposed to do and removed some bad spots whilst minimizing my pores so that my skin just felt amazing! I have a real nice feeling, smooth skin now every time I apply the serum. And the simple application just made it an all the way positive experience for me. Thanks to a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Absorbs well no greasy feel or unpleasant odor hydrates skin well. Cannot review any long term results as have only used short time but happy with product and ingredients impressive also.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is my favorite out of all the serums I have tried. I usually am scared of using new products on my skin since it is sensitive but I tried it anyways. I wasn&#x27;t a baby about trying it this time. I was surprised on how well it worked. I was so excited it have a dropper. It is easier to apply to my hand. I do not waste the product and I can use it for about 2 months. I have been using it every day at night for a month and its halfway gone. There really isnt a smell to the serum. That is the only thing I would change about it. I love fresh scents. I think lavander would be such a nice scent to put into the serum. It would help you fall asleep at night and make you also feel very relaxed at night. I felt it have a little floral smell. When I applied it to my face underneath the parts that are blotchy and red, it did take that out of my skin. That is what has impressed me over this past month. I am going to continue to use this product. It has really helped me feel a lot better about my skin. Anyone can benefit from using this. I would recommend using this on someone who needs a fresh face. :)</li>
            <li> Works better than Lancome.  Like the luquid.</li>
            <li> I bought my second bottle and I think I&#x27;m seeing fading spots...</li>
            <li> I waited over a month to post the review as I wanted to see if there are any visible results from daily use of the Serum.  I must unfortunately report back that it really did not do anything.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Vitamin C and liked them all, and this one did not let me down!  Very thick and fresh-smelling citrus serum that has a superb effect on your skin.  Of course most Hyaluronic Acid serums contain a bit of Vitamin C, but not much.  This has 20% Vitamin C and is a very potent product that works like a charm.  This will make your skin feel more firm and give it that shine and glow that we all want.  It also helps make your pores smaller, which in turn helps acne that is a problem I have dealt with all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will leave your skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated and give you a younger-looking appearance with continued use.  It only takes a few drops a day to rub on your face - I would recommend using it after showering and washing your face well so there is no oil or residue on your face, then apply the Vitamin C serum, rub it in very well and then use moisturizures or other creams.  This way you get the full effect of the Vitamin C with nothing in between it and your skin.  The best way to use it and get the benefits :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I was sent this Vitamin C Serum by Clarigenics to review for my blog, GlamRiver and it has really helped with my on-going battle with Melasma and that makes me really happy!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Clarigenics Vitamin C Serum as part of my a.m. skincare routine and applying it on my face, around my eyes, neck, decollete and shoulders, it&#x27;s a very lightweight formula so it&#x27;s fast-absorbing.  I love that is has really helped fade the lingering Melasma on my face, neck and decollete.  Unfortunately, if you have Melasma like I do then you know it&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of completely since it&#x27;s triggered by the sun and even though I wear sunscreen everyday I am not reapplying it throughout the day so it&#x27;s inevitable that I will get more.  So, like I said, it&#x27;s an on-going battle but I am able to keep it in check with great products like this Vitamin C Serum.  I highly recommend Vitamin C Serum if you are dealing with any kind of hyperpigmentation issues, it&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle and I prefer it to hydroquinone, which is another popular pigmentation fading product.  Plus, with a Vitamin C Serum you get all the other added benefits like, reduced fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration and smoother skin!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love my new vitamin C serum. After only using it for a week I could tell the fine lines around my face cheeks and eyes are already starting to go away. I&#x27;m most definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants to use a product that is non evasive to get rid of small lines around their face eyes neck and mouth.</li>
            <li> Received this product very quickly. Serum goes on smoothly and feels great on your face. It actually makes applying moisturizer easier as it glides on. Definitely will purchase this Vitamin C serum again!</li>
            <li> I have to say, I think this is one of the best products I have ever used, if not THE best.  Pores appear smaller, my skin is considerably softer and shows less lines - a plus for us 65+ ladies!  My skin is also very sensitive so I use any new product &#x27;gently&#x27; at first and I have had absolutely no problem with this!  I am truly a fan!!</li>
            <li> Only been using for a week, but it has made my skin feel soft and supple. I am looking forward to seeing the long term effects.</li>
            <li> I really like it! It makes my face smoother, and tighter! I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I swear by this! The very moment I applied it to my newly washed and deep cleaned pores, my face drank it in like it was water! It was like watching a baby fall in love with its mother for the first time! This stuff DOES the trick! So I give it 5, and if I could I would say 10..</li>
            <li> I am a real client.  This product worked better than MANY others I have tried.  I&#x27;m 50.  I&#x27;m  a readhead, so I have sun damage, dark spots, wrinkles, etc.  I have one product I use (TNS essential serum) that&#x27;s 300/ounce, and I pay it because it works.  This product, the vitamin C serum, is so affordable that I can use it on my chest, arms, and legs...everywhere.  There was a noticeable improvement after just 2 or three times of using it.  I love it and I will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for my face. It really helps get the Vitamin C in my skin and helps remove age spots. I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> i did not see any result.</li>
            <li> Nice amount comes in bottle, easy to use, great price</li>
            <li> As described. Great service</li>
            <li> Used it as directed and it did not fade the age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> This was a nice product. My o ly complaint was that the squirter top made it hard to aim it in the right spot. I found if I put it in my hands and then put it on my face, it worked a lot better.</li>
            <li> while the texture of this product is decent, not oily or anything, the smell of it is off putting. Since it is something used on the hands and face, you want something that is going to have no scent or a light scent that is not going to overtake your senses.</li>
            <li> Loved this serum, it felt great going on, rubbed in smooth other than taking a little while was a perfect product!</li>
            <li> Another awesome...,Add this to the treasure chest.  67 year old female...this dries almost immediately and then add whatever face cream you like.  Works like a champ and you won&#x27;t believe the results.</li>
            <li> Title of product is exact! Best product for skin smoothing evening out skin tone</li>
