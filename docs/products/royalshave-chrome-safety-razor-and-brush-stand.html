            <li>This is a great value for the price and fits my Edwin Jagger razor and Art of Shaving Silvertip brush PERFECTLY!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful piece.</li>
            <li>The razor and brush stand is sturdy and attractive.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a great holder</li>
            <li>so im happy with this one.</li>
            <li>the finish is very nice, and the simplicity of design is pleasing.</li>
            <li>Looks very nice on my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the weight, so it will not tip easily.  </li>
            <li>Looks as good now as it did new,I&#x27;ve had it now 3 months and shows no sign of ware..</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>All in all, good product.</li>
            <li>Good piece at a good price.</li>
            <li>It has a good weight to it</li>
            <li>Better looking than picture!</li>
            <li>and it holds my brush and blade nicely.  </li>
            <li>It looks really nice with the Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>This stand looks nice in the picture, but when you hold it,  it is lighter than you would think.</li>
            <li>This is very well constructed and very pleasant to look at.</li>
            <li>It rivals many of the $100 stands I&#x27;ve seen in specialty shops.</li>
            <li>Im sure to the seller I still threw it in the trash</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think that it could be designed better.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>The chrome looks fantastic, and the knurled portion adds a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyways, I now am looking for a better stand as this one did break (my fault, but it should have survived IMHO).  </li>
            <li>...with one suggestion for improvement:  the ends of the razor and lather brush hooks should be bent up a tad more, to prevent the razor and brush from falling off if the stand is moved with them on it.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more?  </li>
            <li>After picking up my brush too many times, it was time for this to go in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>It cradles a Schick brass and marble injector razor and a full Badger brush, handsomely!  </li>
            <li>The holder is great for a classic safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li>The thing looks nice, but it is kind of cheap; the bottom pad isn&#x27;t fitted right</li>
            <li>It works great so far.</li>
            <li>I just make sure that I wipe the stand off after shaving to keep the metal shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>This stand rusts too easily.</li>
            <li>Razor (1965 Gillette safety razor) fits fine, but shaving brushes don&#x27;t fit as well.</li>
            <li>: It holds my razor and brush as advertised, fit and finish seem up to snuff.  </li>
            <li>The brush and the razor fit well.</li>
            <li>This is what I get for going cheap.  </li>
            <li>Both products fit well in the stand&#x27;s allotted spaces.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a great product - very sturdy, well constructed and much heavier than you would expect.</li>
            <li>It fits my Parker 71R perfectly, and also holds my rather small brush with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll pay more for a better product that holds the brush and safety razor better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was looking for a nice stand that wasn&#x27;t costly.  </li>
            <li>The elegant design works well with most classy shaving components.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy good looking stand</li>
            <li>Built very well and holding up great after several months of use.</li>
            <li>It came nicely packaged and fast,, I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>and so far, there are no rust spots, it cleans off easy and holds my brush and razor rather securely.</li>
            <li>It looks great and stylish and it will last a long time!</li>
            <li>Even after a few years, it&#x27;s holding up great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and looks great on my sink.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, cost effective stand for your shaving brush and safety</li>
            <li>He seemed to like it very much.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the metal is pretty good, I&#x27;ve had it a few months</li>
            <li>At first, I thought maybe it was for shipping purposes</li>
            <li>I was able to piece the entire set together for my son through Amazon without having to pay the retail price.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>Although this looks nice in the pic, the edges are rough, and it does not hold the brush very well.  </li>
            <li>Pretty stout and steady.</li>
            <li>Nice and have had for over 2 years and hasnt rusted, my only con is that the holder for the brush is too small and doesnt fit the brush right</li>
            <li>only bristles fit through.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The bottom is some sort of felt-like material that stays wet and moves around the counter top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than this, it is a good razor and brush stand, and (at least at two weeks of use) shows no signs of corrosion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the side that holds my razor is too small for my Edwin Jagger, I have to kind of squeeze it in.</li>
            <li>It is heavy enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get knocked or tipped over and it looks good with a high shine, chromium finish.</li>
            <li>I wring out the brush, and try to dry it as best I can, but it is still a little wet, and I don&#x27;t want that water to end up on my countertop.  </li>
            <li>For me, the stand is too easy to tip over if you are not careful, which can toss your razor potentially breaking it in the sink.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That works fine, but I wish the hook was big enough to hold the brush by the handle.</li>
            <li>Couldnt find any other holder that would fit the brush either</li>
            <li>I bought this stand when I bought a new razor.  </li>
            <li>No thanks, will look for a better quality product out there, and I would suggest the same to you.</li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s alignment nubs on the back don&#x27;t fit properly over the holder.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;RoyalShave Chrome Safety Razor and Brush Stand,\\&quot; adds a masculine touch to any bathroom.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s direct metal contact between the stand and the counter.  </li>
            <li>So far hasn&#x27;t rusted yet either.</li>
            <li>mine arrived rusted, scratched and flimsy, simply was not tightened together properly, all connecting parts felt loose, seller was helpful and refunded me right away.</li>
            <li>I would look for something that can easily fit in your medicine cabinet or that at least does not get water spots all over it.  </li>
            <li>It seems very sturdy, I assume it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Actually is rusting which surprised me</li>
            <li>stainless steel is not really stainless...</li>
            <li>When I looked on Amazon to buy one and noticed the price, I thought that it was a little pricey, but I&#x27;m glad that it bought it because it&#x27;s a quality heavy duty stand.  </li>
            <li>Rust was all over it within a few months of first use.</li>
            <li>Adds a little manliness to my bathroom that is decorated by my wife hahaha.</li>

            <li> Adds a little manliness to my bathroom that is decorated by my wife hahaha.</li>
            <li> Still think the price is a little high</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a veteran wet shaver you know this already.</li>
            <li> use it to hold my Merkur 180 long handled safety razor, and Escali badger hair brush (both also purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Prongs that hold the brush could be a little larger to accomodate larger brush handles.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Escali badger hair brush (which I also got off Amazon) because it needs to hang dry.</li>
            <li> The base is heavy enough so that it won&#x27;t fall over and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> Base was filled with a foam pad that if not dried properly will start molding.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting into wet shaving, you&#x27;ll need a brush and a stand (pro tip, keep it in your room or any dry place as the humidity in the bathroom will wreak havoc on your blade and brush).</li>
            <li> Other than this minor detail</li>
            <li> Im sure they are all not this bad, eventhough I was allowed to keep the item, these items run like $3-$6 dollars</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to prevent tipping over.  </li>
            <li> , I expected it when I bought it</li>
            <li> We have no humidity problems even here in the wet northwest</li>
            <li> and it sits on a small shelf above sink so dos not get wet</li>
            <li> Apparently this company thinks that buyers should spend their hard earned money on merchandise that lacks any sort of quality.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> With a sleek, textured chrome design this single stand holds both your brush and razor together, saving space for tight quarters on bathroom shelves or surfaces.</li>
            <li> It also has sharp edges on the insides of the holders for your razor, and brush.</li>
            <li> Nice stand with heavy base.</li>
            <li> One is tight the other needs to be placed so</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show water marks from water dripping down onto it.</li>
            <li> There are no signs of wear at all and this holder is constantly being used by my facial hair obsessed husband.</li>
            <li> Heavy and constructed well.</li>
            <li> customer service has forced me to write a poor review so as to save the next stupid schmuck from spending their hard earned buck on their sham of a product--it appears this company is all about the all mighty dollar and acquiring shameful profit at someone else&#x27;s expense.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this stand 4 out of 5 stars is because the chrome plating on mine came with a slight flaw on the base (see in pictures above).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a stand give this one serious consideration.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely put there to be as a base filler.</li>
            <li> How discouraged was I to find this Amazon seller telling me that this item has no warranty---very poor customer service I must say.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> but indicates the poor material is made of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I hang my wet brush, there is no where for me to place a cup to catch any drippings, because the base is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this product that I purchased as a present for my husband,  The shaft of the stand has a silver wrapping that became unraveled.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Thinking this wrong could be corrected</li>
            <li> I have to balance my shaving mug on the edge, and it sits at an angle, so it looks bad.</li>
            <li> chrome has chipped off and this has rusted badly.  </li>
            <li> A weighted base</li>
            <li> and I just hang the brush from the base of the bristles instead of the handle.</li>

            <li> This razor stand holds my safety razor (Edwin Jagger DE89) and brush (Escali badger hair) perfectly, it also doesn&#x27;t appear to be flimsy or anything like that. The only reason I gave this stand 4 out of 5 stars is because the chrome plating on mine came with a slight flaw on the base (see in pictures above). Other than this minor detail this razor stand is great!</li>
            <li> If it were priced just a bit cheaper, say $3-$5, then I would give this razor stand 5-stars. The quality of the metal is pretty good, I&#x27;ve had it a few months and so far, there are no rust spots, it cleans off easy and holds my brush and razor rather securely. The base is heavy enough so that it won&#x27;t fall over and has a good weight to it. I just shouldn&#x27;t have paid close to $30 for it.</li>
            <li> This stand is shinny and holds a razor and a brush.  It seems very sturdy, I assume it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The razor and brush stand is sturdy and attractive.  It is heavy enough to prevent tipping over.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I cannot put my brush&#x27;s handle on the brush hook.  The brush&#x27;s handle is too big for the hook, so I hooked it where the bristles meet the handle.  That works fine, but I wish the hook was big enough to hold the brush by the handle.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;RoyalShave Chrome Safety Razor and Brush Stand,\\&quot; adds a masculine touch to any bathroom. It exudes quality with precision machined knurling on the post and chrome plating reminiscent of American bumpers from the 50&#x27;s.  It cradles a Schick brass and marble injector razor and a full Badger brush, handsomely!  It rivals many of the $100 stands I&#x27;ve seen in specialty shops.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Escali badger hair brush (which I also got off Amazon) because it needs to hang dry. I also hang my Merkur safety razor on it. It works great so far. I just make sure that I wipe the stand off after shaving to keep the metal shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Pros: It holds my razor and brush as advertised, fit and finish seem up to snuff.  Cons: Um.... it doesn&#x27;t shave for me?</li>
            <li> Nice stand with heavy base. Razor (1965 Gillette safety razor) fits fine, but shaving brushes don&#x27;t fit as well. One is tight the other needs to be placed so only bristles fit through.</li>
            <li> Base was filled with a foam pad that if not dried properly will start molding. I went ahead and removed this, but why is it even there? At first, I thought maybe it was for shipping purposes but it was definitely put there to be as a base filler. Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> This was purchased through: BEAUTYTOOLZ , mine arrived rusted, scratched and flimsy, simply was not tightened together properly, all connecting parts felt loose, seller was helpful and refunded me right away. Im sure they are all not this bad, eventhough I was allowed to keep the item, these items run like $3-$6 dollars Im sure to the seller I still threw it in the trash, rust is spreading and it looks like sheeet. No thanks, will look for a better quality product out there, and I would suggest the same to you.</li>
            <li> Prongs that hold the brush could be a little larger to accomodate larger brush handles. Otherwise this is a great product - very sturdy, well constructed and much heavier than you would expect.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a safety razor and totally forgot to buy a stand.  When I looked on Amazon to buy one and noticed the price, I thought that it was a little pricey, but I&#x27;m glad that it bought it because it&#x27;s a quality heavy duty stand.  It looks great and stylish and it will last a long time! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Better looking than picture! Heavy and constructed well. I recommend this for anyone that needs it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The thing looks nice, but it is kind of cheap; the bottom pad isn&#x27;t fitted right so there&#x27;s direct metal contact between the stand and the counter.  Nothing big, but it distracts.  Additionally, the stand doesn&#x27;t hold my Merkur razors properly.  The razor&#x27;s alignment nubs on the back don&#x27;t fit properly over the holder.  Not the holder&#x27;s fault, but I can&#x27;t help but think that it could be designed better.</li>
            <li> The holder is great for a classic safety razor and brush. Even after a few years, it&#x27;s holding up great. There are no signs of wear at all and this holder is constantly being used by my facial hair obsessed husband. I just wish it had a third holder for a moustache razor but that&#x27;s ok... it&#x27;s still a great holder and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stand rusts too easily. Rust was all over it within a few months of first use. I have no complaints about its functionality though. It is solid and does what it should. The brush and the razor fit well.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the quality of this product that I purchased as a present for my husband,  The shaft of the stand has a silver wrapping that became unraveled.  Thinking this wrong could be corrected I contacted customer service.  How discouraged was I to find this Amazon seller telling me that this item has no warranty---very poor customer service I must say.  Apparently this company thinks that buyers should spend their hard earned money on merchandise that lacks any sort of quality.  Well I tried rectifying this the proper way but customer service has forced me to write a poor review so as to save the next stupid schmuck from spending their hard earned buck on their sham of a product--it appears this company is all about the all mighty dollar and acquiring shameful profit at someone else&#x27;s expense.</li>
            <li> This is very well constructed and very pleasant to look at. It&#x27;s basically functional art.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re getting into wet shaving, you&#x27;ll need a brush and a stand (pro tip, keep it in your room or any dry place as the humidity in the bathroom will wreak havoc on your blade and brush). If you&#x27;re a veteran wet shaver you know this already. I have no problem recommending this product. If you&#x27;re in the market for a stand give this one serious consideration.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand when I bought a new razor.  It fits my Parker 71R perfectly, and also holds my rather small brush with no problem.  The chrome looks fantastic, and the knurled portion adds a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I hang my wet brush, there is no where for me to place a cup to catch any drippings, because the base is so thick.  I wring out the brush, and try to dry it as best I can, but it is still a little wet, and I don&#x27;t want that water to end up on my countertop.  I have to balance my shaving mug on the edge, and it sits at an angle, so it looks bad.</li>
            <li> A weighted base and it holds my brush and blade nicely.  Adds a little manliness to my bathroom that is decorated by my wife hahaha.</li>
            <li> See my uploaded photo.  After about a year of use. chrome has chipped off and this has rusted badly.  I keep it in the drawer since it&#x27;s so ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the side that holds my razor is too small for my Edwin Jagger, I have to kind of squeeze it in.</li>
            <li> This chrome stand is an excellent option for a brush and safety razor system. With a sleek, textured chrome design this single stand holds both your brush and razor together, saving space for tight quarters on bathroom shelves or surfaces. The elegant design works well with most classy shaving components.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.  I was able to piece the entire set together for my son through Amazon without having to pay the retail price.  It&#x27;s a beautiful piece.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Son-in-law for a Christmas present.  I was very impressed with the weight, so it will not tip easily.  the finish is very nice, and the simplicity of design is pleasing.</li>
            <li> I got into DE safety blade shaving a while ago at the beginning of this year and I got this stand.  For me, the stand is too easy to tip over if you are not careful, which can toss your razor potentially breaking it in the sink.  Anyways, I now am looking for a better stand as this one did break (my fault, but it should have survived IMHO).  The crome is constantly needing to be cleaned and it seems that water would get inside.  With my needs now, I desire a stand that will hold my brush and possibly my razor in my medicine cabinet since I do not need a shave mug since moving to shaving sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Based on my experience I would look for something that can easily fit in your medicine cabinet or that at least does not get water spots all over it.  But if you are a meticulous cleaner after each use this may work well for you.</li>
            <li> Great for people who want to mix and match their razor and brush! I have a #66 and a Vintage Rooney in mine... it works great!</li>
            <li> Nice heavy good looking stand</li>
            <li> Nice and have had for over 2 years and hasnt rusted, my only con is that the holder for the brush is too small and doesnt fit the brush right, I expected it when I bought it and I just hang the brush from the base of the bristles instead of the handle. Couldnt find any other holder that would fit the brush either so im happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a shaving brush and a manual razor. Looks very nice on my bathroom cabinet. So far hasn&#x27;t rusted yet either.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Actually is rusting which surprised me but indicates the poor material is made of. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Looks as good now as it did new,I&#x27;ve had it now 3 months and shows no sign of ware.. We have no humidity problems even here in the wet northwest and it sits on a small shelf above sink so dos not get wet, it&#x27;s still in perfect condition,,, holds my medium sized brush and E.J.89 safety razor with some room to spare.. It came nicely packaged and fast,, I highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and was looking for a nice stand that wasn&#x27;t costly.  This is a great value for the price and fits my Edwin Jagger razor and Art of Shaving Silvertip brush PERFECTLY!  It&#x27;s heavy and sturdy and looks great on my sink.</li>
            <li> Built very well and holding up great after several months of use. No staining or discoloration on any of the product, it still looks just as polished as day one.</li>
            <li> After some time in my bathroom, it starts to rust.&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel is not really stainless...</li>
            <li> Looks good. Pretty stout and steady. Still think the price is a little high but it is constant with similar items of the same quality.  All in all, good product.</li>
            <li> ...with one suggestion for improvement:  the ends of the razor and lather brush hooks should be bent up a tad more, to prevent the razor and brush from falling off if the stand is moved with them on it.  I am hesitant to do this, because I fear the chrome plating will crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, it is a good razor and brush stand, and (at least at two weeks of use) shows no signs of corrosion.</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend (it was something he wanted) for Christmas.  He seemed to like it very much.  Hope so.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?  Yes, there are more expensive razor/brush stands out there. This one does the job well. It is heavy enough so that it doesn&#x27;t get knocked or tipped over and it looks good with a high shine, chromium finish. Good piece at a good price.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we needed. It looks really nice with the Merkur razor. It has a good weight to it and I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues with the finish. Been using it for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> This stand looks nice in the picture, but when you hold it,  it is lighter than you would think. It also has sharp edges on the insides of the holders for your razor, and brush. For the price, I find these flaws acceptable, but I might suggest trying another brand. I might add that mine still had polishing compound stains on it in several places, and is made in China.</li>
            <li> I have used this stand for almost two months. It doesn&#x27;t show water marks from water dripping down onto it. Holds Brush and Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is what I get for going cheap.  Although this looks nice in the pic, the edges are rough, and it does not hold the brush very well.  My shaving brush was perched precariously for several weeks (I tried adjusting it often), and it just got to be a pain.  The bottom is some sort of felt-like material that stays wet and moves around the counter top.  After picking up my brush too many times, it was time for this to go in the garbage.  Next time I&#x27;ll pay more for a better product that holds the brush and safety razor better.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, cost effective stand for your shaving brush and safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to hold my Merkur 180 long handled safety razor, and Escali badger hair brush (both also purchased on Amazon). Both products fit well in the stand&#x27;s allotted spaces.</li>
