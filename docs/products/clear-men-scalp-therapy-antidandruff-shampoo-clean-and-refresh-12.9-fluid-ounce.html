            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>so you know if you are getting a good price or not.  </li>
            <li>but it works good.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>Although this product smells good, it doesn&#x27;t help the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>If you like that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and&lt;</li>
            <li>it it feels really good on my scalp and leaves a good scent in my hair.</li>
            <li>He says his head has never felt so good.</li>
            <li>so I thought his shampoo would be good for him.</li>
            <li>good as before.  </li>
            <li>Best Shampoo I ever used because it perfectly handled my dandruff issue and made my hair clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels good, smells good, the hair behaves nicely after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better shampoos out there, but this one does what it says and accomplishes it at a great price.</li>
            <li>Nice smell and does a good job cleaning without being drying to his scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>Who would think that something so affordable would be so effective.</li>
            <li>nice alternative to head and shoulders</li>
            <li>a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice smelling shampoo, which lathers well (according to my son.)</li>
            <li>My husband used this product and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Lathers nicely and does the job.</li>
            <li>As someone who has suffered with dandruff for years, I can honestly say that I have tried every product out there.</li>
            <li>So for us, it is a nice way to wash the hair, just doesn&#x27;t touch the flakes.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice, but I have been using it for almost a month now</li>
            <li>Feels nice and refreshing when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>that are more appropriate and effective for men.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent natural alternative to a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li>It has a very light, almost unnoticable, fragrence.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fresh scent that I find agreeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo does the job, has a very light scent which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>They could do a better job at packing it.</li>
            <li>Shampoo aroma smells okay, but I was hoping for the invigorating Tea Tree coupled with Mint scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell after my husband uses this</li>
            <li>Definitely the best shampoo for dandruff I&#x27;ve had, helps that its for men</li>
            <li>just love it</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice,  light scent</li>
            <li>and I like it much better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2012</li>
            <li>Smell  and leave hair ok.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of Dandruff shampoos - mostly Head &amp; Shoulders brands or pharmacy store equivalent generics.</li>
            <li>But even besides that, the shampoo smells good but really didn&#x27;t nourish my hair and would make it frizzy so to each their own</li>
            <li>Okay, I am on an anti-greasy hair campaign and this review is not about dandruff or scalp problems.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through different brands of shampoo and discovered that anti-dandruff shampoos seem to work the best against greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>While that&#x27;s not terribly manly itself, it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
            <li>I will bump this up to five stars if this thing continues to do its magic after a month or so. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many prescription steroid medications by my dermatologist that I have been scared to keep using so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Although now I&#x27; am trying to grow my hair longer, so I would rather buy a shampoo that&#x27;s more appropriate for hair growth.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d say it lathers up better than H&amp;S)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more could one ask for?...</li>
            <li>Most shampoos leave me with sores on my head.</li>
            <li>Most zinc shampoos get rid of those but still leave an itch feeling.</li>
            <li>Overall best shampoo I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li>While this worked most of the time, it didn&#x27;t help with the itching and scratching.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>Okay let me educate you about hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>and it has been more than a year.</li>
            <li>It is very rich</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo, rich, lots of lather.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and rinses out well, leaving the hair feeling clean and looking shiny.)</li>
            <li>My hair was very clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li>very good shampoo deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;MEN&#x27;S\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, those have passed for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review after a couple of weeks, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very reasonably-priced, functional, good shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be &amp;#34;proof of God&#x27;s existence&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li>The bottle is an easy shape to get the shampoo out.</li>
            <li>Smells clean, not too strong (H&amp;S has an OK smell to it too in my opinion)&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Sound delish, but don&#x27;t mistake this for an ice cream topping.  </li>
            <li>I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>He loves this shampoo, it helps with his light dandriff and he likes the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product (and others of the same variety but with different fragrances) for two months, now, and can honestly say that it is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>though, the shampoo is a great consistency - not so runny it runs out your hands while you&#x27;re still trying to put the lid on and get it back on the shower shelf.  </li>
            <li>My scalp and skin look and feel smooth, moist and richer.</li>
            <li>For what I paid (free)</li>
            <li>for the shampoo, it works and it smells fantastic - my wife even likes it.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp and it has been good.</li>
            <li>Works against dandruff just fine, and the scent and cool tingly feeling on my scalp is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you have any kind of irritation on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll have to say, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again because my hair stays clean a lot longer, too.</li>
            <li>It IS a clean smell</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair clean for 3 whopping days which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>a plus, no greasy residue, just a clean scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes clean and I&#x27;ve had zero flakes while using the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I tried Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo and the only thing that would have made it perfect is if it came with conditioner in one (2 capped) packagae!  </li>
            <li>I did a little research and since they&#x27;ll let you skip a month if you don&#x27;t need more, it was great to save an extra buck on an already good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for a couple weeks and they do work, make sure to really use it and not stop using it after you see its clearing up.</li>
            <li>It really controls my dandruff I had for many years.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>For the price, however, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild dandruff.</li>
            <li>While that got rid of most of the itching, it left more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for about a month now and my scalp is healthier and more dandruff free than anytime</li>
            <li>I say it is excellent and is achieved at a very good and full of expectation deep cleansing of the scalp, eliminates the itching and discomfort of dirty hair, leaving it softer and easier to comb.</li>
            <li>High end shampoos will smell better.</li>
            <li>Also, Tea Tree on the scalp feels absolutely refreshing and this shampoo just feels like normal shampoo-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a whole host of botanical additives including ginseng (who knew your hair could be more ALERT?), tea tree, natural mint (more on this one below), vitamins B5 and E, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice product, pretty standard, but priced well and with the added convenience of free shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li>He normally is a buy whatever kind of guy, but after getting him this 1 time, he always asks for more of this specific brand when he runs out.</li>
            <li>I find this to be an effective treatment for dry/itchy scalp, regardless of whether you actually have dandruff or not.</li>
            <li>This is a nice daily use shampoo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>May be too powerful for him.</li>
            <li>More importantly for me, though, is that the itching is gone, almost instantly.</li>
            <li>For the money and functionality, this is worth a try on your part.</li>
            <li>The bottle is sturdy and the unique design has the bottom  click open for greater control</li>
            <li>I think it worked well as a dandruff shampoo, but it lathers up better and smells alot better than some of the other ones i have tried.</li>
            <li>just pure clean and refreshed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>recommend trying different active ingredients and figuring out what works best for you.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, and actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had a bottle of peppermint oil lying around and decided to dump some in the shampoo because I noticed there is tea tree oil and other good stuff in there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cool and quite invigorating first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>But not near as nice as what you&#x27;ll get wherever you get your hair cut.</li>
            <li>Controlled my mild dandruff very well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works well, scalp feels refreshed, but the smell is not fantastic, seems kind of cheap and medicine-y.</li>
            <li>Nice design for the bottle; dispenses cleanly without leaving a mess on the bottle (H&amp;S can clump up over time, and their caps are not as easy to use as the Clear product)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have even used it a time or two to get a good deep clean on my long hair.</li>
            <li>My husband has a more moderate case and found this shampoo to be beneficial as well.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no brand (for me) can be used for a prolonged period of time</li>
            <li>When I first stumbled upon this, it was like discovering a treasure trove.  </li>
            <li>That was not the product&#x27;s fault, but be aware that buying a liquid anything, and having it shipped to you, might leak.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice at first.</li>
            <li>The container is pretty tall and holds a lot of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used so many anti dandruff shampoo and none seem to work or work for about a year and boom dandruff back.</li>
            <li>and I think the price is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li>If you want to spend a little more and get a super shot of tingly scalp check out [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Does it actually make one&#x27;s hair more lively?  </li>
            <li>no extra tingles or anything - which would be fine if it worked.</li>
            <li>I think the Tea Tree ingredient makes this shampoo so gentle, but I can&#x27;t be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the effectiveness and reasonable price, I give this product 5 Stars.</li>
            <li>it has a very fresh/minty feel to it, it cools your scalp and body.</li>
            <li>If you download the amazon app it has a feature in the search section of the app where you can scan the barcode of any item at a store and it will tell you how much it costs on amazon</li>
            <li>Really... Devastated.</li>
            <li>Really eliminates Dandruff.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a couple weeks straight</li>
            <li>It also cleans very well and is gentle</li>
            <li>Great product but at $4.98 is not a great deal to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;Local</li>
            <li>It has really helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have problem dandruff that is too much for Denorex and, until now, has required a coal tar-based shampoo to subdue.</li>
            <li>I (wish, really)</li>
            <li>I will try a different kind of shampoo instead next time.</li>
            <li>He tends to have a dry scalp and his hair gets pretty dry, but this anti dandruff shampoo and daily scalp treatment cleaned his hair nicely, has a nice fresh scent and it left his hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, peppermint oil is really good for dandruff treatment when diluted and mixed with other oils and in this case,</li>
            <li>You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li>I guess the other one was formulated to fight dandruff more, which I used to have, but that has not been an issue for me for some time now.  </li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]].  </li>
            <li>I tried to switch over from Head and Should to this shampoo but found that this CLEAR shampoo didn&#x27;t take care of my dry scalp issues and it almost seemed like it creates more dandruff?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regularly use this kind of shampoo, but mix it in every now and then if my scalp starts feeling dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but the scent is reminiscent of bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I have a dry, flakey scalp; the fact that it was $1 to $1.50 cheaper than the Axe Anti-Dandruff shampoo I normally use also influenced my decision (and free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost per ounce vs. some of the competing products is high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for men whether or not you have dandruff or not as they seem to use ingredients in this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any guy who is looking for a way out of it all.</li>
            <li>If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean &amp; Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>It is the same active ingredient and concentration as another popular anti-dandruff shampoo, [[ASIN:B000GCY2PG</li>
            <li>This particular one was advertised as using special chemicals to help with dry, damaged and dandruff hair.</li>
            <li>Unlikely, but it feels GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for me, it works great.</li>
            <li>I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li>This is better than any plain national brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>How much of these additives actually make some sort of positive difference for your hair, well, who knows?  </li>
            <li>In fact, this bottle design looks like it was made by them and just put this under a new brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this new \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; product each day for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The new formula does nothing.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is mildly fruity, not particularly manly, but it washes out cleanly with no real residual odor, so I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that while it didn&#x27;t work for him, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for others as it is a medical issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not usually one to put a lot of stock in differences in shampoos, I have to give this one credit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first and only time using it, I was blown away.</li>
            <li>Not sure how they do it, but it smells better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: if you leave the cap open, the residual shampoo along the &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; will dry up and will not &amp;#34;wash away&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li>I had a huge dandruff problem, this thing made it less visible on Day 1.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad alternative to the \\&quot;big boys\\&quot; as in Head &amp; Shoulders, T-Gel, Selsun Blue.....</li>
            <li>(I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than Head &amp; Shoulders, and less medical feeling/smelling than Neutrogena.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why, then, buy CLEAR?  </li>
            <li>(I have oily hair, and Clear cleans it well, and does so</li>
            <li>/&gt;After being fed up and in need to replace my shampoo, I just stumbled upon Clear Men Scalp Therapy and boy</li>
            <li>It really is the only one that has ever worked at removing dandruff.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling too soft.</li>
            <li>One thing I have found, though, is the addition of natural mint may make your scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li>I looked for old stock everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I was surprised at how soft his hair felt without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I was balding really early</li>
            <li>Have used it 4 times so far</li>
            <li>and wow.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I will say that this shampoo feels and looks a bit like Elmer&#x27;s(r) glue when you put a little in your hand; sort of fun!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for men with more serious cases of dandruff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird to describe a shampoo as soft, seeing as it&#x27;s a liquid and therefore would be regardless, but it just feels very very soft.  </li>
            <li>The smell of generic shampoo fruitiness is a little strong and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Bought because I needed to hit 35$ to get free shipping, I have a minor Dandruff problem in the winter due to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and used Dove Men+Care and within a week, the dandruff came back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a major dandruff problem, but I do get some flakes every now and then.  </li>
            <li>This Head &amp; shoulders shampoo really controls my dry itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company.</li>
            <li>I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I will provide an update after a couple weeks to a couple months to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is completely gone showing only a scar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I have no doubts that it&#x27;ll fix my dandruff issue.  </li>
            <li>He normally likes to switch it up occasionally because he says the same brand starts to cause buildup on his scalp but not since getting this brand.</li>
            <li>My son used this and liked it, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help his dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who has a dry scalp or drandruff.</li>
            <li>The first and only shampoo that totally eliminated my dry scalp!</li>
            <li>This product is no different to me as it uses the same proven active ingredient and drives the same positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as controlling my flakey, dry scalp - it has been almost 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Some people have a light case of dandruff while others have a more difficult or serious case.</li>
            <li>minimizes dandruff for me... has a neutral smell, don&#x27;t use everyday as in doing so my hair became flat... but does its job pretty well.. have re-purchased this product.</li>
            <li>But it really cut down on my dandruff!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It always works great on my beard.</li>

            <li> This is good solution for dandruff.</li>
            <li> Good Luck</li>
            <li> so you know if you are getting a good price or not.  </li>
            <li> but it works good.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> Although this product smells good, it doesn&#x27;t help the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> If you like that, you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and&lt;</li>
            <li> it it feels really good on my scalp and leaves a good scent in my hair.</li>
            <li> He says his head has never felt so good.</li>
            <li> so I thought his shampoo would be good for him.</li>
            <li> good as before.  </li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I ever used because it perfectly handled my dandruff issue and made my hair clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels good, smells good, the hair behaves nicely after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are better shampoos out there, but this one does what it says and accomplishes it at a great price.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and does a good job cleaning without being drying to his scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Who would think that something so affordable would be so effective.</li>
            <li> nice alternative to head and shoulders</li>
            <li> a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice smelling shampoo, which lathers well (according to my son.)</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely and does the job.</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered with dandruff for years, I can honestly say that I have tried every product out there.</li>
            <li> So for us, it is a nice way to wash the hair, just doesn&#x27;t touch the flakes.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice, but I have been using it for almost a month now</li>
            <li> Feels nice and refreshing when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> that are more appropriate and effective for men.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent natural alternative to a healthy scalp.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, almost unnoticable, fragrence.</li>
            <li> It was very cheap</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fresh scent that I find agreeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo does the job, has a very light scent which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> They could do a better job at packing it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo aroma smells okay, but I was hoping for the invigorating Tea Tree coupled with Mint scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell after my husband uses this</li>
            <li> Definitely the best shampoo for dandruff I&#x27;ve had, helps that its for men</li>
            <li> just love it</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice,  light scent</li>
            <li> and I like it much better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2012</li>
            <li> Smell  and leave hair ok.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of Dandruff shampoos - mostly Head &amp; Shoulders brands or pharmacy store equivalent generics.</li>
            <li> But even besides that, the shampoo smells good but really didn&#x27;t nourish my hair and would make it frizzy so to each their own</li>
            <li> Okay, I am on an anti-greasy hair campaign and this review is not about dandruff or scalp problems.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through different brands of shampoo and discovered that anti-dandruff shampoos seem to work the best against greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> While that&#x27;s not terribly manly itself, it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
            <li> I will bump this up to five stars if this thing continues to do its magic after a month or so. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many prescription steroid medications by my dermatologist that I have been scared to keep using so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Although now I&#x27; am trying to grow my hair longer, so I would rather buy a shampoo that&#x27;s more appropriate for hair growth.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d say it lathers up better than H&amp;S)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more could one ask for?...</li>
            <li> Most shampoos leave me with sores on my head.</li>
            <li> Most zinc shampoos get rid of those but still leave an itch feeling.</li>
            <li> Overall best shampoo I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li> While this worked most of the time, it didn&#x27;t help with the itching and scratching.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> Okay let me educate you about hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is also nice which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> and it has been more than a year.</li>
            <li> It is very rich</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo, rich, lots of lather.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and rinses out well, leaving the hair feeling clean and looking shiny.)</li>
            <li> My hair was very clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li> very good shampoo deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;MEN&#x27;S\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, those have passed for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after a couple of weeks, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very reasonably-priced, functional, good shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be &amp;#34;proof of God&#x27;s existence&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li> The bottle is an easy shape to get the shampoo out.</li>
            <li> Smells clean, not too strong (H&amp;S has an OK smell to it too in my opinion)&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Sound delish, but don&#x27;t mistake this for an ice cream topping.  </li>
            <li> I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> He loves this shampoo, it helps with his light dandriff and he likes the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (and others of the same variety but with different fragrances) for two months, now, and can honestly say that it is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> though, the shampoo is a great consistency - not so runny it runs out your hands while you&#x27;re still trying to put the lid on and get it back on the shower shelf.  </li>
            <li> My scalp and skin look and feel smooth, moist and richer.</li>
            <li> For what I paid (free)</li>
            <li> for the shampoo, it works and it smells fantastic - my wife even likes it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp and it has been good.</li>
            <li> Works against dandruff just fine, and the scent and cool tingly feeling on my scalp is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you have any kind of irritation on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to say, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again because my hair stays clean a lot longer, too.</li>
            <li> It IS a clean smell</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair clean for 3 whopping days which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> a plus, no greasy residue, just a clean scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes clean and I&#x27;ve had zero flakes while using the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I tried Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo and the only thing that would have made it perfect is if it came with conditioner in one (2 capped) packagae!  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and since they&#x27;ll let you skip a month if you don&#x27;t need more, it was great to save an extra buck on an already good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple weeks and they do work, make sure to really use it and not stop using it after you see its clearing up.</li>
            <li> It really controls my dandruff I had for many years.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> For the price, however, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild dandruff.</li>
            <li> While that got rid of most of the itching, it left more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for about a month now and my scalp is healthier and more dandruff free than anytime</li>
            <li> I say it is excellent and is achieved at a very good and full of expectation deep cleansing of the scalp, eliminates the itching and discomfort of dirty hair, leaving it softer and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> High end shampoos will smell better.</li>
            <li> Also, Tea Tree on the scalp feels absolutely refreshing and this shampoo just feels like normal shampoo-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a whole host of botanical additives including ginseng (who knew your hair could be more ALERT?), tea tree, natural mint (more on this one below), vitamins B5 and E, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice product, pretty standard, but priced well and with the added convenience of free shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li> He normally is a buy whatever kind of guy, but after getting him this 1 time, he always asks for more of this specific brand when he runs out.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an effective treatment for dry/itchy scalp, regardless of whether you actually have dandruff or not.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily use shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> May be too powerful for him.</li>
            <li> More importantly for me, though, is that the itching is gone, almost instantly.</li>
            <li> For the money and functionality, this is worth a try on your part.</li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy and the unique design has the bottom  click open for greater control</li>
            <li> I think it worked well as a dandruff shampoo, but it lathers up better and smells alot better than some of the other ones i have tried.</li>
            <li> just pure clean and refreshed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> recommend trying different active ingredients and figuring out what works best for you.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, and actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of peppermint oil lying around and decided to dump some in the shampoo because I noticed there is tea tree oil and other good stuff in there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool and quite invigorating first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But not near as nice as what you&#x27;ll get wherever you get your hair cut.</li>
            <li> Controlled my mild dandruff very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, scalp feels refreshed, but the smell is not fantastic, seems kind of cheap and medicine-y.</li>
            <li> Nice design for the bottle; dispenses cleanly without leaving a mess on the bottle (H&amp;S can clump up over time, and their caps are not as easy to use as the Clear product)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have even used it a time or two to get a good deep clean on my long hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has a more moderate case and found this shampoo to be beneficial as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no brand (for me) can be used for a prolonged period of time</li>
            <li> When I first stumbled upon this, it was like discovering a treasure trove.  </li>
            <li> That was not the product&#x27;s fault, but be aware that buying a liquid anything, and having it shipped to you, might leak.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice at first.</li>
            <li> The container is pretty tall and holds a lot of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used so many anti dandruff shampoo and none seem to work or work for about a year and boom dandruff back.</li>
            <li> and I think the price is pretty reasonable.  </li>
            <li> If you want to spend a little more and get a super shot of tingly scalp check out [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Does it actually make one&#x27;s hair more lively?  </li>
            <li> no extra tingles or anything - which would be fine if it worked.</li>
            <li> I think the Tea Tree ingredient makes this shampoo so gentle, but I can&#x27;t be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the effectiveness and reasonable price, I give this product 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> it has a very fresh/minty feel to it, it cools your scalp and body.</li>
            <li> If you download the amazon app it has a feature in the search section of the app where you can scan the barcode of any item at a store and it will tell you how much it costs on amazon</li>
            <li> Really... Devastated.</li>
            <li> Really eliminates Dandruff.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a couple weeks straight</li>
            <li> It also cleans very well and is gentle</li>
            <li> Great product but at $4.98 is not a great deal to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;Local</li>
            <li> It has really helped my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have problem dandruff that is too much for Denorex and, until now, has required a coal tar-based shampoo to subdue.</li>
            <li> I (wish, really)</li>
            <li> I will try a different kind of shampoo instead next time.</li>
            <li> He tends to have a dry scalp and his hair gets pretty dry, but this anti dandruff shampoo and daily scalp treatment cleaned his hair nicely, has a nice fresh scent and it left his hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, peppermint oil is really good for dandruff treatment when diluted and mixed with other oils and in this case,</li>
            <li> You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.somewhat unique hair needs.</li>
            <li> I guess the other one was formulated to fight dandruff more, which I used to have, but that has not been an issue for me for some time now.  </li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]].  </li>
            <li> I tried to switch over from Head and Should to this shampoo but found that this CLEAR shampoo didn&#x27;t take care of my dry scalp issues and it almost seemed like it creates more dandruff?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regularly use this kind of shampoo, but mix it in every now and then if my scalp starts feeling dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but the scent is reminiscent of bubble gum.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I have a dry, flakey scalp; the fact that it was $1 to $1.50 cheaper than the Axe Anti-Dandruff shampoo I normally use also influenced my decision (and free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost per ounce vs. some of the competing products is high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for men whether or not you have dandruff or not as they seem to use ingredients in this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any guy who is looking for a way out of it all.</li>
            <li> If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean &amp; Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> It is the same active ingredient and concentration as another popular anti-dandruff shampoo, [[ASIN:B000GCY2PG</li>
            <li> This particular one was advertised as using special chemicals to help with dry, damaged and dandruff hair.</li>
            <li> Unlikely, but it feels GREAT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for me, it works great.</li>
            <li> I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead.</li>
            <li> This is better than any plain national brand I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> How much of these additives actually make some sort of positive difference for your hair, well, who knows?  </li>
            <li> In fact, this bottle design looks like it was made by them and just put this under a new brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; product each day for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The new formula does nothing.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is mildly fruity, not particularly manly, but it washes out cleanly with no real residual odor, so I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fair to say that while it didn&#x27;t work for him, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for others as it is a medical issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not usually one to put a lot of stock in differences in shampoos, I have to give this one credit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first and only time using it, I was blown away.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they do it, but it smells better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: if you leave the cap open, the residual shampoo along the &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; will dry up and will not &amp;#34;wash away&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li> I had a huge dandruff problem, this thing made it less visible on Day 1.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad alternative to the \\&quot;big boys\\&quot; as in Head &amp; Shoulders, T-Gel, Selsun Blue.....</li>
            <li> (I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than Head &amp; Shoulders, and less medical feeling/smelling than Neutrogena.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why, then, buy CLEAR?  </li>
            <li> (I have oily hair, and Clear cleans it well, and does so</li>
            <li> /&gt;After being fed up and in need to replace my shampoo, I just stumbled upon Clear Men Scalp Therapy and boy</li>
            <li> It really is the only one that has ever worked at removing dandruff.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling too soft.</li>
            <li> One thing I have found, though, is the addition of natural mint may make your scalp tingle.  </li>
            <li> I looked for old stock everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I was surprised at how soft his hair felt without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I was balding really early</li>
            <li> Have used it 4 times so far</li>
            <li> and wow.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I will say that this shampoo feels and looks a bit like Elmer&#x27;s(r) glue when you put a little in your hand; sort of fun!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for men with more serious cases of dandruff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird to describe a shampoo as soft, seeing as it&#x27;s a liquid and therefore would be regardless, but it just feels very very soft.  </li>
            <li> The smell of generic shampoo fruitiness is a little strong and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Bought because I needed to hit 35$ to get free shipping, I have a minor Dandruff problem in the winter due to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and used Dove Men+Care and within a week, the dandruff came back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major dandruff problem, but I do get some flakes every now and then.  </li>
            <li> This Head &amp; shoulders shampoo really controls my dry itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company.</li>
            <li> I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I will provide an update after a couple weeks to a couple months to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is completely gone showing only a scar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I have no doubts that it&#x27;ll fix my dandruff issue.  </li>
            <li> He normally likes to switch it up occasionally because he says the same brand starts to cause buildup on his scalp but not since getting this brand.</li>
            <li> My son used this and liked it, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help his dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who has a dry scalp or drandruff.</li>
            <li> The first and only shampoo that totally eliminated my dry scalp!</li>
            <li> This product is no different to me as it uses the same proven active ingredient and drives the same positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as controlling my flakey, dry scalp - it has been almost 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Some people have a light case of dandruff while others have a more difficult or serious case.</li>
            <li> minimizes dandruff for me... has a neutral smell, don&#x27;t use everyday as in doing so my hair became flat... but does its job pretty well.. have re-purchased this product.</li>
            <li> But it really cut down on my dandruff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer something a little more subtle.  </li>
            <li> This product works just as well, if not better than those shampoos at eliminating dandruff, plus is smells a whole lot nicer and left my hair feeling a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> I use this on large purchases but also have found that I can save a ton on even these small items.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness, I don&#x27;t blame Amazon or the product&#x27;s packaging for the leak, and for the small mess that I had to clean up, things just sometimes happen during shipping, it&#x27;s a risk we all face when we purchase this way</li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large, and the amount needed is small, so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which brings me to my last point, this product completely dried out my scalp and though some (but not all) of the dandruff went away, I was left with a new problem: several dry spots on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son who was having a minor issue with dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Now my issues are only minor, but the Clear Men shampoo resolved the little I had left.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in 2013 and has used about half bottle so far.</li>
            <li> : The bottle is a pain to open and when it is nearly empty it is a pain to get the last bit of shampoo out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Bigger con:</li>
            <li> Because the shelf life is about that long.</li>
            <li> As long as it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps control his dandruff as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> Unlike the myriad of other anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one that has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I moved to dry San Diego and my hairdresser recommended an anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> it didnt dry out my scalp the way h&amp;s did.</li>
            <li> I use this about twice a week and keeps my dry skin at bay</li>
            <li> Same active ingredient as head and shoulders (zinc pyrithione), so</li>
            <li> find this type of shampoo preferable to Denorex or T/Gel, in which the active ingredient is Coal Tar, which smells nastier to me also has potential health</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a single flake.</li>
            <li> My hair also feels different, stronger, and a lot less hair fallouts in the shower.</li>
            <li> , I currently keep about 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula.</li>
            <li> It arrived open and spilled a little</li>
            <li> so only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> I personally never really cared it because it didn&#x27;t cause me any pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it until the bottle is empty, but I finish it and still have dandruff</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of their other formulations, but they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in my opinion, this is just like every other shampoo that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty blind</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the only issue with this product is that a small amount of it leaked out in shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this was supposed to be different from all the other dandruff shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I never had problem with any other product.</li>
            <li> I usually get Head &amp; Shoulders (or equivalent) for my daily shampoo &amp; on a whim, decided to see what Amazon had.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this shampoo is Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%).  </li>
            <li> One bottle typically lasts me four months (showering every other day).  </li>
            <li> I can keep it under control by using a typical Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter feeling shampoo that doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down and rinses away well.</li>
            <li> Btw, when it came there was a slight leak but not a biggie.</li>
            <li> It used to slightly burn your scalp before after applying it, which gave you some feeling that it was working.  </li>
            <li> Lost over half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is slight, which I also like.</li>
            <li> packaging was a little bit nicer but who cares.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is a bit hard on my color.</li>
            <li> it for a few weeks before I threw it away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a heavy scent tho.</li>
            <li> If you leave this shampoo in for a few minutes, you may notice a tingly sensation eminating from your scalp.  </li>
            <li> The scent does subside after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product a few times, and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing this for years.</li>
            <li> I tested this quite a few times.</li>
            <li> I tried H&amp;S before but it never worked as well as this one did and for half the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this intermittently for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle, but it is less irritating.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well with just a small amount of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more flakes, no more itching,</li>
            <li> Of the brands I&#x27;ve tried, this dandruff shampoo is the most like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo, without the usual nasty coal tar or chemical</li>
            <li> Any shampoo that has sulfate in the ingredient list is bad for your hair, because the hair has natural oil and sulfate strips it all off.</li>
            <li> (At least, that&#x27;s been my experience.)  </li>
            <li> When I open the box, I realize that some shampoo has been out and it looks dirty.</li>
            <li> I used to have serious dandruff problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells a little weird though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really, really bad dandruff for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Now, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all my dandruff, but it has reduced it by at least 90%!  </li>
            <li> However, the packaging was poor.</li>
            <li> but it was a poor shipping job.</li>
            <li> My husband works alot and his hair gets dusty.</li>
            <li> (Now there&#x27;s a dramatic jump start for your scalp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for about 2 years after randomly finding it on one of my travels.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does what the description says and always has every time without fail.</li>
            <li> Crazy?</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, but I understand that 1% of the time this happens.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The first and only shampoo that totally eliminated my dry scalp!</li>
            <li> This is good solution for dandruff. I moved to dry San Diego and my hairdresser recommended an anti-dandruff shampoo. This seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quiet a while and it has definitely helped me with dandruff. I would recommend it to everyone. I tried H&amp;S before but it never worked as well as this one did and for half the price! Not a bad deal. Btw, when it came there was a slight leak but not a biggie. They could do a better job at packing it.</li>
            <li> Use it to wash, after 2, 3 days of scalp began to itch. I won&#x27;t buy this product again, also do not recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I used as directed. Smells great, but didn&#x27;t get the job done for me. I&#x27;m not sure how this has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Item arrived this am in perfect condition, am very pleased</li>
            <li> It did not help my dandruff at all!!&lt;br /&gt;Used it for a few weeks before I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works when it comes to my dandruff!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is probably the best I have ever had! It is unbelievably good at keeping the dandruff away! It really is the only one that has ever worked at removing dandruff. I wanted to try something new and used Dove Men+Care and within a week, the dandruff came back. The next day, I used this again, and the dandruff was gone!!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. I chose this shampoo because I&#x27;m a fan of Tea Tree and Mint. Shampoo aroma smells okay, but I was hoping for the invigorating Tea Tree coupled with Mint scent. Also, Tea Tree on the scalp feels absolutely refreshing and this shampoo just feels like normal shampoo- no extra tingles or anything - which would be fine if it worked. Which brings me to my last point, this product completely dried out my scalp and though some (but not all) of the dandruff went away, I was left with a new problem: several dry spots on my scalp. I&#x27;d skip this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I have a dry, flakey scalp; the fact that it was $1 to $1.50 cheaper than the Axe Anti-Dandruff shampoo I normally use also influenced my decision (and free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to say, I&#x27;m not disappointed. This shampoo has a pleasant \\&quot;clean\\&quot; fresh scent that I find agreeable. It lathers up well with just a small amount of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as controlling my flakey, dry scalp - it has been almost 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in my scalp. I think the Tea Tree ingredient makes this shampoo so gentle, but I can&#x27;t be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the effectiveness and reasonable price, I give this product 5 Stars. I hope it works as well for you!</li>
            <li> I love the smell after my husband uses this and it definitely helps control his dandruff as well as other brands. I have even used it a time or two to get a good deep clean on my long hair.</li>
            <li> Same active ingredient as head and shoulders (zinc pyrithione), so if that works for you, this probably will also.  This does not have coal tar (like neutrogena products) or selenium sulfide (like selson blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying different active ingredients and figuring out what works best for you.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have tried all of the over the counter dandruff shampoo and prescription shampoos and Steroid foams. I no longer have Scalp Psoriasis! Who would think that something so affordable would be so effective. My only complaint is it is a bit hard on my color.</li>
            <li> minimizes dandruff for me... has a neutral smell, don&#x27;t use everyday as in doing so my hair became flat... but does its job pretty well.. have re-purchased this product. nice alternative to head and shoulders</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple weeks and they do work, make sure to really use it and not stop using it after you see its clearing up. Good Luck</li>
            <li> everytime i would use it and throughly rincw&#x3D;ed mt hail it would burn my as and made my hair feel greesy</li>
            <li> Definitely the best shampoo for dandruff I&#x27;ve had, helps that its for men so it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling too soft. it has a very fresh/minty feel to it, it cools your scalp and body. just love it</li>
            <li> These are the best prices.  I check walmart, cvs and safeway.  If you download the amazon app it has a feature in the search section of the app where you can scan the barcode of any item at a store and it will tell you how much it costs on amazon so you know if you are getting a good price or not.  I use this on large purchases but also have found that I can save a ton on even these small items.  Paste this link into your browser.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId&#x3D;1000291661</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; shoulders shampoo really controls my dry itchy scalp! It does have a heavy scent tho. I&#x27;d buy it again because my hair stays clean a lot longer, too. I recommend that you buy it!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s cut to the chase:  The active ingredient in this shampoo is Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%).  It is the same active ingredient and concentration as another popular anti-dandruff shampoo, [[ASIN:B000GCY2PG Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]].  If Head &amp; Shoulders works for you, so will CLEAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why, then, buy CLEAR?  It&#x27;s got a whole host of botanical additives including ginseng (who knew your hair could be more ALERT?), tea tree, natural mint (more on this one below), vitamins B5 and E, sunflower, soybean, almond and coconut oils.  Sound delish, but don&#x27;t mistake this for an ice cream topping.  How much of these additives actually make some sort of positive difference for your hair, well, who knows?  One thing I have found, though, is the addition of natural mint may make your scalp tingle.  If you leave this shampoo in for a few minutes, you may notice a tingly sensation eminating from your scalp.  It&#x27;s pretty cool and quite invigorating first thing in the morning.  Does it actually make one&#x27;s hair more lively?  Unlikely, but it feels GREAT.  If you want to spend a little more and get a super shot of tingly scalp check out [[ASIN:B002F34YG6 American Crew Daily Stimulating Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B000F4CXTC American Crew Citrus Mint Cooling Conditioner 33.8oz]].  (Now there&#x27;s a dramatic jump start for your scalp.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the aroma, feel, and dandruff-control effectiveness of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice,  light scent and I like it much better than Head and Shoulders. (Yes, I am a woman and I have used it). My hair was very clean and bouncy. Controlled my mild dandruff very well. My husband has a more moderate case and found this shampoo to be beneficial as well. The bottle is sturdy and the unique design has the bottom  click open for greater control (no water can get in either!). We will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products I would have never given a try except it was sent to me in the Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;Now every one in my family uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how it works but it works good. Scalp never itches and hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> The smell of generic shampoo fruitiness is a little strong and takes getting used to.  But it really cut down on my dandruff!  I use it every other day.  The scent does subside after a few hours.  It IS a clean smell so don&#x27;t worry about smelling gross like dandruff shampoo can smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it for people with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Bought because I needed to hit 35$ to get free shipping, I have a minor Dandruff problem in the winter due to the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does the job, has a very light scent which I enjoyed. I haven&#x27;t seen any Dandruff on my shoulder / itchiness since I used the product. It&#x27;s cheaper than the comparing Dandruff product found in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you leave the cap open, the residual shampoo along the &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; will dry up and will not &amp;#34;wash away&amp;#34; as easily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was definitely not what I was expecting. It gave my scalp a burning sensation and I had to stop using it. Occasionally I would go back to it thinking maybe it was a temporary sensation but no - it kept burning every time I used it. Had to toss it.</li>
            <li> i suffered itchiness and flakiness and lots of -ness for years. i used head and shoulders hoping it would all go away but it never did. then i tried this and within four days there werent and flakes to speak of. it didnt dry out my scalp the way h&amp;s did. i almost wanted to punch myself not getting this sooner.</li>
            <li> This has literally changed my life. To be fair, I used to use Axe anti-dandruff 2 in 1. It was the &amp;#34;life changer&amp;#34;. Then they changed the formula. I was devastated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. Really... Devastated. Not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because for the first 40+ years of life, I had to shampoo my hair every 24 or so hours religiously. If I went 36 hours or more, my hair got dandruff that stayed with me for about 2 weeks. The Axe shampoo changed that. I used it for about 2 years after randomly finding it on one of my travels. Then they changed the formula and it stopped working. I looked for old stock everywhere. I tried a bunch of alternatives. Nothing worked. Then I called the company that makes Axe shampoos. The very nice lady on the phone explained that there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it didn&#x27;t look like the ingredients changed. But she recommended the Clear brand because it was made by the same company. I told her I&#x27;d already tried it, and though I liked it better than most of the alternatives, it wasn&#x27;t the same. So, I continued trying different shampoos and continued hoping to find a stash of old stock somewhere (I actually went straight to the shampoo aisle in every new supermarket/drug store I visited).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that the Clear shampoo I tried was only shampoo and not the shampoo and conditioner. So I picked up a bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out it&#x27;s about the same as the Axe that I had been using before. I&#x27;ve also tried a couple of their other formulations, but they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I currently keep about 2 year&#x27;s stock on hand - just in case they decide to mess with the formula. Why only 2 years? Because the shelf life is about that long. I buy more every few months so that I&#x27;ll always stay a couple years ahead. Crazy? Have I mentioned that this has CHANGED MY LIFE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, judging by the fact that most people haven&#x27;t found this to be &amp;#34;proof of God&#x27;s existence&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to guess that I have somewhat unique hair needs. But for those of you with chronic dandruff who haven&#x27;t found anything else that works, give this a try. You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.somewhat unique hair needs. But for those of you with chronic dandruff who haven&#x27;t found anything else that works, give this a try. You might just end up having to fight me for the last bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans well, and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is large, and the amount needed is small, so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoying mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Sean P. Logue, 2012</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo I have ever used.  I use this about twice a week and keeps my dry skin at bay</li>
            <li> It arrived open and spilled a little but I like the product. I have a sensitive scalp and it has been good.</li>
            <li> This is for my husband.  He loves this shampoo, it helps with his light dandriff and he likes the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; &amp; the scent.</li>
            <li> Really eliminates Dandruff.  I have been using it for over two years once or twice a week depending on the season.  It really controls my dandruff I had for many years.  Smell  and leave hair ok.</li>
            <li> very good , i like the smell of the product. i will buy this one again</li>
            <li> I have used many types of Dandruff shampoos - mostly Head &amp; Shoulders brands or pharmacy store equivalent generics. This product works just as well, if not better than those shampoos at eliminating dandruff, plus is smells a whole lot nicer and left my hair feeling a bit lighter. I&#x27;ve been using this product (and others of the same variety but with different fragrances) for two months, now, and can honestly say that it is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> i like it is very effective for removing dandruff from your face&amp;head.old persons must use it there will be no iteing on your skull</li>
            <li> Although this product smells good, it doesn&#x27;t help the dandruff problem. My son used this and liked it, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help his dandruff problem. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that while it didn&#x27;t work for him, that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for others as it is a medical issue. Some people have a light case of dandruff while others have a more difficult or serious case. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for men with more serious cases of dandruff. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice smelling shampoo, which lathers well (according to my son.)</li>
            <li> I tried to switch over from Head and Should to this shampoo but found that this CLEAR shampoo didn&#x27;t take care of my dry scalp issues and it almost seemed like it creates more dandruff? But even besides that, the shampoo smells good but really didn&#x27;t nourish my hair and would make it frizzy so to each their own but I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am on an anti-greasy hair campaign and this review is not about dandruff or scalp problems.  Instead, I am applauding at how wonderful this shampoo is for folks who suffer from oily hair.  I have gone through different brands of shampoo and discovered that anti-dandruff shampoos seem to work the best against greasy hair.  Unfortunately, no brand (for me) can be used for a prolonged period of time and I have to alternate various bottles between washings.  When I first stumbled upon this, it was like discovering a treasure trove.  The scent is light and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;MEN&#x27;S\\&quot;.  It keeps my hair clean for 3 whopping days which is a miracle.  As a reformed minimalist, this is the one brand I&#x27;m going to stock up on.</li>
            <li> A great affordable antidandruff Shampoo.  One bottle typically lasts me four months (showering every other day).  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Head &amp; Shoulders, but seems to work just as well for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo washes the hair well but does not get rid of dandruff. My dandruff problem increased after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. The bottle is an easy shape to get the shampoo out. I don&#x27;t have drandruff anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little weird though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regularly use this kind of shampoo, but mix it in every now and then if my scalp starts feeling dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your standard dandruff shampoo with Pyrithione Zinc, just like Head &amp; Shoulders. I find this to be an effective treatment for dry/itchy scalp, regardless of whether you actually have dandruff or not. The chemical helps &#x27;normalize&#x27; conditions on your scalp and allows it to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this type of shampoo preferable to Denorex or T/Gel, in which the active ingredient is Coal Tar, which smells nastier to me also has potential health consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product, pretty standard, but priced well and with the added convenience of free shipping through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is better than any plain national brand I&#x27;ve used before. But not near as nice as what you&#x27;ll get wherever you get your hair cut.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son who was having a minor issue with dandruff.  He doesn&#x27;t now.  &#x27;Nuff said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Seriously though, the shampoo is a great consistency - not so runny it runs out your hands while you&#x27;re still trying to put the lid on and get it back on the shower shelf.  It lathers nicely and rinses out well, leaving the hair feeling clean and looking shiny.)</li>
            <li> Works against dandruff just fine, and the scent and cool tingly feeling on my scalp is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a plus, no greasy residue, just a clean scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better shampoos out there, but this one does what it says and accomplishes it at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. However, the packaging was poor. It was tapped shut like someone had used it. It had not been that I could see but it was a poor shipping job.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and he really liked it. He tends to have a dry scalp and his hair gets pretty dry, but this anti dandruff shampoo and daily scalp treatment cleaned his hair nicely, has a nice fresh scent and it left his hair feeling very soft. I ran my fingers through his hair after he used it and I have to say that I was surprised at how soft his hair felt without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a dry scalp or drandruff. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product. So happy I discovered this a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does what the description says and always has every time without fail. Feels nice and refreshing when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff works immediately! My scalp and skin look and feel smooth, moist and richer. I put some lotion on my skin and it locks the moisture in all day.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not usually one to put a lot of stock in differences in shampoos, I have to give this one credit. It cleans very well, and actually smells pretty good. It&#x27;s not some crazy fruit smell of strawberries or the like, but a nice mint. While that&#x27;s not terribly manly itself, it&#x27;s better than most. It&#x27;s a lighter feeling shampoo that doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down and rinses away well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild dandruff. I can keep it under control by using a typical Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) shampoo every other day. This product is no different to me as it uses the same proven active ingredient and drives the same positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This one has a nice/strong minty scent and does create a nice/slight tingle when using. It washes clean and I&#x27;ve had zero flakes while using the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Con: The bottle is a pain to open and when it is nearly empty it is a pain to get the last bit of shampoo out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Bigger con: The cost per ounce vs. some of the competing products is high. Nothing comes close to 40 ounce pump bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders from Costco.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily use shampoo. It has a very light, almost unnoticable, fragrence. I do not believe it works quite as well as Selsun Blue or Head and Shoulders, but it is nicer to use on a daily basis. I would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and I&#x27;ve already bought another bottle.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff or flakiness, but I do have itchiness and hair that breaks off.  After using this for a couple weeks straight I noticed that the itchiness on my scalp stopped.  I also noticed that my hair was no longer breaking off and in fact is stronger and fuller.  I highly recommend this for men whether or not you have dandruff or not as they seem to use ingredients in this that are more appropriate and effective for men.  I often will leave it in my hair for 1-3 minutes as well so that my scalp as an opportunity to asborb it.</li>
            <li> I used to have serious dandruff problems.  Fortunately, those have passed for the most part.  Now my issues are only minor, but the Clear Men shampoo resolved the little I had left.  It&#x27;s kind of weird to describe a shampoo as soft, seeing as it&#x27;s a liquid and therefore would be regardless, but it just feels very very soft.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair any softer, but it&#x27;s pleasant to use.  It also cleans very well and is gentle so it won&#x27;t damage your hair.  (At least, that&#x27;s been my experience.)  The only downside is the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but the scent is reminiscent of bubble gum.  If you like that, you&#x27;re good to go.  I&#x27;d prefer something a little more subtle.  That said, everything is else great.  It&#x27;s a very reasonably-priced, functional, good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes a Shampoo great nor do I care. As long as it gets the job done. This particular one was advertised as using special chemicals to help with dry, damaged and dandruff hair. I suppose this is what Head and Shoulders is designed to do as well. In fact, this bottle design looks like it was made by them and just put this under a new brand. Who knows? To me, this is just a regular Shampoo that gets the hair cleaned. For what I paid (free) it&#x27;s worth it but in my opinion, this is just like every other shampoo that&#x27;s out there. Maybe this is just me but I have to review this and this is my opinion of what I think of the item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I will provide an update after a couple weeks to a couple months to share my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really, really bad dandruff for as long as I can remember. Probably started when I hit puberty (about 8 years ago?). I personally never really cared it because it didn&#x27;t cause me any pain and I&#x27;m pretty blind so I don&#x27;t notice the flakes. I found out I had a dandruff problem from my girlfriend at the time. Anyways, recently, I&#x27;ve been noticing a lot of hair breakage on my forehead. I thought I was balding really early but the lady at the salon said it&#x27;s just breakage probably caused by dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and came upon this product and said why not and bought it. I did modify my shampoo a bit. I had a bottle of peppermint oil lying around and decided to dump some in the shampoo because I noticed there is tea tree oil and other good stuff in there. Not to mention, peppermint oil is really good for dandruff treatment when diluted and mixed with other oils and in this case, shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first and only time using it, I was blown away. My dandruff went from a 10/10 to about 4/10 looking at my scalp two days after use. That&#x27;s a huge improvement. My hair also feels different, stronger, and a lot less hair fallouts in the shower. (I have long hair by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note, this is only from a one time experience. I will bump this up to five stars if this thing continues to do its magic after a month or so. :)</li>
            <li> Wanted an alternate shampoo so the same chemicals and cleaners weren&#x27;t over used.  Smells good and&lt;br /&gt;works well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product but at $4.98 is not a great deal to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;Local 99cents store has the same item for $2.99</li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviewers used this for their scalp psoriasis or sebboria dermatitis so I though I would give it a shot.  Have used it 4 times so far and wow.  It has really helped my scalp.  I had one batch psoriasis patch on my head and it is completely gone showing only a scar.  I have tried so many prescription steroid medications by my dermatologist that I have been scared to keep using so this is a God send.  I would highly recommend it if you have any kind of irritation on your scalp.  I never had dandruff breakouts on my scalp and this has helped immensely because of the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product a few times, and it it feels really good on my scalp and leaves a good scent in my hair. So it gets the job done and I&#x27;m satisfied. Although now I&#x27; am trying to grow my hair longer, so I would rather buy a shampoo that&#x27;s more appropriate for hair growth.</li>
            <li> It simply did not work for my boyfriend. It was very cheap so I wanted to give it a try but in the end I had to throw it and went back to Nizoral.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. He normally is a buy whatever kind of guy, but after getting him this 1 time, he always asks for more of this specific brand when he runs out. He says his head has never felt so good. He normally likes to switch it up occasionally because he says the same brand starts to cause buildup on his scalp but not since getting this brand.</li>
            <li> Unlike the myriad of other anti-dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, this is the only one that has made a difference.  Now, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all my dandruff, but it has reduced it by at least 90%!  It always works great on my beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; product each day for about two weeks.  Before using this product, I used one very similar to it for about 3 weeks: [[ASIN:B007JT7AEY CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean &amp; Refresh, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]].  Honestly, I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.  I guess the other one was formulated to fight dandruff more, which I used to have, but that has not been an issue for me for some time now.  Before using the \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; products, I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice design for the bottle; dispenses cleanly without leaving a mess on the bottle (H&amp;S can clump up over time, and their caps are not as easy to use as the Clear product)&lt;br /&gt;- Smells clean, not too strong (H&amp;S has an OK smell to it too in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;- cleans well (I have oily hair, and Clear cleans it well, and does so quickly)&lt;br /&gt;- lathers up nicely! (I&#x27;d say it lathers up better than H&amp;S)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- the only issue with this product is that a small amount of it leaked out in shipping.  That was not the product&#x27;s fault, but be aware that buying a liquid anything, and having it shipped to you, might leak.  In all fairness, I don&#x27;t blame Amazon or the product&#x27;s packaging for the leak, and for the small mess that I had to clean up, things just sometimes happen during shipping, it&#x27;s a risk we all face when we purchase this way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting:&lt;br /&gt;- I will say that this shampoo feels and looks a bit like Elmer&#x27;s(r) glue when you put a little in your hand; sort of fun!</li>
            <li> Better than Head &amp; Shoulders, and less medical feeling/smelling than Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;Feels good, smells good, the hair behaves nicely after the wash.&lt;br /&gt;What more could one ask for?...</li>
            <li> My son has a problem with dandruff so I thought his shampoo would be good for him. Great smell, lathers up great, but all it did was make his scalp itch, so he discontinued use. May be too powerful for him. Good luck, it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this was supposed to be different from all the other dandruff shampoos out there. It smelled the same, works the same. packaging was a little bit nicer but who cares.</li>
            <li> very good shampoo deep cleaning. I say it is excellent and is achieved at a very good and full of expectation deep cleansing of the scalp, eliminates the itching and discomfort of dirty hair, leaving it softer and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos leave me with sores on my head. Most zinc shampoos get rid of those but still leave an itch feeling. This shampoo results in neither. Lathers nicely and does the job. The fragrance is mildly fruity, not particularly manly, but it washes out cleanly with no real residual odor, so I&#x27;m not going to complain. Overall best shampoo I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered with dandruff for years, I can honestly say that I have tried every product out there. I have tried both OTC and prescription products. While some of them worded well, nothing was complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having numerous failures, I finally switched to Head and Shoulder&#x27;s. While this worked most of the time, it didn&#x27;t help with the itching and scratching. Instead I was left with the occasional flake and annoyance. So I switched over to Dial&#x27;s 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo. While that got rid of most of the itching, it left more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being fed up and in need to replace my shampoo, I just stumbled upon Clear Men Scalp Therapy and boy may I say it works wonders. I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for me, it works great. I have been using it for 6 months now and have not seen 1 flake at all. My girlfriend hasn&#x27;t noticed any either. More importantly for me, though, is that the itching is gone, almost instantly. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing this for years. I highly recommend this to any guy who is looking for a way out of it all. No more flakes, no more itching, just pure clean and refreshed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an added bonus, it has a great smell that lasts (my girlfriend loves the smell hours later). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thought I would try a different dandruff shampoo.  The price was very good on this one, and it works great.  It is very rich so only takes a little.  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major dandruff problem, but I do get some flakes every now and then.  I&#x27;ve tried Head and Shoulders, Selsun Blue and have a bottle of Neutrogena T/Gel at present.  Of the brands I&#x27;ve tried, this dandruff shampoo is the most like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo, without the usual nasty coal tar or chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work well and I think the price is pretty reasonable.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has a flake issure. It is a nice shampoo, rich, lots of lather. But after using it for a month, he still has flakes. So for us, it is a nice way to wash the hair, just doesn&#x27;t touch the flakes.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-dandruff shampoo I have ever used. I recommend it without reservation to all with a similar malady.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  I had a huge dandruff problem, this thing made it less visible on Day 1.  You can literally feel your scalp reacting to the shampoo when you put it on.  I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but I have no doubts that it&#x27;ll fix my dandruff issue.  I&#x27;ll update this review after a couple of weeks, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  Update: I think they changed the formula and ruined it.  It used to slightly burn your scalp before after applying it, which gave you some feeling that it was working.  The new formula does nothing.  It has some affect on dandruff but don&#x27;t think it[s good as before.  Reduced from 5 stars to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Okay let me educate you about hair. Any shampoo that has sulfate in the ingredient list is bad for your hair, because the hair has natural oil and sulfate strips it all off. My husband works alot and his hair gets dusty. He switched to my shampoo i get it from sally&#x27;s beauty supply</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in 2013 and has used about half bottle so far. Every time I used this, my scalp became inflamed. I tested this quite a few times. No exception. I never had problem with any other product. I hope this is the only case for me.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent natural alternative to a healthy scalp. Great natural ingredients. It does as advertised with regular use.</li>
            <li> I have problem dandruff that is too much for Denorex and, until now, has required a coal tar-based shampoo to subdue. I&#x27;ve been using Clear Men Scalp Therapy for about a month now and my scalp is healthier and more dandruff free than anytime I can remember. It has a pleasant scent and leaves my hair and scalp feeling great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice at first. It made my hair really soft and manageable. My hair used to stand up. Now my hair is softer to touch and manageable and does not stand up too much after using it for a few times.</li>
            <li> I was using a different product and my scalp was irritated, red, and flaky. This felt like a milder, calming version that cut back on those symptoms. There is a slight tingle, but it is less irritating. The smell is also nice which is a huge plus. If you have an irritated scalp I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I open the box, I realize that some shampoo has been out and it looks dirty. I (wish, really) this is because of UPS...</li>
            <li> The container is pretty tall and holds a lot of shampoo. It&#x27;s not a bad alternative to the \\&quot;big boys\\&quot; as in Head &amp; Shoulders, T-Gel, Selsun Blue.....</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice, but I have been using it for almost a month now and I still have an itchy scalp and dandruff. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the bottle is empty, but I finish it and still have dandruff I will try a different kind of shampoo instead next time.</li>
            <li> Product came opened within the bag. Lost over half of the bottle. Not too big of an issue for a $5 item though. A bit disappointed, but I understand that 1% of the time this happens.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  I never thought he would switch from his Head and Shoulders but after going through a bottle he was hooked.  Nice smell and does a good job cleaning without being drying to his scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t like the fragrance, but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I ever used because it perfectly handled my dandruff issue and made my hair clean and smooth. The fragrance is slight, which I also like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this intermittently for the past few months.  It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I tried Clear Men Scalp Therapy shampoo and the only thing that would have made it perfect is if it came with conditioner in one (2 capped) packagae!  I think it worked well as a dandruff shampoo, but it lathers up better and smells alot better than some of the other ones i have tried. Id definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used so many anti dandruff shampoo and none seem to work or work for about a year and boom dandruff back. This shampoo is awesome. I like the smell and it has been more than a year. I don&#x27;t see a single flake.</li>
            <li> I usually get Head &amp; Shoulders (or equivalent) for my daily shampoo &amp; on a whim, decided to see what Amazon had. I found this and they offered it on a &#x27;subscription&#x27; basis. I did a little research and since they&#x27;ll let you skip a month if you don&#x27;t need more, it was great to save an extra buck on an already good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shampoo, it works and it smells fantastic - my wife even likes it. Not sure how they do it, but it smells better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff all my life. I&#x27;ve used a number of products, and you dandruff-people know which ones.  This one is working well, but it has taken about a month to see the differences.  For the money and functionality, this is worth a try on your part.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, scalp feels refreshed, but the smell is not fantastic, seems kind of cheap and medicine-y. For the price, however, it&#x27;s not bad. High end shampoos will smell better.</li>
