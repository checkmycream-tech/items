            <li>My 5 and 3 year old granddaughters are going to love these when they find them in their Christmas stockings.</li>
            <li>Lace came off at first day of wearing it.i wonder how other reviewers giving these headbands good reviews.</li>
            <li>so these really were a special first hair accessory.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I cannot tell more about it since it&#x27;s my daughter who wears it, lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes exactly how it is on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>She is 5 and loves dressing up and looking pretty.</li>
            <li>They fit both my 3 and 6 year old...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more from Bundle Monster in the future for headbands. :)</li>
            <li>look so pretty in them</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty but not practical.</li>
            <li>And they are just so pretty.</li>
            <li>Also these ship extremely fast and my past experience with this seller has been great customer service and fast shipping each time.</li>
            <li>She just needs to take it off when in the monkey bars :)</li>
            <li>(she does have a large head for a toddler)</li>
            <li>They actually fit me better than most adult headbands, but for an adult- I have a very small head (X-Small motorcycle helmet, wish I had the hips to match).  </li>
            <li>Very well made and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li>They are made very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my daughter is very</li>
            <li>Fast shipping thanks.</li>
            <li>Very please with the quality and style.</li>
            <li>I would think most 4 year old&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t have an issue with them slipping off.</li>
            <li>only thing is that we didn&#x27;t like the third on the picture,the bow has skulls on it.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that,very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>They are high quality.  </li>
            <li>These are really precious headbands for any little girl.</li>
            <li>although my little missy takes them off in 2 minutes, I just love the way they look.</li>
            <li>So far they have been very durable with no issues.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on my two-year old&#x27;s head -- which for sizing purposes is slightly small on the circumference chart -- but are flexible enough that they also fit on my head (are just short behind my ears), so I see them being useful for as long as they remain unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>colorful striped and poka dot bow on it with a yellow button in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly but even though the package had FRAGILE on it the box the headbands were in was completely smashed.</li>
            <li>Just opened these because they were a birthday gift for my two year old who loves bows.</li>
            <li>it is stays on my 5 year old</li>
            <li>Bought these for my four year old niece.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 3 year old niece.  </li>
            <li>My 3 yr old loves them.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered these, I didn&#x27;t read carefully and thought the designs on them could come off and I could clip something else onto the headbands.</li>
            <li>they will fit approximately a 9 month old as well as a 2 year old.</li>
            <li>The headbands were a Christmas present for our 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I can definitely use these at almost any occasion for my 10 month old and she can still grow into them</li>
            <li>These were a big hit with my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Not a single bow has fell off yet.</li>
            <li>I can find one of these to go with anything but bold red, blue or green.  </li>
            <li>and now these little pretty accessories were added to my fashionista&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li>Thinner hot pink band with a zebra print and hot pink bow with a plastic black and crystal crown in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band</li>
            <li>Considering ordering the other color set if these hold up decently.</li>
            <li>3:  Slightly thicker black band with a white bow with black skulls on it (kind of punk rocker style</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Unfortunately I cannot tell more about it since it&#x27;s my daughter who wears it, lol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes exactly how it is on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> She is 5 and loves dressing up and looking pretty.</li>
            <li> They fit both my 3 and 6 year old...</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more from Bundle Monster in the future for headbands. :)</li>
            <li> look so pretty in them</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty but not practical.</li>
            <li> And they are just so pretty.</li>
            <li> Also these ship extremely fast and my past experience with this seller has been great customer service and fast shipping each time.</li>
            <li> She just needs to take it off when in the monkey bars :)</li>
            <li> (she does have a large head for a toddler)</li>
            <li> They actually fit me better than most adult headbands, but for an adult- I have a very small head (X-Small motorcycle helmet, wish I had the hips to match).  </li>
            <li> Very well made and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> They are made very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and my daughter is very</li>
            <li> Fast shipping thanks.</li>
            <li> Very please with the quality and style.</li>
            <li> I would think most 4 year old&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t have an issue with them slipping off.</li>
            <li> only thing is that we didn&#x27;t like the third on the picture,the bow has skulls on it.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that,very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They are high quality.  </li>
            <li> These are really precious headbands for any little girl.</li>
            <li> although my little missy takes them off in 2 minutes, I just love the way they look.</li>
            <li> So far they have been very durable with no issues.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my two-year old&#x27;s head -- which for sizing purposes is slightly small on the circumference chart -- but are flexible enough that they also fit on my head (are just short behind my ears), so I see them being useful for as long as they remain unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> colorful striped and poka dot bow on it with a yellow button in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly but even though the package had FRAGILE on it the box the headbands were in was completely smashed.</li>
            <li> Just opened these because they were a birthday gift for my two year old who loves bows.</li>
            <li> it is stays on my 5 year old</li>
            <li> Bought these for my four year old niece.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 3 year old niece.  </li>
            <li> My 3 yr old loves them.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these, I didn&#x27;t read carefully and thought the designs on them could come off and I could clip something else onto the headbands.</li>
            <li> they will fit approximately a 9 month old as well as a 2 year old.</li>
            <li> The headbands were a Christmas present for our 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I can definitely use these at almost any occasion for my 10 month old and she can still grow into them</li>
            <li> These were a big hit with my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Not a single bow has fell off yet.</li>
            <li> I can find one of these to go with anything but bold red, blue or green.  </li>
            <li> and now these little pretty accessories were added to my fashionista&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> Thinner hot pink band with a zebra print and hot pink bow with a plastic black and crystal crown in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band</li>
            <li> Considering ordering the other color set if these hold up decently.</li>
            <li> 3:  Slightly thicker black band with a white bow with black skulls on it (kind of punk rocker style</li>
            <li> the bows attached are rather large and would overwhelm a small child&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> Little bigger for my1 year old</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to add a little hair style to their little girls hair.</li>
            <li> They are not too big or too small as far the bow part of them.</li>
            <li> Shes a small 4 year old (28lb) and they seem to be a bit loose</li>
            <li> , they are about half the price of a comparable headband at a big box store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the others were super expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Band 6:  Slightly thicker pink band with a white, pink, and brown bow.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little bit big for her 18-month-old head.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, the majority of toddler girls&#x27; clothes are pink and something.  </li>
            <li> She wears a different one everyday to school.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s brown and pink.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to offer these and in other colors besides pink as all of these contain pink in them.</li>
            <li> A bands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Band 1:  Slightly thicker in width with a brown and pink zig-zag pattern band, with a brown and pink giraffe print</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t just come unglued like some other brands have done.</li>
            <li> The bows aren&#x27;t too big or too small.  </li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t take these off like she does her other one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> She is also almost one year old and sometimes it is hard to find headbands for the little ones</li>
            <li> These come in common color combinations such as pink and brown, pink and black, pink and green.  </li>
            <li> only reason I gave them four stars and not five is because the designs are slightly hard to see online, even when you zoom in, and I didn&#x27;t realize that package</li>
            <li> One of the headbands fell apart after a few uses, but I have a rough child.  </li>
            <li> 5:  Slightly thicker green and pink band with a green and pink bow with ladybugs on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside is that after about a month they don&#x27;t hold as well, they slip when my daughter tilts her head backwards or bends down.</li>
            <li> it keeps slip down from my daughter&#x27;s head and doesn&#x27;t hold her hair well.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s typically what we experience anyhow.</li>
            <li> I bought their infant headbands previously</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and a half</li>
            <li> They have a little bit of stretch to them, but return to their shape to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> they are so slightly heavy and silky</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone with little girls!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cute .. My daughter loved them all.</li>
            <li> Value for the product was great. The designs on the headbands very cute. Fit kind of loose on my daughters head but otherwise, great!</li>
            <li> Really cute, my niece loves them</li>
            <li> I love these bands, my toddler doesn&#x27;t but she will at some point, I&#x27;m sure.  They are high quality.  The materials are very nice and the flowers and bows are perfectly crafted.  Hat&#x27;s off to the folks who have the skill to make these things.  They&#x27;re a little bit big for her 18-month-old head.  They actually fit me better than most adult headbands, but for an adult- I have a very small head (X-Small motorcycle helmet, wish I had the hips to match).  I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These headbands are very very cute.  While they have patterns I&#x27;ve found them fairly easy to match to most my daughter&#x27;s outfits.  These come in common color combinations such as pink and brown, pink and black, pink and green.  I can find one of these to go with anything but bold red, blue or green.  Let&#x27;s face it, the majority of toddler girls&#x27; clothes are pink and something.  I would like some of these head bands based on primary colors at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bands themselves are top-notch.  They are of 2 thicknesses.  My toddler has neither been able to bend nor break either size.  They have a little bit of stretch to them, but return to their shape to stay in place.  If only I could get my daughter to leave them on.  One of these days.</li>
            <li> Very cute- wished my daughter would keep it in her hair! Shes a small 4 year old (28lb) and they seem to be a bit loose but that&#x27;s typically what we experience anyhow. I would think most 4 year old&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t have an issue with them slipping off.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter liked these.</li>
            <li> Great value, all colors for various outfits. Great buy.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is happy with those head pieces wearing each day different one to the kindergarten.</li>
            <li> It is a Cheap quality headband. Lace came off at first day of wearing it.i wonder how other reviewers giving these headbands good reviews. I m just returning this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter really liked the headbands! She wears a different one everyday to school. The downside is that after about a month they don&#x27;t hold as well, they slip when my daughter tilts her head backwards or bends down. She just needs to take it off when in the monkey bars :)</li>
            <li> Just opened these because they were a birthday gift for my two year old who loves bows. THEY ARE SOO CUTE!  I am amazed at the quality and how sturdy they are. LOVE the designs and they fit her amazingly well (she does have a large head for a toddler) some bows easily slide off but these stay on all day. Could not be happier with this product and cannot beat the price either!</li>
            <li> These headbands are great for not only toddlers but young girls as well.  Colorful and creative.  Easy to wear and lots of fun to select.</li>
            <li> Love them. Very cute. Little bigger for my1 year old but she will be able to wear them soon!</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous. Very well made and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li> Lovely !&lt;br /&gt; I like these hair hoop. They are made very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like every details in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend you buy them!</li>
            <li> They are so cute! I felt the quality was great and my daughter loves them. She&#x27;s 2yrs. and is just starting to get hair so these really were a special first hair accessory. I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty set of hairbands.Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;And it is stays on my 5 year old had,the size is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Comes exactly how it is on the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that we didn&#x27;t like the third on the picture,the bow has skulls on it.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that,very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> They are great! My daughter loves!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 7 (almost 8 y/o) and she LOVES them. They fit perfectly, and they are all super adorable and well made. :)</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing this item, look great and my daughter is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very vivid and this articles is very good quality</li>
            <li> One of the headbands fell apart after a few uses, but I have a rough child.  They look great otherwise.</li>
            <li> super cute, excellent material detail and color. However with that said they do not stay in the hair bc they are so slightly heavy and silky</li>
            <li> Completely adorable and fit a 5 year old&#x27;s head perfectly.  She loved them, and said they were comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!My daughter is very happy, she love all of them. Fast shipping thanks.</li>
            <li> These headbands are good as expected. Unfortunately I cannot tell more about it since it&#x27;s my daughter who wears it, lol.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my four year old niece. She loved them and they fit her perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very nice gift for baby</li>
            <li> Very cute and great quality! My daughter is just going to love them!!!</li>
            <li> These are really precious headbands for any little girl. My daughter has thick curly hair and they fit her beautifully. She is also almost one year old and sometimes it is hard to find headbands for the little ones but these do the job. They are not too big or too small as far the bow part of them. They are strong and sturdy and I say this because she has pulled them off her head a time or two and they didn&#x27;t just come unglued like some other brands have done. I hope they continue to offer these and in other colors besides pink as all of these contain pink in them. I thought the brown animal print one was brown and white but it&#x27;s brown and pink. Lol! Not a fan of the pink but definitely of the superb quality of these items. Also these ship extremely fast and my past experience with this seller has been great customer service and fast shipping each time. 8)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are all cute and fit my four-year-old granddaughter just fine. With the selection of colors, I can find one to match most anything she wears.</li>
            <li> All of them broke within 1 or 2 time use</li>
            <li> They are super cute. After a year of having them, wearing them occasionally, the ribbon started unraveling off of the plastic. I still may buy again.</li>
            <li> very good quality and love the colors.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves pretty things for her hair and these certainly fit the bill.  She constantly has one of them in her hair.</li>
            <li> Very cute headbands. My daughter fell in love with them, she even wants to wear them to bed. She is 5 and loves dressing up and looking pretty. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants to add a little hair style to their little girls hair.</li>
            <li> i love bundle monster and everything they make! I bought their infant headbands previously and now these little pretty accessories were added to my fashionista&#x27;s collection. they will fit approximately a 9 month old as well as a 2 year old. very well made, beautiful colors, awesome ribbons! MIUST HAVE! although my little missy takes them off in 2 minutes, I just love the way they look. If that makes any sense :)</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my daughters! They fit both my 3 and 6 year old...they are great quality love them!</li>
            <li> Very cute, made very well!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 3 year old niece.  She LOVED them!  They are made so well.  Very please with the quality and style.</li>
            <li> The headbands were a Christmas present for our 4 year old daughter. She loved them. So far they have been very durable with no issues. The quality of the headbands is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous. My girl loves them.</li>
            <li> These headbands have a nice color selection. My 3 yr old loves them. They have held up well through months of wear. Great value!</li>
            <li> I was concerned when I bought these because I assumed they might not be good quality. To my surprise, they are very well made and are adorable.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these, I didn&#x27;t read carefully and thought the designs on them could come off and I could clip something else onto the headbands. When I received the headbands, I still loved them even if the designs didn&#x27;t come off. My favorite one is the skull one. I can definitely use these at almost any occasion for my 10 month old and she can still grow into them so they&#x27;ll last awhile so they&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of them. I will definitely be ordering more from Bundle Monster in the future for headbands. :)</li>
            <li> These are so cute i love them so so so much very convenient i match them with numerous outfits and my lil girl look so pretty in them</li>
            <li> My 5 and 3 year old granddaughters are going to love these when they find them in their Christmas stockings. I&#x27;ll send pictures!</li>
            <li> These were a big hit with my 5 year old granddaughter. They are so colorful and the quality is excellent. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a variety of headbands. The product arrived quickly but even though the package had FRAGILE on it the box the headbands were in was completely smashed. I had to remove them and put them in something different to wrap them. These probably should have been shipped in a box and not a padded envelope.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty but not practical. it keeps slip down from my daughter&#x27;s head and doesn&#x27;t hold her hair well.</li>
            <li> These fit my 2.5 year-old&#x27;s head perfectly and are absolutely adorable!  The bows aren&#x27;t too big or too small.  We LOVE them!</li>
            <li> Beautiful , Never really encountered any problems buying</li>
            <li> The items arrived. Well packaged. Liked them very much! My girls are not toddlers, but this would fit them well.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and a half and these look adorable on her. They fit well and she doesn&#x27;t take these off like she does her other one&#x27;s. I recommend these to anyone with little girls!</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old daughter loves wearing this and they have made it through the day and being smashed in a backpack, which is more than I can say for a lot of headbands. And they are just so pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought these headbands for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she loves them. Not a single bow has fell off yet.</li>
            <li> This set of headbands comes with a good variety of styles and colors.  They&#x27;re very colorful, well made and seem comfortable on my daughter&#x27;s head.  I would recommend them for toddlers as opposed to infants-- the bows attached are rather large and would overwhelm a small child&#x27;s head.  Very fun purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the digest headbands ever. I am more excited than my 6y old. I tried everyone on and they are adorable. Some are lager than others. Wonderful mix.</li>
            <li> These headbands have adorable designs and are well-made.  They fit perfectly on my two-year old&#x27;s head -- which for sizing purposes is slightly small on the circumference chart -- but are flexible enough that they also fit on my head (are just short behind my ears), so I see them being useful for as long as they remain unbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, $2.50 a band when I purchased them, they are about half the price of a comparable headband at a big box store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave them four stars and not five is because the designs are slightly hard to see online, even when you zoom in, and I didn&#x27;t realize that package A included a band with skulls on it (which of course is now my daughter&#x27;s favorite!).  In case anyone else is wondering, here is a description of the package A bands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Band 1:  Slightly thicker in width with a brown and pink zig-zag pattern band, with a brown and pink giraffe print bow.&lt;br /&gt;Band 2:  Thinner hot pink band with a zebra print and hot pink bow with a plastic black and crystal crown in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band 3:  Slightly thicker black band with a white bow with black skulls on it (kind of punk rocker style I guess)&lt;br /&gt;Band 4:  Thinner bright yellow band with colorful striped and poka dot bow on it with a yellow button in the center.&lt;br /&gt;Band 5:  Slightly thicker green and pink band with a green and pink bow with ladybugs on it.&lt;br /&gt;Band 6:  Slightly thicker pink band with a white, pink, and brown bow.  The white part of the bow has ice cream cones on it and the brown part is a brown giraffe print.</li>
            <li> very nice quality for the price, very colerful and classy.  All the others were super expensive.  Wish I could get more.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these headbands, can&#x27;t stop trying them all, very well made, can&#x27;t beat the price, really good deal</li>
            <li> I bought these for my niece, they are ADORABLE!  I can&#x27;t wait to see these on her, she&#x27;s going to love them!</li>
            <li> Great quality and selection - my 2 1/2 year old loves them!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. Really cute and came exactly as described. Considering ordering the other color set if these hold up decently.</li>
