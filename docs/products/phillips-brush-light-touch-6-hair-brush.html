            <li>FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>It seems very nicely made, too.  </li>
            <li>Many brushes come apart or break when you use them on tangled hair, not this brush, it is excellent.  </li>

            <li>AND WE LOVED THESE BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Phillips Light touch is the best hair brush you&#x27;ll ever had.</li>
            <li>Everyone that has received one has loved it.  </li>
            <li>nice brush works good.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush almost exactly 2 years ago and it is still the very best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush ever!</li>
            <li>I bought one from the salon immediately, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>You will be glad you bought it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this brush works great.  </li>
            <li>looks and feels like the most durable, most pleasant and most intelligently designed hair brush</li>
            <li>THIS BRUSH IS AMAZING to comb out or thru tangles w/o PAIN...</li>
            <li>We received them yesterday and they are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>So I bought him his own.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I did buy a wonderful boars hair brush but also decided to give the Phillips a try since it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve found a decent brush.  </li>
            <li>Best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best brush I have ever used - I have purchased a variety of brushes (for a LOT more money) and none have been any better than this Phillips brush.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my fine hair and now I have to have one!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t create static in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have given many for gifts.</li>
            <li>and it didnt take any more than a stroke to each state of my hair to figure this out.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, as you brush hair it feel like you are massaging your head</li>
            <li>I could never find a better hairbrush.    </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll never have to find a hair brush better than the Light Touch 6, because I don&#x27;t think it exists!</li>
            <li>I love this brush but couldn&#x27;t find a store that carries it</li>
            <li>The Phillips Light Touch 6 Hair Brush is kind to my hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it and with every brush stroke my hair ended up with so much static</li>
            <li>one of the better ones I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li>I have traveled to many countries, many hotels and many hairdressing salons.</li>
            <li>WE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, does not pull or hurt when brushing.  </li>
            <li>, we both love this brush, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Love this brush for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>It does produce some static.</li>
            <li>I also like it better than a Fuller boards hair bristle brush that I also have.  </li>
            <li>If this brush worked so brilliantly on my long tangled hair w/o any pain, no breaking off my hair, it will be the best thing you can have for any hair types.</li>
            <li>Owned one years ago and was excited to find it again at Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for great new hair products.  </li>
            <li>I love the Phillips Light touch.  </li>
            <li>so you can easily toss it in a bag when you&#x27;re traveling.  </li>
            <li>but I must admit that this is the most powerful brush a person can ever get a hold of for sure.</li>
            <li>deck catches the hair easily</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li>It massages the scalp, doesn&#x27;t tear my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Phillips Light Touch 8 after reading these reviews.  </li>
            <li>Recently, my husband started using it and decided it was great too.</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>They let me try their Phillips Light Touch 6.    </li>
            <li>The smaller version is just as great for the handbag.    </li>
            <li>I ordered the Phillips light touch brush.  </li>
            <li>This is our second one, great when putting hair up in the pony</li>
            <li>It is a very nice brush but too big and not antistatic...and not the one I was looking for....</li>
            <li>I have fairly long, fine hair, but a lot of it and this brush is great.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m another person who had been holding on to a great, really old brush because she couldn&#x27;t find anything decent to replace it.</li>
            <li>Not even a full stroke because the brush would not move through my hair.</li>
            <li>It is gentle too and well made, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>My girls have fine hair and very snarly.</li>
            <li>Works great for little girls tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair a little softer though, which is nice, but sometimes leaves a bit of static.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to unbox an easy to clean brush with soft flexible pins that wouldn&#x27;t snag my ends.</li>
            <li>Finally, I was in a salon one day, and I asked whether they had any hairbrushes they really liked.  </li>
            <li>The bristles penetrate my hair easily, are neither too stiff nor too flexible, they&#x27;re not sharp against my scalp, don&#x27;t cause my hair to clump or frizz, the size and weight is excellent in the hand, the contour of the bristle bed lays naturally against my scalp...</li>
            <li>My original I bought many years ago (at least 10, but it seams more like 20).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a Phillips Light Touch #1 and was looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li>smooth and great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Handle is exceptionally ergonomic, and the bristles are strong enough to go through your hair, but gentle enough to not break it.  </li>
            <li>This brush is super gentle on both your scalp and hair, my hair is also rather thick now, and it still does a great job with brushing.</li>
            <li>If you want a great, long lasting brush, then you should get this one!</li>
            <li>I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the way this brush feels and for people with short hair like my boyfriend</li>
            <li>this is my second since i wore the first one out after many years.</li>
            <li>This brush goes deep and lifts unlike most.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THREE MORE TO KEEP IN OUR PLACES.  </li>
            <li>Well, maybe just more of the same, like I did!!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I never had such a legendary product that preserves that positive smile knowing it could do miracles as long as you have some hair left naturally ! ! !</li>
            <li>I have super thick, fine hair, and still the basic stiff bristle brush works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very usable, and they require no perfect skill to make them work very good on the hair.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m going to order a couple of the purse size models</li>
            <li>This brush would not even get to the very ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>(my tangles were to a severe stage from illness and being in bed so much.</li>
            <li>Excelent quality and really pleacent to brush my hair.</li>
            <li>Well made and gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer than any I saw in a store.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my grandkids hair.</li>
            <li>I am sure its manly for men to wear pink but draw the line here.</li>
            <li>and I use it as much as him</li>
            <li>I have never liked these types of brushes, but the reviews sounded so good</li>
            <li>This one is nice, but doesn&#x27;t quite reach through all my hair, I have to brush it at different angles to get all my hair brushed.</li>
            <li>Have been ordering them for Years, nice and firm, used to see them in 4 colors.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and it is comfortable on the scalp and gentle getting the tangles out.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product and will never buy any other hair brush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, the whole family uses it everyday.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li>It has been in daily use, been washed several times, and still hasn&#x27;t lost any of the bristle tips, still is just as it was when new, and I love how well it brushes my hair</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every buy another one, I have thick long hair, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I love this brush and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, I ordered a solid wood, antistatic small hairbrush \\&quot;Florence Billon\\&quot; and my granddaughter loved it.  </li>
            <li>Simply can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in place of an old Denman Classic that I had for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several (for my kids too), the first one was bought 3 years ago, looking as the new one</li>
            <li>The Phillips brush is very nearly as good as my old brush, being gentle to the hair (I have long hair several inches below the shoulder) and firm to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I keep the small one in my car now, and I love them both.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store anymore, I even bought it in the smaller size too.</li>
            <li>The first hairbrush I&#x27;ve used in 27 years that exceeded that strange old clunker my dad had gotten me!  </li>
            <li>Overall, fantastic product given if your hair is not very thick and coarse where the relatively soft bristle may not penetrate properly.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was worried that the bristles would be too soft to get through my hair --</li>
            <li>My old brush was over 30 years old.</li>
            <li>Even missing several rows of bristles on its leading edge it was far better than any of the brushes that I tried from time to time and discarded.</li>
            <li>I received a Phillip&#x27;s hair brush when I was just 10 years old.</li>
            <li>no issues so far.</li>
            <li>This brush comes closest to the firmness and bristle spacing of my 30-year old nylon bristle brush...</li>
            <li>this brush far exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li>This brush goes through my hair easily with very little snarling, even when I have just awakened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the close bristle spacing of a boar&#x27;s hair brush but about 50% stiffer... which if you&#x27;ve got a decent head of hair is necessary.</li>
            <li>I have long (past bra line) hair that is medium bodied (my hairdresser says I have a lot of very fine hair).  </li>
            <li>My wife use it to brush my daugther long hair, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought the small one for my Grand Daughter, but she wanted the same size as mine, so I bought the larger one for her.</li>
            <li>I have used that brush until last month, I am now 24 years old!</li>
            <li>About 3 months ago, my son carried that funky old hairbrush to the public pool and lost it.  </li>
            <li>ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM NEAR MEXICO CITY , MEXICO AND PAID $25.00 FOR EACH</li>
            <li>If you bend the brush by pushing it too long against something, it will return to normal after couple days without pressure.</li>
            <li>hard to find brushes that feel good in thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same as the Light Touch 6, except that the head is a little longer and the bristles are spaced a little farther apart.  </li>
            <li>It goes through my long hair extremely easy whether it&#x27;s wet or dry and is stiff enough to reach my scalp.  </li>

            <li> I could never find a better hairbrush.    </li>
            <li> Hopefully, I&#x27;ll never have to find a hair brush better than the Light Touch 6, because I don&#x27;t think it exists!</li>
            <li> I love this brush but couldn&#x27;t find a store that carries it</li>
            <li> The Phillips Light Touch 6 Hair Brush is kind to my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it and with every brush stroke my hair ended up with so much static</li>
            <li> one of the better ones I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li> I have traveled to many countries, many hotels and many hairdressing salons.</li>
            <li> WE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, does not pull or hurt when brushing.  </li>
            <li> , we both love this brush, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> It does produce some static.</li>
            <li> I also like it better than a Fuller boards hair bristle brush that I also have.  </li>
            <li> If this brush worked so brilliantly on my long tangled hair w/o any pain, no breaking off my hair, it will be the best thing you can have for any hair types.</li>
            <li> Owned one years ago and was excited to find it again at Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for great new hair products.  </li>
            <li> I love the Phillips Light touch.  </li>
            <li> so you can easily toss it in a bag when you&#x27;re traveling.  </li>
            <li> but I must admit that this is the most powerful brush a person can ever get a hold of for sure.</li>
            <li> deck catches the hair easily</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li> It massages the scalp, doesn&#x27;t tear my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Phillips Light Touch 8 after reading these reviews.  </li>
            <li> Recently, my husband started using it and decided it was great too.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> They let me try their Phillips Light Touch 6.    </li>
            <li> The smaller version is just as great for the handbag.    </li>
            <li> I ordered the Phillips light touch brush.  </li>
            <li> This is our second one, great when putting hair up in the pony</li>
            <li> It is a very nice brush but too big and not antistatic...and not the one I was looking for....</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, fine hair, but a lot of it and this brush is great.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another person who had been holding on to a great, really old brush because she couldn&#x27;t find anything decent to replace it.</li>
            <li> Not even a full stroke because the brush would not move through my hair.</li>
            <li> It is gentle too and well made, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> My girls have fine hair and very snarly.</li>
            <li> Works great for little girls tangly hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a little softer though, which is nice, but sometimes leaves a bit of static.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to unbox an easy to clean brush with soft flexible pins that wouldn&#x27;t snag my ends.</li>
            <li> Finally, I was in a salon one day, and I asked whether they had any hairbrushes they really liked.  </li>
            <li> The bristles penetrate my hair easily, are neither too stiff nor too flexible, they&#x27;re not sharp against my scalp, don&#x27;t cause my hair to clump or frizz, the size and weight is excellent in the hand, the contour of the bristle bed lays naturally against my scalp...</li>
            <li> My original I bought many years ago (at least 10, but it seams more like 20).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a Phillips Light Touch #1 and was looking for a new brush.</li>
            <li> smooth and great for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Handle is exceptionally ergonomic, and the bristles are strong enough to go through your hair, but gentle enough to not break it.  </li>
            <li> This brush is super gentle on both your scalp and hair, my hair is also rather thick now, and it still does a great job with brushing.</li>
            <li> If you want a great, long lasting brush, then you should get this one!</li>
            <li> I love it and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way this brush feels and for people with short hair like my boyfriend</li>
            <li> this is my second since i wore the first one out after many years.</li>
            <li> This brush goes deep and lifts unlike most.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THREE MORE TO KEEP IN OUR PLACES.  </li>
            <li> Well, maybe just more of the same, like I did!!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I never had such a legendary product that preserves that positive smile knowing it could do miracles as long as you have some hair left naturally ! ! !</li>
            <li> I have super thick, fine hair, and still the basic stiff bristle brush works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very usable, and they require no perfect skill to make them work very good on the hair.</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m going to order a couple of the purse size models</li>
            <li> This brush would not even get to the very ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> (my tangles were to a severe stage from illness and being in bed so much.</li>
            <li> Excelent quality and really pleacent to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> Well made and gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer than any I saw in a store.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my grandkids hair.</li>
            <li> I am sure its manly for men to wear pink but draw the line here.</li>
            <li> and I use it as much as him</li>
            <li> I have never liked these types of brushes, but the reviews sounded so good</li>
            <li> This one is nice, but doesn&#x27;t quite reach through all my hair, I have to brush it at different angles to get all my hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Have been ordering them for Years, nice and firm, used to see them in 4 colors.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and it is comfortable on the scalp and gentle getting the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product and will never buy any other hair brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, the whole family uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> It has been in daily use, been washed several times, and still hasn&#x27;t lost any of the bristle tips, still is just as it was when new, and I love how well it brushes my hair</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every buy another one, I have thick long hair, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I ordered a solid wood, antistatic small hairbrush \\&quot;Florence Billon\\&quot; and my granddaughter loved it.  </li>
            <li> Simply can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in place of an old Denman Classic that I had for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several (for my kids too), the first one was bought 3 years ago, looking as the new one</li>
            <li> The Phillips brush is very nearly as good as my old brush, being gentle to the hair (I have long hair several inches below the shoulder) and firm to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I keep the small one in my car now, and I love them both.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store anymore, I even bought it in the smaller size too.</li>
            <li> The first hairbrush I&#x27;ve used in 27 years that exceeded that strange old clunker my dad had gotten me!  </li>
            <li> Overall, fantastic product given if your hair is not very thick and coarse where the relatively soft bristle may not penetrate properly.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was worried that the bristles would be too soft to get through my hair --</li>
            <li> My old brush was over 30 years old.</li>
            <li> Even missing several rows of bristles on its leading edge it was far better than any of the brushes that I tried from time to time and discarded.</li>
            <li> I received a Phillip&#x27;s hair brush when I was just 10 years old.</li>
            <li> no issues so far.</li>
            <li> This brush comes closest to the firmness and bristle spacing of my 30-year old nylon bristle brush...</li>
            <li> this brush far exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair easily with very little snarling, even when I have just awakened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the close bristle spacing of a boar&#x27;s hair brush but about 50% stiffer... which if you&#x27;ve got a decent head of hair is necessary.</li>
            <li> I have long (past bra line) hair that is medium bodied (my hairdresser says I have a lot of very fine hair).  </li>
            <li> My wife use it to brush my daugther long hair, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought the small one for my Grand Daughter, but she wanted the same size as mine, so I bought the larger one for her.</li>
            <li> I have used that brush until last month, I am now 24 years old!</li>
            <li> About 3 months ago, my son carried that funky old hairbrush to the public pool and lost it.  </li>
            <li> ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM NEAR MEXICO CITY , MEXICO AND PAID $25.00 FOR EACH</li>
            <li> If you bend the brush by pushing it too long against something, it will return to normal after couple days without pressure.</li>
            <li> hard to find brushes that feel good in thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as the Light Touch 6, except that the head is a little longer and the bristles are spaced a little farther apart.  </li>
            <li> It goes through my long hair extremely easy whether it&#x27;s wet or dry and is stiff enough to reach my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear my hair like the other brushes and it is soft on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> They are stiff and are set up in such a high concentration.</li>
            <li> long, dense, wavy/curly, and coarse.  </li>
            <li> I also returned to get one for my dog who does not like her long hair tugged at either.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this was a life savor for me)&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like writing a long review</li>
            <li> , I have long hair</li>
            <li> My search was on again, and I spent another $50 trying various $8 and $10 drug store brushes, nylon bristle, natural bristle, military style, round, etc.  </li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles are a tiny bit sharp.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this hair brush about ten years ago, and I have not used any other hair brush since then.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for almost 10 years and it finally broke in half.  </li>
            <li> After about 12-13 years, I dropped it on a very hard floor from very high up</li>
            <li> I touched this brush to my head when it was saturated in my preferred hair mask, moisturized while wet, and blow-dried.</li>
            <li> It is too big and heavy for a purse.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dipped in pink paint.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband, he has very little hair left, he loves it and so do I</li>
            <li> This is not good for natural afro-textured hair.</li>
            <li> One that I thought would correct the issues that I had with the other model.</li>
            <li> because I disliked it so much--it looked like a dog had chewed on it, which made the handle rough on my hand all those years--but to no avail...</li>
            <li> When this brush breaks down, which I don&#x27;t anticipate for sometime, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> There are noticibly less gaps between strands of hair where my scalp is visible.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money if you have kinky, afro-textured hair that you&#x27;d like to detangle with a brush.</li>
            <li> Putting this brush to my hair shaft was trouble as well.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m missing something.</li>
            <li> It is not as stiff as boars hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I will be looking for the small version for my purse.</li>
            <li> I have thick, past the shoulder hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> OMG!!! I bought this brush almost exactly 2 years ago and it is still the very best brush I have ever owned. It has been in daily use, been washed several times, and still hasn&#x27;t lost any of the bristle tips, still is just as it was when new, and I love how well it brushes my hair (incredibly, some brushes don&#x27;t). If you want a great, long lasting brush, then you should get this one!</li>
            <li> This brush will meet all of your expectations!! I have owned this brush for 12 or 13 years. It get used every day and is still holding up wonderfully. It feels great to the scalp and does not dammage your hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush.  It&#x27;s not too big so you can easily toss it in a bag when you&#x27;re traveling.  It&#x27;s a lightweight but sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Phillips Light Touch 8 after reading these reviews.  It&#x27;s the same as the Light Touch 6, except that the head is a little longer and the bristles are spaced a little farther apart.  No latex cushion (I have a latex allergy).  When it arrived, I was worried that the bristles would be too soft to get through my hair -- long, dense, wavy/curly, and coarse.  This brush does the best job of any brush I have ever used.  It glides through tangles without tearing my hair or pulling it out, and it feels wonderful on my scalp.  It seems very nicely made, too.  Happy!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT hairbrush. Handle is exceptionally ergonomic, and the bristles are strong enough to go through your hair, but gentle enough to not break it.  I bought my 1st one of these 15-20 years ago. After about 12-13 years, I dropped it on a very hard floor from very high up and the handle broke. Bought a 2nd one. I love it and use it daily. Recently, my husband started using it and decided it was great too. So I bought him his own. Everybody&#x27;s happy. And, just for the record, I super-glued my 1st one back together and it&#x27;s good as new. Keep it around as a back-up.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a boars hair brush when I ran across this brush and read the reviews. I did buy a wonderful boars hair brush but also decided to give the Phillips a try since it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve found a decent brush.  Well I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It goes through my long hair extremely easy whether it&#x27;s wet or dry and is stiff enough to reach my scalp.  It also doesn&#x27;t create static in my hair.  In fact I like it so much I&#x27;m going to order a couple of the purse size models so I can have one in my car and at work.</li>
            <li> I have never liked these types of brushes, but the reviews sounded so good, I had to try it, figuring I&#x27;d give it to my granddaughter if I hated it. I love it. This brush is wonderful and I mean it. Needless to say, granddaughter lost out this time.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for great new hair products.  I have long (past bra line) hair that is medium bodied (my hairdresser says I have a lot of very fine hair).  This brush is gentle yet effective.  It gives my hair some body, brushes through knots and is sturdy.  When this brush breaks down, which I don&#x27;t anticipate for sometime, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for years. They are hard to find. I have always had to order from the company. I have long straight hair and it is comfortable on the scalp and gentle getting the tangles out. I have given many for gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another person who had been holding on to a great, really old brush because she couldn&#x27;t find anything decent to replace it. My old brush was over 30 years old. Even missing several rows of bristles on its leading edge it was far better than any of the brushes that I tried from time to time and discarded. The Phillips brush is very nearly as good as my old brush, being gentle to the hair (I have long hair several inches below the shoulder) and firm to the scalp.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush ever! Never using another one! Detangles with our breaking or tearing my hair.</li>
            <li> My original I bought many years ago (at least 10, but it seams more like 20). I bought the small one for my Grand Daughter, but she wanted the same size as mine, so I bought the larger one for her. I keep the small one in my car now, and I love them both. They&#x27;re very usable, and they require no perfect skill to make them work very good on the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a Phillips Light Touch #1 and was looking for a new brush. One that I thought would correct the issues that I had with the other model. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money if you have kinky, afro-textured hair that you&#x27;d like to detangle with a brush. Or if you wish to even get your brush into your hair, do not buy this. I was expecting to unbox an easy to clean brush with soft flexible pins that wouldn&#x27;t snag my ends. As soon as I laid eyes on this brush, I knew it wasnt for me. The pins are actually a cluster of one ball pin and two ball-less pins. They are stiff and are set up in such a high concentration. This is not good for natural afro-textured hair. For the sake of a review i tried it anyway. I may as well have put a velcro strip on my head. It immediately started pulling out unnecessary hair. This brush would not even get to the very ends of my hair. Putting this brush to my hair shaft was trouble as well. I touched this brush to my head when it was saturated in my preferred hair mask, moisturized while wet, and blow-dried. I say &#x27;touched&#x27; because even when attempting the &#x27;Lightest Touch&#x27; possible, this brush just pulled my hair out. and it didnt take any more than a stroke to each state of my hair to figure this out. Not even a full stroke because the brush would not move through my hair. Unless forced and I wasn&#x27;t going to do that. If you have a curly hair type, do not buy this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, as you brush hair it feel like you are massaging your head and it does not break the hair</li>
            <li> I received a Phillip&#x27;s hair brush when I was just 10 years old. I have used that brush until last month, I am now 24 years old! I never had any luck with hair brushes, they were either to hard on my scalp or my hair. This brush is super gentle on both your scalp and hair, my hair is also rather thick now, and it still does a great job with brushing. I suggest this brush for all hair types and head sensitivities.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HAIRBRUSH!!! My grandma used to buy these for the family, so I&#x27;ve been using them since I was a kid. Absolutely love it, the whole family uses it everyday. I even ordered some for my nieces, nephews, and my dad.</li>
            <li> My dad got me a used hairbrush from an estate sale when I was about 13.  I&#x27;ve spent nearly 30 years on and off trying to replace it, because I disliked it so much--it looked like a dog had chewed on it, which made the handle rough on my hand all those years--but to no avail... I could never find a better hairbrush.    About 3 months ago, my son carried that funky old hairbrush to the public pool and lost it.  I was livid, because I knew how hard it would be to find a brush to replace it.  My search was on again, and I spent another $50 trying various $8 and $10 drug store brushes, nylon bristle, natural bristle, military style, round, etc.  Bleck!  Finally, I was in a salon one day, and I asked whether they had any hairbrushes they really liked.  They let me try their Phillips Light Touch 6.    WOW!  The first hairbrush I&#x27;ve used in 27 years that exceeded that strange old clunker my dad had gotten me!  I bought one from the salon immediately, and I love it!  The bristles penetrate my hair easily, are neither too stiff nor too flexible, they&#x27;re not sharp against my scalp, don&#x27;t cause my hair to clump or frizz, the size and weight is excellent in the hand, the contour of the bristle bed lays naturally against my scalp... just a great hairbrush!    Now I&#x27;m buying them for each of my kids.  I&#x27;m debating buying a couple extras, just in case they go out of production and I lose mine again.  Hopefully, I&#x27;ll never have to find a hair brush better than the Light Touch 6, because I don&#x27;t think it exists!</li>
            <li> This brush should come in a plush box it&#x27;s so awesome, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every buy another one, I have thick long hair, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Works great for little girls tangly hair. Best I have tried so far. My hairstylist turned me on to it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush but couldn&#x27;t find a store that carries it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this hair brush and ordered 2 of them. My hair is always tangled terribly. THIS BRUSH IS AMAZING to comb out or thru tangles w/o PAIN...I am so pleased with this product and will never buy any other hair brush. I also returned to get one for my dog who does not like her long hair tugged at either. If this brush worked so brilliantly on my long tangled hair w/o any pain, no breaking off my hair, it will be the best thing you can have for any hair types. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!! Thank you. It is gentle too and well made, easy to hold. (my tangles were to a severe stage from illness and being in bed so much. I have long hair and this was a life savor for me)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you AMAZON! You&#x27;re the best for all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;________UPDATE May 2017 ::: BEST BRUSH I&#x27;VE EVER OWNED. Still works great after all these years !!</li>
            <li> looks and feels like the most durable, most pleasant and most intelligently designed hair brush I have found in either the US or Germany. I&#x27;m already very happy with it and would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush I have ever owned. I have thick, past the shoulder hair. I never have a problem with my hair getting tangle. The brush goes through my hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Light Touch 6 Hair Brush is kind to my hair. It feels great to use and it shapes my hair just like the brushes I used 40 years ago. I recommend this brush and Bravofun!, the company I bought it from. I, of course, bought it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Phillips Brushes are the best! I ordered several (for my kids too), the first one was bought 3 years ago, looking as the new one</li>
            <li> This is the best brush you could ever buy and it may be the last one you will ever need.  I have one for each of my four children and they have used it for years.  Many brushes come apart or break when you use them on tangled hair, not this brush, it is excellent.  It also does not pull or break off hair.  You will be glad you bought it!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for my 2 daughters. We received them yesterday and they are AMAZING. My girls have fine hair and very snarly. This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt them and gets the tangles out while making their hair shiny and gorgeous. I tried it on my fine hair and now I have to have one!</li>
            <li> Nice quality and sturdy. It brushes my hair well. The ends of the bristles are a tiny bit sharp. Others have said this is a great purse brush, I disagree. It is too big and heavy for a purse. I like it enough to keep it as my bathroom brush, but don&#x27;t understand why everyone is raving over this and the price? Apparently, I&#x27;m missing something.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush years ago for my husband, he loves it. When it came time to buy another one we found it on your site. Service was excellent as always.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way this brush feels and for people with short hair like my boyfriend it&#x27;s perfect.  He loves it.  I tried it and with every brush stroke my hair ended up with so much static it all stuck to my face.  Sadly, could not use it.</li>
            <li> I had one of those for 10 years. Excelent quality and really pleacent to brush my hair. My wife use it to brush my daugther long hair, and it works very well. If you bend the brush by pushing it too long against something, it will return to normal after couple days without pressure. Unfurtunatelly I lost it on the hotel and I have to buy another one. I recomended 100%.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy brush that I bought for home, office, and gym.  Made with quality craftsmanship that will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying 3 of these brushes, one for each bathroom.  Well made and gentle on the hair.  Much nicer than any I saw in a store.</li>
            <li> nice brush works good. one of the better ones I&#x27;ve had over the years. you can do worse.&lt;br /&gt;softly stimulates scalp.</li>
            <li> I have traveled to many countries, many hotels and many hairdressing salons. This is THE BRUSH. Point. The smaller version is just as great for the handbag.    A happy consumer. I will be back!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like writing a long review but I must admit that this is the most powerful brush a person can ever get a hold of for sure. I never had such a legendary product that preserves that positive smile knowing it could do miracles as long as you have some hair left naturally ! ! ! Z</li>
            <li> smooth and great for thin hair. no issues so far.</li>
            <li> hard to find brushes that feel good in thick hair. this is my second since i wore the first one out after many years. get one if you want your scalp to feel good and brushing to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Product just as described, good price.</li>
            <li> Owned one years ago and was excited to find it again at Amazon!  This brush goes deep and lifts unlike most.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush goes through my hair easily with very little snarling, even when I have just awakened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Phillips, great brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;j r</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best brush I have ever used - I have purchased a variety of brushes (for a LOT more money) and none have been any better than this Phillips brush.  I have fairly long, fine hair, but a lot of it and this brush is great. I highly recommend it!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this hair brush about ten years ago, and I have not used any other hair brush since then.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THREE OF THESE BRUSHES  15 YEARS AGO AND GAVE ONE  TO A GRANDDAUGHTER&lt;br /&gt;I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM NEAR MEXICO CITY , MEXICO AND PAID $25.00 FOR EACH AND WE LOVED THESE BRUSHES AND I STILL HAVE ONE OF THEM .  WHEN I FOUND THEM ON LINE THIS YEAR AND NEVER SAW THEM IN A STORE, I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THREE MORE TO KEEP IN OUR PLACES.  WE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Phillips Light touch is the best hair brush you&#x27;ll ever had. I would recommend this product 100%. Been using this product for many years. Never disappointed</li>
            <li> I have three of them so that I will not be without one (my son kept getting it and misplacing it).  It doesn&#x27;t tear my hair like the other brushes and it is soft on my scalp.  I have bought them for friends and family.  I will be looking for the small version for my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it everyday. Gentle on my hair. Gentle on my grandkids hair. I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever !&lt;br /&gt;My mother give me one as a present and now I got one for my girls !</li>
            <li> great brush, had as a kid and found a replacment to maintain the flow</li>
            <li> This brush comes closest to the firmness and bristle spacing of my 30-year old nylon bristle brush... a replacement for which I&#x27;ve searched for years.  It has the close bristle spacing of a boar&#x27;s hair brush but about 50% stiffer... which if you&#x27;ve got a decent head of hair is necessary.</li>
            <li> The bristles are dipped in pink paint. I am sure its manly for men to wear pink but draw the line here. This product looks too feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product picture doesnt show the pink-dip.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, does not pull or hurt when brushing.  Great for pets too, they love it!</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I ordered a solid wood, antistatic small hairbrush \\&quot;Florence Billon\\&quot; and my granddaughter loved it.  So I was trying to find it again.  I ordered the Phillips light touch brush.  It is a very nice brush but too big and not antistatic...and not the one I was looking for....</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my husband, he has very little hair left, he loves it and so do I, I have long hair and I use it as much as him, we both love this brush, I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent brush &amp; I was thrilled to find it!</li>
            <li> I have super thick, fine hair, and still the basic stiff bristle brush works the best for me.  This one is nice, but doesn&#x27;t quite reach through all my hair, I have to brush it at different angles to get all my hair brushed. Leaves my hair a little softer though, which is nice, but sometimes leaves a bit of static.</li>
            <li> Have been ordering them for Years, nice and firm, used to see them in 4 colors. my wife keeps stealing them so dont get the wrong Idea thay do last</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve owned. My sister has been suing this brush for years, I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m just now buying it for myself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use anything but these</li>
            <li> It braked after one week using &amp;#60;&amp;#60;it&#x27;s made in China not Japan like the picture &amp;#62;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deck catches the hair easily</li>
            <li> This is the exact brush I was looking for and could not find in the store anymore, I even bought it in the smaller size too.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever. Period.  I have one in each bathroom, one in my car, one in my gym bag, one in the swim bag... Simply can&#x27;t live without it. Best for detangling my 8 year-old daughters hair, awesome for my boys and even for my husband who is super picky!! We all have different type (and length) of  hair and it works for everybody. Get this brush and you won&#x27;t buy another brush in your life! Well, maybe just more of the same, like I did!! ;)</li>
            <li> I had one of these for almost 10 years and it finally broke in half.  I tried 3 other hairbrushes and they were terrible for my hair.  I love the Phillips Light touch.  I have fine hair and this brush works great.  It massages the scalp, doesn&#x27;t tear my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever had. I have bought and given away 10over the last two years. Everyone that has received one has loved it.  I highly recommend  it. Hope they never stop making or selling it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for my daughters hair. This is our second one, great when putting hair up in the pony</li>
            <li> I purchased this in place of an old Denman Classic that I had for over 10 years.  For my hair type (thin and getting thinniner) this brush far exceeds my expectations.  The bristles are closer together than my Denman and is gentler on my scalp.  My hair now actually appears fuller because of the density of the bristles compare to the Denman.  There are noticibly less gaps between strands of hair where my scalp is visible.  It does produce some static. I also like it better than a Fuller boards hair bristle brush that I also have.  It is not as stiff as boars hair brush.  Overall, fantastic product given if your hair is not very thick and coarse where the relatively soft bristle may not penetrate properly.</li>
