            <li>Pigmentation is ok on some of the matte but the shimmers are awesome!</li>

            <li>I thought because of the price the product was gonna be cheap, but it&#x27;s actually really good .. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li>i really loved  it  and  iwanted it  </li>
            <li>These colors are great for doing warm eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>If I could, I would rate it 2.5 because the colors are gorgeous, but they DO NOT transfer well and are not pigmented.</li>
            <li>Not too good for darker skin tones</li>
            <li>The colors are good</li>
            <li>The Eyeshadow was fair quality.</li>
            <li>colors are good pigmented, not all.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved the selection.</li>
            <li>There is also good colors for correcting eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>I recomend BH Cosmetics products if you are looking for a good buy.</li>
            <li>Nice palette; colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I like, but it has great colors.</li>
            <li>Got in good amount of time.</li>
            <li>i loved it, but it took for ever</li>
            <li>The shipping took a good while, but I accidentally forgot to change my mailing address.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I filed a claim and let them know, and they were good about sending me another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it since it&#x27;s a gift for someone, so I don&#x27;t know how good the eyeshadows are themselves</li>
            <li>But I will be using this on fair skin clients.</li>
            <li>When u find something good u tend to tell friends and family so this was one of those things I had to share</li>
            <li>and they all loved it and ordered pallets fir them selves.</li>
            <li>Definetly a good steal</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>and it has a good texture-make-up stays on all day</li>
            <li>IT LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li>Perfect Shades , Pigmented, Smooth looks ,</li>
            <li>all of my friends loved the eye shadow colors.</li>
            <li>Nice eyeshadow for my business of make up they are very nice color and variety</li>
            <li>But it came in good timing and was exceptionally packaged.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, comes off nicely, and stays great.</li>
            <li>Love the colors great quality</li>

            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The thing that I love is, it doesn&#x27;t spread out when I use it !</li>
            <li>Love this pallet!</li>
            <li>Love the colors!</li>
            <li>but the size is really good, and the palette it self is very light weight.</li>
            <li>The pallet itself is light weight, but sturdy, great for travel.</li>
            <li>is amazing</li>
            <li>The colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice as well and none of the shadows were damaged at all.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>We pay our money to receive nice, top-of-the-line products.</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice.</li>
            <li>This is nice to have because of all of the colors.</li>
            <li>Really nice pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>(Although I would not have my own daughter use this)</li>
            <li>the colors look nice though</li>
            <li>The palette itself is really nice.  </li>
            <li>The colors blend nicely</li>
            <li>They packaged it really nicely.</li>
            <li>Still nice</li>
            <li>all the colors are nice.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product....was exactly what I had hoped for and a great bargain..arrived safe and sound and was wrapped well for delivery....</li>
            <li>This palette looks like a great neutral palette, the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t user friendly though.</li>
            <li>a great gift very affordable with amazing quality!</li>
            <li>I am in love with all the colors they are so warm and sexy in a way!</li>
            <li>This is a great eyeshadow palette with a large selection of color!!</li>
            <li>I got it in perfect condition, the colors are lovely and stay very well.</li>
            <li>The color pay off was good, the colors are easy to blend.</li>
            <li>The colors do not go on your eye without applying a bunch of times &amp; even then it rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s many nice colors.</li>
            <li>able I think I should get a refund or some kind of compensation for this</li>
            <li>The light colors are good for the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
            <li>They are more rose and peach, which I do not use.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer to a brush or your eye...</li>
            <li>It has so many nice matte colors that will work with any look.</li>
            <li>Nice eyeshadow, was happy with the product exactly as shown in pictures.  </li>
            <li>but when I got this-I was so happy I tried it out, put the colors on just right</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>When I first purchase this item I though it might not be that great bc of the price .</li>
            <li>The shadows are still very pretty just for suitable for fair skin women</li>
            <li>Definitely very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I love how many neutral colors this palette has.</li>
            <li>So then I used one of my better quality brushes and it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.</li>
            <li>yeah :)</li>
            <li>It looks better online</li>
            <li>I love this palette</li>
            <li>So... I LOVE the colors</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s just one shadow, I expect what I order to be in the best condition possible.</li>
            <li>And that surely wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I love all the natural/nude colors that it comes with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this pallet, my daughter loves it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll find some use for it until I get a better neutral palette, one</li>
            <li>I love my eye Palette,</li>
            <li>Love the colors in the palette.</li>
            <li>but I love neutral colors.</li>
            <li>but I was able to createbeautiful eye looks.</li>
            <li>The highlighting shades are my favorite, wish the browns were richer and darker brown.</li>
            <li>Love this one</li>
            <li>Is nice but very chalky need a good primer to show them off nice if you like light browns and cream whites</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li>From a make-up artist:  I love this palette-every shade of brown</li>
            <li>However, on the matte colors in this palette, I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I do love this.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more :)</li>
            <li>great product, fast  shipping</li>
            <li>I need to use it more to decide if I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eye shadow</li>
            <li>i swatched out most of the shadows</li>
            <li>But I love the product.</li>
            <li>I am more of a matte girl</li>
            <li>so I was pleased about that.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t shattered but the top of the case had marks on it as if it had come into contact with nail polish remover or something</li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and im sure its will still get alot of use.</li>
            <li>many looks with.</li>
            <li>This eye palette is OK.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE PIGMENTATION.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t use all the colors, but I mix and blend a lot of the colors I thought I wouldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>Most just a shimmer.</li>
            <li>The darker colors are naturally more pigmented.</li>
            <li>and I love to do my makeup</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is okay.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll have more luck with a powder based eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>but it might suit your skin tone better.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product in the world</li>
            <li>I really love the colors of the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>️In love with this</li>
            <li>Love the colores in this pallet amazed on the quality</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I have most of those mac shades and it is NOTHING</li>
            <li>The warm colors are very lovely and blends very well.</li>
            <li>This is a nice warm colored eyeshadow pallet nice colors and go&#x27;s  on smooth thanks</li>
            <li>Though the shadows seem nice and pigmented, unless they change their packaging, you will not receive a full palette that you can use.</li>
            <li>Over all pretty good.</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty, good for the office or bridal makeup.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a 28 WARM got 28 COOL, who even knew that it existed?</li>
            <li>The colors are beautifully pigmented and suitable for many different skin tones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!!$$$</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented, they look even better with a really good eye primer.</li>
            <li>It is great for natural tones!</li>
            <li>Great for a 3 color contour look.you dont feel like younhave alot of make up on your eye, its not heavy.</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth and creamy the formula for the shadows is.</li>
            <li>Feels like its wet which makes It look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Very nice colors natural look on my skin .</li>
            <li>I thought the colours would be more rich</li>
            <li>I had ordered a couple of things and this was the one I was most excited for.</li>
            <li>Some colors do not transfer, cracks easily</li>
            <li>But over all its still a good palette for those who are more into natural looks or neutral.</li>
            <li>I love it, it came it a nicely secured box at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Great because there are many different colors.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were very quick to respond and said they would send another one out.  </li>
            <li>They go on easily</li>
            <li>Love the palette , its perfect for an everyday make up</li>
            <li>Very impressive, I&#x27;d been wanting a palette of a bunch of Mac warm eyeshadow shades but we all know those are at least $100</li>
            <li>The dark browns are perfect for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice for the price.  </li>
            <li>Not as though it happened in transit as the rest were fine.</li>
            <li>they are super pigmented!</li>
            <li>The colors are the exact range that I wanted, some shimmer, some are a more matted color, great for natural smokey eyes.</li>
            <li>this is probably fine, but if you are expecting something great, this definitely is not shadow set to get.</li>
            <li>I like the colors...really enjoy putting my makeup on....</li>
            <li>Cheap materials.  </li>
            <li>The palette was fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good way yo start learning til your comfortable enough to use makeup that will stand out more</li>
            <li>and it was EXTREMELY lightly packaged.</li>
            <li>it has all the best colors for an everyday look</li>
            <li>No staying power and lightly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Now, like I said, I wanted the light colors, so I&#x27;m not upset about that</li>
            <li>Wished they were more colorful.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using them</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this palette.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative for those of you who want a cheaper pallette that has enough colors to do</li>
            <li>Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>it is a tad but light though.  </li>
            <li>and what you pay this is veryyyyyy cheap</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>I would say its a good palette to start off with if your just starting to use makeup, because it&#x27;s not so much or overwhelming for you to handle.</li>
            <li>They are gorgeous neutral colors that I can use to create a really natural makeup look.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and are very nice once applied but dont last all day long.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this as well!!</li>
            <li>I find myself very rarely reaching for this palette.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a decent prouduct and it might not have been very successful for me</li>
            <li>Great neutrals, with a couple of shimmery coppery and champagne-y colors and a matte black thrown in to deepen your nude looks, or make them more sparkly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received this package today, I was SO EXCITED.</li>
            <li>Im aware I wasnt expecting ”Mac” quality obvisously, but I could get product better than this stuff in the toy isle of a dollar tree.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive this palette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed w/</li>
            <li>Overall the colors are nice and it was an afordable price so can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m so excited waiting for my palette to arrive and when it does....</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I * had to clean it for Christ&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>i was just hoping there would be some darker browns, they are more of a  red brown, but i can work with what it has, its still a nice neutral palette.</li>
            <li>Overall great pallette and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this palette is mixed with matte and shimmery colors, colors are very good, they blend out very smoothly, i used the matte brown to contour my face, and the light ivory colors the highlight my face, it looks bigger in pictures</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t really like the look of the dots or specks in the eyeshadow but other than that it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I know it is cheap but lots of the cheap makeups are now pretty pigmented and this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li>There are so many out there for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the good, but I would NOT buy this again simple because ALL THE SHADOWS smell identical to acrylic paints.</li>
            <li>They should really work on trying to make sure that that doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone anymore.</li>
            <li>Just not a representation of the true color.</li>
            <li>The colors are true and have plenty of pigment.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>*for the 28 color pallet*&lt;br /&gt;You can never take a good picture of makeup, of course its going to look slightly different than pictures.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors that last all day.</li>
            <li>I decided to contact them just to let them know that they really need to pack better as mail gets tossed around a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no bad reaction to makeup...</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>one of the colors works as a coverup, two are great for contouring, I do my eyeshadow and use the black as a light liner.</li>
            <li>I would pay more next time for a palette that is SAFE FOR EYES and DOESNT SMELL LIKE PAINT from an art store.</li>
            <li>It got here super quick.</li>
            <li>You can make many different looks which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>quickly looks</li>
            <li>this color are really intense and beautiful and stay long.</li>
            <li>love it highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Pretty accurate to the picture as well.</li>
            <li>I recommended exactly as it is on the picture for cheap price 😉</li>
            <li>fabulous natural eye shades!!!!</li>
            <li>it was very cheap and the shadows are so easy to apply and last for along time.</li>
            <li>I was very glad that it wasn&#x27;t a cheaply made product for what I spent.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I received my palette a few days earlier than was expected and it was in very good shape, it was wrapped very nicely and safely.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to have a reaction to the shadows since I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more from this seller!</li>
            <li>get exactly what you expect with this product!</li>
            <li>they are kind of light and hard to tell if you have on, but adding more helps for me.</li>
            <li>Great Palette for everyday wear</li>
            <li>and it is a very slim and light weight case</li>
            <li>When my package finally arrived, I was thrilled with how well they worked.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow brush picks up a good amount but the only thing I have a problem with is that some times I&#x27;ll pick up way too much with my eye shadow brush with the just the lightest dab.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette for it&#x27;s variety and warm, neutral shades since I have blue eyes.</li>
            <li>This may be ok for a young girl just learning to use make up</li>
            <li>She liked what was left of it, so opted to keep it.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the palette itself is nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t order powdered makeup from this seller again as the packaging just isn&#x27;t sturdy enough to prevent breakage.  </li>
            <li>however I was looking for the morphe natural warm palette which has more colors in a larger neutral range.</li>
            <li>nice, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This pallet is actually nice for it to be inexpensive or use it underneath my eyes and or above my eye</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s while worth the wait</li>
            <li>This is actually much nicer than I had expected and the colors are very nice as well.</li>
            <li>having fun with this pallete, glides on easy, blends easy and the different shades</li>
            <li>they are pretty and it came really quick</li>
            <li>All the right colors.</li>
            <li>Just the right amounts of mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li>(you get what you pay for right?)</li>
            <li>I might not have been using the right brush</li>
            <li>The pigment is okay not bad actually</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented and they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This bootsie cool palette, not so much.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t have a ton of pigment, but this works fine for my 9-5 makeup routine, very natural looking for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t happy when I open the palette and 3 eye shadows where totally destroyed!</li>
            <li>works very well and was shipped quick</li>
            <li>but it was very natural so it would be a smooth transition to get used to the look.</li>
            <li>this price, each member of my staff can have one-they look very professional and are very slim for easy packing and stacking.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be packaged pretty well but two of the colors broke anyway.  </li>
            <li>and I really appreciate everything!</li>
            <li>Took a while for the package to come , overall it&#x27;s a okay</li>
            <li>and I was only able salvage  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>they sent it out exactly like the first one - so after again waiting forever for it to arrive...</li>
            <li>The choices for tone is vastly appealing, numerous.  </li>
            <li>All the colors were very neutral but usable!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the palette was the almost perfumey smell coming from the shadows.</li>
            <li>Would love my money back.</li>
            <li>Great price and the shadow itself last a long time when wearing  it</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered I received it with one shadow busted all over the package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go ahead and get the actual Coast Scents palette that they offer, because ive heard it is a lot better quality.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and get an actual brand one.</li>
            <li>I love this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>They go on pretty well</li>
            <li>I liked that it came faster then expected</li>
            <li>I love the different neutral shades, they go with everything.</li>
            <li>I was very unsatisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better more practical gift for a young makeup lover on a budget, it took a little while to arrive but it was well worth</li>
            <li>I was happy when the product came earlier than expected</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, good product :)</li>
            <li>Love the verity even though I only really use like 4 of them.</li>
            <li>Love the colors  last long and blends in good 👌 bigger</li>
            <li>The warm palette is fantastic, the colors are very well pigmented and long lasting with or without a primer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get much better shadows from Wet n Wild if you need something cheap but useable.</li>
            <li>There very neutral colors and this is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>mess.&lt;br /&gt;Shadow chalk is pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very vibrant, though.</li>
            <li>and it is already a mess.the colors get mixed together to easy .&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li>easy to open the palette.</li>
            <li>Leaving off a star because for me and my environment this case is a bit large.</li>
            <li>The colors looked  exactly as seen on the pictures, decent amount of product in the pan.</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic between the shadows, on the inside, is rather flimsy and cheap, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because otherwise, the product looks gorgeous and expensive and the actual palette itself is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>there no have too much pigmatation</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really miss the ones that broke.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the product and it is what I needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks came fast.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
            <li>but the packaging was very neat.</li>
            <li>My daughter really loves these colors</li>
            <li>Some of the colors (darker colors with shimmer) were pigmented , the lighter matte colors weren&#x27;t so much.</li>
            <li>You gotta really brush your make up brushes into the colors and really pack it on.</li>
            <li>My clients think it&#x27;s really something fancy</li>
            <li>the colors are not the same all the colors are to light</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product was intact,</li>
            <li>The wet brush allows you to pick up more of the eyeshadow color and it drys it onto the eyelid helping it to stay longer.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and creamy to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Very compact too.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well in two boxes with 3 layers of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>With all the reviews I read on this palette, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a very ling time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Make up artist, and this palette is an absolute MUST HAVE for any kit.</li>
            <li>and I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that much so of course</li>
            <li>and I found this, and I have to say it was even better than I expected, and for the $7.50 I paid</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an absolute no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>and they were all the ones I really wanted this pallet for.</li>
            <li>so I figured that (not only was it cheap)</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really show up on my eyelid....</li>
            <li>Mine are very neutral but not like that picture.</li>
            <li>but i really cant complain because i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, but package arrived severly damaged.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, some not so much.</li>
            <li>colors are beautiful but waited nearly three weeks to get here  and case arrived cracked, not worth it to send it back to China for a replacement</li>
            <li>i returned it right away the colors i wanted where all natural but</li>
            <li>They seem to have to much under tones of red or orange instead of being a rich brown.  </li>
            <li>The only real criticism I have is that the pictures are slightly deceiving; the colors have more rose undertones than yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>The pigment on half of the palette are very light</li>
            <li>These are perfect for their price very difficult to blend  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s hard to tell in the photo, there is a very bright pink.</li>
            <li>And now I have to wait another three weeks just to get a new palette!</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product was in new condition.</li>
            <li>The black is a nice matte black which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Colors were exactly as shown but were pretty low quality.</li>
            <li>as soon as I got it and has decent pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can seriously never gi wring with a neutral pallet andtth I one here</li>
            <li>I got this palette for the light colors, because I lay those down on my eye first, so when I blend, it gives the darker colors something close to my skin color to blend with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I was highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This eye-shadow are a high picment .</li>
            <li>I just wished the pigmentation was a little better...</li>
            <li>color pay off not so much very chalky however after several uses the color payoff improves and very blendable so over all I really like it</li>
            <li>I tried to explain the problem was with their lack of packaging and recommended more protection, however it was a waste of time-</li>
            <li>but the next time i by something i will be going to mac products, yea they are pretty pricey but in the end i will pay that much for makeup just because i never had problems with there products ever.</li>
            <li>can b easily mixed to get the right shade for your skin tone</li>
            <li>not strong colors at all you need to apply so many times.</li>
            <li>Which ever color is on the far right second from top, was completely missing.</li>
            <li>They all have a slight glimmer to them, especially the dusty rose in the top right corner.</li>
            <li>The palette didn&#x27;t even look NEW.</li>
            <li>once whatever you thought you were buying is in the mail, it&#x27;s off their hands and your new folly.</li>
            <li>I can mix and match and wear a new look every day.</li>
            <li>And from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m not the only person that has experienced a broken shadow or two in the palette.</li>
            <li>and I would have liked to see a deep green or navy instead.</li>
            <li>matte neutrals are great for base lids colors to build upon, light add a very dark cat eye, or a dark crease color to smoke out or a bright color on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they are the colors I usually use.  </li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ll more likely design/create using Inglots freedom system, before tossing or donating this one to a younger relative.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>The picture looks like these pretty colors and the item I received not the same.</li>
            <li>But the plastic is super cheap and it arrived broken</li>
            <li>Other than higher end products that might tend to be too much..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely needs to be used with softer brushes and not stiff ones.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and steer clear of CrazyCart bc they will blame you for their shipping mistakes, so</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t to loud...</li>
            <li>This was such a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have one palette designated for bridal makeup &amp; those who want to look natural</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t chalky or old looking.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>It was to be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Almost all of the shades are completely matte</li>
            <li>I do professional</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES NATURAL EYE MAKEUP.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a complete</li>
            <li>Fortunately there were other shades that were very similar</li>
            <li>the colors are so pigmented somr of the colors have a lil bit of fall out but other then that worth the 7bucks</li>
            <li>I also purchased the 168 color palette from this same seller, not sure if this palette has the same manufacturer, and if they do, I cannot explain why the other palette is so great as opposed to this one,</li>
            <li>The actual palette is mostly light, with 3 dark colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are a lot lighter than showed in the picture and a lot of them are very similar but decent quality</li>
            <li>for the actual shadows, they&#x27;re decent.</li>
            <li>The dark browns give the color of a light tan or even a peach(keeping in mind that I am as white as paper)</li>
            <li>The black is kind of matte, I use my fingers to apply (I like it better) and do pretty complex smokey looks, it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the others but for the price (remember the price 28 eye shadows for the same price as a small drug store container which both end up working the same)</li>
            <li>but when you get it the smell is sooo bad omg and its not that neutral to be honest its really more on the pink side, the browns are NOT like the picture</li>
            <li>The color would collect in little areas, kind of cake up in little spots even with an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would package it better when they ship it because 2 of the colors were broken but as far as colors it have all the neutral &amp; natural colors &amp; that every woman must have.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy using it on younger clients or anyone who is a little afraid of makeup still but wants to look natural and nice.</li>
            <li>If you do the wet brush trick make sure you wet it and dab it off on cloth or something before picking a different color as it will mix with the other color because of how much it can get on the brush!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You typically get what you pay for, and in this case I feel like the product was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The colors are okay however they are very thin and not enough especially if you like one color more than the other.</li>
            <li>but in general I like it</li>
            <li>All the eye shadows are very pigmented and last long, considering the fact that I tried it as soon</li>
            <li>and I can barely see the colors.</li>
            <li>I can work with the colors if I really want to, not as pigmented as I expected at all.</li>
            <li>but it barely has any on some of the colors</li>
            <li>When I received my eyeshadow many if them were broken, and the eye shadows did not go on well.</li>
            <li>The compact is incredibly thin, which I love.</li>
            <li>It was a total mess to clean up the inside and outside of the case.</li>
            <li>or if I would experience the same thing had I bought the palette from the other companies at a higher price,....</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I tested a color (the goldish color right above the black)</li>
            <li>It is a little cheap, but it&#x27;s about what I expected given the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago, took about a month or a little more to come</li>
            <li>I would recommend using concealer and my personal trick a wet brush and then hairspray over your eyes after applying however much you want on.</li>
            <li>I have to really dig my eyeshadow brush into the product to get any color; not worth it.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that I had to wait for a month to revise my product because apparently it come from china</li>
            <li>Not even worth the small amount of money I paid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the same palettes manufactured from BH cosmetics &amp; Coastal Scents, even with their professional discount, the price I paid for this one was much lower, but I&#x27;m not sure if I sacrificed quality because of that</li>
            <li>While the product is fine, it arrived (from China) with a lot of broken shadows.</li>
            <li>Nice natural looking colors, too bad one of the shadows broke and got all over the outside, and inside of the pkg, and all over my hands when i opened it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice inexpensive palette</li>
            <li> many great things about this-colors to choose never a loss of the perfect color.</li>
            <li> Pigmentation is ok on some of the matte but the shimmers are awesome!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more pinky toned the brown, great pigmentation with eyeshadow primer!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great item, arrived with all colors in tact which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality.</li>

            <li> Just Great ! :)</li>
            <li> This eye shadow arrived in good condition, and the colors are very nice.</li>
            <li> I thought because of the price the product was gonna be cheap, but it&#x27;s actually really good .. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> i really loved  it  and  iwanted it  </li>
            <li> These colors are great for doing warm eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate it 2.5 because the colors are gorgeous, but they DO NOT transfer well and are not pigmented.</li>
            <li> Not too good for darker skin tones</li>
            <li> The colors are good</li>
            <li> The Eyeshadow was fair quality.</li>
            <li> colors are good pigmented, not all.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the selection.</li>
            <li> There is also good colors for correcting eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> I recomend BH Cosmetics products if you are looking for a good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice palette; colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I like, but it has great colors.</li>
            <li> Got in good amount of time.</li>
            <li> i loved it, but it took for ever</li>
            <li> The shipping took a good while, but I accidentally forgot to change my mailing address.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I filed a claim and let them know, and they were good about sending me another one to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it since it&#x27;s a gift for someone, so I don&#x27;t know how good the eyeshadows are themselves</li>
            <li> But I will be using this on fair skin clients.</li>
            <li> When u find something good u tend to tell friends and family so this was one of those things I had to share</li>
            <li> and they all loved it and ordered pallets fir them selves.</li>
            <li> Definetly a good steal</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> and it has a good texture-make-up stays on all day</li>
            <li> IT LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li> Perfect Shades , Pigmented, Smooth looks ,</li>
            <li> all of my friends loved the eye shadow colors.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadow for my business of make up they are very nice color and variety</li>
            <li> But it came in good timing and was exceptionally packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, comes off nicely, and stays great.</li>
            <li> Love the colors great quality</li>

            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The thing that I love is, it doesn&#x27;t spread out when I use it !</li>
            <li> Love this pallet!</li>
            <li> Love the colors!</li>
            <li> but the size is really good, and the palette it self is very light weight.</li>
            <li> The pallet itself is light weight, but sturdy, great for travel.</li>
            <li> is amazing</li>
            <li> The colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice as well and none of the shadows were damaged at all.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> We pay our money to receive nice, top-of-the-line products.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice.</li>
            <li> This is nice to have because of all of the colors.</li>
            <li> Really nice pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> (Although I would not have my own daughter use this)</li>
            <li> the colors look nice though</li>
            <li> The palette itself is really nice.  </li>
            <li> The colors blend nicely</li>
            <li> They packaged it really nicely.</li>
            <li> Still nice</li>
            <li> all the colors are nice.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product....was exactly what I had hoped for and a great bargain..arrived safe and sound and was wrapped well for delivery....</li>
            <li> This palette looks like a great neutral palette, the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t user friendly though.</li>
            <li> a great gift very affordable with amazing quality!</li>
            <li> I am in love with all the colors they are so warm and sexy in a way!</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeshadow palette with a large selection of color!!</li>
            <li> I got it in perfect condition, the colors are lovely and stay very well.</li>
            <li> The color pay off was good, the colors are easy to blend.</li>
            <li> The colors do not go on your eye without applying a bunch of times &amp; even then it rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s many nice colors.</li>
            <li> able I think I should get a refund or some kind of compensation for this</li>
            <li> The light colors are good for the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
            <li> They are more rose and peach, which I do not use.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer to a brush or your eye...</li>
            <li> It has so many nice matte colors that will work with any look.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadow, was happy with the product exactly as shown in pictures.  </li>
            <li> but when I got this-I was so happy I tried it out, put the colors on just right</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> When I first purchase this item I though it might not be that great bc of the price .</li>
            <li> The shadows are still very pretty just for suitable for fair skin women</li>
            <li> Definitely very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> I love how many neutral colors this palette has.</li>
            <li> So then I used one of my better quality brushes and it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.</li>
            <li> yeah :)</li>
            <li> It looks better online</li>
            <li> I love this palette</li>
            <li> So... I LOVE the colors</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s just one shadow, I expect what I order to be in the best condition possible.</li>
            <li> And that surely wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I love all the natural/nude colors that it comes with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this pallet, my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll find some use for it until I get a better neutral palette, one</li>
            <li> I love my eye Palette,</li>
            <li> Love the colors in the palette.</li>
            <li> but I love neutral colors.</li>
            <li> but I was able to createbeautiful eye looks.</li>
            <li> The highlighting shades are my favorite, wish the browns were richer and darker brown.</li>
            <li> Love this one</li>
            <li> Is nice but very chalky need a good primer to show them off nice if you like light browns and cream whites</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> From a make-up artist:  I love this palette-every shade of brown</li>
            <li> However, on the matte colors in this palette, I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I do love this.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more :)</li>
            <li> great product, fast  shipping</li>
            <li> I need to use it more to decide if I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye shadow</li>
            <li> i swatched out most of the shadows</li>
            <li> But I love the product.</li>
            <li> I am more of a matte girl</li>
            <li> so I was pleased about that.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t shattered but the top of the case had marks on it as if it had come into contact with nail polish remover or something</li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and im sure its will still get alot of use.</li>
            <li> many looks with.</li>
            <li> This eye palette is OK.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE PIGMENTATION.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t use all the colors, but I mix and blend a lot of the colors I thought I wouldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> Most just a shimmer.</li>
            <li> The darker colors are naturally more pigmented.</li>
            <li> and I love to do my makeup</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is okay.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll have more luck with a powder based eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> but it might suit your skin tone better.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product in the world</li>
            <li> I really love the colors of the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> ️In love with this</li>
            <li> Love the colores in this pallet amazed on the quality</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I have most of those mac shades and it is NOTHING</li>
            <li> The warm colors are very lovely and blends very well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice warm colored eyeshadow pallet nice colors and go&#x27;s  on smooth thanks</li>
            <li> Though the shadows seem nice and pigmented, unless they change their packaging, you will not receive a full palette that you can use.</li>
            <li> Over all pretty good.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty, good for the office or bridal makeup.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a 28 WARM got 28 COOL, who even knew that it existed?</li>
            <li> The colors are beautifully pigmented and suitable for many different skin tones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!!$$$</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented, they look even better with a really good eye primer.</li>
            <li> It is great for natural tones!</li>
            <li> Great for a 3 color contour look.you dont feel like younhave alot of make up on your eye, its not heavy.</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth and creamy the formula for the shadows is.</li>
            <li> Feels like its wet which makes It look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Very nice colors natural look on my skin .</li>
            <li> I thought the colours would be more rich</li>
            <li> I had ordered a couple of things and this was the one I was most excited for.</li>
            <li> Some colors do not transfer, cracks easily</li>
            <li> But over all its still a good palette for those who are more into natural looks or neutral.</li>
            <li> I love it, it came it a nicely secured box at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Great because there are many different colors.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they were very quick to respond and said they would send another one out.  </li>
            <li> They go on easily</li>
            <li> Love the palette , its perfect for an everyday make up</li>
            <li> Very impressive, I&#x27;d been wanting a palette of a bunch of Mac warm eyeshadow shades but we all know those are at least $100</li>
            <li> The dark browns are perfect for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not as though it happened in transit as the rest were fine.</li>
            <li> they are super pigmented!</li>
            <li> The colors are the exact range that I wanted, some shimmer, some are a more matted color, great for natural smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> this is probably fine, but if you are expecting something great, this definitely is not shadow set to get.</li>
            <li> I like the colors...really enjoy putting my makeup on....</li>
            <li> Cheap materials.  </li>
            <li> The palette was fantastic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good way yo start learning til your comfortable enough to use makeup that will stand out more</li>
            <li> and it was EXTREMELY lightly packaged.</li>
            <li> it has all the best colors for an everyday look</li>
            <li> No staying power and lightly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Now, like I said, I wanted the light colors, so I&#x27;m not upset about that</li>
            <li> Wished they were more colorful.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using them</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this palette.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for those of you who want a cheaper pallette that has enough colors to do</li>
            <li> Silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> it is a tad but light though.  </li>
            <li> and what you pay this is veryyyyyy cheap</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I would say its a good palette to start off with if your just starting to use makeup, because it&#x27;s not so much or overwhelming for you to handle.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous neutral colors that I can use to create a really natural makeup look.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and are very nice once applied but dont last all day long.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this as well!!</li>
            <li> I find myself very rarely reaching for this palette.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a decent prouduct and it might not have been very successful for me</li>
            <li> Great neutrals, with a couple of shimmery coppery and champagne-y colors and a matte black thrown in to deepen your nude looks, or make them more sparkly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received this package today, I was SO EXCITED.</li>
            <li> Im aware I wasnt expecting ”Mac” quality obvisously, but I could get product better than this stuff in the toy isle of a dollar tree.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive this palette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed w/</li>
            <li> Overall the colors are nice and it was an afordable price so can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m so excited waiting for my palette to arrive and when it does....</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I * had to clean it for Christ&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> i was just hoping there would be some darker browns, they are more of a  red brown, but i can work with what it has, its still a nice neutral palette.</li>
            <li> Overall great pallette and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this palette is mixed with matte and shimmery colors, colors are very good, they blend out very smoothly, i used the matte brown to contour my face, and the light ivory colors the highlight my face, it looks bigger in pictures</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t really like the look of the dots or specks in the eyeshadow but other than that it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I know it is cheap but lots of the cheap makeups are now pretty pigmented and this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> There are so many out there for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the good, but I would NOT buy this again simple because ALL THE SHADOWS smell identical to acrylic paints.</li>
            <li> They should really work on trying to make sure that that doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone anymore.</li>
            <li> Just not a representation of the true color.</li>
            <li> The colors are true and have plenty of pigment.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> *for the 28 color pallet*&lt;br /&gt;You can never take a good picture of makeup, of course its going to look slightly different than pictures.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors that last all day.</li>
            <li> I decided to contact them just to let them know that they really need to pack better as mail gets tossed around a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no bad reaction to makeup...</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> one of the colors works as a coverup, two are great for contouring, I do my eyeshadow and use the black as a light liner.</li>
            <li> I would pay more next time for a palette that is SAFE FOR EYES and DOESNT SMELL LIKE PAINT from an art store.</li>
            <li> It got here super quick.</li>
            <li> You can make many different looks which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> quickly looks</li>
            <li> this color are really intense and beautiful and stay long.</li>
            <li> love it highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Pretty accurate to the picture as well.</li>
            <li> I recommended exactly as it is on the picture for cheap price 😉</li>
            <li> fabulous natural eye shades!!!!</li>
            <li> it was very cheap and the shadows are so easy to apply and last for along time.</li>
            <li> I was very glad that it wasn&#x27;t a cheaply made product for what I spent.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I received my palette a few days earlier than was expected and it was in very good shape, it was wrapped very nicely and safely.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to have a reaction to the shadows since I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more from this seller!</li>
            <li> get exactly what you expect with this product!</li>
            <li> they are kind of light and hard to tell if you have on, but adding more helps for me.</li>
            <li> Great Palette for everyday wear</li>
            <li> and it is a very slim and light weight case</li>
            <li> When my package finally arrived, I was thrilled with how well they worked.</li>
            <li> My eyeshadow brush picks up a good amount but the only thing I have a problem with is that some times I&#x27;ll pick up way too much with my eye shadow brush with the just the lightest dab.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for it&#x27;s variety and warm, neutral shades since I have blue eyes.</li>
            <li> This may be ok for a young girl just learning to use make up</li>
            <li> She liked what was left of it, so opted to keep it.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the palette itself is nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t order powdered makeup from this seller again as the packaging just isn&#x27;t sturdy enough to prevent breakage.  </li>
            <li> however I was looking for the morphe natural warm palette which has more colors in a larger neutral range.</li>
            <li> nice, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This pallet is actually nice for it to be inexpensive or use it underneath my eyes and or above my eye</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s while worth the wait</li>
            <li> This is actually much nicer than I had expected and the colors are very nice as well.</li>
            <li> having fun with this pallete, glides on easy, blends easy and the different shades</li>
            <li> they are pretty and it came really quick</li>
            <li> All the right colors.</li>
            <li> Just the right amounts of mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li> (you get what you pay for right?)</li>
            <li> I might not have been using the right brush</li>
            <li> The pigment is okay not bad actually</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented and they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This bootsie cool palette, not so much.</li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t have a ton of pigment, but this works fine for my 9-5 makeup routine, very natural looking for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t happy when I open the palette and 3 eye shadows where totally destroyed!</li>
            <li> works very well and was shipped quick</li>
            <li> but it was very natural so it would be a smooth transition to get used to the look.</li>
            <li> this price, each member of my staff can have one-they look very professional and are very slim for easy packing and stacking.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be packaged pretty well but two of the colors broke anyway.  </li>
            <li> and I really appreciate everything!</li>
            <li> Took a while for the package to come , overall it&#x27;s a okay</li>
            <li> and I was only able salvage  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> they sent it out exactly like the first one - so after again waiting forever for it to arrive...</li>
            <li> The choices for tone is vastly appealing, numerous.  </li>
            <li> All the colors were very neutral but usable!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the palette was the almost perfumey smell coming from the shadows.</li>
            <li> Would love my money back.</li>
            <li> Great price and the shadow itself last a long time when wearing  it</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered I received it with one shadow busted all over the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go ahead and get the actual Coast Scents palette that they offer, because ive heard it is a lot better quality.</li>
            <li> Spend more money and get an actual brand one.</li>
            <li> I love this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They go on pretty well</li>
            <li> I liked that it came faster then expected</li>
            <li> I love the different neutral shades, they go with everything.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a better more practical gift for a young makeup lover on a budget, it took a little while to arrive but it was well worth</li>
            <li> I was happy when the product came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, good product :)</li>
            <li> Love the verity even though I only really use like 4 of them.</li>
            <li> Love the colors  last long and blends in good 👌 bigger</li>
            <li> The warm palette is fantastic, the colors are very well pigmented and long lasting with or without a primer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get much better shadows from Wet n Wild if you need something cheap but useable.</li>
            <li> There very neutral colors and this is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> mess.&lt;br /&gt;Shadow chalk is pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very vibrant, though.</li>
            <li> and it is already a mess.the colors get mixed together to easy .&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> easy to open the palette.</li>
            <li> Leaving off a star because for me and my environment this case is a bit large.</li>
            <li> The colors looked  exactly as seen on the pictures, decent amount of product in the pan.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic between the shadows, on the inside, is rather flimsy and cheap, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because otherwise, the product looks gorgeous and expensive and the actual palette itself is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> there no have too much pigmatation</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really miss the ones that broke.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the product and it is what I needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks came fast.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
            <li> but the packaging was very neat.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loves these colors</li>
            <li> Some of the colors (darker colors with shimmer) were pigmented , the lighter matte colors weren&#x27;t so much.</li>
            <li> You gotta really brush your make up brushes into the colors and really pack it on.</li>
            <li> My clients think it&#x27;s really something fancy</li>
            <li> the colors are not the same all the colors are to light</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product was intact,</li>
            <li> The wet brush allows you to pick up more of the eyeshadow color and it drys it onto the eyelid helping it to stay longer.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and creamy to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Very compact too.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well in two boxes with 3 layers of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> With all the reviews I read on this palette, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Shipping took a very ling time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Make up artist, and this palette is an absolute MUST HAVE for any kit.</li>
            <li> and I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that much so of course</li>
            <li> and I found this, and I have to say it was even better than I expected, and for the $7.50 I paid</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an absolute no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> and they were all the ones I really wanted this pallet for.</li>
            <li> so I figured that (not only was it cheap)</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really show up on my eyelid....</li>
            <li> Mine are very neutral but not like that picture.</li>
            <li> but i really cant complain because i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but package arrived severly damaged.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, some not so much.</li>
            <li> colors are beautiful but waited nearly three weeks to get here  and case arrived cracked, not worth it to send it back to China for a replacement</li>
            <li> i returned it right away the colors i wanted where all natural but</li>
            <li> They seem to have to much under tones of red or orange instead of being a rich brown.  </li>
            <li> The only real criticism I have is that the pictures are slightly deceiving; the colors have more rose undertones than yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> The pigment on half of the palette are very light</li>
            <li> These are perfect for their price very difficult to blend  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s hard to tell in the photo, there is a very bright pink.</li>
            <li> And now I have to wait another three weeks just to get a new palette!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product was in new condition.</li>
            <li> The black is a nice matte black which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> Colors were exactly as shown but were pretty low quality.</li>
            <li> as soon as I got it and has decent pigmentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can seriously never gi wring with a neutral pallet andtth I one here</li>
            <li> I got this palette for the light colors, because I lay those down on my eye first, so when I blend, it gives the darker colors something close to my skin color to blend with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I was highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eye-shadow are a high picment .</li>
            <li> I just wished the pigmentation was a little better...</li>
            <li> color pay off not so much very chalky however after several uses the color payoff improves and very blendable so over all I really like it</li>
            <li> I tried to explain the problem was with their lack of packaging and recommended more protection, however it was a waste of time-</li>
            <li> but the next time i by something i will be going to mac products, yea they are pretty pricey but in the end i will pay that much for makeup just because i never had problems with there products ever.</li>
            <li> can b easily mixed to get the right shade for your skin tone</li>
            <li> not strong colors at all you need to apply so many times.</li>
            <li> Which ever color is on the far right second from top, was completely missing.</li>
            <li> They all have a slight glimmer to them, especially the dusty rose in the top right corner.</li>
            <li> The palette didn&#x27;t even look NEW.</li>
            <li> once whatever you thought you were buying is in the mail, it&#x27;s off their hands and your new folly.</li>
            <li> I can mix and match and wear a new look every day.</li>
            <li> And from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m not the only person that has experienced a broken shadow or two in the palette.</li>
            <li> and I would have liked to see a deep green or navy instead.</li>
            <li> matte neutrals are great for base lids colors to build upon, light add a very dark cat eye, or a dark crease color to smoke out or a bright color on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they are the colors I usually use.  </li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ll more likely design/create using Inglots freedom system, before tossing or donating this one to a younger relative.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> The picture looks like these pretty colors and the item I received not the same.</li>
            <li> But the plastic is super cheap and it arrived broken</li>
            <li> Other than higher end products that might tend to be too much..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely needs to be used with softer brushes and not stiff ones.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and steer clear of CrazyCart bc they will blame you for their shipping mistakes, so</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t to loud...</li>
            <li> This was such a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have one palette designated for bridal makeup &amp; those who want to look natural</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t chalky or old looking.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> It was to be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Almost all of the shades are completely matte</li>
            <li> I do professional</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES NATURAL EYE MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a complete</li>
            <li> Fortunately there were other shades that were very similar</li>
            <li> the colors are so pigmented somr of the colors have a lil bit of fall out but other then that worth the 7bucks</li>
            <li> I also purchased the 168 color palette from this same seller, not sure if this palette has the same manufacturer, and if they do, I cannot explain why the other palette is so great as opposed to this one,</li>
            <li> The actual palette is mostly light, with 3 dark colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are a lot lighter than showed in the picture and a lot of them are very similar but decent quality</li>
            <li> for the actual shadows, they&#x27;re decent.</li>
            <li> The dark browns give the color of a light tan or even a peach(keeping in mind that I am as white as paper)</li>
            <li> The black is kind of matte, I use my fingers to apply (I like it better) and do pretty complex smokey looks, it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the others but for the price (remember the price 28 eye shadows for the same price as a small drug store container which both end up working the same)</li>
            <li> but when you get it the smell is sooo bad omg and its not that neutral to be honest its really more on the pink side, the browns are NOT like the picture</li>
            <li> The color would collect in little areas, kind of cake up in little spots even with an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would package it better when they ship it because 2 of the colors were broken but as far as colors it have all the neutral &amp; natural colors &amp; that every woman must have.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy using it on younger clients or anyone who is a little afraid of makeup still but wants to look natural and nice.</li>
            <li> If you do the wet brush trick make sure you wet it and dab it off on cloth or something before picking a different color as it will mix with the other color because of how much it can get on the brush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You typically get what you pay for, and in this case I feel like the product was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The colors are okay however they are very thin and not enough especially if you like one color more than the other.</li>
            <li> but in general I like it</li>
            <li> All the eye shadows are very pigmented and last long, considering the fact that I tried it as soon</li>
            <li> and I can barely see the colors.</li>
            <li> I can work with the colors if I really want to, not as pigmented as I expected at all.</li>
            <li> but it barely has any on some of the colors</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeshadow many if them were broken, and the eye shadows did not go on well.</li>
            <li> The compact is incredibly thin, which I love.</li>
            <li> It was a total mess to clean up the inside and outside of the case.</li>
            <li> or if I would experience the same thing had I bought the palette from the other companies at a higher price,....</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I tested a color (the goldish color right above the black)</li>
            <li> It is a little cheap, but it&#x27;s about what I expected given the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, took about a month or a little more to come</li>
            <li> I would recommend using concealer and my personal trick a wet brush and then hairspray over your eyes after applying however much you want on.</li>
            <li> I have to really dig my eyeshadow brush into the product to get any color; not worth it.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that I had to wait for a month to revise my product because apparently it come from china</li>
            <li> Not even worth the small amount of money I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the same palettes manufactured from BH cosmetics &amp; Coastal Scents, even with their professional discount, the price I paid for this one was much lower, but I&#x27;m not sure if I sacrificed quality because of that</li>
            <li> While the product is fine, it arrived (from China) with a lot of broken shadows.</li>
            <li> Nice natural looking colors, too bad one of the shadows broke and got all over the outside, and inside of the pkg, and all over my hands when i opened it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not the quality that an adult would use.</li>
            <li> They are somewhat hard to get off of the pallet and they take a little more than usual to get the color to really show.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the packaging and the case is hard to open but for what I paid, I am sure it is OK.  </li>
            <li> Not deep colors....doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here and the eyeshadows were not entirely intact...</li>
            <li> it produce creasing and won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Long lasting if use correct.</li>
            <li> The colors are long lasting and well pigmented.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation was reasonable,  I mean not as much as more expensive brands</li>
            <li> The black shadow in the bottom corner of the palette had completely shattered.</li>
            <li> This is actually a lot bigger than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I can re set the shadow that stayed in its spot with alcohol, but there was quite a bit mixed in with others and loose all over the pallet.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, they&#x27;re not very pigmented so a primer is necessary.</li>
            <li> The palette itself was bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time actually earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Way bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> it arrived it was wrapped in thick bubble wrap, and then stuffed into a bubble wrap lined package, so there isn&#x27;t much room for error.</li>
            <li> So much good review, the product is a crap.</li>
            <li> An envelope was to small and my package was not secure right way.</li>
            <li> The broken ones were reduced to powder so that when I opened the box, there was a HUGE mess.</li>
            <li> Took very long to get here.</li>
            <li> the colors fade real easily only the darker colors last longer than the lighter colors but other than that its not worth $8.66.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day</li>
            <li> And it took so long to get to my home!!</li>
            <li> but when I went to open it there where two colors that had been broken and had to clean it up not very happy.</li>
            <li> I need from almost white to dark dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one not the colorful one such a disappointment didn&#x27;t bother to inform them I just kept it</li>
            <li> Colors are not very pigmented and do no show up well when applied to the eye area.</li>
            <li> After waiting a whole month for this palette it came to me with broken pieces and with lots of makeup film all over the plastic</li>
            <li> For the cost of the item I can&#x27;t complain too much, I would recommend this product but just be prepared for it to arrive with some shades broken.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> The case is not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected from rough hadling from shipping overseas.</li>
            <li> I also came to find out that the colors are not as pigmented as I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Not much pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Did not especially care for it leaves creases in eye lid and messy some were cracked would not recommend</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money .</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get the eye shadow on the brush when I was using an older cheaper brush.</li>
            <li> Colors are dull and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are doing makeup for photos, makeup prods that contain talc usually appear &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in photos.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented on the lack of pigment</li>
            <li> Was worried that it would come shattered because of other comments i read.</li>
            <li> It was alright not really as pretty as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I the other hand</li>
            <li> I showed a few family members that were make up lovers like my self and even a few that aren&#x27;t big make up junkies like my self</li>
            <li> The other half has some cream based eye-shadows with a bit of pigment.</li>
            <li> Not worth all the hassle</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the time, the mistake and the lack of service.</li>
            <li> My only complaint on the palette I received is that there are some sparkly colors that I wont use.  </li>
            <li> At least the seller got back to me promptly.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is of one of the colors.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken up into pieces, was a huge mess when finally received 6 weeks later :-(</li>
            <li> In the picture given, it shows that the palette is half light/half dark.</li>
            <li> It I could give it less</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not upset, I knew I would be taking a slight risk.</li>
            <li> It was shipped from China and when we opened it up our fingers turned black from all the colors mingling together.  </li>
            <li> less than a week too thinkibg</li>
            <li> Leaving black powder EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> : the black broke and ruined the rest of the colors, now they all are hinted with black, I even tried to wipe them off.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this color is oddly placed in this pallette</li>
            <li> , the colors were intact but the case was slightly cracked...</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s from overseas, but the very least they could do is put a fragile label on it so the other people handling the package don&#x27;t toss it around and treat it any sort of way.</li>
            <li> 10 of the shadows were smashed and a mess.  </li>
            <li> Came with a broken pot :/ and one random super neon pink shade.</li>
            <li> Basically something at little girl would play in</li>
            <li> These are just my little tricks to help.</li>
            <li> makeup for little girls to pkay.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little warmer.</li>
            <li> I did not get it when they said I would and had to have them re-send it and when I finally did receive it the case was broken and half of the make up was broke up and falling out</li>
            <li> Just expect some shattering and open VERY SLOWLY.</li>
            <li> It arrived 2 months later and one pot was broken and powder was all over the place.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tested out a few of the colors they seem a tad bit chalky but we&#x27;ll see when it comes time to put this to use.</li>
            <li> but then the second one I received was also broken.  </li>
            <li> Several of the colors were broken..</li>
            <li> I like it but few colors were broke when i got it</li>
            <li> I did a swatch test and what is supposed to be a dark black is coming out as a sad diluted grey.</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> I half expected to receive the pallet all broken and destroyed</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t want a broken up, dirty dusty palette in the mail thinking that we&#x27;re going to get something better.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say is that some of the lighter colors are very, VERY similar.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned that it would arrive with broken shadows, but none were broken!</li>
            <li> I received this product with eye shadows broken and the complete palette covered in the broken eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I can have my makeup done in 5 minutes with just a coverup brush and a small brush for liner.</li>
            <li> Waste of time, do not buy!</li>
            <li> not sure if they were supposed to be there</li>
            <li> Dark colors was spilled into light colors, ugh it was terrible.</li>
            <li> not ordering no more.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I received this it was crumbled very few shadows that are usable.</li>
            <li> but they are very messy.</li>
            <li> There was only a very thin piece of bubble wrap to protect it.</li>
            <li> I got less than 3 weeks !!</li>
            <li> not one of the shadows was broken like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.</li>
            <li> its not a strong pigment!</li>
            <li> So of course half the shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> Colors are dull, and they contain talc.</li>
            <li> Everyone is complaining about how hard it is to blend</li>
            <li> i swatched it , it was hard.</li>
            <li> The colors are all powder compacts and hardly vary at all from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering make-up online, worried that it would come in broken and unusable, but that wasn&#x27;t the case!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of negative reviews</li>
            <li> Delicate shadows,</li>
            <li> I noticed that a lot of customers complained that it was damaged when it arrived.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a thick piece of plastic covering the colors, there was sent fallout</li>
            <li> This product was terrible, cheap &amp; a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I now use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> i mean you get what you pay for buuuut</li>
            <li> This  product disappointed me a whole lot , it came in the mail all shatterd and broken</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I see alot of people saying there is not a good color payoff</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the photo and came late and broken.</li>
            <li> It arrived early, but the eye shadow was all over the pallet and were broken up :(</li>
            <li> First delayed&lt;br /&gt;Second horrible package</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this item and when I received it, both palettes had multiple colors broken during shipment. :(  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t come broken.</li>
            <li> Aldo complaining about broken colors when you opened it, you can just YouTube how to fix it, its from shipping NOT a product malfunction.</li>

            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt it since it is very poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not as bad as others, one of the eye shadows were all smashed and broken.</li>
            <li> worst eyeshadow pallet out there chalky not easy to blend.</li>
            <li> But when I opened it, I was disappointed and angry.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too mad about it because of the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> Eye shadows were almost all broken except a couple!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly IMPOSSIBLE to manipulate the colors in this palette for some reason.</li>
            <li> so bad  </li>
            <li> The eyeshadow colors were all chipped up and the it was badly packaged.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t that bad I would buy this again.</li>

            <li> UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR PACKAGING.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT WAS BROKEN  BEFORE GETTING DESTINATION.</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup novice and are wanting to buy something to play with...this is probably fine, but if you are expecting something great, this definitely is not shadow set to get. Colors are dull, and they contain talc. One thing I&#x27;ve learned along the way doing makeup-talc stinks! Especially if you are doing makeup for photos, makeup prods that contain talc usually appear &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; in photos. Spend your money on a &amp;#34;reputable&amp;#34; eye shadow kit. There are so many out there for reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Love this palette!! All the eye shadows are very pigmented and last long, considering the fact that I tried it as soon I received it (2 days) without any primer. Great deal for great price! 👍🏼</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is not the greatest,,,but there&#x27;s many nice colors. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, good product :)</li>
            <li> Not very impressed. Colors are dull and don&#x27;t last very long. Took a long time to get here and the eyeshadows were not entirely intact...</li>
            <li> I like the colors...really enjoy putting my makeup on....the colors aren&#x27;t to loud...no bad reaction to makeup...I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Colors are not very pigmented and do no show up well when applied to the eye area.</li>
            <li> This is actually a lot bigger than what I had expected. The pallet lookes much smaller in the picture. The colors are beautiful and are very nice once applied but dont last all day long.</li>
            <li> there no have too much pigmatation</li>
            <li> This palette is a bit thin. But it came in good timing and was exceptionally packaged. The colors are really nice too.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, they&#x27;re not very pigmented so a primer is necessary.</li>
            <li> i really loved  it  and  iwanted it  so bad  i think my cuzzin  for buying it for me  idk about it</li>
            <li> I love how many neutral colors this palette has. It is a little hard to get the eye shadow on the brush when I was using an older cheaper brush. So then I used one of my better quality brushes and it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. The packaging was nice as well and none of the shadows were damaged at all. So yeah :)</li>
            <li> It looks better online but shadows work great</li>
            <li> It seemed to be packaged pretty well but two of the colors broke anyway.  Fortunately there were other shades that were very similar and I don&#x27;t really miss the ones that broke.  The colors don&#x27;t have a ton of pigment, but this works fine for my 9-5 makeup routine, very natural looking for work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You typically get what you pay for, and in this case I feel like the product was well worth the price.  I will continue to use this palette on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Cheap materials.  The colors did not stay on. Threw out. Would not recommend if you want colors to stat on.</li>
            <li> Some colors do not transfer, cracks easily</li>
            <li> I love this palette the colors are so pigmented somr of the colors have a lil bit of fall out but other then that worth the 7bucks I payed for it</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented on the lack of pigment but I think my colors all have plenty of pigment. These colors are great for doing warm eyeshadow. On days at home when I don&#x27;t want to bother with foundation, etc I use this palette to do my face. one of the colors works as a coverup, two are great for contouring, I do my eyeshadow and use the black as a light liner. I can have my makeup done in 5 minutes with just a coverup brush and a small brush for liner. If it had a color that matched my brows I would have everything.&lt;br /&gt;My palette was wrapped in bubble wrap, then put in a box and that was also wrapped in bubble wrap and put in another box before it was sent and it arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;It was a great buy and I am thrilled with my purchase. A big five stars from me.</li>
            <li> So... I LOVE the colors, that&#x27;s the good, but I would NOT buy this again simple because ALL THE SHADOWS smell identical to acrylic paints. I value my eyesight and have only used them once, but if they begin to irritate my eyes I will discontinue. I would pay more next time for a palette that is SAFE FOR EYES and DOESNT SMELL LIKE PAINT from an art store. If I could, I would rate it 2.5 because the colors are gorgeous, but they DO NOT transfer well and are not pigmented. Hope this helps everyone when deciding to purchase!</li>
            <li> I received my palette a few days earlier than was expected and it was in very good shape, it was wrapped very nicely and safely.  I love the colors and they are the colors I usually use.  The warm colors are very lovely and blends very well. It is a perfect choice for warm toned people and it is a very good investment for the price.  Hope this helped.  :)</li>
            <li> It I could give it less I would I didint even get to try it came all broken</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even come. I wish I could give it zero stars</li>
            <li> colors are beautiful but waited nearly three weeks to get here  and case arrived cracked, not worth it to send it back to China for a replacement</li>
            <li> The palette was fantastic. One of the best neutral palettes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I wish I hadn&#x27;t dropped it.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a gift for my cousin. It arrived 2 months later and one pot was broken and powder was all over the place. I had to brush it off and ask if I should buy a replacement gift instead. Waste of time, do not buy!</li>
            <li> After waiting a whole month for this palette it came to me with broken pieces and with lots of makeup film all over the plastic and that&#x27;s just not except able I think I should get a refund or some kind of compensation for this I&#x27;m just not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I am fascinated with this palette. Totally recommended</li>
            <li> When I received this package today, I was SO EXCITED. But when I opened it, I was disappointed and angry. Even though it&#x27;s not as bad as others, one of the eye shadows were all smashed and broken. Even though it&#x27;s just one shadow, I expect what I order to be in the best condition possible. And that surely wasn&#x27;t it. And the palette and box holding it was FIL-THY. * I * had to clean it for Christ&#x27;s sake. The palette didn&#x27;t even look NEW. It looked crappy and like it had already been used. I understand it&#x27;s from overseas, but the very least they could do is put a fragile label on it so the other people handling the package don&#x27;t toss it around and treat it any sort of way. After all, eye shadow IS fragile. And from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;m not the only person that has experienced a broken shadow or two in the palette. They should really work on trying to make sure that that doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone anymore. We shouldn&#x27;t have to go through this. We pay our money to receive nice, top-of-the-line products. We don&#x27;t want a broken up, dirty dusty palette in the mail thinking that we&#x27;re going to get something better. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The package came undamaged and it has a very nice outer cover. I love all the natural/nude colors that it comes with. Nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great neutrals, with a couple of shimmery coppery and champagne-y colors and a matte black thrown in to deepen your nude looks, or make them more sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matte neutrals are great for base lids colors to build upon, light add a very dark cat eye, or a dark crease color to smoke out or a bright color on the lower lash line. The light colors are good for the waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
            <li> it produce creasing and won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product and it is what I needed. It was on time and I really appreciate everything! I&#x27;m in love with it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this pallet, my daughter loves it the colors are great and so is the price.</li>
            <li> Love the colors great quality</li>
            <li> Not too good for darker skin tones but i use it in my make up effects kit now.</li>
            <li> Thanks came fast. All the colors are the same. And none came broken. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Took a while for the package to come , overall it&#x27;s a okay</li>
            <li> good pallet wish it was more pigmented!!!</li>
            <li> This was such a reasonable price so I&#x27;m not upset, I knew I would be taking a slight risk. I have to admit that I was not happy with this palette. The color(s) don&#x27;t transfer well. It&#x27;s nearly IMPOSSIBLE to manipulate the colors in this palette for some reason. I&#x27;m a makeup artist &amp; I&#x27;ve tried different brush techniques, &amp; NONE of those techniques worked. The color would collect in little areas, kind of cake up in little spots even with an eyeshadow primer. I&#x27;ve seen the same palettes manufactured from BH cosmetics &amp; Coastal Scents, even with their professional discount, the price I paid for this one was much lower, but I&#x27;m not sure if I sacrificed quality because of that or if I would experience the same thing had I bought the palette from the other companies at a higher price,.... who knows? I was hoping to have one palette designated for bridal makeup &amp; those who want to look natural (like they don&#x27;t have any makeup on) but I won&#x27;t be using this on anyone. I got this for under $10 so again, I&#x27;m not upset, I&#x27;ll find some use for it until I get a better neutral palette, one that I&#x27;ll more likely design/create using Inglots freedom system, before tossing or donating this one to a younger relative. I also purchased the 168 color palette from this same seller, not sure if this palette has the same manufacturer, and if they do, I cannot explain why the other palette is so great as opposed to this one, esp. if the ingredients are the same, but it is what it is. This palette looks like a great neutral palette, the eyeshadows aren&#x27;t user friendly though. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible, cheap &amp; a waste of money!! The colors do not go on your eye without applying a bunch of times &amp; even then it rubs off very easily. the pigment sucks would not recommend this to anyone else!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what  I ordered.  The colors shown were neutrals but I was sent neon colors.  I just gave it to my girls to play with,</li>
            <li> It was shipped from China and when we opened it up our fingers turned black from all the colors mingling together.  What a mess!  Did get a refund.</li>
            <li> I like this palette i was just hoping there would be some darker browns, they are more of a  red brown, but i can work with what it has, its still a nice neutral palette.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! I will definitely purchase more from this seller!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. When my package finally arrived, I was thrilled with how well they worked. You definitely cannot beat this bargain!!</li>
            <li> I love my eye Palette, Well I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the packaging was very neat. It looks just like the picture above. I will come back to let you know how it turns out</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Best neutral pallet I have ever bought. All the right colors. Pigmentation is ok on some of the matte but the shimmers are awesome! love it highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the colors in the palette. I saw a lot of negative reviews but I love neutral colors. The pigmentation was reasonable,  I mean not as much as more expensive brands but I was able to createbeautiful eye looks.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loves these colors</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the packaging and the case is hard to open but for what I paid, I am sure it is OK.  It was a gift so havent heard back from the receiver.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors (darker colors with shimmer) were pigmented , the lighter matte colors weren&#x27;t so much. You gotta really brush your make up brushes into the colors and really pack it on. But over all its still a good palette for those who are more into natural looks or neutral. I would say its a good palette to start off with if your just starting to use makeup, because it&#x27;s not so much or overwhelming for you to handle. Other than higher end products that might tend to be too much.. it&#x27;s a good way yo start learning til your comfortable enough to use makeup that will stand out more</li>
            <li> This  product disappointed me a whole lot , it came in the mail all shatterd and broken and I was only able salvage  a couple of the eye shadows !!!!! Very disappointed and felt my money was wasted and it took very long than it wa supposed to , to even reach me !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this item and when I received it, both palettes had multiple colors broken during shipment. :(  The highlighting shades are my favorite, wish the browns were richer and darker brown. They seem to have to much under tones of red or orange instead of being a rich brown.  For the cost of the item I can&#x27;t complain too much, I would recommend this product but just be prepared for it to arrive with some shades broken.</li>
            <li> I like well made make up-but when I got this-I was so happy I tried it out, put the colors on just right and they help with age.&lt;br /&gt;So many great things about this-colors to choose never a loss of the perfect color. Love this one it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Is nice but very chalky need a good primer to show them off nice if you like light browns and cream whites</li>
            <li> I love it, it came it a nicely secured box at a reasonable time. The colors are very pigmented, they look even better with a really good eye primer. My eyeshadow brush picks up a good amount but the only thing I have a problem with is that some times I&#x27;ll pick up way too much with my eye shadow brush with the just the lightest dab.</li>
            <li> This pallet is perfect. It has all the colors a girl who&#x27;s just getting into makeup needs! Just the right amounts of mattes and shimmers.</li>
            <li> I was happy when the product came earlier than expected but I wasn&#x27;t happy when I open the palette and 3 eye shadows where totally destroyed! And now I have to wait another three weeks just to get a new palette! Not worth all the hassle</li>
            <li> Came with a broken pot :/ and one random super neon pink shade. And the shadow has a low color pay off.  Kinda disappointed. Guess you get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Colors are nice. The palette itself was bigger than I expected. They aren&#x27;t very vibrant, though. And don&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> I just loved it for the price and lots of just neutral colors awesome deal and their just great colors they look great in my eyes. And got shipped in less than a week too thinkibg it was gonna take like a month since thats wat my review order said but it did came within 5 days !!! defantly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Once I got the item, it was completely destroyed, it was not how i expected it,i do recommend this item but not the way i received it.</li>
            <li> It got here super quick. The PRICE WAS GREAT. They didn&#x27;t come broken. I am really really happy with my purchase. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> Great because there are many different colors. Some are sparkles and some are matte. Love the verity even though I only really use like 4 of them. ;)</li>
            <li> I am in love with all the colors they are so warm and sexy in a way! You can make many different looks which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> Colors suck. They definitely don&#x27;t go on the way you would expect them to. Just not a representation of the true color.</li>
            <li> From a make-up artist:  I love this palette-every shade of brown I need from almost white to dark dark brown.  My clients think it&#x27;s really something fancy and I can do any eye I want with this.  The colors are true and have plenty of pigment.&lt;br /&gt;At this price, each member of my staff can have one-they look very professional and are very slim for easy packing and stacking.</li>
            <li> amazinggg i love his palette! the colors are beautiful! this palette is mixed with matte and shimmery colors, colors are very good, they blend out very smoothly, i used the matte brown to contour my face, and the light ivory colors the highlight my face, it looks bigger in pictures but the size is really good, and the palette it self is very light weight. very good buy for the price, loving it!</li>
            <li> They sent me the totally wrong order. I double checked three times and this palette with eyeshadow colors is what is in my order but instead, I received a palette of red and orange blush-colors! I have not heard anything back from the seller. I will not purchase again from them. Definitely not worth the time, the mistake and the lack of service.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong pallete I ordered this one not the colorful one such a disappointment didn&#x27;t bother to inform them I just kept it</li>
            <li> The colors are good I just wished the pigmentation was a little better...I had to keep applying and applying until I saw color....</li>
            <li> This is nice to have because of all of the colors. Great for a 3 color contour look.you dont feel like younhave alot of make up on your eye, its not heavy.</li>
            <li> My make up pallete came all broke! An envelope was to small and my package was not secure right way. It all broke. I want my money back!</li>
            <li> having fun with this pallete, glides on easy, blends easy and the different shades can b easily mixed to get the right shade for your skin tone</li>
            <li> LOVED IT!!! A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> The Eyeshadow was fair quality. It wasn&#x27;t chalky or old looking. Applied very nicely. I was very glad that it wasn&#x27;t a cheaply made product for what I spent.</li>
            <li> This pallets was awesome but I was so supriesed because it isn&#x27;t the same colors u see, it&#x27;s more pinky toned the brown, great pigmentation with eyeshadow primer!! It&#x27;s worth the money!!$$$</li>
            <li> Very nice colors natural look on my skin . I recommended exactly as it is on the picture for cheap price 😉</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeshadow palette with a large selection of color!! I will definitely buy more of this as well!!</li>
            <li> the pigmentation of these colors is not where I had hoped it would be.  I know it is cheap but lots of the cheap makeups are now pretty pigmented and this one just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing and really good for its price . I rated it a 4 only because there were these tiny black/purplish specks in a couple of the colors not sure if they were supposed to be there but they don&#x27;t show up at all when applying . I just don&#x27;t really like the look of the dots or specks in the eyeshadow but other than that it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I received this it was crumbled very few shadows that are usable. I was so disappointed since I was looking so forward to receiving this.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. The case is not very sturdy. I didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t come with no applicators. I&#x27;ve only used it once and it is already a mess.the colors get mixed together to easy .&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> I had a horrible time with this product and wish I would have listened to the reviews.  The product took FOREVER to come because its from overseas and it was EXTREMELY lightly packaged. Because of the lack of packaging, 11 of the shadows were smashed and all over the place.  I opened it up and shadow went everywhere.  I contacted the seller and they were very quick to respond and said they would send another one out.  I tried to explain the problem was with their lack of packaging and recommended more protection, however it was a waste of time- they sent it out exactly like the first one - so after again waiting forever for it to arrive... 10 of the shadows were smashed and a mess.  Though the shadows seem nice and pigmented, unless they change their packaging, you will not receive a full palette that you can use.</li>
            <li> *for the 28 color pallet*&lt;br /&gt;You can never take a good picture of makeup, of course its going to look slightly different than pictures. They all have a slight glimmer to them, especially the dusty rose in the top right corner. The black is kind of matte, I use my fingers to apply (I like it better) and do pretty complex smokey looks, it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as the others but for the price (remember the price 28 eye shadows for the same price as a small drug store container which both end up working the same) I haven&#x27;t used all of the colors yet but the ones I have worked great. There&#x27;s a thick piece of plastic covering the colors, there was sent fallout but that&#x27;s expected from rough hadling from shipping overseas. Says you ship from China but my package says Sweden. Everyone is complaining about how hard it is to blend but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s a user error not the product itself. Aldo complaining about broken colors when you opened it, you can just YouTube how to fix it, its from shipping NOT a product malfunction. Over all pretty good. Not the best pallet I&#x27;ve ever had but for the price its great. I just wish I known it was glittery dusty colors.</li>
            <li> Love the colors  last long and blends in good 👌 bigger then I had thought fits in any bag to go</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, took about a month or a little more to come and I already have 1 fall out for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;Some colors are good pigmented, not all. The black is a nice matte black which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> The palette I received is by a makeup company called Gaga.  It is NOT the palette advertised. My only complaint on the palette I received is that there are some sparkly colors that I wont use.  However, on the matte colors in this palette, I am really pleased.  They are gorgeous neutral colors that I can use to create a really natural makeup look.  These colors could probably even be used to contour and highlight.  They go on easily and they didn&#x27;t crease throughout the day despite the heat.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful! they are kind of light and hard to tell if you have on, but adding more helps for me. The dark browns are perfect for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The palette took forever to come , like literally over 2 months.  And when they did come, almost all of the colors were chopped up. Dark colors was spilled into light colors, ugh it was terrible.</li>
            <li> The choices for tone is vastly appealing, numerous.  I do love this.  Leaving off a star because for me and my environment this case is a bit large.</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! All the colors were very neutral but usable!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great item, arrived with all colors in tact which is always a good thing. The colors are the exact range that I wanted, some shimmer, some are a more matted color, great for natural smokey eyes.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation for the vast majority of the colors are terrible. Very disappointing. Also, the colors pictured here are misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get much better shadows from Wet n Wild if you need something cheap but useable.</li>
            <li> Really nice pigmented colors. Very happy with product.  Beautiful  matte colors.  They go on very nicely and give a beautiful color.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful...color pay off not so much very chalky however after several uses the color payoff improves and very blendable so over all I really like it</li>
            <li> I have to really dig my eyeshadow brush into the product to get any color; not worth it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the selection. Great price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice item, smooth and applies good on eyes. Long lasting if use correct. I just like it. There is also good colors for correcting eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette. I use it every single day and I love how smooth and creamy the formula for the shadows is. The only downside is that when I received this in the mail, one of the shadows had shattered and pieces of it were everywhere. Delicate shadows, but that&#x27;s what you get sometimes when you order makeup online.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for their price very difficult to blend  but if you know how to put on make up then you should be</li>
            <li> the colors are not the same all the colors are to light</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get it but when I went to open it there where two colors that had been broken and had to clean it up not very happy.</li>
            <li> Really good product. I recommend that!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. Im aware I wasnt expecting ”Mac” quality obvisously, but I could get product better than this stuff in the toy isle of a dollar tree. I recomend BH Cosmetics products if you are looking for a good buy.</li>
            <li> I got it in perfect condition, the colors are lovely and stay very well. I plan on buying more :)</li>
            <li> Colors were exactly as shown but were pretty low quality. Still wearable!</li>
            <li> The pigment is okay not bad actually but when you get it the smell is sooo bad omg and its not that neutral to be honest its really more on the pink side, the browns are NOT like the picture</li>
            <li> great product, fast  shipping</li>
            <li> Love the palette , its perfect for an everyday make up</li>
            <li> worst eyeshadow pallet out there chalky not easy to blend.</li>
            <li> not pigmented at all. but guess its whats its price is for. not ordering no more. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product....was exactly what I had hoped for and a great bargain..arrived safe and sound and was wrapped well for delivery....very happy customer !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for it&#x27;s variety and warm, neutral shades since I have blue eyes. I was extremely excited to receive this palette. The first thing I noticed when I opened the palette was the almost perfumey smell coming from the shadows. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to have a reaction to the shadows since I have very sensitive skin so I tested them out on my arm. I also came to find out that the colors are not as pigmented as I expected them to be. I find myself very rarely reaching for this palette. The palette includes matte and shimmer shades. I&#x27;m not disappointed w/ the palette but I am not overly raving about it either. I&#x27;m content w/ this palette. For the price, it&#x27;s a very good deal. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this review seems quite negative but I would definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> I Love this product but packing need to be done carefully two came broken</li>
            <li> Nice palette; colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I like, but it has great colors. Delivery was fast and product was intact, not one of the shadows was broken like I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews. I need to use it more to decide if I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> I just received the pallet and one of the colors was broken. So far I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> Not much pigmentation. Basically something at little girl would play in</li>
            <li> It is great for natural tones! I would recommend using concealer and my personal trick a wet brush and then hairspray over your eyes after applying however much you want on. They are somewhat hard to get off of the pallet and they take a little more than usual to get the color to really show. The wet brush allows you to pick up more of the eyeshadow color and it drys it onto the eyelid helping it to stay longer. The hairspray works as like a setting and holding spray. These are just my little tricks to help. If you do the wet brush trick make sure you wet it and dab it off on cloth or something before picking a different color as it will mix with the other color because of how much it can get on the brush! Hope this helped :)</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.  Very pigmented and creamy to the touch.  I recommend this pallette. Very compact too. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wife loved her set! Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> My palette arrived with eye shadows that were crumbled everywhere. The pigment on half of the palette are very light and I can barely see the colors. The other half has some cream based eye-shadows with a bit of pigment. Lesson learned..&amp;#34; you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did not especially care for it leaves creases in eye lid and messy some were cracked would not recommend</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors that last all day. There very neutral colors and this is exactly what I was looking for can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed by this product. The colors are way off from the picture. They are more rose and peach, which I do not use.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer to a brush or your eye... it&#x27;s weird. It turns to powder and then wont allow the brush to pick it up. Even using your finger the color wont transfer. This may be ok for a young girl just learning to use make up (Although I would not have my own daughter use this) but it&#x27;s certainly not the quality that an adult would use. Would love my money back.</li>
            <li> Ughhhh! I LOVE this eye shadow I now use it everyday!!♥ it has all the best colors for an everyday look</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price and the shadow itself last a long time when wearing  it</li>
            <li> It arrived early, but the eye shadow was all over the pallet and were broken up :( the colors look nice though</li>
            <li> It melted before I got it in the mail. It was a waste of money. I was not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This was a great by, lovely smokey eyes colours.... a great all rounder, a must in every womans make up collection.</li>
            <li> Not deep colors....doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow colors were all chipped up and the it was badly packaged.</li>
            <li> Great Palette for everyday wear</li>
            <li> Just receive this pallete today and I was suprised to see how big it was! Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that big... I tested out a few of the colors they seem a tad bit chalky but we&#x27;ll see when it comes time to put this to use. Overall the colors are nice and it was an afordable price so can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> No staying power and lightly pigmented. Definitely very cheap.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister, she was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> packaging was 99% perfect. i swatched out most of the shadows and it&#x27;s not the greatest pigment. i mean you get what you pay for buuuut i would suggest paying an extra. $10 on a bH cosmetics palette or something. ill see if my mac fix plus will enhance the pigment</li>
            <li> Great pallet for the price! Purchased twice!</li>
            <li> While the product is fine, it arrived (from China) with a lot of broken shadows. The broken ones were reduced to powder so that when I opened the box, there was a HUGE mess. It was to be a Christmas gift for my adult daughter. I gave her the choice of keeping it (as is) or returning it (to China). She liked what was left of it, so opted to keep it. I don&#x27;t think I could recommend the purchase, given the arrival condition.</li>
            <li> works very well and was shipped quick</li>
            <li> Got in good amount of time. Great colors.</li>
            <li> i loved it, but it took for ever so i could receive it. when i bought it the confirmation said it would take 4- 6 days. I got it in a month.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected. Nothing was broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I tested a color (the goldish color right above the black) as soon as I got it and has decent pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely needs to be used with softer brushes and not stiff ones.</li>
            <li> The shipping took a good while, but I accidentally forgot to change my mailing address.&lt;br /&gt;they corrected the error and I recieved it at the correct address.&lt;br /&gt;product is intact and I do like the colors. It isnt name brand or anything. It doesnt even have a name on the packaging. But I love the product. Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> estoy conforme , estoy muy contento con este producto son de muy buena calidad y en envio fue realmente rapido</li>
            <li> The palette itself is really nice.  Colors are pretty, good for the office or bridal makeup.  However, the shipping leaves a lot to be desired.  The first time I ordered I received it with one shadow busted all over the package.  Thin bubble wrap and the minute I opened the bag I knew before I opened the box.  I filed a claim and let them know, and they were good about sending me another one to replace it.  I was excited but then the second one I received was also broken.  I decided to contact them just to let them know that they really need to pack better as mail gets tossed around a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the palette itself is nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t order powdered makeup from this seller again as the packaging just isn&#x27;t sturdy enough to prevent breakage.  At least the seller got back to me promptly.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and is a really beautiful palette! Pretty accurate to the picture as well. I have not used it since it&#x27;s a gift for someone, so I don&#x27;t know how good the eyeshadows are themselves which is why I gave it 4 stars. Also, the plastic between the shadows, on the inside, is rather flimsy and cheap, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because otherwise, the product looks gorgeous and expensive and the actual palette itself is pretty nice. I was very concerned that it would arrive with broken shadows, but none were broken! It was packaged very well in two boxes with 3 layers of bubble wrap. Great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> I got this palette for the light colors, because I lay those down on my eye first, so when I blend, it gives the darker colors something close to my skin color to blend with. In the picture given, it shows that the palette is half light/half dark. The actual palette is mostly light, with 3 dark colors. Now, like I said, I wanted the light colors, so I&#x27;m not upset about that BUT if you&#x27;re wanting what was pictures, don&#x27;t order this. Because that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re gonna get.</li>
            <li> When I received the package i was very happy. Until i actually opened it. The black shadow in the bottom corner of the palette had completely shattered. Leaving black powder EVERYWHERE. It got on my clothes, my hands, by face, legitimately EVERYWHERE. I wasn&#x27;t too mad about it because of the price I paid for it (you get what you pay for right?) The colors blend nicely and I like that they aren&#x27;t all shimmery. I am more of a matte girl so I was pleased about that. Just expect some shattering and open VERY SLOWLY. lol</li>
            <li> I can work with the colors if I really want to, not as pigmented as I expected at all. I&#x27;d go ahead and get the actual Coast Scents palette that they offer, because ive heard it is a lot better quality. Contemplating purchasing that one to compare. Spend more money and get an actual brand one.</li>
            <li> Which ever color is on the far right second from top, was completely missing. I got damaged goods as it seemed to have been smashed out and brushed away. Not as though it happened in transit as the rest were fine.</li>
            <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> showed up broken and then only 2 of the colors are pigmented or smooth to apply. This is the worst makeup I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> With all the reviews I read on this palette, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The colors looked  exactly as seen on the pictures, decent amount of product in the pan. They arrived perfectly intact. The pallet itself is light weight, but sturdy, great for travel. The color pay off was good, the colors are easy to blend. I would recommend using a primer. The only bad thing I have to say is that some of the lighter colors are very, VERY similar.</li>
            <li> When I received my eyeshadow many if them were broken, and the eye shadows did not go on well. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> When I first purchase this item I though it might not be that great bc of the price . I got less than 3 weeks !! And it looks amazing !! Must buy. !!</li>
            <li> My pallete came perfectly packaged and as for the product.. The colors are very pigmented. LOVE THIS !!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad. Needs to be applied with a primer. Took very long to get here. Was worried that it would come shattered because of other comments i read. It wasn&#x27;t shattered but the top of the case had marks on it as if it had come into contact with nail polish remover or something but you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Very nice inexpensive palette however I was looking for the morphe natural warm palette which has more colors in a larger neutral range. But I will be using this on fair skin clients. The shipping was fast and the product was in new condition. It also came packaged great! The shadows are still very pretty just for suitable for fair skin women</li>
            <li> Wanted a 28 WARM got 28 COOL, who even knew that it existed? I sure didn&#x27;t. The warm palette is fantastic, the colors are very well pigmented and long lasting with or without a primer. This bootsie cool palette, not so much. I did a swatch test and what is supposed to be a dark black is coming out as a sad diluted grey. VERY disappointing. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of CrazyCart bc they will blame you for their shipping mistakes, so once whatever you thought you were buying is in the mail, it&#x27;s off their hands and your new folly.</li>
            <li> Pro: shipped quickly looks nice, low price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the black broke and ruined the rest of the colors, now they all are hinted with black, I even tried to wipe them off.  Doesnt show up well, have to use a lot of the lighter colors to see them. Olive-tan skin tone</li>
            <li> It was alright not really as pretty as I thought they would be. Wished they were more colorful. Enjoy using them but they are very messy.</li>
            <li> LOVED this palette! Almost all of the shades are completely matte</li>
            <li> The colors are okay however they are very thin and not enough especially if you like one color more than the other.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadow, was happy with the product exactly as shown in pictures.  Shipped on time actually earlier than expected.  Would order again, definitely</li>
            <li> For the price i didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Shipping took a very ling time i think i waited almost a month. Nothing was broken thank goodness! I see alot of people saying there is not a good color payoff but i think the colors are buildable. With a good primer it works, i like it!</li>
            <li> Great pallets i had it for about a year now and still get alot of use from it and im sure its will still get alot of use. When u find something good u tend to tell friends and family so this was one of those things I had to share I showed a few family members that were make up lovers like my self and even a few that aren&#x27;t big make up junkies like my self and they all loved it and ordered pallets fir them selves. You can seriously never gi wring with a neutral pallet andtth I one here is amazing is has some. Shimmer shadows and mate as well.also a great gift very affordable with amazing quality!</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money . It does not show up at all . I tried and tried . It looks good in the case but does not transfer to your skin!!! Sorry, Judy.T.</li>
            <li> Two of the eye Shadows were busted when I got them. It was a total mess to clean up the inside and outside of the case.</li>
            <li> Nice eyeshadow for my business of make up they are very nice color and variety I do professional make up and this color are really intense and beautiful and stay long.</li>
            <li> Perfect for anytime, traveling, great price, nice container. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This pallet is actually nice for it to be inexpensive or use it underneath my eyes and or above my eye no complaints on this pallet what actually order from this retailer again</li>
            <li> totally not what i was looking for. i returned it right away the colors i wanted where all natural but when i got the order it did not seem like that i didn&#x27;t like one bit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Make up artist, and this palette is an absolute MUST HAVE for any kit. It covers all your Neutral, warm shades and is PERFECT for bridal. I also enjoy using it on younger clients or anyone who is a little afraid of makeup still but wants to look natural and nice.</li>
            <li> Very impressive, I&#x27;d been wanting a palette of a bunch of Mac warm eyeshadow shades but we all know those are at least $100 and I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that much so of course I came to Amazon looking for a different less-expensive alternative and I found this, and I have to say it was even better than I expected, and for the $7.50 I paid it&#x27;s an absolute no-brainer.  I can&#x27;t think of a better more practical gift for a young makeup lover on a budget, it took a little while to arrive but it was well worth the wait, very happy:)</li>
            <li> The thing that I love is, it doesn&#x27;t spread out when I use it ! I the other hand some colors look the same ! but in general I like it</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow palette was crumbled and has no staying power at all. Worst purchase ever! Not even worth the small amount of money I paid.</li>
            <li> :( my eye shadow were all broken</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this palette. I recommend it to anyone who is a makeup beginner or just someone who loves to expand their collection! The colors are beautifully pigmented and suitable for many different skin tones. This is a great alternative for those of you who want a cheaper pallette that has enough colors to do many looks with. The only complaint I have is of one of the colors. Although it&#x27;s hard to tell in the photo, there is a very bright pink. I feel like this color is oddly placed in this pallette and I would have liked to see a deep green or navy instead. Overall great pallette and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> First delayed&lt;br /&gt;Second horrible package&lt;br /&gt;Third the eye shadows don&#x27;t have any pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Good makeup for little girls to pkay. I gave it to my niece! So much good review, the product is a crap.</li>
            <li> it was very cheap and the shadows are so easy to apply and last for along time. the only thing is that I had to wait for a month to revise my product because apparently it come from china but it was wort it</li>
            <li> This eye palette is OK. I just wish they would package it better when they ship it because 2 of the colors were broken but as far as colors it have all the neutral &amp; natural colors &amp; that every woman must have.</li>
            <li> MY PURCHASED ARRIVED SOONER THE DELIVERY DATE STATED. THE ITEM IS AS DESCRIBE. I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE PIGMENTATION. AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES NATURAL EYE MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors! It has so many nice matte colors that will work with any look.Amazjng quality,comparable to more expensive brands.Definetly a good steal</li>
            <li> I love it!! ... I thought because of the price the product was gonna be cheap, but it&#x27;s actually really good .. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> The colors are a lot lighter than showed in the picture and a lot of them are very similar but decent quality</li>
            <li> The pallete has some shimmer which I am no fan of shimmer but it barely has any on some of the colors and it is easy to apply and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> This is actually much nicer than I had expected and the colors are very nice as well. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette to have on hand. I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t use all the colors, but I mix and blend a lot of the colors I thought I wouldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m so excited waiting for my palette to arrive and when it does.... it&#x27;s a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;Shadow chalk is pretty much everywhere and 5 shadows are broken. I don&#x27;t know if this happened in shipping or if the shadows are just so fragile that this occurred but I was highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual shadows, they&#x27;re decent. I guess they&#x27;re good for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet! I bought it a while ago and till this day it&#x27;s my go to product!</li>
            <li> I did not get it when they said I would and had to have them re-send it and when I finally did receive it the case was broken and half of the make up was broke up and falling out</li>
            <li> I received this product with eye shadows broken and the complete palette covered in the broken eyeshadow. The lighter colors are not pigmented at all. Most just a shimmer. The darker colors are naturally more pigmented. Guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This eye shadow arrived in good condition, and the colors are very nice. I noticed that a lot of customers complained that it was damaged when it arrived. I don&#x27;t doubt it since it is very poorly packaged.</li>
            <li> Silky and smooth. Feels like its wet which makes It look beautiful! Recommend to everyone and I love to do my makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. Way bigger than I expected. The pigmentation is okay. If you use some primer it&#x27;s great! I was really shocked to see the the colors are not chalky at all! Very smooth. They packaged it really nicely. There was like 5 layers of bubble wrap! Overall it&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> The compact is incredibly thin, which I love. It is a little cheap, but it&#x27;s about what I expected given the price. They are highly pigmented and they go on smoothly. The only real criticism I have is that the pictures are slightly deceiving; the colors have more rose undertones than yellow undertones. I was looking for something a little warmer.</li>
            <li> the colors are horrible&lt;br /&gt;its fake. As soon as i opened it, i knew it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;you know how you can tell when the cover is fake. there was no name on it or anything.&lt;br /&gt;when i swatched it , it was hard. Dont recommend it</li>
            <li> When I bought it I was so excited but when I received it i was so disappointed. Several of the colors were broken..and they were all the ones I really wanted this pallet for. Now the pallet is my daughter&#x27;s for dress up her dress up party.</li>
            <li> The colors were not quite the same shades as what was shown. And it took so long to get to my home!!</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened this package and realized this was my  eye shadow, and not the scarf I assumed it had to be based on the flimsy packaging, I was extremely disappointed. There was only a very thin piece of bubble wrap to protect it. So of course half the shadows were broken. I can re set the shadow that stayed in its spot with alcohol, but there was quite a bit mixed in with others and loose all over the pallet.</li>
            <li> Great product, good selection of colors and it has a good texture-make-up stays on all day and it is a very slim and light weight case</li>
            <li> It took some time to get here but was worh it. One of the colors fell out but that not a problem... I&#x27;m 15 and never wore make-up before so I figured that (not only was it cheap) but it was very natural so it would be a smooth transition to get used to the look. I might not have been using the right brush but it doesn&#x27;t really show up on my eyelid.... The dark browns give the color of a light tan or even a peach(keeping in mind that I am as white as paper) I thought the colours would be more rich even hough they are a bit oily. Maybe I&#x27;ll have more luck with a powder based eyeshadow. Overall it was a decent prouduct and it might not have been very successful for me but it might suit your skin tone better.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, comes off nicely, and stays great. Not my favorite product in the world but it still works great</li>
            <li> will order another for girfriend, she loves it</li>
            <li> Arrived broken up into pieces, was a huge mess when finally received 6 weeks later :-( end up throwing it away</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, the package is good too,  the delivery was on time and the price is excellent. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like these pretty colors and the item I received not the same. Mine are very neutral but not like that picture. Lighting maybe. Still nice and they have sparkle. Delivered ahead of time</li>
            <li> I really love the colors of the eyeshadow a they are super pigmented! But the plastic is super cheap and it arrived broken which is why only 3 stars. Once I cleaned it up it was great to add to my collection:)</li>
            <li> I love this product especially for the price. I half expected to receive the pallet all broken and destroyed but that was not the case, the colors were intact but the case was slightly cracked... no big deal. The colors are long lasting and well pigmented.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LIKE THESE COLORS.  IT LOOK GOOD ON PICTURE BUT IN PERSON THE COLORS IS HORRIBLE.  NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the photo and came late and broken.</li>
            <li> Package came broken!!!  Eye shadows were almost all broken except a couple!!</li>
            <li> ❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️In love with this I use it every day I definitely recommend these 👌👌</li>
            <li> Pretty nice for the price.  They go on pretty well it is a tad but light though.  For the price I can&#x27;t complain.  Quality isn&#x27;t that bad I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like it but few colors were broke when i got it</li>
            <li> Love the colores in this pallet amazed on the quality</li>
            <li> Perfect Shades , Pigmented, Smooth looks , Just Great ! :)</li>
            <li> I liked that it came faster then expected but i wasn&#x27;t happy that it came to be with the case broken/chipped and one of the eye shadows were broken and there was makeup everywhere on the others as well. but i really cant complain because i guess you get what you pay for. but the next time i by something i will be going to mac products, yea they are pretty pricey but in the end i will pay that much for makeup just because i never had problems with there products ever.</li>
            <li> Make up pallet had four broken shades of color in it when it arrived to me. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> fabulous natural eye shades!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, but package arrived severly damaged.</li>
            <li> relying on her she said put all stars she loves--but she also like bieber soooooo take her advice for what you will</li>
            <li> all the colors are nice. they are pretty and it came really quick so i was happy about that. easy to open the palette. all of my friends loved the eye shadow colors.</li>
            <li> i dont like this pallet the&#x27;re not strong colors at all you need to apply so many times. its not a strong pigment! the colors fade real easily only the darker colors last longer than the lighter colors but other than that its not worth $8.66.</li>
            <li> Love the colors! Blends fairly well, great buy!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering make-up online, worried that it would come in broken and unusable, but that wasn&#x27;t the case!&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived it was wrapped in thick bubble wrap, and then stuffed into a bubble wrap lined package, so there isn&#x27;t much room for error. The colors are all powder compacts and hardly vary at all from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;You get exactly what you expect with this product!</li>
            <li> Took over a month to get but it&#x27;s while worth the wait love it.</li>
            <li> I love the different neutral shades, they go with everything. I can mix and match and wear a new look every day. They last all day and blend together well.</li>
            <li> This is also the same eyeshadow that costal scents sells for 10.00 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eyeshadows are like chalk. They have no pigment. Someone compared all of them to mac shades.....I have most of those mac shades and it is NOTHING close.&lt;br /&gt;These are just terrible.</li>
            <li> Nice natural looking colors, too bad one of the shadows broke and got all over the outside, and inside of the pkg, and all over my hands when i opened it.</li>
            <li> Shadows not pigmented and came with a shadow that was shattered. Dust everywhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent products !!</li>
            <li> This eye-shadow are a high picment . The quality is great they are how they describe . Perfect for a smoky eye  look</li>
            <li> Loved this pallet and u can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is a nice warm colored eyeshadow pallet nice colors and go&#x27;s  on smooth thanks amazon😉 and what you pay this is veryyyyyy cheap you wont regret this at all!!! Get yours TODAY.</li>
            <li> I was very unsatisfied with this product! I had ordered a couple of things and this was the one I was most excited for. When I received it I was very glad to see that it was all in one piece! But when I was testing out the different shades they all had the same color! They did not show up at all I even tried it on a lighter tone skin and nothing! An item that you might look into if your looking for brighter colors would be \\&quot;Shany Eyeshadow Palette, Boutique, 40 Color\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, some not so much. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> It came in all broke and what not.. Upset because it wasn&#x27;t was I was expecting either</li>
