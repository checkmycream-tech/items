            <li> This stuff is very hot and burns a lot I tried to was it off but it didn&#x27;t help if you can stand the burning then it&#x27;s great but if you have sensitive skin the this prob isn&#x27;t go u it makes you feel like ur on fire literally</li>
            <li> This product does burn like crazy, but i do feel that it has worked, I just don&#x27;t like the burning so much.</li>
            <li> The product was damaged seems there was a punctured in it but the seller was great gave me a refund and j got to keep the item althought it was not able to keep since it was spilling all over the place if did save a bit in a zip lock bag and it burns not to much I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working I did sweat much more wit my waist trainer n the gel and my skin looks much softer and shiny no complaints the burning heat is bare able</li>
            <li> Hot Tamale&#x27;,  I&#x27;m not certain if the slimming gel worked, but I can clearly say that it is HOT!!!!.  I thought my skin was burning, but it wasn&#x27;t it was the sensation of the gel on my skin that was hot!!!</li>
            <li> Just got mines today can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
            <li> this really helps with the sweating it heats up in like 10-15 mins and you can feel the burn! will be ordering again</li>
            <li> It is hot stuff but not that hot as i would liked it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really heats up like almost HOT!  Couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m losing more in my belly than usual w this under my waist band made by sweat sweat on Amazon... Which is also one of best sweatband ever! Will be ordering more soon!!!</li>
            <li> The ones I used before hotter than this. I bought 2 items from same seller and still paid double shipping!</li>

            <li> This stuff works. It burns like nothing else, but it has definitely helped my skin become tighter. I usually put this one, and then my Ann Chery latex waist cincher. With this slimming gel, make sure to take enough time to rub it in. It seems to work best with more friction when applying. I will be buying some more in the future!</li>
            <li> Did not work. Way too hot.</li>
