            <li> Got this as a gift for my mom...she LOVED them!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what i needed them for.</li>
            <li> Nice items.  Would recommend them.  They fit nicely in suitcase for traveling, and they are also useful for kids&#x27; items.</li>
            <li> These bags are beyond my expectations! I am going to be able to us this in multiple bags!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to go with my Shany clear carrying bag to sort out my makeup products. They&#x27;re nice but a little bigger than ehst I expected. The large one can&#x27;t even fit into my bag, and the second to large one is just fiting, if I s queen it in there. The quality is nice, it just isn&#x27;t fitting. Maybe I can use them for my suit case or something.</li>
            <li> I sent these to my state jumping brother that was traveling with his medication in a big white garbage bag! He now looks put together like a internet security specialist should look like! Plus they are manly bags not girlie ones which is perfect for my hero! He&#x27;s also a retired Army Ranger! I&#x27;m very proud of him!</li>
            <li> Quck shipping and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for</li>
            <li> I am saving this to give as a birthday gift. It is very nice...as advertised</li>
            <li> Love that these bags, really like the mesh!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for a cruise we were taking to Alaska recently.  Loved them, because you could put your individual items in the different sizes (some were quite roomy) and they fit neatly into our suitcases, without having to lug another suitcase around.  Now that we have returned, I find myself STILL using them when we travel somewhere and have to use a suitcase.  They pack nicely and makes it more convenient.</li>
            <li> Great bags. I use them to separate my make-up in my kit. They are sturdy and the fact that they are see through makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li> Great for organizing my make up and hair kits and a good value for the price..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great for organizing and seeing what is in the container.</li>
            <li> Like the meshed better than plastic.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received them..i ordered another set! Lolol</li>
            <li> Well-made but very light -- good solution for herding your small items together and finding them easily.</li>
