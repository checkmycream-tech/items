    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat faded but still looks great!  </li>
            <li>Best purple dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So very happy with this product, but watch out it can stain you like you wont believe!</li>
            <li>If you want long-lasting brilliant color though, this is the brand for you!</li>
            <li>For best results, I use gloves, paint brush, tin foil, blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I wear a shock through my fringe and about two or three inches through the ends looks great but any regrowth is still mousey brown regrowth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you won&#x27;t regret it, great color, great all around</li>
            <li>I wanted a gorgeous purple, and after debating between Manic Panic&#x27;s Purple Haze and this guy, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good purple, I&#x27;d suggest Manic Panic&#x27;s Purple Haze.</li>
            <li>This stuff I rinsed what I thought was good</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fullest and remember that you can always revive it with more dye after those three months, and THIS dye is non-toxic and will NOT hurt your hair!</li>
            <li>it really has impressed me.  </li>
            <li>, i thought it would be purple but its so much better in my hair, its blue purple ad teal and when it fades its so nice, its perfect, when i run out im getting more for sure.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands</li>
            <li>Then wrap foil around the hair and pin out of the way if you have more hair to do.</li>
            <li>Then wrap it up and let it sit for 10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>The color stays in better than most of this type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for 10+ years, and I was really, exceptionally pleased with the way this color came out on my hair.</li>
            <li>But it was really kind of cool once it started fading in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how long the color lasts.  </li>
            <li>Heard lots of good things about this product and, since my bright purple color has to be done so regularly with Manic Panic, decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I did find that it fades fairly rapidly if you spend much time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>However when I rinse out Manic Panic it easily rinses out and I never have any dye on my towels, clothes, etc.</li>
            <li>I liked how the color turned out, though it didn&#x27;t seem consistent.</li>
            <li>This product has been better then Splat products which weren&#x27;t true to color.</li>
            <li>thats fine</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>ENJOY this to</li>
            <li>just has to be slightly light but result will vary in that case.</li>
            <li>Bleach your hair first though!!</li>
            <li>This color last me for about three months before it started to fade into an amazing variety of blues, teals, greens, and light purples.</li>
            <li>The dye itself is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is my best recommendation for long lasting color.</li>
            <li>if washed with warm water it will turn blue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been washing with warm water each night and only wash it with shampoo once in a blue moon, and it has remained fabulous! ^__^</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shade of blue, but it&#x27;s definitely not the purple I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to get near my couch for days thanks to this</li>
            <li>I did bleach my hair first, as I had a &#x27;semi&#x27; in it</li>
            <li>and you are left with a more purple color.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first &#x27;demi&#x27; that I have found and</li>
            <li>a lil goes a long way and it still works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>if you have bleached your hair and are looking for a good hair color brand that will last for a long time</li>
            <li>In some lights, it looks straight up navy.</li>
            <li>This color really took well</li>
            <li>I like how much thicker it is</li>
            <li>does, that made it much cleaner to apply.</li>
            <li>Overall: Love the color, shows up well, stays in even with frequent hair washing.</li>
            <li>The smell didn&#x27;t last, but the color sure has -- a week later</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much more royal blue than purple, but as it fades, the blue is what goes away</li>
            <li>First, I expected a purple but the color is more of a midnight blue.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in high school out of boredom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, deep purple and fades very slowly, which says a lot since my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping after a few washes maybe the color will come through better?</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I wanted to do my hair in peacock colors: Purple on top, teal beneath, then green bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong, although blue tones are starting to peek through.</li>
            <li>I earned the nickname Skittles and I wish my new job would let me keep it</li>
            <li>When I saw that this was a demi-permanent instead of all of the semi-permanent options - both available commercially (Manic Panic, Punky Colour) and those only sold to industry professionals (Pravana, which I have not tried) - I decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m knocking off one star only because this dye is definitely more of a deep midnight blue than a purple.</li>
            <li>I like to have a streak of color in my hair and this is the first purple I have found that actually lasts!  </li>
            <li>I was coloring over purple, which was fading up to a light brown color, and it came out BLACK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely dark blue.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply it to dry hair; it doesn&#x27;t stick to wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have started mixing it with a pink I have from previous coloring and it turns out really nice.</li>
            <li>It smelled like bubblegum and was nearly as sticky.</li>
            <li>I got them done professionally and have been redying with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>since i bought this ive used it to redye me hair 6-7 times and its still half full</li>
            <li>I have used many colors over the years but keep going back to Raw.  </li>
            <li>The few reviews I saw for RAW looked good</li>
            <li>While manic panic washes out with even cold water (within weeks...), this dye lasts for months and doesn&#x27;t wash out even with warm to hot water.</li>
            <li>Be careful of your pillows after the first day or two.</li>
            <li>Bear in mind though, the top half of my hair was previously bleached and dyed blue, so it wasn&#x27;t applied to natural hair.</li>
            <li>the color is vivid and long lasting.</li>
            <li>When I was putting it on, I noticed it was much more thick and clingy than other brands.</li>
            <li>The consistency isn&#x27;t like the typical boxed hair dyes i&#x27;m used to, it&#x27;s more thick, kinda like paint.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I usually leave the dye on for much longer than the directions when it doesn&#x27;t use a developer, and this does NOT use a developer.</li>
            <li> One bottle of this stuff will last me a long time if I continue to dilute it.  </li>
            <li> I did get a little bleed right after putting it on but very little.  </li>
            <li> I heat one of those gel packs that you use for sore muscles in the microwave and hold it on the dye area until I am ready to rinse, or for at least 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I soaked it, clipped it up and wore a showercap all night until it dried then washed out for vibrant deep almost black purple.</li>
            <li> Place the piece of tin foil behind the portion of hair you are coloring (paint the hair right on the foil).</li>
            <li> It kinda left streaks of purple, turquoise, green, and blue.</li>
            <li> However my biggest complaint is that it only seems to adhere to my decolorized hair and not at all to natural regrowth.</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair almost white before application, which means there was no way that any other factors such as previous colors could&#x27;ve affected this outcome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark blue with a purple undertone.</li>
            <li> and when I washed it out, was left with hair that was nearly black.</li>
            <li> but back to black.</li>
            <li> When you wash it out be careful it can or will make a big mess that will stain everything.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely not like the little swatch on the picture.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I got said it was purple, but in fact it was a very dark ROYAL BLUE.</li>
            <li> Ended up with stained hands from running my fingers through wet (washed) hair as well.</li>
            <li> I usually have to redye every 2-3 weeks and was looking for something that would last longer.</li>
            <li> other brands like Manic Panic just wouldnt stay in my hair and wouldnt hold</li>
            <li> Blow dry the hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize i like going dark until after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not purple-y dark tinged color, but jet black.</li>
            <li> Faded faster than other colors by RAW.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find any other color system out there that works even half as well!!</li>
            <li> In the sun, you can see it&#x27;s a very dark blue-ish purple.</li>
            <li> dried and let my hair rest for the night.</li>
            <li> but when I dried my hair my towel was streaked with purple</li>
            <li> i used this to dye my hair purple for prom, it faded so bad within the first two days</li>
            <li> I have had my 1 bottle of raw hair color in Purple for over 10 years... 1 bottle..</li>
            <li> I would usually wash it out then take a shower to get the excess.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every semi permanent known to man and the RAW brand has surpassed all my experiences!  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to start with a &#x27;pure&#x27; base.  </li>
            <li> If I were to rank the commercial products I have tried, I would put this one behind Punky Colour, about equal with Manic Panic and ahead of Beyond the Zone and Splat, in that order.</li>
            <li> Very messy, NO vibrancy to the color, all around disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, won&#x27;t order from them again.</li>

            <li> since i bought this ive used it to redye me hair 6-7 times and its still half full, i thought it would be purple but its so much better in my hair, its blue purple ad teal and when it fades its so nice, its perfect, when i run out im getting more for sure.</li>
            <li> The dye itself is pretty fantastic. When I was putting it on, I noticed it was much more thick and clingy than other brands. It smelled like bubblegum and was nearly as sticky. The smell didn&#x27;t last, but the color sure has -- a week later and it hasn&#x27;t faded at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m knocking off one star only because this dye is definitely more of a deep midnight blue than a purple. It&#x27;s a great shade of blue, but it&#x27;s definitely not the purple I was expecting. If that&#x27;s what you want, definitely try this brand.</li>
            <li> i used this to dye my hair purple for prom, it faded so bad within the first two days and I had to redye it three times! and it still didn&#x27;t stay. I don&#x27;t like this hair dye at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about six weeks since I applied this color.  I only used about two tablespoons, mixed with about three ounces of conditioner, to achieve a lavender color.  It&#x27;s somewhat faded but still looks great!  Now my hair is a sort of steely lavender with lots of shine.  I only wash my hair once a week and my shampoo and conditioner both contain purple toner, so that probably helps.  One bottle of this stuff will last me a long time if I continue to dilute it.  Be sure to apply it to dry hair; it doesn&#x27;t stick to wet hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gorgeous purple, and after debating between Manic Panic&#x27;s Purple Haze and this guy, I decided to try this. The consistency isn&#x27;t like the typical boxed hair dyes i&#x27;m used to, it&#x27;s more thick, kinda like paint. I kept it in for about 3 hours and when I washed it out, was left with hair that was nearly black. In the sun, you can see it&#x27;s a very dark blue-ish purple. In some lights, it looks straight up navy. I&#x27;m hoping after a few washes maybe the color will come through better? But it&#x27;s definitely not like the little swatch on the picture. Next time, I&#x27;m trying Purple Haze.</li>
            <li> I liked how the color turned out, though it didn&#x27;t seem consistent. It was either purple or indigo in some places. But it was really kind of cool once it started fading in my hair. It kinda left streaks of purple, turquoise, green, and blue. People thought I did it on purpose.</li>
            <li> I have had my 1 bottle of raw hair color in Purple for over 10 years... 1 bottle.. a lil goes a long way and it still works better than anything else on the market. the color is vivid and long lasting. I have yet to find any other color system out there that works even half as well!!</li>
            <li> My favorite! Best purple dye I&#x27;ve used. While manic panic washes out with even cold water (within weeks...), this dye lasts for months and doesn&#x27;t wash out even with warm to hot water. I&#x27;ve been washing with warm water each night and only wash it with shampoo once in a blue moon, and it has remained fabulous! ^__^ So very happy with this product, but watch out it can stain you like you wont believe!</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the purple from the picture. It&#x27;s a dark blue with a purple undertone. If you&#x27;re looking for a warmer purple, this is not it.</li>
            <li> Searched forever to find this color. It&#x27;s a great, deep purple and fades very slowly, which says a lot since my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color very well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I wanted to do my hair in peacock colors: Purple on top, teal beneath, then green bangs. This is NOT purple at all. The bottle that I got said it was purple, but in fact it was a very dark ROYAL BLUE. I had bleached my hair almost white before application, which means there was no way that any other factors such as previous colors could&#x27;ve affected this outcome. If you&#x27;re looking for a good purple, I&#x27;d suggest Manic Panic&#x27;s Purple Haze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every semi permanent known to man and the RAW brand has surpassed all my experiences!  In fact, DON&#x27;T buy this brand if you want it to wash out!  If you want long-lasting brilliant color though, this is the brand for you!</li>
            <li> I like to have a streak of color in my hair and this is the first purple I have found that actually lasts!  This is a &#x27;demi&#x27; which means it isn&#x27;t permanent, but it lasts longer than a &#x27;semi&#x27;.  I did bleach my hair first, as I had a &#x27;semi&#x27; in it and it was red and I wanted to start with a &#x27;pure&#x27; base.  This color really took well and I didn&#x27;t have any &#x27;bleed&#x27; onto my face or pillow after the second wash.  I did get a little bleed right after putting it on but very little.  I did find that it fades fairly rapidly if you spend much time in the sun.  I had to reapply after about 3 weeks because I had some lighter areas where the sun had hit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much more royal blue than purple, but as it fades, the blue is what goes away and you are left with a more purple color.  I am very impressed with how long the color lasts.  I have tried many brands but this is the first &#x27;demi&#x27; that I have found and it really has impressed me.  When I apply it I heat one of those gel packs that you use for sore muscles in the microwave and hold it on the dye area until I am ready to rinse, or for at least 10 minutes.  I usually leave the dye on for much longer than the directions when it doesn&#x27;t use a developer, and this does NOT use a developer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in high school out of boredom. I just graduated from college and still have the hair dye. It is just as vibrate now as it was and maintains it&#x27;s color. This product has been better then Splat products which weren&#x27;t true to color. For best results, I use gloves, paint brush, tin foil, blow dryer. Apply product to portion of hair and use brush to spread or hands. It will stain your hands if you do not wear gloves. Place the piece of tin foil behind the portion of hair you are coloring (paint the hair right on the foil). Then wrap foil around the hair and pin out of the way if you have more hair to do. Once done applying product to hair and wrapping in separate tin foil pieces. Blow dry the hair for a few minutes. Then wrap it up and let it sit for 10 more minutes. When you wash it out be careful it can or will make a big mess that will stain everything. I would usually wash it out then take a shower to get the excess. After doing this the color will last a minimum of two weeks. Be careful of your pillows after the first day or two. The purple will keep washing out!! Enjoy and I hope this is helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS mine smelled like grapes! Extra bonus!</li>
            <li> When I saw that this was a demi-permanent instead of all of the semi-permanent options - both available commercially (Manic Panic, Punky Colour) and those only sold to industry professionals (Pravana, which I have not tried) - I decided to give it a chance. First, I expected a purple but the color is more of a midnight blue. I have started mixing it with a pink I have from previous coloring and it turns out really nice. However my biggest complaint is that it only seems to adhere to my decolorized hair and not at all to natural regrowth. I wear a shock through my fringe and about two or three inches through the ends looks great but any regrowth is still mousey brown regrowth. If I were to rank the commercial products I have tried, I would put this one behind Punky Colour, about equal with Manic Panic and ahead of Beyond the Zone and Splat, in that order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this same product twice and each time the color was not the purple I was promised. It&#x27;s a lovely dark blue. But it&#x27;s still not the color I wanted. Very disappointed, won&#x27;t order from them again. :/</li>
            <li> This is my best recommendation for long lasting color. Bleach your hair first though!! I bleached. dried and let my hair rest for the night. Them drenched it in this color, two bottles for my 22 inches of hair. I soaked it, clipped it up and wore a showercap all night until it dried then washed out for vibrant deep almost black purple. This color last me for about three months before it started to fade into an amazing variety of blues, teals, greens, and light purples. I earned the nickname Skittles and I wish my new job would let me keep it but back to black. ENJOY this to it&#x27;s fullest and remember that you can always revive it with more dye after those three months, and THIS dye is non-toxic and will NOT hurt your hair!</li>
            <li> I have used many colors over the years but keep going back to Raw.  The color stays in better than most of this type.</li>
            <li> I have some streaks in my hair that are purple to fuschia. I got them done professionally and have been redying with Manic Panic. I usually have to redye every 2-3 weeks and was looking for something that would last longer. The few reviews I saw for RAW looked good so I bought it to try. I like how much thicker it is, it stayed on my hair and didn&#x27;t drip or splash off like Manic Panic does, that made it much cleaner to apply. However when I rinse out Manic Panic it easily rinses out and I never have any dye on my towels, clothes, etc. This stuff I rinsed what I thought was good, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any dye but when I dried my hair my towel was streaked with purple so I had to rerinse and really get my fingers into my hair and rinse for another few minutes. I put a shirt on and already I see that my shirts been ruined by dye. I won&#x27;t be able to get near my couch for days thanks to this, I will not buy it again, going back to Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> Heard lots of good things about this product and, since my bright purple color has to be done so regularly with Manic Panic, decided to give it a shot. It turned out NOTHING like what I thought! I was coloring over purple, which was fading up to a light brown color, and it came out BLACK. Not purple-y dark tinged color, but jet black. There was no hint of purple to it at all, not even in the sun! Ended up with stained hands from running my fingers through wet (washed) hair as well. Very messy, NO vibrancy to the color, all around disappointing. I will never be buying this product again</li>
            <li> if washed with warm water it will turn blue</li>
            <li> Faded faster than other colors by RAW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for 10+ years, and I was really, exceptionally pleased with the way this color came out on my hair. Bear in mind though, the top half of my hair was previously bleached and dyed blue, so it wasn&#x27;t applied to natural hair. It&#x27;s still going strong, although blue tones are starting to peek through. Overall: Love the color, shows up well, stays in even with frequent hair washing.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize i like going dark until after using this stuff. works amazing!&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t regret it, great color, great all around</li>
            <li> if you have bleached your hair and are looking for a good hair color brand that will last for a long time this is the one you should get. other brands like Manic Panic just wouldnt stay in my hair and wouldnt hold but this one does the trick. and i alwayyysss get complements. dont want to bleach? thats fine it will still take it just has to be slightly light but result will vary in that case. of course! but hey its awsome smells awsome. AWSOME!</li>
