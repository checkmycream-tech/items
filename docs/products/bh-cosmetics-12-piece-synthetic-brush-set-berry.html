            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good thing. They are perfect, exactly what I wanted.  I can&#x27;t stop looking at them.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brushes. I use the two face brushes everyday. If you wash your brushes once a week, you wont be experiencing uneven applying. The angle brush is not my favorite when using it to apply concealer to the brows, but now I use it to apply brow powder when filling instead.  These are by far good brushes for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend</li>

            <li> Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> My sister loves these! I have also considered getting myself a set</li>
            <li> Happy I purchased these! Excellent quality and applies products nicely. Thank you BH Cosmetics (:</li>
            <li> Super soft wish the powder brush was thicker tho</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because a makeup artist from YouTube highly recommended theses. I ordered them and in a couple of days, they were here so I was really surprised by the shipping. They all work very well and I&#x27;m really satisfied.  However,  they had a funny smell to them. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re brand new so it smells like plastic or paint but it fades over time. Over all I love these brushes and they&#x27;re going to last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much. I bought them as a gift and I bought myself one once I saw how great they are. These brushes are great for beginners and also for those more experienced. Brushes are very soft and help blend colors easily.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes! No weird smell when opened. All brushes are very soft. I use most of this set and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t any miracle bargain, you get what you pay for . And I ordered this exact set a month ago and was so excited seeing how the reviews stated they were an affordable alt for high end brushes. They&#x27;re not. They are okay for the price, soft and sturdy. But do not pick up product well at all ... Or apply. way too soft and thin to really use in an effective way. If you&#x27;re a beginner I guess it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> Amazing brush set! I will never need to buy makeup brushes again. This brush set comes with every kind of makeup brush you will need AND top quality for a cheap price. I will recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, very soft and barely any shedding. All the brushes are useful (to me at least) and I only wish they came labeled so I knew what each one does but hey this is a good start. Can&#x27;t knock BH cosmetics for quality.</li>
            <li> Wow I am so thrilled with this brush set! The case looks and feels nice and closes securely with magnets on each side. The brushes I received were actually closer to black and purple than black and pink. The bristles are super soft and the smaller brushes&#x27; bristles are firm but soft. I can not imagine needing a brush that is not already included in this set.</li>
            <li> These are really good but i rarely use them</li>
