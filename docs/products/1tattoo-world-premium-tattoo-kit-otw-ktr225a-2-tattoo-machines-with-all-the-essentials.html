            <li>It works great and definitely a great starter kit.</li>
            <li>but they were great with replacing it with another one of my choice.  </li>
            <li>Would be of *great* benefit to have English/Spanish directions in print-</li>

            <li>What is not so great: lack of printed directions, sound quality on DVD.  </li>
            <li>Awesome kit for a great low price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, can be better.</li>

            <li>I just received my tattoo kit today, everything seems to work fine so far but my power box is a bit dinged up, and the DVD doesn&#x27;t have anything on it.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it the power box n cords would not work.</li>
            <li>I was upset at first because my tattoo kit wasnt functioning well..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>DVD is becoming less accessible as tablets/laptops etc.</li>
            <li>Other than that so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing and pissed off .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended this item for people wanting to get into tattooing.</li>
            <li>After I saw the problem they sent me some new pieces</li>
            <li>The power supply stopped working completely after five minutes, I had to go buy one from somewhere else over all product was normal.</li>
            <li>equipment complete.  </li>
            <li>The power supply is small and lightweight, but works fine.</li>

            <li> The power supply is small and lightweight, but works fine.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered got sent to the wrong state</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a pretty picture.</li>
            <li> So if you order this you better get some other ink with it because it&#x27;s crap</li>
            <li> The black won&#x27;t even take.</li>
            <li> instead of using the black in that came with it</li>
            <li> Only downfall is my power supply came broken</li>
            <li> the amp window has the am voltages dangling around not secure, but the amazon company gave me a discount</li>
            <li> This kit came compldte its definantly not top of the line</li>
            <li> All in all I am not a very happy customer</li>
            <li> i used crazy horse black stallion lining ink for both the outline and the coloring.</li>
            <li> Just got my kit today, power supply knob is broken off the power supply unit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the kit yet, as the broken knob.</li>
            <li> But other than the ink being bad.</li>
            <li> The ink sucks so bad .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a casual tattoo artist who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money to throw around, so I&#x27;ve been a bit skeptical about ordering tattoo supplies online, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this kit.</li>

            <li> Everything but the ink is great.. The ink sucks so bad . The black won&#x27;t even take. So if you order this you better get some other ink with it because it&#x27;s crap</li>
            <li> First time I tried it the power box n cords would not work. Very dissapointing and pissed off . Waist of money</li>
            <li> Present and they loved it</li>

            <li> whatever you do do not use the ink that comes with the kit. Your skin will reject it and it will peel off it&#x27;s not a pretty picture. But other than the ink being bad. And have to say everything was okay. Until about into my third tattoo. PowerBox decided to take a s*** .</li>
            <li> I was upset at first because my tattoo kit wasnt functioning well.. After I saw the problem they sent me some new pieces and now it works fine. Excellent customer service. Thanks!</li>

            <li> Excellent set, everything works great. Well worththe money.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of this machine and the ink</li>
            <li> Just got my kit today, power supply knob is broken off the power supply unit. Ink set is way smaller than I thought it would be. I haven&#x27;t used the kit yet, as the broken knob. Also I should note my order sat for a week before I contacted Amazon customer service. I had chosen free shipping. All in all I am not a very happy customer</li>
            <li> Awesome kit for a great low price!</li>
            <li> Kit as described- equipment complete.  I bought this for a demo kit for school- the bonus is locking case included.  What is not so great: lack of printed directions, sound quality on DVD.  Have to wait until the end of the DVD for directions on how to assemble/ use- and we ended up looking things up online.  Would be of *great* benefit to have English/Spanish directions in print- DVD is becoming less accessible as tablets/laptops etc. lack players-</li>
            <li> great quality kit except for the ink. i&#x27;ve just done my 1st tattoo using this kit and it went great except for the ink. instead of using the black in that came with it i used crazy horse black stallion lining ink for both the outline and the coloring.</li>
            <li> This kit came compldte its definantly not top of the line but if you know how to tattoo. You can come up</li>
            <li> Everything was great, nice looking machines. Only downfall is my power supply came broken the amp window has the am voltages dangling around not secure, but the amazon company gave me a discount so I could purchase another at a later time. Have not been able to use the equipment as of yet, but have finals for college and two more classes to complete my Associates Degree, then going to blasting out the machines and getting to know the fundamental of tattooing. I am excited already have my designs are ready and laying out and have been drawing like a madman.... Looking forward to using machine.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son. He&#x27;s the artist. He was pleased.</li>
            <li> Machines are pretty good for what the are worth need to tinker and tune them up. The power supply stopped working completely after five minutes, I had to go buy one from somewhere else over all product was normal.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail and my tattoo machine has a crack in the screen where the numbers show up</li>
            <li> Some part were damage, in the package on arrival.</li>
            <li> my box was damaged and so were the items inside but it&#x27;s okay Amazon refunded me great item works good</li>
