            <li>These mold to the perfect fit so easily and do not hurt at all!!!</li>
            <li>These trays would probably be better suited as a mouth guard, but not for thermo-molding custom fitting whitening trays!!!  </li>
            <li>The molds fit perfectly to your teeth and are great for those who have not used trays before.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to fit perfect.</li>
            <li>Work well but not as good as dentist-made ones.</li>
            <li>I used the 35% opalescence and works fairly good üëç</li>
            <li>Good thing there were two sets of trays.</li>
            <li>good transaction.</li>
            <li>The trays are good</li>

            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>dental moldings were good too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li>Let it cool and your mouthpiece is now perfectly molded to your teeth.</li>
            <li>fits great, feels great, nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>These are nice because there&#x27;s 3 in case a mistake is made and because they&#x27;re good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>the best thing is, these kinds of trays are so well priced you can afford to practice on a couple if needed before getting it just right.</li>
            <li>Ok, good seller and good products.</li>
            <li>and I was able to successfully form a tray.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and made a great mold against my mouth.</li>
            <li>Nice quality in package, haven&#x27;t molded yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;‚Ä¢Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can not have ideal footprints, they are very imperfect</li>
            <li>Took two attempts on both to get good fit.</li>
            <li>You just have to kind of suck on them to get it to fit your mouth!</li>
            <li>its good - i didnt get a full impression of my theeth but that could be fault</li>
            <li>To good to be true.</li>
            <li>Also, quality of trays was very cheap.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on these different mouthpieces to find the best way to mold them</li>
            <li>Bu the seller does need to find a better way of packaging them</li>
            <li>thank you for whiter teeth:)</li>
            <li>I was able to stretch them out again</li>
            <li>Love the trays once I understood how to correctly mold them..</li>
            <li>I have made SO many of these trays over the years and NEVER have had so many issues with a tray.</li>
            <li>and it is okay to use.</li>
            <li>this water temp is MORE THAN ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab</li>
            <li>I ordered to many</li>
            <li>but I like the fact the molds are made for top and bottom teeth and  </li>
            <li>After you&#x27;ve formed your trays...just don&#x27;t set them on top of your automatic coffeemaker...</li>
            <li>My husband had better luck with these than I did</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to speak well at all.</li>
            <li>I have used thermal forming tray products before and they were much better quality.</li>
            <li>I have another boil and bite tray and love it.</li>
            <li>some are much better but cost more</li>
            <li>and I have two well fitting trays for whitening gel.</li>
            <li>Not to good a product got 2 out of 4 to form right</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to sleep with them in.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>It is a good thing there is 4 of these in the order because the first two turned out unusable.</li>
            <li>then next time you know just what to do for your best fit.</li>
            <li>The fitting trays are made of good quality, and fit good enough.</li>
            <li>I needed the trays for my bottom teeth, and no matter how many times I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get these to fit.</li>
            <li>Even tried with holing it in the water longer so it would be more flexable to costum fit</li>
            <li>Good service, responsible seller.</li>
            <li>responsible , good product quality,I recommend</li>
            <li>They were easy to mold and use with bleaching gel.</li>
            <li>These were easy to mold to my mouth.</li>
            <li>The company was very quick to reimburse the additional postage that the post office charged me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and durable.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut to fit.  </li>
            <li>the molding trays were not as easy to fit to teeth as I was lead to believe.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere super cheap and love them</li>
            <li>Comfortable both unmolded and molded.</li>
            <li>yes they&#x27;re cheap to my surprise</li>
            <li>Cheap trays.  </li>
            <li>Then use opalescence 35% available on amazon.</li>
            <li>you can dip it in the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water to try again.</li>
            <li>fit well.</li>
            <li>Have used them already, cheap.</li>
            <li>WHY ITS SO CHEAP DONT DO IT</li>
            <li>and i had to keep on submerging the tray over and over to get some sort of fit and</li>
            <li>Also the fit isn&#x27;t all that well</li>
            <li>These trays are cheap.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li>These were super easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you mold them be sure to not use boiling hot water.</li>
            <li>The trays arrived not in their original packaging.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these because this time instead of purchasing a whitening gel from Amazon, I purchased the gel from my dentist.</li>
            <li>The trays arrived not in their original packaging.</li>
            <li>then let the water cool for about 2 mins before I dunked them in.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t mold right,it shrunk up in length,and couldn&#x27;t get them to fit right</li>
            <li>They would probably be ok for the top teeth, but definitely not for the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>It should have said to use boiling water (very hot water) and to do the molds one at a time.</li>
            <li>easy to form and work very well.</li>
            <li>Instructions were very clear and I was able to use this in minutes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>had to keep dipping in hot water a few times to get the mold i needed but whateeevss still good!</li>
            <li>* much air out of the tray, but more gently instead.</li>
            <li>I did it with the regular tray which worked ok fit</li>
            <li>The molding trays seem nice enough, but it didn&#x27;t come with the instructions.</li>
            <li>I dipped one in boiling water for ~8-10 seconds, stuck it onto to my upper teeth and instead of pressing it, I kind of sucked my cheeks in, like I was vacuuming forming the tray to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I had used soft whitening trays from a Rembrandt whitening kit I got at the drugstore, and found it to be MUCH better quality.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this product before purchasing and it seemed that they worked for many other customers.</li>
            <li>Once they are put into the hot water they shrivel up so quickly that you cannot put them in your mouth to get a mold.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews on how quickly these melt into an unusable mess let me offer a better approach.</li>
            <li>As a liscensed dental assistant experimenting with alternative ways for my patients to get their teeth h bleach the inexpensive way without having to go throught the process of taking an impression and using a special plastic and machine to produce a flexible bleaching tray, this product absolutely sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very many tries</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more on trays in order to get a better product.</li>
            <li>Form fit them with your fingers quickly but make sure the back and sides clear your molars or they can fold over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They became so soft when bitten , but they did not take shape easily.</li>
            <li>The tray really doesn&#x27;t conform at all even after dipping into very hot water.  </li>
            <li>I did the procedure exactly how it was instructed.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Trays really do the job !</li>
            <li>First order never arrived and they shipped out another promptly with no questions.</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li>When attempting to form the first tray I placed it in a boiling cup of water as directed and the thing melted in 5 seconds and stuck to itself.  </li>
            <li>My first try</li>
            <li>I put the first set in boiling water for 5 seconds (as directed), and they melted.</li>
            <li>Teeth are getting more white by the week.</li>
            <li>The first two that I tried with this method came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After proper cleaning and sanitizing the trays were okay.</li>
            <li>I boiled the first set per the seller&#x27;s instructions, for 5 seconds, and they didn&#x27;t form to my mouth.</li>
            <li>I needed replacement trays,  and these were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>They are also pretty bulky</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions exactly as written, you will end up with a melted glob.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions exactly</li>
            <li>Reading the instructions you will see to dipping it in the hot water between 5 to 15 secs.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s a quick tip if you cut one tray in half and use it one side for your upper and the other for your lowers you will have perfect fit very thin, you will be able to trace it and cut it with a sharp scissors to make it a perfect fit around your gums.</li>
            <li>Now i know i can have a steady supply of fresh trays every month.</li>
            <li>just be positive</li>
            <li>They came fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I am at this very moment wearing them for the first time</li>
            <li>Easy instructions, simple!</li>
            <li>Easy to &#x27;mold&#x27; to your mouth and tall enough.</li>
            <li>Prepare for them to shrink... will not work for a large mouth...</li>
            <li>They are too large to actually&lt;br /&gt;Form</li>
            <li>and there is actually a large gap between the tray and teeth.</li>
            <li>I microwaved a large bowl of water for 8 minutes and dunked them until I thought they were gooey and ready.</li>
            <li>Too big and too much space because they are not custom fit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like these molding trays.</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t mold very well.</li>
            <li>but I still don&#x27;t have a proper fit for my bottom teeth.p.s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;‚Ä¢Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and</li>
            <li>Great product too, not too thin.</li>
            <li>Does not mold very well to your teeth.</li>
            <li>Mine melted too fast.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, just as described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>We had no luck getting these to fit properly;(</li>
            <li>They are to big for my mouth but should fit my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought the whole kit just to get these out of them.</li>
            <li>They are doing their job very well</li>
            <li>tHANKS</li>
            <li>These are very generic in their fit</li>
            <li>This product absolutely sucked.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>was a real challenge.</li>
            <li>This worked very well</li>
            <li>this product is very strong and gave me a lot of sensitivity and made my teeth hurt for about half hour after using it</li>
            <li>though so try to get it right with the first or second dip into the hot water.</li>
            <li>I had these things so hot that they were actually hurting to have in my mouth, but I suffered through to try to get a good impression in the trays, only to find out that these things are way too thick to be able to form into a any sort of custom fitted tray.</li>
            <li>It came in a little Ziplock bag with four trays inside very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Less is more here regarding time and temp.</li>
            <li>I started reading the reviews online and decided to order these Mainly because of the price</li>
            <li>Worked decent for the price.</li>
            <li>One last thing, the bottom tray does not cover the back of my teeth like the top tray does.</li>
            <li>I will have to start all over again with new trays, if I can purchase any decent ones online.</li>
            <li>It took a long time for it to soften up and then once in my mouth it would cool off and not adjust to the shape of my teeth.</li>
            <li>they are pretty much the same thing I had before.</li>
            <li>Worth the low price.</li>
            <li>If you mess up they are cheap to repurchased and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Once you get it down you are fine.</li>
            <li>For the first try of adding the gel in the tray and placing it on my upper teeth</li>
            <li>First off, i like how the tab says \\&quot;made in the USA\\&quot;  second, these trays were designed to not fold over and stick together during the molding process.  </li>
            <li>It works just don&#x27;t boil them use hot water only.</li>
            <li>they completely melt immediately, 2 seconds tops!</li>
            <li>Pretty low quality - I&#x27;d suggest picking up the whitening kit at the drugstore, maybe on sale or with a coupon,</li>
            <li>I lalternate each pair to allow the second to be washed, which you can do easily and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li>For the second tray I let the water cool and then only placed the tray in it for about 4 seconds</li>
            <li>The plastic melts so quickly that trying to place them into your mouth so they can form BEFORE they begin to stick to each other</li>
            <li>Directions not that clear.</li>
            <li>it is soft hole, it deforms and can be repeated as soon as it is cooled</li>
            <li>so I knew to not leave them for too long in the hot water.</li>
            <li>ppl to order from... had a mistake in my order they fixed it...</li>
            <li>Complete junk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially after dipping it in the water without letting it wilt and inserting in into the mouth following the instructions did not help because just the act of sucking the air and pressing the tray to mold around the teeth was just not enough to rlly make a good impression since the plastic was quite thick.</li>
            <li>this time, I went for water without even that much bubbles and dipped-and-shaped the tray a few times before it was right for me.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get them into your moth fast the mold is a hot mess.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t bite very much while shaping it to avoid ending up with deep bottom teeth marks that thin out the surface and cause more issues if you grind your teeth.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>Maybe they are useful for other things (can&#x27;t imagine what)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used these types of bite guards for several years (this product is my favorite so far), and boiling water will indeed end you up with a floppy or shriveled mess and can potentially burn your mouth.</li>
            <li>There was a large overhang which covered the roof of my mouth on the upper tray and another large overhang which partially covered my tongue on the bottom tray.</li>
            <li>I did my research on the net and found out these trays were not fit perfectly for my teeth due to the fact that the gel started leaking to my gums meaning it DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While you&#x27;re still seeing a small amount of bubbles, dip the tray into the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water once or twice for 1-2 seconds each.</li>
            <li>These were just what I needed for my teeth whitening kit but be careful when you dip them in the hot water.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to wear top and bottom at the same time</li>
            <li>Bit large and loose</li>
            <li>They are HUGE, so unless you have a mouth the size of a giant, don&#x27;t waste your time.  </li>
            <li>Through its thicker it at least resembles my teeth and you can get cheap at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>no cocky responce just a simple fix which in my world now is necessary!!!&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>I bought these for my teen, so they could use my professional whitening gel.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned you shouldn&#x27;t be boiling them at all, just softening the plastic to a clear-looking state with scalding-hot water and then you have a 3-5 second window to shape them to your teeth.</li>
            <li>and they barely conform to your teeth.</li>
            <li>you could barely see my imprints.</li>
            <li>Careful not to heat these up to much.</li>
            <li>Had to form them a few times but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Too thick and cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice trays but their very big and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The molding is a little tricky the first time you do it.</li>
            <li>I always have to buy backups since I always destroy the first set.</li>
            <li>get a little boost there, and then save the trays for further user with higher quality whitening gel here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Super hard does not mold at all.</li>

            <li> Great price, always good to have spares</li>
            <li> ended up fitting my teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> These mold to the perfect fit so easily and do not hurt at all!!!</li>
            <li> These trays would probably be better suited as a mouth guard, but not for thermo-molding custom fitting whitening trays!!!  </li>
            <li> The molds fit perfectly to your teeth and are great for those who have not used trays before.  </li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Work well but not as good as dentist-made ones.</li>
            <li> I used the 35% opalescence and works fairly good üëç</li>
            <li> Good thing there were two sets of trays.</li>
            <li> good transaction.</li>
            <li> The trays are good</li>
            <li> Cheap and worked perfectly for molding whitening trays!</li>
            <li> he tray fit perfectly and molded well.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> dental moldings were good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> Let it cool and your mouthpiece is now perfectly molded to your teeth.</li>
            <li> fits great, feels great, nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li> These are nice because there&#x27;s 3 in case a mistake is made and because they&#x27;re good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> the best thing is, these kinds of trays are so well priced you can afford to practice on a couple if needed before getting it just right.</li>
            <li> Ok, good seller and good products.</li>
            <li> and I was able to successfully form a tray.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and made a great mold against my mouth.</li>
            <li> Nice quality in package, haven&#x27;t molded yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;‚Ä¢Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can not have ideal footprints, they are very imperfect</li>
            <li> Took two attempts on both to get good fit.</li>
            <li> You just have to kind of suck on them to get it to fit your mouth!</li>
            <li> its good - i didnt get a full impression of my theeth but that could be fault</li>
            <li> To good to be true.</li>
            <li> Also, quality of trays was very cheap.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on these different mouthpieces to find the best way to mold them</li>
            <li> Bu the seller does need to find a better way of packaging them</li>
            <li> thank you for whiter teeth:)</li>
            <li> I was able to stretch them out again</li>
            <li> Love the trays once I understood how to correctly mold them..</li>
            <li> I have made SO many of these trays over the years and NEVER have had so many issues with a tray.</li>
            <li> and it is okay to use.</li>
            <li> this water temp is MORE THAN ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab</li>
            <li> I ordered to many</li>
            <li> but I like the fact the molds are made for top and bottom teeth and  </li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve formed your trays...just don&#x27;t set them on top of your automatic coffeemaker...</li>
            <li> My husband had better luck with these than I did</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be able to speak well at all.</li>
            <li> I have used thermal forming tray products before and they were much better quality.</li>
            <li> I have another boil and bite tray and love it.</li>
            <li> some are much better but cost more</li>
            <li> and I have two well fitting trays for whitening gel.</li>
            <li> Not to good a product got 2 out of 4 to form right</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to sleep with them in.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> It is a good thing there is 4 of these in the order because the first two turned out unusable.</li>
            <li> then next time you know just what to do for your best fit.</li>
            <li> The fitting trays are made of good quality, and fit good enough.</li>
            <li> I needed the trays for my bottom teeth, and no matter how many times I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get these to fit.</li>
            <li> Even tried with holing it in the water longer so it would be more flexable to costum fit</li>
            <li> Good service, responsible seller.</li>
            <li> responsible , good product quality,I recommend</li>
            <li> They were easy to mold and use with bleaching gel.</li>
            <li> These were easy to mold to my mouth.</li>
            <li> The company was very quick to reimburse the additional postage that the post office charged me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and durable.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut to fit.  </li>
            <li> the molding trays were not as easy to fit to teeth as I was lead to believe.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere super cheap and love them</li>
            <li> Comfortable both unmolded and molded.</li>
            <li> yes they&#x27;re cheap to my surprise</li>
            <li> Cheap trays.  </li>
            <li> Then use opalescence 35% available on amazon.</li>
            <li> you can dip it in the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water to try again.</li>
            <li> fit well.</li>
            <li> Have used them already, cheap.</li>
            <li> WHY ITS SO CHEAP DONT DO IT</li>
            <li> and i had to keep on submerging the tray over and over to get some sort of fit and</li>
            <li> Also the fit isn&#x27;t all that well</li>
            <li> These trays are cheap.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> These were super easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you mold them be sure to not use boiling hot water.</li>
            <li> The trays arrived not in their original packaging.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because this time instead of purchasing a whitening gel from Amazon, I purchased the gel from my dentist.</li>
            <li> The trays arrived not in their original packaging.</li>
            <li> then let the water cool for about 2 mins before I dunked them in.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mold right,it shrunk up in length,and couldn&#x27;t get them to fit right</li>
            <li> They would probably be ok for the top teeth, but definitely not for the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> It should have said to use boiling water (very hot water) and to do the molds one at a time.</li>
            <li> easy to form and work very well.</li>
            <li> Instructions were very clear and I was able to use this in minutes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> had to keep dipping in hot water a few times to get the mold i needed but whateeevss still good!</li>
            <li> * much air out of the tray, but more gently instead.</li>
            <li> I did it with the regular tray which worked ok fit</li>
            <li> The molding trays seem nice enough, but it didn&#x27;t come with the instructions.</li>
            <li> I dipped one in boiling water for ~8-10 seconds, stuck it onto to my upper teeth and instead of pressing it, I kind of sucked my cheeks in, like I was vacuuming forming the tray to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had used soft whitening trays from a Rembrandt whitening kit I got at the drugstore, and found it to be MUCH better quality.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product before purchasing and it seemed that they worked for many other customers.</li>
            <li> Once they are put into the hot water they shrivel up so quickly that you cannot put them in your mouth to get a mold.  </li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews on how quickly these melt into an unusable mess let me offer a better approach.</li>
            <li> As a liscensed dental assistant experimenting with alternative ways for my patients to get their teeth h bleach the inexpensive way without having to go throught the process of taking an impression and using a special plastic and machine to produce a flexible bleaching tray, this product absolutely sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very many tries</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little more on trays in order to get a better product.</li>
            <li> Form fit them with your fingers quickly but make sure the back and sides clear your molars or they can fold over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They became so soft when bitten , but they did not take shape easily.</li>
            <li> The tray really doesn&#x27;t conform at all even after dipping into very hot water.  </li>
            <li> I did the procedure exactly how it was instructed.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Trays really do the job !</li>
            <li> First order never arrived and they shipped out another promptly with no questions.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as instructed.</li>
            <li> When attempting to form the first tray I placed it in a boiling cup of water as directed and the thing melted in 5 seconds and stuck to itself.  </li>
            <li> My first try</li>
            <li> I put the first set in boiling water for 5 seconds (as directed), and they melted.</li>
            <li> Teeth are getting more white by the week.</li>
            <li> The first two that I tried with this method came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After proper cleaning and sanitizing the trays were okay.</li>
            <li> I boiled the first set per the seller&#x27;s instructions, for 5 seconds, and they didn&#x27;t form to my mouth.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement trays,  and these were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> They are also pretty bulky</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions exactly as written, you will end up with a melted glob.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions exactly</li>
            <li> Reading the instructions you will see to dipping it in the hot water between 5 to 15 secs.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s a quick tip if you cut one tray in half and use it one side for your upper and the other for your lowers you will have perfect fit very thin, you will be able to trace it and cut it with a sharp scissors to make it a perfect fit around your gums.</li>
            <li> Now i know i can have a steady supply of fresh trays every month.</li>
            <li> just be positive</li>
            <li> They came fast and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I am at this very moment wearing them for the first time</li>
            <li> Easy instructions, simple!</li>
            <li> Easy to &#x27;mold&#x27; to your mouth and tall enough.</li>
            <li> Prepare for them to shrink... will not work for a large mouth...</li>
            <li> They are too large to actually&lt;br /&gt;Form</li>
            <li> and there is actually a large gap between the tray and teeth.</li>
            <li> I microwaved a large bowl of water for 8 minutes and dunked them until I thought they were gooey and ready.</li>
            <li> Too big and too much space because they are not custom fit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these molding trays.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t mold very well.</li>
            <li> but I still don&#x27;t have a proper fit for my bottom teeth.p.s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;‚Ä¢Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and</li>
            <li> Great product too, not too thin.</li>
            <li> Does not mold very well to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Mine melted too fast.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, just as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> We had no luck getting these to fit properly;(</li>
            <li> They are to big for my mouth but should fit my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought the whole kit just to get these out of them.</li>
            <li> They are doing their job very well</li>
            <li> tHANKS</li>
            <li> These are very generic in their fit</li>
            <li> This product absolutely sucked.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> was a real challenge.</li>
            <li> This worked very well</li>
            <li> this product is very strong and gave me a lot of sensitivity and made my teeth hurt for about half hour after using it</li>
            <li> though so try to get it right with the first or second dip into the hot water.</li>
            <li> I had these things so hot that they were actually hurting to have in my mouth, but I suffered through to try to get a good impression in the trays, only to find out that these things are way too thick to be able to form into a any sort of custom fitted tray.</li>
            <li> It came in a little Ziplock bag with four trays inside very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Less is more here regarding time and temp.</li>
            <li> I started reading the reviews online and decided to order these Mainly because of the price</li>
            <li> Worked decent for the price.</li>
            <li> One last thing, the bottom tray does not cover the back of my teeth like the top tray does.</li>
            <li> I will have to start all over again with new trays, if I can purchase any decent ones online.</li>
            <li> It took a long time for it to soften up and then once in my mouth it would cool off and not adjust to the shape of my teeth.</li>
            <li> they are pretty much the same thing I had before.</li>
            <li> Worth the low price.</li>
            <li> If you mess up they are cheap to repurchased and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Once you get it down you are fine.</li>
            <li> For the first try of adding the gel in the tray and placing it on my upper teeth</li>
            <li> First off, i like how the tab says \\&quot;made in the USA\\&quot;  second, these trays were designed to not fold over and stick together during the molding process.  </li>
            <li> It works just don&#x27;t boil them use hot water only.</li>
            <li> they completely melt immediately, 2 seconds tops!</li>
            <li> Pretty low quality - I&#x27;d suggest picking up the whitening kit at the drugstore, maybe on sale or with a coupon,</li>
            <li> I lalternate each pair to allow the second to be washed, which you can do easily and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li> For the second tray I let the water cool and then only placed the tray in it for about 4 seconds</li>
            <li> The plastic melts so quickly that trying to place them into your mouth so they can form BEFORE they begin to stick to each other</li>
            <li> Directions not that clear.</li>
            <li> it is soft hole, it deforms and can be repeated as soon as it is cooled</li>
            <li> so I knew to not leave them for too long in the hot water.</li>
            <li> ppl to order from... had a mistake in my order they fixed it...</li>
            <li> Complete junk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially after dipping it in the water without letting it wilt and inserting in into the mouth following the instructions did not help because just the act of sucking the air and pressing the tray to mold around the teeth was just not enough to rlly make a good impression since the plastic was quite thick.</li>
            <li> this time, I went for water without even that much bubbles and dipped-and-shaped the tray a few times before it was right for me.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get them into your moth fast the mold is a hot mess.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t bite very much while shaping it to avoid ending up with deep bottom teeth marks that thin out the surface and cause more issues if you grind your teeth.</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¢Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> Maybe they are useful for other things (can&#x27;t imagine what)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these types of bite guards for several years (this product is my favorite so far), and boiling water will indeed end you up with a floppy or shriveled mess and can potentially burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> There was a large overhang which covered the roof of my mouth on the upper tray and another large overhang which partially covered my tongue on the bottom tray.</li>
            <li> I did my research on the net and found out these trays were not fit perfectly for my teeth due to the fact that the gel started leaking to my gums meaning it DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While you&#x27;re still seeing a small amount of bubbles, dip the tray into the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water once or twice for 1-2 seconds each.</li>
            <li> These were just what I needed for my teeth whitening kit but be careful when you dip them in the hot water.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to wear top and bottom at the same time</li>
            <li> Bit large and loose</li>
            <li> They are HUGE, so unless you have a mouth the size of a giant, don&#x27;t waste your time.  </li>
            <li> Through its thicker it at least resembles my teeth and you can get cheap at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> no cocky responce just a simple fix which in my world now is necessary!!!&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teen, so they could use my professional whitening gel.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned you shouldn&#x27;t be boiling them at all, just softening the plastic to a clear-looking state with scalding-hot water and then you have a 3-5 second window to shape them to your teeth.</li>
            <li> and they barely conform to your teeth.</li>
            <li> you could barely see my imprints.</li>
            <li> Careful not to heat these up to much.</li>
            <li> Had to form them a few times but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Too thick and cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice trays but their very big and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The molding is a little tricky the first time you do it.</li>
            <li> I always have to buy backups since I always destroy the first set.</li>
            <li> get a little boost there, and then save the trays for further user with higher quality whitening gel here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Super hard does not mold at all.</li>
            <li> These were stiff and made me salivate too much.</li>
            <li> I would suggest if your seriously considering whitening your teeth, do it right and have the molds made by yiur dentist.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave long enough for them to collapse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not soft enough, you have five seconds retemper</li>
            <li> I was horrified and worried.&lt;br /&gt;I removed the tray and realized my gums on the left side of my mouth was white and turning dark at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not only was it just loose in the packagebut</li>
            <li> They work but fit is questionable.</li>
            <li> Getting them to fit on the teeth is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> Note-keeping the mouthpiece submerge too long will cause it to shrink.</li>
            <li> Ifyou leave them in the water for too long</li>
            <li> It you leave them in the boiling water too long they melt</li>
            <li> With the other pair, I dipped it under water for 2 or 3 secs and as result, these do not mold properly too.</li>
            <li> one of the trays by the little round lip that you see near the front of the guard - with the next step you have to operate</li>
            <li> Be careful not to put them in the boiling water too long, or they will melt/ crust away.</li>
            <li> They were loose in an envelope with NO instructions.  </li>
            <li> Instead, they were loose in an envelope with a Xerox copy of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They may need a little adjusting, such as cutting off the parts that cover your gums, and that is an easy task.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Product was just like I expected.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money and time trying to get these to work.</li>
            <li> They came with absolutely no instructions!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is quite complicated to find the right temperature of the water must be at the beginning of the boil, we must soak 10 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a small cup in microwave for only one minute.  </li>
            <li> Unable to use first time.</li>
            <li> However, I find the tray is small for my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> If the water is too hot they will become to pliable and are difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why my outcome was so different.</li>
            <li> Very rough on the gums</li>
            <li> (just like the pricey professional ones I&#x27;ve had, when I&#x27;ve sucked all the air possible out of the tray, it ends up feel too tight and uncomfortable).</li>
            <li> Also, the molds (the other pair that I didn&#x27;t mess up) didn&#x27;t form around each tooth.</li>
            <li> Too much heat, and they shrivel to a weird piece of something.  </li>
            <li> The trays shrunk down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut them down a lot on the gum line and also the overhangs as the bulkiness caused a gag reflex.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on my last try and just deal with them being slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is an amendment to my previous review on this product.  </li>
            <li> and hope I didn&#x27;t mess those up.  </li>
            <li> they mess up when you try to mold them toyour teeth.</li>
            <li> but they are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very hard to mold, had to try 5-7 times dipping back and forth in the water.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Set your burner to 5 or halfway and wait a few minutes until you start seeing a few bubbles coming up -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother spending the few dollars for these trays.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> but they are a waste of money for teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Its a waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with them.</li>
            <li> is not easy to molding</li>
            <li> instead, go for some amount of small bubbles in the water.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> These either have to be used as is,  or risk shrinking and not fitting correctly.</li>
            <li> Following the directions rendered the trays completely useless.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not really sure where to go from here.</li>
            <li> though, I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with a teeth whitening product and they are completely pointless.</li>
            <li> Alsomgood to kep biting down too hard while sleeping!</li>
            <li> was really tight and very thick</li>
            <li> so u can imagine how rude.  </li>
            <li> terrible quality and fit.</li>
            <li> Careful not to overheat or they wilt and then they are useless.</li>
            <li> I have no idea who could use these too thick, cumbersome wads of plastic.  </li>
            <li> Plus they are so thick, no amount of heat will make them any easier to mold.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.</li>
            <li> Material is too thick it did not form against your teeth.</li>
            <li> It was so thick.</li>
            <li> it was not their fault yet with my mean rude attitude (in pain having surgery to fix nerve degeneratin and bulged discs in neck) ....</li>
            <li> I paid hundreds of dollars to have the similar thing done at the dentist office which somehow I manage to lose it :(</li>
            <li> Very hard to Mold the material they are made out of was very thick..</li>
            <li> They are very thick and just don&#x27;t mold well.</li>
            <li> These are so thick and uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> IT IS POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> had to read other bad reviews to figure out how to soften them.</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive way to whiten teeth or have a mouth guard so as that you do not Grind Teeth when sleeping!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these trays do not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trays were difficult to mold.</li>
            <li> trays from the Dentist which are expensive and knew these would be no</li>
            <li> Could be user error, but I found these to be a bit difficult too mold.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP.</li>
            <li> After 6 secs the tray melted and became useless.</li>
            <li> Weird shape and</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Very useless.</li>
            <li> These are so bad.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for recommending these.</li>
            <li> I have gone through three sets trying to get them molded correctly. :(</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hate them.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> Horrible Product, Horrible Service</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> These were absolutely HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> These trays are CRAP!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> and they turned out horribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I followed another review on here that said not to boil water all the way. When bubbles started to come to surface I dipped each in about 8 seconds and they were done. I didn&#x27;t leave long enough for them to collapse. Seemed to fit perfect. Used them afterwards for whitening and they worked great.</li>
            <li> Horrible Product, Horrible Service</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t follow the instructions given with product.</li>
            <li> Doesnt go to the back teeth but who sees those anyway</li>
            <li> Easy instructions, simple!</li>
            <li> I purchased these trays thinking they were the same as the ones that came with my whitening kit. I did the procedure exactly how it was instructed. For the first try of adding the gel in the tray and placing it on my upper teeth I immediately felt a burning sensation on my gums. I was horrified and worried.&lt;br /&gt;I removed the tray and realized my gums on the left side of my mouth was white and turning dark at the same time. I did my research on the net and found out these trays were not fit perfectly for my teeth due to the fact that the gel started leaking to my gums meaning it DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY!!!</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. Perfect and great price. They were easy to mold and use with bleaching gel.</li>
            <li> I always have to buy backups since I always destroy the first set. But once you mold them they work as intended.</li>
            <li> I have no idea who could use these too thick, cumbersome wads of plastic.  I had hoped to use the with teeth whitening.  Not a chance!</li>
            <li> Good service, responsible seller. Trays really do the job ! Will buy them in future!</li>
            <li> easy to form and work very well.</li>
            <li> its good - i didnt get a full impression of my theeth but that could be fault i don&#x27;t know. Serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> fits great, feels great, nice smooth texture. agree with another reviewer: do not use boiling water to shape!! it&#x27;s way too hot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these types of bite guards for several years (this product is my favorite so far), and boiling water will indeed end you up with a floppy or shriveled mess and can potentially burn your mouth. instead, go for some amount of small bubbles in the water. this time, I went for water without even that much bubbles and dipped-and-shaped the tray a few times before it was right for me. I also recommend not sucking *too* much air out of the tray, but more gently instead. (just like the pricey professional ones I&#x27;ve had, when I&#x27;ve sucked all the air possible out of the tray, it ends up feel too tight and uncomfortable). also don&#x27;t bite very much while shaping it to avoid ending up with deep bottom teeth marks that thin out the surface and cause more issues if you grind your teeth. the best thing is, these kinds of trays are so well priced you can afford to practice on a couple if needed before getting it just right. then next time you know just what to do for your best fit.</li>
            <li> They came fast and exactly as described. Comfortable both unmolded and molded. If you mold them be sure to not use boiling hot water. Less is more here regarding time and temp.</li>
            <li> I would describe this as thermo-MELTing, not thermo-molding. At best the plastic try shrinks, but the idea that these are &amp;#34;custom fitting&amp;#34; is a joke.</li>
            <li> Great option for the cehap value</li>
            <li> I have gone through three sets trying to get them molded correctly. :( I finally settled on my last try and just deal with them being slightly uncomfortable. Oh, the pains we go through for beauty!</li>
            <li> Picture looks as if there is actually an upper and lower tray by size.  All four trays are the same size and they do not mold to your bite as indicated.  The tray really doesn&#x27;t conform at all even after dipping into very hot water.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.  Nothing fancy, but does the job as a whitening tray.  First order never arrived and they shipped out another promptly with no questions.</li>
            <li> had to keep dipping in hot water a few times to get the mold i needed but whateeevss still good!</li>
            <li> Worked as they were supposed to... Will order again when needed...</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  The trays arrived not in their original packaging. They were loose in an envelope with NO instructions.  They are HUGE, so unless you have a mouth the size of a giant, don&#x27;t waste your time.  Plus they are so thick, no amount of heat will make them any easier to mold.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because this time instead of purchasing a whitening gel from Amazon, I purchased the gel from my dentist. Unfortunately, these trays do not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These trays do not mold properly, so when I was whitening my teeth with the gel I got from my dentist, there was no change. My teeth did not whiten at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will have to start all over again with new trays, if I can purchase any decent ones online.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut to fit.  Pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as instructed. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good  Add to dr.georges Dental</li>
            <li> Work well but not as good as dentist-made ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these molding trays. It took a long time for it to soften up and then once in my mouth it would cool off and not adjust to the shape of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t mold very well.Even after redipping after they have been shaped by sucking out air ,squeezing with fingers.I need up using my hockey mouth piece and reheating that.Through its thicker it at least resembles my teeth and you can get cheap at Walgreens.I read many reviews on these different mouthpieces to find the best way to mold them and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same thing with all but I still don&#x27;t have a proper fit for my bottom teeth.p.s. I used the 35% opalescence and works fairly good üëç</li>
            <li> I ordered this a week ago and it came in today. I was quite disappointed with the results. As a liscensed dental assistant experimenting with alternative ways for my patients to get their teeth h bleach the inexpensive way without having to go throught the process of taking an impression and using a special plastic and machine to produce a flexible bleaching tray, this product absolutely sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially after dipping it in the water without letting it wilt and inserting in into the mouth following the instructions did not help because just the act of sucking the air and pressing the tray to mold around the teeth was just not enough to rlly make a good impression since the plastic was quite thick.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite complicated to find the right temperature of the water must be at the beginning of the boil, we must soak 10 seconds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s not soft enough, you have five seconds retemper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is soft hole, it deforms and can be repeated as soon as it is cooled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 15 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not succeed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is not corecte&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can not have ideal footprints, they are very imperfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all close enough molded teeth ... ..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not would resume this model !!!&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed</li>
            <li> Garbage, these don&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> These were super easy to use. I read plenty of reviews so I knew to not leave them for too long in the hot water. I did as the instructions stated and sucked them against my teeth, but also pressed them on. These are nice because there&#x27;s 3 in case a mistake is made and because they&#x27;re good quality for the price. They work perfectly with my teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> These mold to the perfect fit so easily and do not hurt at all!!!</li>
            <li> When attempting to form the first tray I placed it in a boiling cup of water as directed and the thing melted in 5 seconds and stuck to itself.  When I tried to separate the pieces they broke in two in a gooey clump.  For the second tray I let the water cool and then only placed the tray in it for about 4 seconds and I was able to successfully form a tray.  I really only needed one I guess but they are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> These were way too big to use. After gagging for several minutes i just tossed them. It was like having a deck of cards in my mouth.</li>
            <li> this product is very strong and gave me a lot of sensitivity and made my teeth hurt for about half hour after using it</li>
            <li> The fitting trays are made of good quality, and fit good enough. Be careful not to put them in the boiling water too long, or they will melt/ crust away. Bu the seller does need to find a better way of packaging them</li>
            <li> great quality, prompt delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li> c.s.&lt;br /&gt;great ppl to order from... had a mistake in my order they fixed it... it was not their fault yet with my mean rude attitude (in pain having surgery to fix nerve degeneratin and bulged discs in neck) .... so u can imagine how rude.  beautiful attitude no cocky responce just a simple fix which in my world now is necessary!!!&lt;br /&gt;product&lt;br /&gt;perfect for what it does and price!! thank you for whiter teeth:)</li>
            <li> I needed the trays for my bottom teeth, and no matter how many times I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get these to fit. They would probably be ok for the top teeth, but definitely not for the bottom teeth. They are very thick and just don&#x27;t mold well.</li>
            <li> Nice quality in package, haven&#x27;t molded yet.</li>
            <li> These are so thick and uncomfortable to wear. Very hard to mold, had to try 5-7 times dipping back and forth in the water. Didn&#x27;t have a problem with them melting like others did even in boiling water. Would not recommend. I am at this very moment wearing them for the first time and I absolutely hate them. Returning immediately if possible.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions explicitly and had no problems molding these.  They are very comfortable, and it&#x27;s easy to sleep with them in.  A great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Well very good product! It came in a little Ziplock bag with four trays inside very easy to use. I paid hundreds of dollars to have the similar thing done at the dentist office which somehow I manage to lose it :( I started reading the reviews online and decided to order these Mainly because of the price yes they&#x27;re cheap to my surprise they are pretty much the same thing I had before. here&#x27;s a quick tip if you cut one tray in half and use it one side for your upper and the other for your lowers you will have perfect fit very thin, you will be able to trace it and cut it with a sharp scissors to make it a perfect fit around your gums. My first try I did it with the regular tray which worked ok fit was really tight and very thick so I decided to try again just be positive my came out great! :)</li>
            <li> Worked great. Had to form them a few times but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Good thing there were two sets of trays. I put the first set in boiling water for 5 seconds (as directed), and they melted. The second set I held with tongs for 1 second.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- as described and, for the price!.  This is the least expensive way to whiten teeth or have a mouth guard so as that you do not Grind Teeth when sleeping!  tWill buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> good transaction. The product met my expectations</li>
            <li> Great price, always good to have spares</li>

            <li> 2 of the 4 just collapsed and where unusable when I took them out of the boiling water.</li>
            <li> Great! Great price too</li>
            <li> The trays were difficult to mold. They became so soft when bitten , but they did not take shape easily. They were inexpensive, and they work, so they have that going for them.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> terrible quality and fit.</li>
            <li> Read all of the reviews about how this melted while trying to mold.  So I didn&#x27;t even boil water.  I put a small cup in microwave for only one minute.  The trays shrunk down to nothing.  I was able to stretch them out again but they don&#x27;t actually cover front of teeth.  I recommend a different brand.  These either have to be used as is,  or risk shrinking and not fitting correctly.</li>
            <li> These were easy to mold to my mouth. Great product too, not too thin.</li>
            <li> Took two attempts on both to get good fit. Careful not to overheat or they wilt and then they are useless.</li>
            <li> Teeth are getting more white by the week. Easy to use, and made a great mold against my mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great beware not to over heat them. They will disintegrate before your eyes</li>
            <li> Prepare for them to shrink... will not work for a large mouth...</li>
            <li> Should be marketed as a mouth guard, not whitening trays. Does not mold very well to your teeth.</li>
            <li> The trays are good they are very simple to use. These were the one that you boil water for. Boil a pot of water and then submerge your mouthpiece into it for 5 to 15 seconds. You will see the mouthpiece begin to wilt. Note-keeping the mouthpiece submerge too long will cause it to shrink. Place the mouthpiece into your mouth and press it against the front of your teeth with your fingers and the back of your teeth with your tongue. Let it cool and your mouthpiece is now perfectly molded to your teeth. I recommend this product and seller just follow the instructions it will work.</li>
            <li> They did not work for me. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Love the trays once I understood how to correctly mold them..</li>
            <li> These trays would probably be better suited as a mouth guard, but not for thermo-molding custom fitting whitening trays!!!  I had these things so hot that they were actually hurting to have in my mouth, but I suffered through to try to get a good impression in the trays, only to find out that these things are way too thick to be able to form into a any sort of custom fitted tray.</li>
            <li> Cheap and worked perfectly for molding whitening trays!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE!!! These were absolutely HORRIBLE!!! Following the directions rendered the trays completely useless. I had to immediately throw them in the trash because they weren&#x27;t salvageable. I have made SO many of these trays over the years and NEVER have had so many issues with a tray.</li>
            <li> Directions not that clear. It should have said to use boiling water (very hot water) and to do the molds one at a time. Also, the molds (the other pair that I didn&#x27;t mess up) didn&#x27;t form around each tooth.</li>
            <li> Mine melted too fast. Unable to use first time. Practice is needed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I even bought these. When they say don&#x27;t boil them DON&#x27;T.  I microwaved a large bowl of water for 8 minutes and dunked them until I thought they were gooey and ready. It Worked perfectly for what I need them for (Dr. Georges teeth whitener). So for the price they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but they are definitely usable! Buy if your looking for an inexpensive way to keep whitening gel in place!</li>
            <li> Cheap trays.  Don&#x27;t mold well to teeth.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Excellent . responsible , good product quality,I recommend</li>
            <li> fast shipping, just as described.</li>
            <li> The molding is a little tricky the first time you do it.</li>
            <li> These did not work at all. I followed the instructions and did it step by step. Was not what I was wanting at all,.</li>
            <li> Product was just like I expected.  Great experience! Thank you!</li>
            <li> he tray fit perfectly and molded well.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teen, so they could use my professional whitening gel. You can&#x27;t compair them to my molds made by the dentist.  They work but fit is questionable. I would suggest if your seriously considering whitening your teeth, do it right and have the molds made by yiur dentist. Then use opalescence 35% available on amazon.</li>
            <li> As advertised, great price, holds the gel in place.</li>
            <li> Nice trays but their very big and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Bit large and loose and it is okay to use.</li>
            <li> Good price. Good Product.</li>
            <li> Everything Ok, good seller and good products.</li>
            <li> The molding trays seem nice enough, but it didn&#x27;t come with the instructions. So, I&#x27;m not really sure where to go from here. I know you boil them.. but?</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with this say to boil water and submerge the tray for 5-15 seconds. DON&#x27;T DO IT!  After reading so many reviews on how quickly these melt into an unusable mess let me offer a better approach. The first two that I tried with this method came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not fully boil the water!!!! Set your burner to 5 or halfway and wait a few minutes until you start seeing a few bubbles coming up - this water temp is MORE THAN ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab one of the trays by the little round lip that you see near the front of the guard - with the next step you have to operate rather fluidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you&#x27;re still seeing a small amount of bubbles, dip the tray into the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water once or twice for 1-2 seconds each. Remove the guard and let it drip excess water for 1 second and put onto upper or lower teeth. Form fit them with your fingers quickly but make sure the back and sides clear your molars or they can fold over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BOIL THESE LIKE YOU ARE BOILING AN EGG - THEY WILL MELT. As far as I&#x27;m concerned you shouldn&#x27;t be boiling them at all, just softening the plastic to a clear-looking state with scalding-hot water and then you have a 3-5 second window to shape them to your teeth. If there is a gap or part of the tray isn&#x27;t conforming to the shape of your teeth you can dip it in the LIGHTLY OR ALMOST boiling water to try again. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get very many tries though so try to get it right with the first or second dip into the hot water. Mine came out great.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and as advertised. Will definitely order again if the need arises. Thank you!</li>
            <li> First off, i like how the tab says \\&quot;made in the USA\\&quot;  second, these trays were designed to not fold over and stick together during the molding process.  I also like how they cover all my teeth. Good value. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not only was it just loose in the packagebut there were no instructions on how to use them How am i suppose to use them?.</li>
            <li> We had no luck getting these to fit properly;(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother spending the few dollars for these trays.&lt;br /&gt;Have trays from the Dentist which are expensive and knew these would be no where close...BUT, they are a joke, don&#x27;t even bother...</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use.  ended up fitting my teeth perfectly. Instructions were very clear and I was able to use this in minutes.</li>
            <li> They are to big for my mouth but should fit my husband&#x27;s. I have been told by my dentist, though, I have a small mouth. I ordered to many but I like the fact the molds are made for top and bottom teeth and  fit well.</li>
            <li> These work well.  After you&#x27;ve formed your trays...just don&#x27;t set them on top of your automatic coffeemaker...they shriveled up into the size my dog could use.</li>
            <li> The trays arrived not in their original packaging. Instead, they were loose in an envelope with a Xerox copy of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After proper cleaning and sanitizing the trays were okay. However, after further review the trays do not appear in proper packaging in the photo so that should have been my indicator. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.</li>
            <li> Have used them already, cheap. My boyfriend bought the whole kit just to get these out of them. I however am smarter and just ordered them on here! Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> Way too big and bulky, do not like at all.</li>
            <li> Could be user error, but I found these to be a bit difficult too mold.  Too much heat, and they shrivel to a weird piece of something.  Not enough heat,  and they barely conform to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They are doing their job very well</li>
            <li> They just dont seem to form all that well.  My husband had better luck with these than I did so maybe it was user error.  One of my two trays was not even usable though.</li>
            <li> These trays are CRAP!!!! I bought these to use with a teeth whitening product and they are completely pointless. Maybe they are useful for other things (can&#x27;t imagine what) but they are a waste of money for teeth whitening. Too big and too much space because they are not custom fit. I learned my lesson and just got a mold made at my dentist.</li>
            <li> oh, these are AWESOME! Easy to &#x27;mold&#x27; to your mouth and tall enough.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. The plastic is too low grade to boil correctly. I boiled the first set per the seller&#x27;s instructions, for 5 seconds, and they didn&#x27;t form to my mouth. So I boiled the second pair for only 2 seconds longer and they melted into a ball. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very rough on the gums</li>
            <li> Complete junk. A waste of time and money. Don&#x27;t bother with these. Too thick and cheap. Might as well just burn your money.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and as described. However, I find the tray is small for my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> Worked decent for the price. They arent perfect but they were inexpensive and they get the job done without issue.</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You just have to kind of suck on them to get it to fit your mouth!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions specifically and it melted my trays.  I had to then use my back up set and hope I didn&#x27;t mess those up.  Even then, they didn&#x27;t mold like others have for me.</li>
            <li> Time to whiten those teeth!</li>
            <li> the molding trays were not as easy to fit to teeth as I was lead to believe.  To good to be true.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. IT IS POOR QUALITY THATS WHY ITS SO CHEAP DONT DO IT tHANKS</li>
            <li> Great product.  I needed replacement trays,  and these were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Very hard to Mold the material they are made out of was very thick..and i had to keep on submerging the tray over and over to get some sort of fit and the end result you could barely see my imprints.</li>
            <li> They are too large to actually&lt;br /&gt;Form to your teeth, so there is an actual space between your teeth and the tray so if you put whitening gel on the tray it doesn&#x27;t touch your teeth. They are also pretty bulky so it&#x27;s hard to wear top and bottom at the same time and you won&#x27;t be able to speak well at all.</li>
            <li> Alsomgood to kep biting down too hard while sleeping!</li>
            <li> WARNING! If you follow the instructions exactly as written, you will end up with a melted glob. It is a good thing there is 4 of these in the order because the first two turned out unusable. I finally had to use it without putting it in boiling water.</li>
            <li> These are very generic in their fit and I do not recommend trying to use them with whiteners or even as a deterrent to grinding your teeth.  You will drool all over the place.</li>
            <li> These were just what I needed for my teeth whitening kit but be careful when you dip them in the hot water. Ifyou leave them in the water for too long they mess up when you try to mold them toyour teeth. I messup 3out of the four. Also the fit isn&#x27;t all that well but hey they worked</li>
            <li> The item worked perfectly for me. I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars at the dentist for whitening trays. Now i know i can have a steady supply of fresh trays every month.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money and time trying to get these to work.</li>
            <li> This is an amendment to my previous review on this product.  The company was very quick to reimburse the additional postage that the post office charged me.&lt;br /&gt;The dental moldings were good too.</li>
            <li> The molds fit perfectly to your teeth and are great for those who have not used trays before.  They may need a little adjusting, such as cutting off the parts that cover your gums, and that is an easy task.</li>
            <li> Careful not to heat these up to much. I brought the water to a boil then let the water cool for about 2 mins before I dunked them in. If the water is too hot they will become to pliable and are difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so-so.  Getting them to fit on the teeth is a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> They came with absolutely no instructions!&lt;br /&gt;I had to read other bad reviews to figure out how to soften them.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions exactly and they turned out horribly. There was a large overhang which covered the roof of my mouth on the upper tray and another large overhang which partially covered my tongue on the bottom tray. They do not form to your teeth at all and there is actually a large gap between the tray and teeth. I had to cut them down a lot on the gum line and also the overhangs as the bulkiness caused a gag reflex. I have used thermal forming tray products before and they were much better quality. I would recommend spending a little more on trays in order to get a better product. I read many reviews on this product before purchasing and it seemed that they worked for many other customers. I&#x27;m not entirely sure why my outcome was so different. One last thing, the bottom tray does not cover the back of my teeth like the top tray does.</li>
            <li> It works just don&#x27;t boil them use hot water only.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with these. After numerous attempts of trying to get these to mold properly, my son decided CrestWhite strips is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Reading the instructions you will see to dipping it in the hot water between 5 to 15 secs. After 6 secs the tray melted and became useless. This product absolutely sucked. With the other pair, I dipped it under water for 2 or 3 secs and as result, these do not mold properly too. Don&#x27;t buy it! I&#x27;ll ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> Material is too thick it did not form against your teeth. Followed directions all the way! Even tried with holing it in the water longer so it would be more flexable to costum fit and it did not work. Its a waste.</li>
            <li> Super hard does not mold at all. Uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t waste your time with them. Go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> These are so bad. I have another boil and bite tray and love it. I bought this for a friend and it WOULD NOT WORK!!!!!!! Total waste of money. It wouldn&#x27;t even form around the teeth. It was so thick. I feel bad for recommending these. Totally not usable.</li>
            <li> These trays are cheap. I used them to mold to my teeth, and the gel leaked through.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Worth the low price.</li>
            <li> Works. Just drop them in boiling water for a second and immediately pop it into your mouth. It you leave them in the boiling water too long they melt and you can&#x27;t make a mold. If you don&#x27;t get them into your moth fast the mold is a hot mess. Once you get it down you are fine. If you mess up they are cheap to repurchased and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and durable. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> These were terrible!! The directions say to put them in boiling water for 5-15 seconds. It warns you they will melt immediately, however in boiling water they completely melt immediately, 2 seconds tops! The plastic melts so quickly that trying to place them into your mouth so they can form BEFORE they begin to stick to each other was a real challenge. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They TOTALLY SUCKED!  I followed the directions to &amp;#34;the letter&amp;#34; - melted, stuck together, way to flimsy - would TOTALLY NOT recommend the trays.</li>
            <li> Weird shape and they tend to leak.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Molding is tricky. Follow the directions of the above user.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere super cheap and love them</li>
            <li> is not easy to molding</li>
            <li> Not to good a product got 2 out of 4 to form right and I have used different kinds. some are much better but cost more</li>
            <li> Worthless.  Once they are put into the hot water they shrivel up so quickly that you cannot put them in your mouth to get a mold.  Very useless.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mold right,it shrunk up in length,and couldn&#x27;t get them to fit right</li>
            <li> These whitening trays worked great. I dipped one in boiling water for ~8-10 seconds, stuck it onto to my upper teeth and instead of pressing it, I kind of sucked my cheeks in, like I was vacuuming forming the tray to my teeth. I repeated the process with the lower teeth. This worked very well and I have two well fitting trays for whitening gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> makes whitening easier.  I lalternate each pair to allow the second to be washed, which you can do easily and allow to air dry.</li>
            <li> I had used soft whitening trays from a Rembrandt whitening kit I got at the drugstore, and found it to be MUCH better quality. These were stiff and made me salivate too much. Pretty low quality - I&#x27;d suggest picking up the whitening kit at the drugstore, maybe on sale or with a coupon, get a little boost there, and then save the trays for further user with higher quality whitening gel here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for whitening trays</li>
            <li> Had an issue with the product.  Contacted customer service.  Customer service immediately resolved my issue satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> Came without any packaging, was just an envelop with the trays, no instructions, nothing. Also, quality of trays was very cheap. Would not buy again or reccomend.</li>
