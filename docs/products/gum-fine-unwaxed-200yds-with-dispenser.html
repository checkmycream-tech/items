            <li>Excellent transaction and product</li>
            <li>Since I have severe periodontal problems, the unwaxed floss is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>This is not the case anymore, so I was happy to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Item is very nice.</li>
            <li>The Butler GUM fine unwaxed floss was exceptional!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>By chance, I found a good alternative to this floss and it does just as good a job for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Good quality floss</li>
            <li>However, it is good for teeth that are close together.</li>
            <li>So I decided to go buy a spool of good strong sewing tread ($9) to try, and it works great and doesn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>I love this dental floss!</li>
            <li>The difference with my dental hygiene is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Over time I&#x27;ve used every floss the dentist recommended to me and tried some on my own</li>
            <li>None of them are effective:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how very fine this would be.  </li>
            <li>Love this Floss.  </li>
            <li>Unwaxed floss cleans better, I think.</li>
            <li>Do recommend seller but wish there&#x27;d been more description, including flavored/unflavored.</li>
            <li>I love this floss.  </li>
            <li>I happened to have some sewing tread with me, and I decided to give it a try since I didn&#x27;t have anything else better.  </li>
            <li>This makes me FURIOUS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the friction an unwaxed surface provides seems to cleaning better than slippery, waxed floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dental floss for many years</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always been consistently my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This a great product for people who don&#x27;t have much space between their teeth and for those who don&#x27;t like waxed and flavored dental floss.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Cleans much better than waxed floss and is easy to toss in a travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thing it works better than waxed, and because it is so fine</li>
            <li>It breaks easily and gets stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Fine 200yds.</li>
            <li>I have used Butler fine nonwaxed dental floss for years and prefer it to all others.  </li>
            <li>I;ve been using this product forever and fine</li>
            <li>It is the best for anyone with tight teeth.</li>
            <li>(  This latest attempt at finding a good floss l bought three different types.</li>
            <li>You can feel this fine unwaxed  floss clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was giving up hope of ever finding the right floss for me, and then I tried the GUM fine unwaxed floss.</li>
            <li>The dentist even said I don&#x27;t have to come in twice a year to have my teeth cleaned because the floss does such a good job.  </li>
            <li>I wish it could be purchased more readily in drug stores etc.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many, many years because it&#x27;s the only floss that does the job right for crowded teeth.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship, easy transaction.</li>
            <li>GUM unwaxed is the best floss, but very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I guess I need the regular kind.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and exactly</li>
            <li>I have used this floss for a long time and found that it cleans my teeth very well, better than many others that I had tried.</li>
            <li>This product is good for those who don&#x27;t want the waxy residue from other flosses and for those with snug teeth.</li>
            <li>I think it will last me a couple more years.</li>
            <li>The dispenser lasts for quite awhile but it does an excellent job of flossing the difficult in-between spaces.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had seen the store brand first.</li>
            <li>I have used this floss for years and used to be able to find it in local stores.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, especially the unflavored.  </li>
            <li>I received this order within a few days and am very satisfied with the shipper and the product.</li>
            <li>The POH floss shred and broke constantly, and I found it to be too fine.</li>
            <li>Anyway, good product, but so hard to find now.</li>
            <li>This Gum floss shreds fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to the last one and looking for a good source online.</li>
            <li>It may cost a little more, and it may not be as widely available, but there is not a better floss to do what floss is supposed to do than Butler Gum Fine Unwaxed.</li>
            <li>Having 200 yds to use lasts for such a long period of time, it is easy to travel with, and it rarely splits while using.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It does fit between the teeth, but it can cut the gum so be careful.  </li>
            <li>It goes easily in between tight teeth.</li>
            <li>I hate waxed floss, and am glad that I finally found a great floss that is unwaxed.</li>
            <li>but there is nothing that cleans tightly spaced teeth like Butler fine floss.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my teeth are not narrowly spaced.  </li>
            <li>have to wait a while before the floss gets arrives in the mail, so that is why I order three large containers and re-order when I open the last.</li>
            <li>I have some small spaces between my teeth and this works the best, it still shreads a little but nothing like the tape or other flosses and usually get the food stuck where I have a cap that has too much space.</li>
            <li>It is fine enough to get into the tiniest spaces, and yet it hardly ever shreds or breaks.</li>
            <li>The thread was thin enough and did an ok job, but it broke while I flossed.</li>
            <li>Or using thinner floss means you don&#x27;t need wax to  make the floss slip between your teeth because it is already thin BUT STRONG.  </li>

            <li> I still use the GUM floss, but only the small compact pack that fits in my purse</li>
            <li> It has always been difficult to find--the major drug store chains do not carry it--and it has now disappeared entirely from all drug store shelves.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and even though other products are labeled &amp;#34;extra fine&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t seem to work.</li>

            <li> My teeth are very hard on floss.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it was expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive yet very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> All but the Kroger have failed miserably.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate all the floss you find at grocery stores and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Outrageous price.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this Floss.  It goes easily in between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I have some small spaces between my teeth and this works the best, it still shreads a little but nothing like the tape or other flosses and usually get the food stuck where I have a cap that has too much space.</li>
            <li> Unwaxed floss cleans better, I think. Friction 101. Anyway, good product, but so hard to find now. I think I bought the last two packages in town, last year. I&#x27;m down to the last one and looking for a good source online. In Canada, the product is no longer Butler GUM but Sunstar GUM. Made in China. Sigh.</li>
            <li> Fast ship, easy transaction. Not happy with the floss; thin and uncomfortable, though probably fairly standard, just not up to quality of Reach Wide Floss. Do recommend seller but wish there&#x27;d been more description, including flavored/unflavored.</li>
            <li> I love this floss.  I received this order within a few days and am very satisfied with the shipper and the product. I highly recommend. Butler Gum Unwaxed Floss With Dispenser.Fine 200yds.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how very fine this would be.  It breaks easily and gets stuck in my teeth. I guess I need the regular kind.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years because it&#x27;s the only floss that does the job right for crowded teeth.  Over time I&#x27;ve used every floss the dentist recommended to me and tried some on my own but there is nothing that cleans tightly spaced teeth like Butler fine floss. The dentist even said I don&#x27;t have to come in twice a year to have my teeth cleaned because the floss does such a good job.  (I use it every night).</li>
            <li> Item is very nice. Floss is very thin, so glides between the teeth easily. By the time you pay shipping and handling though, it gets a little costly compared to prices in local drug stores.</li>
            <li> It may cost a little more, and it may not be as widely available, but there is not a better floss to do what floss is supposed to do than Butler Gum Fine Unwaxed. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve used it for years (and I&#x27;m not getting paid for this recommendation).    jsfrnk</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for a long time and found that it cleans my teeth very well, better than many others that I had tried. But for the price, it is rather taxing on my wallet. By chance, I found a good alternative to this floss and it does just as good a job for a fraction of the cost. Sewing tread. I stumbled upon this by chance. You see, I always floss and brush after every meal. A few months ago, I was out and about and the floss I always carried in my purse ran out. I happened to have some sewing tread with me, and I decided to give it a try since I didn&#x27;t have anything else better.  The thread was thin enough and did an ok job, but it broke while I flossed. So I decided to go buy a spool of good strong sewing tread ($9) to try, and it works great and doesn&#x27;t break. I will never run out of floss again, because that spool of tread will probably last me at lease two or three years if not more. I still use the GUM floss, but only the small compact pack that fits in my purse so I can take it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/16/2013 - still using the same $9 spool of tread I bought several years ago. I think it will last me a couple more years. What a deal!</li>
            <li> I love this dental floss! I have tried every single kind out there, from store brands, to very expensive brands, to POH floss, that I had used for a long time before I found this one. The POH floss shred and broke constantly, and I found it to be too fine. I was giving up hope of ever finding the right floss for me, and then I tried the GUM fine unwaxed floss. It is perfect for my needs. It is fine enough to get into the tiniest spaces, and yet it hardly ever shreds or breaks. I hate waxed floss, and am glad that I finally found a great floss that is unwaxed.</li>

            <li> Awesome floss. Cleans much better than waxed floss and is easy to toss in a travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like digging for treasure!</li>
            <li> The stores around here don&#x27;t carry any type of unwaxed floss.  This makes me FURIOUS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the friction an unwaxed surface provides seems to cleaning better than slippery, waxed floss.  Perhaps my teeth are not narrowly spaced.  Or using thinner floss means you don&#x27;t need wax to  make the floss slip between your teeth because it is already thin BUT STRONG.

            <li> Excellent transaction and product</li>
            <li> Came quickly and exactly a s advertised! GUM unwaxed is the best floss, but very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Having 200 yds to use lasts for such a long period of time, it is easy to travel with, and it rarely splits while using.  Since I have severe periodontal problems, the unwaxed floss is perfect for my needs.  I pray that the Sunstar Butler company never stops making it!  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate all the floss you find at grocery stores and drug stores. None of them are effective:(  This latest attempt at finding a good floss l bought three different types. The Butler GUM fine unwaxed floss was exceptional!!!!!!  I have to say that it was expensive. But it is 200 yards of dental floss that out performs anything l have found in 58 years!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would replace my Kroger floss that I have to buy at Fry&#x27;s grocery.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll still have to make a special trip whenever I run out.  This Gum floss shreds fast.  It&#x27;s expensive yet very poor quality.  My teeth are very hard on floss.  All but the Kroger have failed miserably.</li>
            <li> Always does the trick when cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> The dispenser lasts for quite awhile but it does an excellent job of flossing the difficult in-between spaces.  Easy to use also.</li>
            <li> Outrageous price.  I bought 100 yards of the same unwaxed dental floss for 88 cents at the local grocery store (their brand).  It works just as well as this brand only for a seventh of the price.  I wish I had seen the store brand first.</li>
            <li> You can feel this fine unwaxed  floss clean your teeth.  I thing it works better than waxed, and because it is so fine can still get between the teeth.</li>
            <li> The difference with my dental hygiene is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for years and used to be able to find it in local stores.  This is not the case anymore, so I was happy to find it here.  This product is good for those who don&#x27;t want the waxy residue from other flosses and for those with snug teeth.</li>
            <li> I;ve been using this product forever and fine it is the only product that works for my teeth. I have very tight teeth and even though other products are labeled &amp;#34;extra fine&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t seem to work. I hope GUM never stops making this product. It is the best for anyone with tight teeth. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This floss slides well and cleans the plaque off of the teeth.  Good quality floss and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It does fit between the teeth, but it can cut the gum so be careful.  It can also shred.  However, it is good for teeth that are close together.</li>
            <li> Wife needed the fine floss for getting at difficult areas between her teeth.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores, especially the unflavored.  This dispenser should last her a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not the same quality as you get in the store. The floss is thinner and weaker. It often breaks in mid flossing.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss for me</li>
