            <li>First off I will say that I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used more than the recommended couple of drops, and could tell.  </li>
            <li>and makes your skin so smooth and absolutely diminishes fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel of this Serum, it leaves my face and neck very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I also noticed right away that my fine lines and wrinkles were diminished.  </li>
            <li>Really looking forward to more products from Genesea.</li>
            <li>This has quickly become a part of my nightly ritual.</li>
            <li>Works nicely with the other products and keeps me looking young. :)</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This Serum is very light when you apply it and that is one of the key factors to me.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about Genesea Jojoba Oil Serum, I use it daily and will be buying again!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and love to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>After using this serum my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised when it went on so smoothly and</li>
            <li>This anti-aging serum was a special treat to myself for early Mom&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels a little greasy going on, and takes a bit to absorb into the skin, but using it daily along with the Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator twice a week, my skin is already feeling more healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using it for only a few days, I can already say that it&#x27;s working great.  </li>
            <li>I never realized how much nicer my skin could feel until I started using this oil.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night to let my face really soak it all in.</li>
            <li>I will continue with it and LOVE all the other Genesea products.</li>
            <li>This is my new FAV anti-aging serum!</li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if I was able to control the application size, and it was a tad less oily.</li>
            <li>It is also a little more oily feeling than I would like, but it absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it, and just a small pump seems to cover my whole face, chin, and neck.  </li>
            <li>A little oily, but absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I now see the company has a new face moisturizer out, and you can bet I will be trying that out as well.</li>
            <li>This new line of products will line my shelves in no time.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to purchase a new bottle every two weeks like some.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night and wake with my skin feeling soft and am noticing some of my &amp;#34;wisdom&amp;#34; spots becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>and it goes so far!  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think a serum can turn back the hands of time, I intend to keep using it daily to keep my skin as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to use as much of this product for complete coverage on my face and my face seems to appear more youthful than the other more expensive product that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as it was a little thicker than the last product I tried</li>
            <li>I tmakes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I have used this for 5 days so far and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product, I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion, and can see using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other serums in the past, but this one absorbed smoothly into my skin leaving it soft and supple overnight.  </li>
            <li>the next morning my face felt extremely soft!  </li>
            <li>A little of this smooth gel goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face look so much more tight and less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>With this serum, just like the facial peel from Genesea, I really like the consistent feel along with a subtle smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Genesea Jojoba Oil Serum about a week ago along with the Genesea facial cleansing mask, I usually wait a full week before reviewing a product, but as with the cleansing mask I am here only after 4 days of dedicated use.</li>

            <li> I have been able to replace a more expensive product with the Genesea Jojoba that is way less expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use as much of this product for complete coverage on my face and my face seems to appear more youthful than the other more expensive product that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Genesea Jojoba for any man as well as any women to use as part of their daily regiment.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I tmakes my skin soft and I look younger.</li>
            <li> I started using this a week ago, I have been getting compliments from family on how great my skin looks. It feels amazing to put on. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great at helping to ease the fine lines around my eyes and soften creases on my forehead. I applaud you for the packaging to prevent oxidation and thereby keeping the potency of the product intact. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much nicer my skin could feel until I started using this oil. what a difference it makes without leaving you feeling greasy. I would definitely buy again and again</li>
            <li> I love the way Genesee feels on my face. I have combination skin so I use it at night because my face tends to get oily during the day. I have seen my frown lines diminish after using this product. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or cause unnecessary breakouts. I will buy again!</li>

            <li> I have used this for 5 days so far and my skin feels so soft.  I use it at night, should I be using it 2 times a day ??</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> There is nothing I don&#x27;t love about Genesea Jojoba Oil Serum, I use it daily and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the serum....leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and it smells great</li>
            <li> This anti-aging serum was a special treat to myself for early Mom&#x27;s Day.  A little of this smooth gel goes a long way.  I love the feel of it, and just a small pump seems to cover my whole face, chin, and neck.  It smells refreshing, but not over-powering.  The size of the container is a good size for this type of high end skin product.  It will surely last me several months. I&#x27;ve used another vitamin serum before that was too thin to spread all around - it just ran through my fingers.  This seems to spread better and feels nice, but not too greasy. My skin feels softer and has a nice healthy glow. I work in the sun every day, and hopefully their next product might contain an SPF for some sun protection. I really like this lotion, and can see using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my new FAV anti-aging serum! I will never be without it. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it. I like that A LOT! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like how this feels on my skin after putting it on. It seems like it would be greasy, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and oily after I rub it in. It has helped with the dry spots on my face. Works nicely with the other products and keeps me looking young. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and love to use it daily.  After using this serum my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2 1/2 weeks now. First off I will say that I love the way it feels. Very soft and smooth. It has a nice fresh smell to it also. I put this on at night to let my face really soak it all in. A little goes a long way with this serum. I have been dealing with severe dry skin for a while now, and this stuff has definitely done the trick. It is a very intense hydrating serum that has made my face feel and look more healthy and radiant. My husband has even noticed a difference. This has quickly become a part of my nightly ritual. Really looking forward to more products from Genesea.</li>
            <li> This stuff is heaven! It smells amazing!! and makes your skin so smooth and absolutely diminishes fine lines and wrinkles! I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Feels amazing and it goes so far!  I have several products from this brand and I love them!  This Serum is very light when you apply it and that is one of the key factors to me.  I don&#x27;t like feeling like I sprayed Pam on my face!  I believe the amount of uses is also a great feature!  I won&#x27;t have to purchase a new bottle every two weeks like some.  I will be returning for more...when I finally run out!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other serums in the past, but this one absorbed smoothly into my skin leaving it soft and supple overnight.  I also noticed right away that my fine lines and wrinkles were diminished.  I have been using the serum for about 2 weeks now and am getting compliments that I look great and my skin is glowing!  Thank you so much for this product, I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!!! Feels so good on my face, smells awesome, and makes me feel good :)</li>
            <li> Its like quenching my skin with a bunch of goodness every time I put it on at night. The smell is amazing. I have noticed a softer appearance to my skin since using. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this Serum but I wish it pumped a smaller portion. It is also a little more oily feeling than I would like, but it absorbs well. I will continue with it and LOVE all the other Genesea products. I would give this 5 stars if I was able to control the application size, and it was a tad less oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how it makes my face feel.  The first time I used it, I used more than the recommended couple of drops, and could tell.  A little goes a long way.  It makes my face feel very smooth, and I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as it was a little thicker than the last product I tried but I was pleasantly surprised when it went on so smoothly and the next morning my face felt extremely soft!  I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  I have used this product for about 1 week now and I can actually say my skin looks younger.  My face is a mixture of dry and oily spots. There are no more dry spots as of now and my forehead is less oily than before I started using this.  I will be looking at other products by Genesea!!</li>
            <li> I love this Serum, I just tried a couple times and I can see difference in my skin, I really recommend it, my skin looks great even when I put make up on. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> This is some amazing stuff. Makes my face look so much more tight and less wrinkles. I&#x27;d buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Genesea Jojoba Oil Serum for a couple of weeks now, and am very impressed. I use just a very small amount once a day. I like the bottle and the pump that dispenses a measured small amount each time - and that amount could be even less for my preference. The serum feels a little greasy going on, and takes a bit to absorb into the skin, but using it daily along with the Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator twice a week, my skin is already feeling more healthy and smooth. While I don&#x27;t think a serum can turn back the hands of time, I intend to keep using it daily to keep my skin as healthy as possible. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice serum! A little oily, but absorbed quickly. Great when used with the night cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  After using it for only a few days, I can already say that it&#x27;s working great.  I use it at night and wake with my skin feeling soft and am noticing some of my &amp;#34;wisdom&amp;#34; spots becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
