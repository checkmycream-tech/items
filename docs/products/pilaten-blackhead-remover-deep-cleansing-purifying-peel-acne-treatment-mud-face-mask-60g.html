            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great price and works well around your nose.  </li>
            <li>If you are using this just on your nose, it&#x27;s a great value for your money</li>
            <li>Skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product , loved the results.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE NOT TO GET IT ON YOUR EYEBROWS!</li>
            <li>but I was highly impressed when i first tried this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice</li>
            <li>I actually liked this blackhead remover.</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like I was waxing my face when pulling it off.</li>
            <li>its ok got rid of my blackheads but not my scars or acne.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>because in &amp;#34;Working&amp;#34; it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel great pulling it off!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>Biore strips do more than this product.</li>
            <li>It also smells like some sort of strong chemical when you wash it off.</li>
            <li>This blackhead remover removed all the fine hairs off my face with alot of pain but the purpose I bought it for it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I just ordered this product am so excited</li>
            <li>Is a good remover deep cleansing, but not as much as I thought!!</li>
            <li>It definitely made my skin feel smooth and clean, but I think I need to use it a couple more times to really get results.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have it on kind of thick, it makes it easier to pull off.</li>
            <li>Overall, my face felt and has looked better.</li>
            <li>Holy suction does this stuff really work!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really take nothing out</li>
            <li>It hurts alittle to peel off, being it adhears so intensely.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates nicely when you peel it and leaves behind soft, smooth skin, but the mask really grabs onto everything.</li>
            <li>The bottle was small but nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use, and will get a bit of the dry skin and hairs off of your face, but it didn&#x27;t really pull much out of my pores.  </li>
            <li>For first time users I recommend you use a lot on on spot, do not thin it out to much because it is harder to pick and peel off.</li>
            <li>From dead skin cells, to pores, and even fine hairs</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear the pores.</li>
            <li>wow, way kool.</li>
            <li>I have made my own poor mask out of unflavored geletin and milk that can pull anything out of your pores so this was a bust for me.</li>
            <li>This does a so-so job of removing blackheads and whiteheads, but I still see sooooo much behind that I would think should easily come out.</li>
            <li>But it does feel cool knowing that you are theoretically pulling out at least some percent of impurities.</li>
            <li>It will remove all the little peach fuzz hairs from all over your face, perhaps that was makes it hurt so much.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t remove much black heads but did remove dead skin and such easy to use and peel off if put on pretty thick</li>

            <li> This product took so long to get here.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work as expected, but there was no instructions or information in English.</li>
            <li> I have never seen so much unwanted black heads and dead skin come off of my skin before.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it took hair off too.</li>
            <li> If anything, it has helped get rid of some dead skin, but that could be done simply by washing and exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li> Wasnt what I expected</li>
            <li> It only removed a couple blackhead 2-3, but it removed alot of dead skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on you</li>
            <li> or you have to wet it til</li>
            <li> I have used other similar products that were ok, but would start falling off within a couple of minutes and get annoying.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely crazy how much junk this mask pulled!</li>
            <li> I like using this product for my trouble areas, which is my T zone and my chin.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in about 4 days but after a few uses I have not seen any change in my pores whether it be shrinkage or cleanliness, which is the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> After countless attempts, this product has failed to remove any blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, be prepared to shed a few tears...</li>
            <li> I put it on thick and thin both ways peels off but neither way took the blackheads.</li>
            <li> a little disappointment!</li>
            <li> Also it is very painful to peal off with little to no results.</li>
            <li> It does work at all :(</li>
            <li> no too bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about this and seen the pics online of nasty blackheads stuck in the mask.</li>
            <li> Horrible product don&#x27;t bother purchasing it!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about this and seen the pics online of nasty blackheads stuck in the mask. As apprehensive as I was I bought it. The bottle was small but nice. I put on the mask and it seemed like it was working. The only issue was it hurt like hell to take off. It&#x27;s like putting bandaids on your face and then taking them off. Ouch. My face though did feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> its ok got rid of my blackheads but not my scars or acne.</li>
            <li> It did NOT! Do the job.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I think is not working but in some how is also working. It&#x27;s really nice I love it</li>
            <li> Is a good remover deep cleansing, but not as much as I thought!! a little disappointment! no too bad! but, shows no impurities such as I thought</li>
            <li> I actually liked this blackhead remover. I have used other similar products that were ok, but would start falling off within a couple of minutes and get annoying. Not the case with this one. MAKE SURE NOT TO GET IT ON YOUR EYEBROWS! Make sure you have it on kind of thick, it makes it easier to pull off. It kind of felt like I was waxing my face when pulling it off. Overall, my face felt and has looked better. Just be careful, it took hair off too.</li>
            <li> Holy suction does this stuff really work! It was absolutely crazy how much junk this mask pulled! From dead skin cells, to pores, and even fine hairs lol. Needless to say, be prepared to shed a few tears...because in &amp;#34;Working&amp;#34; it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel great pulling it off!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use, and will get a bit of the dry skin and hairs off of your face, but it didn&#x27;t really pull much out of my pores.  I have made my own poor mask out of unflavored geletin and milk that can pull anything out of your pores so this was a bust for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all on my pores.  It&#x27;s really thick and hard to remove.  I have yet to find a mask that works.  Bummed</li>
            <li> I like using this product for my trouble areas, which is my T zone and my chin. This does a so-so job of removing blackheads and whiteheads, but I still see sooooo much behind that I would think should easily come out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would peel off when applied, but it did...wow, way kool.</li>
            <li> This is not for those with a very low pain tolerance. It definitely made my skin feel smooth and clean, but I think I need to use it a couple more times to really get results.</li>
            <li> Great product , loved the results.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. I love this product. I will order again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear the pores. Almost nothing came out. It also smells like some sort of strong chemical when you wash it off. But it does feel cool knowing that you are theoretically pulling out at least some percent of impurities.</li>
            <li> This blackhead remover removed all the fine hairs off my face with alot of pain but the purpose I bought it for it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Great price and works well around your nose.  If you have any peach fuzz on your face (including a peach fuzz mustache) this hurts when it peels off.  It exfoliates nicely when you peel it and leaves behind soft, smooth skin, but the mask really grabs onto everything. It makes me think of duct tape that also cleans your pores.  You can see the gunk that comes out of your pores, especially in the nose region and reminds me of the biore pore strips.  If you are using this just on your nose, it&#x27;s a great value for your money</li>
            <li> It was delivered in about 4 days but after a few uses I have not seen any change in my pores whether it be shrinkage or cleanliness, which is the reason I bought it. Also it is very painful to peal off with little to no results. Though my face is a bit softer which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like! It does work at all :(</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I was highly impressed when i first tried this product. I have never seen so much unwanted black heads and dead skin come off of my skin before. For first time users I recommend you use a lot on on spot, do not thin it out to much because it is harder to pick and peel off.</li>

            <li> Wasnt what I expected didn&#x27;t remove much black heads but did remove dead skin and such easy to use and peel off if put on pretty thick</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice and no results. It does not do what the picture shows at all. I put it on thick and thin both ways peels off but neither way took the blackheads. Biore strips do more than this product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product am so excited</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really take nothing out</li>
            <li> This product took so long to get here. Also it doesn&#x27;t even work! Horrible product don&#x27;t bother purchasing it!</li>
            <li> does not take out anything and if anything it made my break out</li>
            <li> This product took well over a month to arrive. It dried like a paper texture and really adhears to skin. It only removed a couple blackhead 2-3, but it removed alot of dead skin. It hurts alittle to peel off, being it adhears so intensely. It will remove all the little peach fuzz hairs from all over your face, perhaps that was makes it hurt so much. Be careful not to get it on you eye brows, or you have to wet it til the mask kn the hair dissolves. It seemed to work as expected, but there was no instructions or information in English.</li>
