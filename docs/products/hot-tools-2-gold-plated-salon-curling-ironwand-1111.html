            <li>The quality of this product is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made as good as the others I&#x27;ve owned, Maybe it&#x27;s an after market who knows.  </li>

            <li>There&#x27;s a GOOD chance I don&#x27;t know the correct way to curl hair</li>
            <li>good word for the seller:</li>
            <li>The temp control is good, and it tells you on the box what temp to use for your hair texture.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the customer service has been good so far:&lt;br /&gt;-Timely shipping&lt;br</li>
            <li>I PUT 3 STARS BECAUSE THIS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMEONE ELSE</li>
            <li>If you need a curling iron please save some money and get a good brand.  </li>
            <li>Loved this</li>
            <li>The handle / stand ratio to the size of the barrel is good (doesn&#x27;t feel clunky or have issues staying up on stand).  </li>
            <li>Good on them.</li>

            <li>After a couple times of using it, I noticed my ends didn&#x27;t look very healthy.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>In terms of giving a huge and beautiful curl, it does not.</li>
            <li>This magic wand will keep eyes on your face with its ability to amplify the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; in your hair!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>I love this iron!</li>
            <li>I love the curling iron!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I am thinking this is more like 3 inches!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better curling iron!</li>
            <li>Hot tools makes a great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quick, and with the many temperature options it is perfect for any hair type.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, this baby gets HOT!!!!</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great to smooth out curls and frizz for curly hair.</li>
            <li>i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair always holds a curl, but this curling iron just doesn&#x27;t give it any kind of curl.</li>
            <li>I own every size Marcel curling iron from the 1/2\\</li>
            <li>It always looks kind of frizzy dependant upon the conditioner or shampoo I use.</li>
            <li>kind of look.</li>
            <li>It got warm but would not make a curl.</li>
            <li>If someone wants this to straighten hair then it would be a great product!</li>
            <li>I really liked this product after I returned a curling iron with no clamp for my hair</li>
            <li>This tool was also really effective in straightening my hair, but again, I already have a hair straightener to do that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that you can pick your heat setting, if you want to spare your hair.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery and great item!</li>
            <li>it just gives it a nice polished look that is curled in at the ends.</li>
            <li>It gives me nice volume that holds through out the day..</li>
            <li>What this does for me is give me a really nice volume.</li>
            <li>I am not aure why that kind of curling iron isn&#x27;t made anymore</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still working nicely.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price... highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>This works great to do waves on a lower heat setting or makes gorgeous curls on higher head settings.  </li>
            <li>perfect size bouncy natural curls..easy to use...always delivers a perfect lasting hair do...very happy with the product</li>
            <li>The good news is that it  arrived very quickly and the price was competitive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own hairspray so it might work better using it</li>
            <li>Works perfect so far.  </li>
            <li>got a great price from this vendor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the best one she has out of the three she owns because it easily gives so much control and body.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and I&#x27;ve used it for years and its still going strong!</li>
            <li>OMG I love love love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love the handle (soft and perfect width for my hand-</li>
            <li>Hot tools has great products which is why I bought this item.</li>
            <li>Great product, shipped quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li>hot as hell, does great curls.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge!  </li>
            <li>ok, doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had anticipated, I find that a lot in this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it with no questions asked and my account was credited for the amount I  had been charged.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the durability of the curling iron as well the results of the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I like being able to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order the appropriate size (should have been 1 inch)</li>
            <li>and I come back and its heated perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li>The stand for this iron is not sufficient to have the top sit off the counter.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the prompt service.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know of anyone that was satisfied with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2\\&quot; gives me volume and a bit of curl, while the 1-1/2\\&quot; gives me volume but more curl and that it&#x27;s more versatile.</li>
            <li>I get more vavoom without looking like an 80s rock star groupie.</li>
            <li>I can put more hair in the curl and get more of a volume look vs. a curled look.</li>
            <li>and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the fat curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have had it for several months and can report nothing but great curls from it!</li>
            <li>and I like it, but dont love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than Conair&#x27;s version but better quality all around.</li>
            <li>I think that the 1.5&amp;#34; might have worked better on my hair.  </li>
            <li>so i have many tools</li>
            <li>It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely hope Amazong will look into this and rectify the situation.</li>
            <li>Works very well &amp; great price.</li>
            <li>You are better off ordering through [...].</li>
            <li>I have the 1 1/4&#x27;&#x27; one, and I love that one.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>This curling iron does magical things to the volume at my crown.</li>
            <li>It neither effectively curled my hair nor helped to even smooth areas into a semi-curl.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I love this size of curling iron for when you don&#x27;t necessarilly want curls but more volume and body.</li>
            <li>I love the size to add body with a curl under or over.</li>
            <li>I am no novice and have tried many hair tools in my 20 years of self styling.</li>
            <li>Should have just listened to myself and stuck with more quality brands.</li>
            <li>I prefer the push-button styles more; I guess because I&#x27;m more convinced they will automatically shut off in case of emergency that a manual functioning device.  </li>
            <li>My favorite tool.</li>
            <li>the more heat it will need to curl hair</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this buy another one</li>
            <li>I like having the feature of being able to adjust the heating setting.  </li>
            <li>and I love their products.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d be better off with a 1.5 inch iron.</li>
            <li>This is a great \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron even though it doesn&#x27;t really curl.</li>
            <li>I love it because it looks like I just got a salon blowout with just using this curling iron.</li>
            <li>If you like the just blown out smooth salon look, this is for you!</li>
            <li>This was one place I was able to do it.</li>
            <li>I love the heat settings on this .</li>
            <li>I love the curls it made</li>
            <li>this curling iron tops everything I love it and would just about die if it broke.  </li>
            <li>I needed the 2\\&quot; because of the length of my hair to give it more body.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a 1 1/2 barrel for years and just love this 2 inch one.</li>
            <li>Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control&lt;br /&gt;Still have to get to use it better</li>
            <li>I love that it has a rotating cord</li>
            <li>I sincerely suggest you don&#x27;t get anything electronic off the internet, everything I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw videos on Youtube of people who were able to get glamorous bombshell waves out of this product.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this tool.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>If you want big curls then best curler I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is better suited to professionals, who keep it heated and who have metal holders and aren&#x27;t relying on the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it should come with a marcel handle, as the spring clip and rubber top is for amateurs.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Upon moving to TX my hair has been even more disagreeable and this iron fights those battles for me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite styler.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I guess I was looking more for 1.5&amp;#34; than 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to play around with the heat settings more, but is seems to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in my hair</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this curling iron EXCEPT for the cord - why can&#x27;t these appliance manufactuers use a non-tangling cord???  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a smoother</li>
            <li>:) That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to replace them.</li>
            <li>but I do love the size</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love the size and the heat</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because Jilbere doesn&#x27;t make my favorite anymore.</li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>The larger barrel is perfect for my longer hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely am in love with it.</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>I had been using and iron with a 1.5 inch barrel, mostly for curling the ends of my hair in.</li>
            <li>Love this curler.</li>
            <li>Love the multi-heat control.</li>
            <li>and I thought the 2\\&quot; would make big curls and since its a good brand work really great like at the salon but didn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>Either way, I love this brand, and will keep the iron.</li>
            <li>i had to hold over 30 seconds before it gave me a &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; i would be satisfied with.</li>
            <li>The heat settings are perfect and it comes with 2 extra springs in case one on the curling iron breaks.</li>
            <li>omg i love this product i have had it over a year</li>
            <li>I absolutely in love with this tool.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this iron.</li>
            <li>I love Hot Tools Appliances!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the waves this curling iron leaves, it was worth every penny and Iove it!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good weight and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>As curls fall out leaves hair nice and full.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased, well worth the money&#x27;s</li>
            <li>; barrel is perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>Curling iron gets good and hot.  </li>
            <li>I had a large curling before and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly and it makes very lose wavy hair, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck).</li>
            <li>I used a curl busting moose and with dry hair tried to create a curl, although it does give my hair beautiful waves, it will not curl!</li>
            <li>This is a high-quality tool that&#x27;s easy to use and okay for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice iron and comes with extra springs which I am happy about.</li>
            <li>I love Hot Tools and was very pleased with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its fine</li>
            <li>I love them and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s amazing for me considering how much hair I have!!  </li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised to discover it works great on my hair...</li>
            <li>Even on the highest heat setting, the most this iron does is straighten my hair with a light curl at the end.</li>
            <li>Gives beautiful, sexy bedhead curls that last.</li>
            <li>I think it would be great if you were in a room where the outlet is far away, but otherwise the cord just makes my bathroom counter so cluttered.</li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This iron gives my hair more of a smooth, shiny, finished look.</li>
            <li>I also have a Hot Tools 1 inch curling iron which I have been very pleased with for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and great for creating large curls/waves.  </li>
            <li>This is not only good as a curling iron, when you use it, you don&#x27;t need a straightner either!  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair great body, provides a smooth curl and it lasts nearly all day.</li>
            <li>I like this curler iron but is not to easy to use.</li>
            <li>heats up very quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and it holds my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair curls fairly easily - so</li>
            <li>easy to burn self.</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>The adjustable heating control makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Iron heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair easily like my conair on</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have wavy-curly fine hair that frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and this curling iron makes beautiful big waves in it, like a just got my hair done at the salon</li>
            <li>and it got so hot through the day when I forgot to turn it off that it burned through its own wire and the countertop.</li>
            <li>Also the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; gets pretty warm so moving the stand out of the way once it is heated is tricky.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for getting a nice subtle curl on the ends of my hair and for accentuating the shorter layers.</li>
            <li>I love how quick and easy my hair fixes with this</li>
            <li>Best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length hair that has a bit of a wave to it.</li>
            <li>and I could see this iron not working on someone with fine or silky hair.</li>
            <li>look and it works fine.</li>
            <li>A fine buy.</li>
            <li>i was fine with the design n</li>
            <li>If your hair is super bleached and fried, this iron might work for you, if you have any sort of healthy hair that is even</li>
            <li>Super savings on this amazing 24K gold hot iron!  </li>
            <li>This iron is perfect for my long, wavy hair, because it gives nice soft curls and smooths frizz.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this curling iron!</li>
            <li>Gets very hot love it</li>
            <li>I really love this iron, I have long straight hair and this adds the perfect &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to the ends.</li>
            <li>It worked perfect and the price was great compared to the regular stores that sell this product (almost half the price).</li>
            <li>but it produces great, loose beach waves that I love.</li>
            <li>HT didn&#x27;t make a set that I liked, so I picked these since I needed large rollers.</li>
            <li>My hair falls about 4 inches below my shoulders, and this size barrel straightens my hair, gives it just a little volume with a perfect bouncy curl at the ends.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and wanted something to straighten and give a little curl at the ends and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>This is such a great curling iron, I can divide my hair into 4 large sections and this has the ability to semi-straighten and get rid of frizzies while providing nice waves at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>This was a hard to find item that I was delighted to find online for a great price.</li>
            <li>; barrel is HUGE and</li>
            <li>The difference between a 1.25&amp;#34; to 1.5&amp;#34; iron isn&#x27;t huge, but the jump to 2&amp;#34; is drastic.</li>
            <li>Huge inch curler, haven&#x27;t tried it yet..</li>
            <li>This thing is huge.</li>
            <li>Huge BUMP iron.</li>
            <li>This is a huge barrel.</li>
            <li>I also like the idea of the gold plating because I heard that it really gives hair a nice smooth shine.</li>
            <li>It is HUGE.</li>
            <li>came in a huge box nicley packaged so it wouldnt break on its journey to my house.</li>
            <li>This product fit my need.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product that feels like its quality built.</li>
            <li>&quot; Overall, this was a great buy for the price!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It does not glide smoothly through the hair</li>
            <li>The iron is no thrills, but it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s a deal for the money.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice look of straight hair with alot of body.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased cheap curling irons from Target/WalMart...</li>
            <li>I have had more success with a 1 1/4\\&quot; iron.</li>
            <li>If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>It worked absolutely fantastic for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The surface works as advertised, hair moves over the surface smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;reason of 3 star is because the light of On/Off and the Temp control dial are not working.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron after reading the great reviews people had left.</li>
            <li>Otherwise...This is great for big curls or to straighten and take out frizz.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, so this helps smooth out the waves and gives a smooth look with lots of body.</li>
            <li>This is better then blow drying your hair and faster, it dose not give you curls is more for a straight hair look.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long (up to my waist) and this curling iron is PERFECT for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I miss that cover, however, so far so good on performance.</li>
            <li>Gets hot and works well, but it is too easy to accidentally turn it off without knowing it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with my new hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the loose hot roller waves.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 Hot Tools, saved a bundle &amp; they were at my door in no time!!</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for!!</li>
            <li>Barrel is very large, the curl turns is more of a wave when done.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools is always my favorite for curling irons &amp; the heat dial helps me so that I don&#x27;t fry my fine, processed hair.</li>
            <li>great price , I have a smaller one also its worn out love hot tool products.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I was pretty sure I could get some huge beachy waves.</li>
            <li>; barrel seems huge at first, but it creates those lovely, covetable &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; waves - and can act as a straightener, in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Makes styling easy and quick.</li>
            <li>My new favorite curling iron!  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and full of body after using this.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, great for wavy curls for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Hot Tools products for many years because of their durability.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure that would FRY my hair, so i keep it on the lower settings.</li>
            <li>I did not use it for the first time until just after that period and have not been able to return it, leaving me out-of-pocket for a ineffective product.</li>
            <li>Always love Hot tools and I was looking for a 2 inch Barrel.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Hot Tools -Supertool 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love this Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; gold curling iron.</li>
            <li>great size for long hair or if you just want some wave to your hair.</li>
            <li>All my curling irons are Hot Tools, I love the brand.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this curling iron</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and gets super hot just as I expected.  </li>
            <li>not real curl, just a nice bend and a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and has a smooth cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>and the cord is super long and its great.</li>
            <li>One thing that was good is that it does heat up very quickly and the clip handle is long so you won&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Even at the lowest setting, the unit quickly gets so hot that merely touching the handle can cause burns.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use medium/small ever, and I needed a large set with more than 5 in them.</li>
            <li>I love the large size for softer curls.</li>
            <li>It has lots of heat settings which is important to me since it gets SO hot!  </li>
            <li>, I have it on the second to lowest setting and it still makes my hair hot - this is great if you need the heat.  </li>
            <li>Nice and hot and holds hair very well.</li>
            <li>Not so good on the bangs because its just to big.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because I needed really lose but elegant curls for an upcoming beauty pageant.</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray because it&#x27;s flexible and really holds.</li>
            <li>The barrel is just too big for my length, so it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of curling.</li>
            <li>as for the item.. its good for SHORT hair.</li>
            <li>much needed on most irons who&#x27;s springs break, but the iron itself still works.</li>
            <li>so I really use it more for a straightener than anything....</li>
            <li>the tip is cool for holding while waiting for the curl to set, but the highest temp is 400</li>
            <li>For those with thick hair this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have to put a lot of hair spray to have it hold but was trying to find something where I wouldn&#x27;t have to fry my hair on top of putting so much chemical in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going for a good ceramic curling iron next time.</li>
            <li>However, I would not advise going full tilt until you know how your hair responds to the heat and tension.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, and for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my hair&#x27;s texture (smoother) and appearance (shinier, more styled.)  </li>
            <li>Arrived really quickly without paying for special delivery.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have this--my hair is fine but can get a little frizzy in our humid air.  </li>
            <li>The iron stays hot and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>A good alternative to a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>it heats quick too and</li>
            <li>Can either be waves or super curly..</li>
            <li>quick curls</li>
            <li>and it heats up quickly within a couppla minutes</li>
            <li>I heats up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly for efficient styling.</li>
            <li>but it seems the springs wear out quick.  </li>
            <li>it heats up quickly and my hair don&#x27;t get stuck around the barrel.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my short in the back, longer on the sides haircut!</li>
            <li>I have used Conair many, many years ago and will NEVER go back to that brand again... ever.</li>
            <li>However, it does straighten my hair quickly and give it one stretced out S wave that allows for some body.  </li>
            <li>I love the option to select the temperature the iron heats up to as I don&#x27;t like to use high heats on my hair to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>Between Tunu and the ionizing Hot Tools, my hair is super shiny, holds curl and volume all day and just looks fabulous.    </li>
            <li>the Hot Tools is worth every cent in quality of barrel, time to heat, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily straighten my hair with it and make it look normal and smooth</li>
            <li>Beware, it gets very hot</li>
            <li>These irons get very hot and will cook your hair if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the iron gives off nice even heat and most of the time I receive the desired style.</li>
            <li>this curler DOES get VERY HOT though.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about how it gets very hot</li>
            <li>Very hot.</li>
            <li>It did get very hot</li>
            <li>IT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This product from Hot Tools really leaves it smooth and silky and with a mild but strong curl.  </li>
            <li>I would have been happy with having just slight curls and some volume</li>
            <li>The quality is good -- I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for several months with no problems.  </li>
            <li>You can easily create a straight style that has roundness to it, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; was recommended to me by my hair stylist, however it stopped working after one use!</li>
            <li>The curling iron is the same quality that you would find in a salon supply store, just much more affordable!</li>
            <li>First thing: this iron does not have an auto-off switch!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Hot Tools Products have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s really hot on highest setting!</li>
            <li>After about one year of great use, the hinge and clamp were no longer tightly closing anyway.</li>
            <li>Lastly, as with most curling iron&#x27;s barrel, long hair would benefit from a longer length barrel to more effectively curl the hair.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot fast but know the 2 inch is a HUGE barrel so this just gives hair a bit of a wave.</li>
            <li>The look it gives when working is great, but check out other 2-inch irons first.</li>
            <li>My hair is stubbornly wavy, but this curling iron does a great job smoothing it out and giving it a little bounce at the ends.  </li>
            <li>With the very large size, I use this to straighten parts of my hair when I need a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I have heavy hair and this tool didn&#x27;t work so great for my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very silky and smooth looking but gives it body too.</li>
            <li>but they dropped and broke a few years ago,just happy</li>
            <li>(i also put biosilk wich helps calm my hair)</li>
            <li>; iron is more for creating a bit of volume, to mimick a professional blowout.</li>
            <li>Although my hair was kind of short.</li>
            <li>Pantene leave in overnight conditioner packets (which are now discontinued) worked in wet somehow styles my mop of hair into this gorgeous polished Dyan Cannon style, 2.</li>
            <li>It straitens my hair better than my old conair straightener, and it stays for two days with just a touch up on my bangs.</li>
            <li>Curls just enough to give nice body &amp; turns ends under</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I, who is usually pleased with anything done to my hair, was completely unsatisfied and I will be returning the curling iron.</li>
            <li>More of a natural look.</li>
            <li>make some nice big curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few 2 inch curling irons over the years and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>This curling is great, but bear in mind its just for really giving body to your hair not real curl.</li>
            <li>Nice big curling iron, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>SOOOOO worth it-</li>
            <li>I love how much volume I get when using this iron on all my hairs layers separately, and I especially like how it works to give my hair direction, more than curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more user friendly than my smaller one...</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, heats up fast and works really well on thick/long hair.</li>
            <li>Between Tunu and the ionizing Hot Tools, my hair is super shiny, holds curl and volume all day and just looks fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curling iron did get super hot</li>
            <li>Gets super hot, but also adjustable.</li>
            <li>They get really hot really quick and the curls don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is very high quality - definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous curlers and to be completely honest my long hair holds curls amazingly for days without any hairspray.</li>
            <li>I section my hair and put the heat setting all the way to maximum and it does get hot very fast!</li>
            <li>With the large barrel, strong spring grip, and high heat level, I&#x27;m able to curl large chunks of my hair at a time, which really saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li>I checked in-store&#x27;s and online but amazon had the right price and the right merchandise.</li>
            <li>Has all the control settings you need &amp; gives you just the right size curl.  </li>
            <li>I bought it from Italy, I don&#x27;t think there could be electrical mismatches since I correctly used the right plug.</li>
            <li>Right there that tells you something</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>cuz theres a temperature setting right on the handle.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right one.</li>
            <li>I have other hot tools curling irons from this line in different sizes, and they are the best.</li>
            <li>The grip isn&#x27;t too tight around the hair, and I can still pull strands through very smoothly without touching the spring.</li>
            <li>I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons.</li>
            <li>I have another 2 inch curling iron and gets hot quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and heats up quickly and gives me the exact look for my hair that I want.</li>
            <li>Not only was this product an amazing price, but shipping was reasonable and it got to me pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Something to smooth out my normally semi-frizzy hair and give it some body.</li>
            <li>Wish I could put a before and after pic, it truely does work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron, especially that the adjustments can&#x27;t be changed while you are using it like many others I have purchased!  </li>
            <li>This iron is more for big waves, but take forever to heat up and then doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Gets real hot fast and saves time getting ready!</li>
            <li>You can do a quick large curl or a straighter look with the tips of your hair curled under or up.</li>
            <li>It will mostly straighten the hair and give a little volume but mostly do the straightening thing.</li>
            <li>Makes large curls, gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, this curling iron does not seem to get as hot, as I don&#x27;t really get the large barrel curl that I&#x27;m looking for, if anything, it will just kind of give a soft curl to the ENDS of my hair without anything higher up along my hair.</li>
            <li>New out of the box and the power indicator light does not work.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and appears to be a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It creates a gentle pressed smoothing action more than a curly effect</li>
            <li>It will smooth your hair and give it a nice bend at the ends as though you&#x27;ve blown it out with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look</li>
            <li>It works well as far as the quality and easy use of it.</li>
            <li>I am a retired cosmetologist and recently my Pro Star curling iron died a good death after nearly 20 years of service.</li>
            <li>It looks nice but really not even worth the 30 something that is sold for.</li>
            <li>When you first curl your hair with this, yes, for the first five minutes, you&#x27;ll have fun, bouncy 2 inch curls.</li>
            <li>I have a 1 inch barrel curling rod that I have been using for years which gives great curls and was looking for the larger softer curls that a larger barrel could offer.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product and the tight spring would be great for someone with thin hair, but if the texture of your hair is as mine, get ready for alot pulling &amp; snagging.  </li>
            <li>Was a little concerned that it might not be a good quality product but was happy to find that it is as good if not better than previous ones.</li>
            <li>Hope it lasts as long as my other one! &lt;3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s disappointing because compared to the Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron (that I also own) the 1 1/2&amp;#34;  does a great job curling and it lasts even a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Sets a nice loose curl.  </li>
            <li>Product shipped very fast and product was as listed online.</li>
            <li>the product is okay, however the curls drop quite quickly and the different heat setting do not seem to have that much of an effect upon the curl or its durability</li>
            <li>Like other reviews have stated it&#x27;s really good for that &#x27;blown out salon look&#x27; without having to be very skilled at using a round brush.</li>
            <li>It has put in many hours of service already a little more than halfway through the project and showing itself to be a very durable product.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is I keep burning my forehead because I&#x27;m not used to the huge size!  </li>
            <li>lot)&lt;br /&gt;Smoked more often than not (and that was on low heat)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its hot tools or just this size, but for that price, I don&#x27;t want to find out.</li>
            <li>I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to.</li>
            <li>I love Hot tools curling irons they usually last me while</li>
            <li>I find that it is not as hot as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>This one is well made and gets plenty hot.</li>
            <li>More like a big wave.</li>
            <li>It doesn exactly what I needed to my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; to the 1-1/2\\&quot; and the spring 2\\&quot; curling iron as well as their ionizing blow dryer and the interchangeable size hot air brush.</li>
            <li>(Hot Tools Hairsetter 12 pc.)</li>
            <li>If I use the hot air brush, this is where I stop.</li>
            <li>Sometimes for more of a spiral perm look, I roll the hair with the rollers perpendicular to the floor and alternate rolling away/towards the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This iron get hot but for some reason it does not curl.  </li>
            <li>I have never used hot tools before so this is my first experience.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Hot Tools 2 inch iron after a friend gave me rave reviews.</li>
            <li>My favorite look is to curl all my hair first, then lightly hairspray it for soft big curls.</li>
            <li>and this really gives me a lot of volume!</li>
            <li>(even at the lower end of the dial), but I&#x27;m getting consistent results now</li>
            <li>so I will see if I can get this to work another time ;)</li>
            <li>Although the curling iron did exactly what I wanted in terms of shape of curls (a 2 inch barrel is not meant to CURL...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot..</li>
            <li>be aware</li>
            <li>This curling iron was exactly what I was looking for -</li>
            <li>this product is exactly as described, but it doesnt work with straight hair!</li>
            <li>barrel forever, and am so glad i finally found one.</li>
            <li>I can never keep rollers in, and this works so fast!</li>
            <li>My hair is only med length so the 1.5&amp;#34; better suits me for waves.</li>
            <li>I tried the product three different times using the hottest setting and holding the curl for 25 seconds or more.</li>
            <li>love the big curls it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li>First I blow it out and then use the iron.</li>
            <li>It did exactly that.</li>
            <li>I tried it out for the first time, cranking it to its highest heat setting and allowing it to heat up for 10 mins before use.</li>
            <li>I have had this curling iron for several months now and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Ordered it to replace mine that I&#x27;d had for over 5 years and finally dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li>I am thinking I was not the first to return this iron.</li>
            <li>First purchase was from Ulta store.  </li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize - the bigger the barrel, the more your curls fall out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I lost my first one</li>
            <li>This curling iron stays hot and doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this before a big day and got so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this line many times in the past and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>After heating, it starts to smell funny</li>
            <li>Gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li>Even the lowest setting was too hot</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the tip of the iron which does not get hot and helps with the process.</li>
            <li>Adjustable temps can keep from frying the more fragile hair.  </li>
            <li>Not so with this Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>The barrell is the exact size that I was after.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Hot tools/</li>
            <li>I will NEVER purchase a Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li>No matter how hot the setting.</li>
            <li>never had these problems with hot tools before.</li>
            <li>Too hot, burned my hair.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it gives me the opportunity to wear my hair with more body and style.</li>
            <li>The gold plate makes hair shinny and smooth, but it sort of weighs hair down just a bit more than the ceramic barrels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a really long cord, which is nice, but as others noted, it comes with extra springs because they break easily</li>
            <li>It gets super hot and leaves my hair looking very sleek without damaging it too much.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li>The good thing about this iron is that it does tame all my frizzy hair and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers said this indeed gets very HOT so people with fine hair should pay close attention to the temp!</li>
            <li>My hair is medium length, so when I use this product, it acts more like a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This curling iron works better than my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Even though I havent been able to use this item as often as I should,I think this product will work better if your hair is not too thick.</li>
            <li>The end of the iron also has a large plastic tip that doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, so you won&#x27;t burn your hands holding the ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, long, and straight</li>
            <li>Great for long and very long hair.</li>
            <li>I paid over $40 for mine because all the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li>So while I find it works great on freshly washed and dried hair, if I take my shower the night before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out as well.</li>
            <li>also, the heat didn&#x27;t get as hot as fast as i would like it to.</li>
            <li>Love the 2\\&quot; &amp; long cord, but will be trading for a safer version.</li>
            <li>I bet it works even greater on those with long hair.</li>
            <li>When I first tried to curl my hair, it came out straight and looking as though I had not done anything to it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how long you wait, or how many times you try to use this, it is just not meant for my hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this 2 inch barrel Hot Tools iron to see how it would work for how I style my hair, and I found I really like it.</li>
            <li>Solid, gets good and hot, has a temperature dial and a long cord.</li>
            <li>I must say, it curls the hair nicely, but it&#x27;s not worth the health risks.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this curling iron is the plastic tip -- you can actually put your fingers into it and hold the iron steady while you twist your hair around it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking nice and styled so you can avoid that slicked down to the side of your head</li>
            <li>I love the long cord, too!</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself due to it large size.</li>
            <li>When I want to add more curl, I just dry my hair and use the irons.</li>
            <li>Liked my previous one but the spring for the clamp broke after about a year.</li>
            <li>And actually, it&#x27;s easy to take the stand off and put it back on if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair.</li>
            <li>The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice fullness to my hair, which generally has no volume, whatsoever (Asian hair).</li>
            <li>Excellent tool for long thick hair 2&amp;#34; is just what I needed</li>
            <li>Mine&#x27;s pretty thick, but it&#x27;s layered and had a good product in it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The size of this tool is only good if you have long hair or if you just want a flip at your ends.</li>
            <li>My hair looks like I just had it done in a salon with a full, but soft, gentle curl.</li>
            <li>For such a large barrel, it is surprisingly easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>The 2\\&quot; diameter is also too large for the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>The Supertool 2\\&quot; curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter&#x27;s shorter hair style.  </li>
            <li>Too large of diameter to make any curl or even a wave.</li>
            <li>but returned it as it was an error on my part as the barrel was too large</li>
            <li>too large and combersom</li>
            <li>The size was too large; the curl did not hold.</li>
            <li>But this barrel is a bit too large.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the barrel is too large.</li>
            <li>The temp controls are great, so if you have weak hair, it won&#x27;t melt or burn your hair.</li>
            <li>While this iron heats up nicely, the spring and clip do not hold onto the hair tightly and the hair slips through before you can roll it up.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 1&amp;#34; and really liked it, so I ordered the 2&amp;#34; for lift and body without tight curls.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the settings to different heat levels but since I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have used HOT tools for years, but never this particular one.  </li>
            <li>Does nice soft, loose curls.</li>
            <li>She had thigh-length straight hair and would roll it up on pop cans, then use large hair ties to figure-8 to hold the hair on the can.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and gets to a high enough heat to style hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Little bigger than I thought but works great.</li>
            <li>The 2\\&quot; barrel makes for large, soft curls like those with rollers, but much more time-saving with its instant heat and adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t really work well to create waves.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the knowledge that a 2\\&quot; barrel will not curl as much as it smooths.   </li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it and it is also used by all her roommates, too.</li>
            <li>Curls fast..</li>
            <li>I found that the curls lasted much longer than those created with the blow brush.</li>
            <li>I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating.  </li>
            <li>I use the recommended setting for my hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>What it doesn&#x27;t give you is much of a curl at all.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a real curl and you don&#x27;t have hair that holds curl</li>
            <li>I did not like the smaller curling barrels and enjoy the lose curls that can be constructed with this iron.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Also the cord on this thing is very aggravating.</li>
            <li>return was simple and hassle free.</li>
            <li>I needed a big honking curler to make those old fashioned rolls of hair that I love so much.</li>
            <li>not so much....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but it still extends the life of your iron to maybe a year, after which both springs are broken and it&#x27;s time to replace it.  </li>
            <li>It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this iron.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Natural and shine and saved a lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>well adjust the temperature, starting at a low setting and going as higher in small increments as directed and figure out which works best for your hair type!  </li>
            <li>This iron did not cost much really, but it is now taking up space in my cabinet and I cannot even give this to a person who could use it.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron is really a monster.</li>
            <li>So it really does depend what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>my whole life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it maybe three times and will probably keep it but not use it very often since all it does is straighten.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I feel it works really well.</li>
            <li>However, on my hair it didn&#x27;t do much of a curly wave to it</li>
            <li>It has the feel of a cheap knock off of a salon quality iron, and given the price I guess that should have been obvious.</li>
            <li>I still use some product to protect my hair &amp; give it some shine, but the curling iron is really what makes it look polished.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect to get a curl out of it because it is a 2inch.</li>
            <li>A straight iron leaves it too straight with no lift and body.</li>
            <li>but like i said didn&#x27;t get much use.</li>
            <li>I was really disapointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe this works really well for people with hair strands that are fine/thin, but I have thicker strands of hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so much work to do.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast.  </li>
            <li>My old model (Revlon, no longer made) lasted over 10 years and had a cover that also was useful as a stand to store upright on the counter when not in use.  </li>
            <li>curling iron heats up lightning fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight.</li>
            <li>its very sturdy</li>
            <li>price on amazon was much nicer than Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Is there anyone out there who wants to purchase this?</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My hair holds curls really well</li>
            <li>I  really was,  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>She really like the size of the curl it produces.</li>
            <li>What this product gave me was soft, smooth, shiny waves that that feel so touchable soft.  </li>
            <li>It is still a nice product and I use mine everyday.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy duty cord....</li>
            <li>Waste of money, could have had a nice lunch with that cash...</li>
            <li>but I wanted to have more natural and big curl</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets hot enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Do not expect classic curl from this iron as the barrel is so large.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not course and curls fine with smaller barrel golden hot curlers and with my chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>the higher the heat setting the more prone to your hair smelling a little \\&quot;crispy.\\</li>
            <li>This 2 inch iron does not curl hair but it does create a smooth, full bodied look with little waves/curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more than slightly curled ends, this iron is probably too large.</li>
            <li>The only product I own that&#x27;s not Hot Tools is my hot rollers, they are Remington Ceramic Rollers.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had when I first received - every time my right hand was working the curling iron, I turned it off.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure if a curling iron will tame your curls, then have a stylist try it in a salon first.</li>
            <li>but my hair is just not long enough to spiral or curl more than once.</li>
            <li>are my products in addition to the Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons from 1/2\\&quot;-2\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li>Here are my products in addition to the Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons from 1/2\\&quot;-2\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I still like Hot Tool Professional products.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love having it in my collection of hair tools and have been using it the most lately.</li>
            <li>Its size makes it heavier than a typical iron, but you will curl more hair faster with the 2&amp;#34; rod so the effort is break-even.  </li>
            <li>So be careful when you unpack it that you don&#x27;t accidentally toss the spare springs because they are imbedded in the packaging and are easy to overlook.</li>
            <li>I totally burned my forehead right in the beginning when doing my bangs, but that was my inexperience with the large barrel....</li>
            <li>I use mainly for straitening.</li>
            <li>This gift was for my daughter, how will be are next top model hair designer of the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for longer layered hair, and for hard to tame hair.</li>
            <li>Since the barrel is so large it is a little clunky/awkward to use at first but for me it is well worth the results!</li>
            <li>There was a bit of a learning curve because it&#x27;s so big and very hot</li>
            <li>This curling iron smooths my almost-shoulder-length thick, dry, bleached hair beautifully...</li>
            <li>But i do think this will work for those who want more of a wave, it will not give you tight curls.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality curling iron.</li>
            <li>or we have a day of high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or we have a day of high humidity.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for shoulder length or longer hair.</li>
            <li>I would  highly recommend this item, for it&#x27;s quality and my needs.</li>
            <li>and this is on medium high temp.</li>
            <li>I will not order this brand again, and cannot recommend it highly based on my experience.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am not particularly clever with smoothing irons, so I use this to give me just a hint of lift and smooth out frizziness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for short to medium length hair (mine is short), for that rounded slightly curled under look.</li>
            <li>This curling iron helps control that wave and gives a soft, large curl.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a large iron that would make soft waves.</li>
            <li>It is for creating large, classy (IMO) waves.</li>
            <li>I should have reviewed a 2&#x27;&#x27; curling iron a little better before purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using a heat protectant, just like with any hot hair styling tool, but this won&#x27;t damage your hair any more than any other iron.  </li>
            <li>and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li>I wanted a really wide diameter curler to create a smooth curve.</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.  </li>
            <li>But, after seeing all the rave reviews, I expected it to really smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair naturally waves as much as this did.</li>
            <li>really makes hair soft and a tad of a curl on ends....</li>
            <li>As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>B00092M2X2 Hot Tools Professional 1035 1875 Watt Direct Ion FastDry Anti-Static Hair Dryer]]  </li>
            <li>This is great for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy layered hair and need the heat and the clamp, and I love the huge barrell it really softens of the look and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li>I normally have curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was really worried, especially reading a review where a women burned her hair off!</li>
            <li>It gives the long, full waves that I like.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s been blown out with a round brush</li>
            <li>Just curl each section normally, pin it and spray.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair the look of sweeping inward, without a stark contrast to the top part of my hair that the iron isn&#x27;t curling.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this brand and product, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I have always dreamt of having bouncing curls which only blow drying is able to deliver, however, I could never master the technique nor keep the curls all day long.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think I could use a curling iron on my type of hair, but my fabulous new hair stylist recommended a wide barrel curling iron to help create smoothness and movement.</li>
            <li>I burnt my forehead twice so easily please, please keep the temperature on as low as possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using very small pieces of hair to curl and still end up with the same softly curled end, which is great if that was the look I was going for.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and the wide barrel is great for loose curls.</li>
            <li>If you want curly hair, this one is not the right one for you, try getting a smaller one.</li>
            <li>Right now, I am growing it back out; it&#x27;s 3\\&quot; below my shoulders, all in one length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As others have said, the cord is super long.</li>
            <li>You have to have super long hair for this size</li>
            <li>The only reason it is not five stars is for the fact the company had to send me a new one, becaue it was not packaged right.</li>
            <li>The barrel is very smooth but the handle is sufficiently small and &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; enough to make the tool very simple and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the curler part is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They did infact send me a new one with a pre paid lable also.</li>
            <li>New works as advertised</li>
            <li>It is definately an item that I can live without.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, you can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>so they made it look new and sold it.</li>
            <li>so had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>and it works like new</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get that smooth easy action that I need to straighten my very thick hair.</li>
            <li>As always, HOT tools are high quality; heat up hot and fast, handle well, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use Straight Smooth &amp; Sexty smoothing spray and even with that, the iron would not easily smooth through the 1\\&quot; sections of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic curling iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the big curls that it gives my because after I fluff it, it turns to body.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the on indicator light is on the side, (not visible), I left it on and it does not have an auto shut off feature.</li>
            <li>WOW, thank you, works GREAT, instead of frying my processed hair with a ( brand name expensive) flat iron, this gives my below the shoulder hair just the right bend and smoothness</li>
            <li>I have thin but unruly hair and this is perfect for smoothing my hair and giving the ends a slight curl under to give my hair that polished salon look!  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a very old 2 inch barrel that I used to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>A very professional product.</li>
            <li>A little larger than I expected, but it works great as a straightener and adds wave.  </li>
            <li>Extra long cord makes it easy to use, you don&#x27;t feel tethered to the electrical outlet.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the 2&amp;#34; curling iron since I have super long hair and wanted to get soft waves.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, works great, curls my very long, thick hair in a short time.</li>
            <li>This tool does it all, it does not create super curly strands, but soft, wavy ones, it also is able to make the curls last longer and feel bouncier for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This definitely isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve curled my hair, so I knew it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>great product- controls my thick, wavy hair faster than any other styling method...</li>
            <li>My first one lasted ten years</li>
            <li>Girlfriend here - This curling iron does not get hot enough, does not curl, and leaves dents.</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have had only Hot Tools curling irons</li>
            <li>As far as heat goes, this thing packs it!  </li>
            <li>NEVER GOT HOT ENOUGH.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why i got it, but because the curling  iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the 2nd Hot Tools Ive gotten.</li>
            <li>But on Amazon, the exact same item is even</li>
            <li>Classy hollywood curls, here I come!</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curly.</li>
            <li>It comes out relaxed and soft!</li>
            <li>This barrel is far too large, apparently.</li>
            <li>I liked this product as it has a variety of temperatures and seems to heat evenly; I had been using a 1&amp;#34;inch barrel on my long hair and the results were a little too curly for my liking.</li>
            <li>I typically wear it naturally curly or flat iron it, but I had really been wanting a big curling iron to style it for nice events.  </li>
            <li>The previous reviewer is correct in that it gives you smooth hair, but with volume and curve.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle , not too heavy for the size of the barrel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to smooth my hair in less than half the time of a flat iron (and without burning myself) and curling iron combination.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite disappointed since I was expecting a tool that gets super hot while mine gets nearly warm.</li>
            <li>as this may just be a bit too large (is that possible?)</li>
            <li>and instead I use it to smooth from root to almost the tip and then to add a little flip to the end - no hairspray needed and the flip stays all day.  </li>
            <li>For my hair, which is a bit past my shoulders, medium thickness, and mostly straight with just a touch of natural wave, this curling iron works more like a flat iron than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>My hair comes to the middle of my back, so I thought this would give me a nice little bump at the end...</li>
            <li>This item was purchased as  Christmas gift for one of my young adult daughters.</li>
            <li>If yours is much shorter than that the barrel may be too big for you.</li>
            <li>it works like a professional curling Iron....10 stars......</li>
            <li>Its also perfecton bangs because it gives them the natural swept look.  </li>
            <li>Professional</li>
            <li>1035 1875 Watt Direct Ion FastDry Anti-Static Hair Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE your time or money on this.  </li>
            <li>so my hair&#x27;s usually left straight.</li>
            <li>Really provides waves because it is so big, not curls.</li>
            <li>Gives me natural curls and body.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools always last a long a time and you can really crank the heat.</li>
            <li>The 2 inch curler didn&#x27;t curl very well because I&#x27;ve learned the bigger the barrel</li>
            <li>It tames my hair when my natural wave begins to take over.  </li>
            <li>I really would suggest going smaller.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that it now squeeks when I life the curling lever piece which probably annoys the people around me more than it annoys myself.</li>
            <li>This makes natural looking curls and if your hair is shorter, it will just curl it under.  </li>
            <li>Even though I turned it all the way up, it still barely curled my hair, and was only somewhat successful when I used really thin chunks of hair.</li>
            <li>hairstylist, who works in a professional salon, also uses this brand.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the  big curls</li>
            <li>heats up fast and curlers last all day!</li>
            <li>as a professional i have used this every tool every week now for a year and its still working well.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t really curl your hair in a traditional sense.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just below my shoulders and is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;6.My hair looks professionally styled after I use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I use this iron to create soft curls.  </li>
            <li>You should order through a salon or your beautician and get a professional model.  </li>
            <li>My old one broke though..</li>
            <li>After much deliberation, I ultimately decided on this one.</li>
            <li>The metal stand is attached to the thumb clamp, but there are separate screws in it that actually hold the whole iron together.</li>
            <li>Recommend this  for girls who want a natural look.</li>
            <li>This item rusted after 2 months, it looks 10yrs old.</li>
            <li>thus far.</li>
            <li>Looks cool in theory - but in use, not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Most curling irons would leave my hair either flat or too tight of a curl.  </li>
            <li>I hope I could come to US to prove if it really works and gets deadly hot down there.</li>
            <li>all my other curlers work fine, heat up in a minute and curl my hair in about ten seconds</li>
            <li>after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I dry until damp, then use the hot air brush to style and complete the drying process.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair normally, apply heat protectant, then I use it to straight my hair.</li>
            <li>It comes out straight with a slight curve, which is fine with me because thats what I expected.</li>
            <li>Instead if makes my hair very flat--like a flat iron would.</li>
            <li>Great for loose wave on long hair or subtle bend on medium length hair..</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have hair that&#x27;s at least 4 inches past your shoulder, this probably isn&#x27;t a great choice for you.</li>
            <li>I recently started to travel more with my job than I did in the past.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one the first one last 4 years!!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased 3 of these curling irons in the past 2 years and they NEVER last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes heating element would stay on high even though I had it set on low</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tryna figure out why they have such high reviews...</li>
            <li>This one came with 2 extra springs and instructions on how to remove old and install new.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it heats up fast</li>
            <li>I have long, layered hair and this doesn&#x27;t really curl it -</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair</li>
            <li>(Before they came out with the jumbo hot rollers, I would use empty pop cans.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s not made as well as I expected.</li>
            <li>The first few uses , I wanted to send it back because it wasn&#x27;t even getting hot.</li>
            <li>I like the enormous size, but the spring is TOO TIGHT to create a \\&quot;smooth out\\&quot; fashion for straightening.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron fell off of the counter and for one brief quarter of a second, bumped against my right ankle, resulting in second degree burns.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Spring kept coming off (put a new spring on, same thing)&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I only use this brand, and I&#x27;m ready for my third because I wear them out with years of use.</li>
            <li>but my opinion is no matter how long or coarse your hair is, don&#x27;t get a 2 inch curler unless it has a higher wattage than 430 or else</li>
            <li>it is very professional with different heat settings a hanging hook and a stand to sit on counter if no hook to hang on.  </li>
            <li>When curling, I start at the crown, roll the top of the head with 1\\&quot; thick by 2\\&quot; wide sections and do them left to right and roll back away from the face.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like the 2&amp;#34; curl, but I went back to using my 1.5&amp;#34; or my flat iron to get a large curl.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about it coming in the mail because despite the other bad reviews, the good ones won me over.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to preheat these like other irons because they get hot within seconds.</li>
            <li>You can use other types of rollers as well, I just happen to have hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I normally use the highest setting on curling irons and flat irons</li>
            <li>Something I can&#x27;t seem to do with any other hot curler.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to people who have long hair and wants natural wave.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s getting quite as hot as other irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>; I turn it into a loose curl thats mostly straight.</li>
            <li>Put the hair tie over one end, flip the tie over so it crosses over the center of the hair, then secure over the other end of the can.)</li>
            <li>a flat iron really can&#x27;t create enough lift--</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, but the strands themselves are fine.</li>
            <li>Depending on how tight your curls are naturally, yours might need to be blown out first.</li>
            <li>I have really long black straight hair down to my waist, and I feel that I&#x27;m better off using a smaller barrel rather than 2 inches.2 inches</li>
            <li>I have long straight, layered, fine but fairly thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use any general cleansers because these will damage the surface of your tools.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t use any general cleansers because these will damage the surface of your tools.   </li>
            <li>I love the look of curly/wavy hair, but it usually takes such a long time for me to curl ALL of my hair</li>
            <li>I tried different techniques: I tried curling a whole bunch of hair, I left it on longer, and I even went out and bought a smaller size (1 inch) to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li>barely a wave to it.</li>
            <li>was using my 5-year-old Chi straightener at the same time, and let me tell you: that old Chi is three times hotter than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want the same look as a professional blow out....</li>
            <li>I have long Straight hair and this tool is big enough to make the curls look natural.</li>
            <li>Item is heavier than I expected, doesn&#x27;t really curl the hair</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t get that hot, and I was somewhat disappointed because I normally love this brand.</li>
            <li>I have thick healthy long hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and this works wonderfully to smooth it out and make it look like it&#x27;s been blown out.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are true, if you have thick hair this iron is too big to curl it (even though it gets smokin&#x27; hot!  </li>
            <li>I first tried the iron on the lowest setting - other reviews said the iron literally burned their hair out on the highest setting!</li>
            <li>Most of my other tools last a few years.</li>
            <li>Was missing a few parts, other than that loved the size and heat control.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools curling irons typically give me 5+ years of use.</li>
            <li>The large barrel on this iron essentially straightens the hair while giving it a little bit of turn at the ends (as opposed to stick straight hair from a flat iron).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on  this one doesn&#x27;t seem to compare to the others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Am old school; actually used to utilize an actual iron to get it done!</li>
            <li>have been using Hot Tools brand professional line styling products for the past 20+ years.</li>
            <li>I have long medium thick hair, and was excited to have large loose curls.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that Hot Tools has constructed this iron by separately screwing in thumb clamp, and not just using the little metal stand to hold it in.</li>
            <li>The weight of it is barely noticeable for the size being so much bigger..</li>
            <li>NOT long hair (which I have)</li>
            <li>all the way up, yes i left it in my hair for even over a minute or two and it barely made any shape.</li>
            <li>Pretty stupid to loose a good customer over $25.00.</li>
            <li>Curling iron works very well to give my hair a slight lift and fullness.</li>
            <li>It has an extra long cord (probably because it is often used professionally in salons,) and it has lots of heat settings so it can be customized for all hair types.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 18 year old daughter with long coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this Curling Iron to smooth out my long, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>The first iron I bought was fine for the first couple of uses, then the spring came off track and it was hard to open and close the clamp -- needed extra force and screeched the entire time I used it, very frustrating.</li>
            <li>It gets hot hot hot, which is so bad for your hair but whatever I can wear wigs if it falls out.&lt;br /&gt;took</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my sister&#x27;s thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>So if something happens and the little stand gets knocked off, the whole iron falls apart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to find a huge barrel for super-long hair.</li>
            <li>Not loving it but am trying to adjust heat and work with it a little bit more.</li>

            <li> The quality of this product is good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made as good as the others I&#x27;ve owned, Maybe it&#x27;s an after market who knows.  </li>

            <li> I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I love this iron!</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better curling iron!</li>
            <li> Hot tools makes a great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quick, and with the many temperature options it is perfect for any hair type.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, this baby gets HOT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great to smooth out curls and frizz for curly hair.</li>
            <li> i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair always holds a curl, but this curling iron just doesn&#x27;t give it any kind of curl.</li>
            <li> I own every size Marcel curling iron from the 1/2\\</li>
            <li> It always looks kind of frizzy dependant upon the conditioner or shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> kind of look.</li>
            <li> It got warm but would not make a curl.</li>
            <li> If someone wants this to straighten hair then it would be a great product!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product after I returned a curling iron with no clamp for my hair</li>
            <li> This tool was also really effective in straightening my hair, but again, I already have a hair straightener to do that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that you can pick your heat setting, if you want to spare your hair.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery and great item!</li>
            <li> it just gives it a nice polished look that is curled in at the ends.</li>
            <li> It gives me nice volume that holds through out the day..</li>
            <li> What this does for me is give me a really nice volume.</li>
            <li> I am not aure why that kind of curling iron isn&#x27;t made anymore</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still working nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price... highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> This works great to do waves on a lower heat setting or makes gorgeous curls on higher head settings.  </li>
            <li> perfect size bouncy natural curls..easy to use...always delivers a perfect lasting hair do...very happy with the product</li>
            <li> The good news is that it  arrived very quickly and the price was competitive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own hairspray so it might work better using it</li>
            <li> Works perfect so far.  </li>
            <li> got a great price from this vendor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s the best one she has out of the three she owns because it easily gives so much control and body.  </li>

            <li> ok, doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had anticipated, I find that a lot in this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it with no questions asked and my account was credited for the amount I  had been charged.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the durability of the curling iron as well the results of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I like being able to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order the appropriate size (should have been 1 inch)</li>
            <li> and I come back and its heated perfectly!  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> The stand for this iron is not sufficient to have the top sit off the counter.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the prompt service.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know of anyone that was satisfied with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; gives me volume and a bit of curl, while the 1-1/2\\&quot; gives me volume but more curl and that it&#x27;s more versatile.</li>
            <li> I get more vavoom without looking like an 80s rock star groupie.</li>
            <li> I can put more hair in the curl and get more of a volume look vs. a curled look.</li>
            <li> and it works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the fat curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have had it for several months and can report nothing but great curls from it!</li>
            <li> and I like it, but dont love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than Conair&#x27;s version but better quality all around.</li>
            <li> I think that the 1.5&amp;#34; might have worked better on my hair.  </li>
            <li> so i have many tools</li>
            <li> It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I sincerely hope Amazong will look into this and rectify the situation.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> You are better off ordering through [...].</li>
            <li> I have the 1 1/4&#x27;&#x27; one, and I love that one.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does magical things to the volume at my crown.</li>
            <li> It neither effectively curled my hair nor helped to even smooth areas into a semi-curl.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I love this size of curling iron for when you don&#x27;t necessarilly want curls but more volume and body.</li>
            <li> I love the size to add body with a curl under or over.</li>
            <li> I am no novice and have tried many hair tools in my 20 years of self styling.</li>
            <li> Should have just listened to myself and stuck with more quality brands.</li>
            <li> I prefer the push-button styles more; I guess because I&#x27;m more convinced they will automatically shut off in case of emergency that a manual functioning device.  </li>
            <li> My favorite tool.</li>
            <li> the more heat it will need to curl hair</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this buy another one</li>
            <li> I like having the feature of being able to adjust the heating setting.  </li>
            <li> and I love their products.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d be better off with a 1.5 inch iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron even though it doesn&#x27;t really curl.</li>
            <li> I love it because it looks like I just got a salon blowout with just using this curling iron.</li>
            <li> If you like the just blown out smooth salon look, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This was one place I was able to do it.</li>
            <li> I love the heat settings on this .</li>
            <li> I love the curls it made</li>
            <li> this curling iron tops everything I love it and would just about die if it broke.  </li>
            <li> I needed the 2\\&quot; because of the length of my hair to give it more body.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a 1 1/2 barrel for years and just love this 2 inch one.</li>
            <li> Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control&lt;br /&gt;Still have to get to use it better</li>
            <li> I love that it has a rotating cord</li>
            <li> I sincerely suggest you don&#x27;t get anything electronic off the internet, everything I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw videos on Youtube of people who were able to get glamorous bombshell waves out of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this tool.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you want big curls then best curler I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is better suited to professionals, who keep it heated and who have metal holders and aren&#x27;t relying on the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it should come with a marcel handle, as the spring clip and rubber top is for amateurs.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Upon moving to TX my hair has been even more disagreeable and this iron fights those battles for me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite styler.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I was looking more for 1.5&amp;#34; than 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to play around with the heat settings more, but is seems to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in my hair</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this curling iron EXCEPT for the cord - why can&#x27;t these appliance manufactuers use a non-tangling cord???  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a smoother</li>
            <li> :) That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to replace them.</li>
            <li> but I do love the size</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love the size and the heat</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because Jilbere doesn&#x27;t make my favorite anymore.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> The larger barrel is perfect for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with it.</li>
            <li> i love this.</li>
            <li> I had been using and iron with a 1.5 inch barrel, mostly for curling the ends of my hair in.</li>
            <li> Love this curler.</li>
            <li> Love the multi-heat control.</li>
            <li> and I thought the 2\\&quot; would make big curls and since its a good brand work really great like at the salon but didn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Either way, I love this brand, and will keep the iron.</li>
            <li> i had to hold over 30 seconds before it gave me a &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; i would be satisfied with.</li>
            <li> The heat settings are perfect and it comes with 2 extra springs in case one on the curling iron breaks.</li>
            <li> omg i love this product i have had it over a year</li>
            <li> I absolutely in love with this tool.</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this iron.</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools Appliances!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the waves this curling iron leaves, it was worth every penny and Iove it!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good weight and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> As curls fall out leaves hair nice and full.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased, well worth the money&#x27;s</li>
            <li> ; barrel is perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li> Curling iron gets good and hot.  </li>
            <li> I had a large curling before and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> It gets hot very quickly and it makes very lose wavy hair, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck).</li>
            <li> I used a curl busting moose and with dry hair tried to create a curl, although it does give my hair beautiful waves, it will not curl!</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality tool that&#x27;s easy to use and okay for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice iron and comes with extra springs which I am happy about.</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools and was very pleased with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its fine</li>
            <li> I love them and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s amazing for me considering how much hair I have!!  </li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised to discover it works great on my hair...</li>
            <li> Even on the highest heat setting, the most this iron does is straighten my hair with a light curl at the end.</li>
            <li> Gives beautiful, sexy bedhead curls that last.</li>
            <li> I think it would be great if you were in a room where the outlet is far away, but otherwise the cord just makes my bathroom counter so cluttered.</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This iron gives my hair more of a smooth, shiny, finished look.</li>
            <li> I also have a Hot Tools 1 inch curling iron which I have been very pleased with for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and great for creating large curls/waves.  </li>
            <li> This is not only good as a curling iron, when you use it, you don&#x27;t need a straightner either!  </li>
            <li> Gives my hair great body, provides a smooth curl and it lasts nearly all day.</li>
            <li> I like this curler iron but is not to easy to use.</li>
            <li> heats up very quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and it holds my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair curls fairly easily - so</li>
            <li> easy to burn self.</li>
            <li> and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> The adjustable heating control makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Iron heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair easily like my conair on</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have wavy-curly fine hair that frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and this curling iron makes beautiful big waves in it, like a just got my hair done at the salon</li>
            <li> and it got so hot through the day when I forgot to turn it off that it burned through its own wire and the countertop.</li>
            <li> Also the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; gets pretty warm so moving the stand out of the way once it is heated is tricky.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for getting a nice subtle curl on the ends of my hair and for accentuating the shorter layers.</li>
            <li> I love how quick and easy my hair fixes with this</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length hair that has a bit of a wave to it.</li>
            <li> and I could see this iron not working on someone with fine or silky hair.</li>
            <li> look and it works fine.</li>
            <li> A fine buy.</li>
            <li> i was fine with the design n</li>
            <li> If your hair is super bleached and fried, this iron might work for you, if you have any sort of healthy hair that is even</li>
            <li> Super savings on this amazing 24K gold hot iron!  </li>
            <li> This iron is perfect for my long, wavy hair, because it gives nice soft curls and smooths frizz.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot love it</li>
            <li> I really love this iron, I have long straight hair and this adds the perfect &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to the ends.</li>
            <li> It worked perfect and the price was great compared to the regular stores that sell this product (almost half the price).</li>
            <li> but it produces great, loose beach waves that I love.</li>
            <li> HT didn&#x27;t make a set that I liked, so I picked these since I needed large rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair falls about 4 inches below my shoulders, and this size barrel straightens my hair, gives it just a little volume with a perfect bouncy curl at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and wanted something to straighten and give a little curl at the ends and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> This is such a great curling iron, I can divide my hair into 4 large sections and this has the ability to semi-straighten and get rid of frizzies while providing nice waves at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This was a hard to find item that I was delighted to find online for a great price.</li>
            <li> ; barrel is HUGE and</li>
            <li> The difference between a 1.25&amp;#34; to 1.5&amp;#34; iron isn&#x27;t huge, but the jump to 2&amp;#34; is drastic.</li>
            <li> Huge inch curler, haven&#x27;t tried it yet..</li>
            <li> This thing is huge.</li>
            <li> Huge BUMP iron.</li>
            <li> This is a huge barrel.</li>
            <li> I also like the idea of the gold plating because I heard that it really gives hair a nice smooth shine.</li>
            <li> It is HUGE.</li>
            <li> came in a huge box nicley packaged so it wouldnt break on its journey to my house.</li>
            <li> This product fit my need.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product that feels like its quality built.</li>
            <li> &quot; Overall, this was a great buy for the price!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It does not glide smoothly through the hair</li>
            <li> The iron is no thrills, but it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s a deal for the money.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a nice look of straight hair with alot of body.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased cheap curling irons from Target/WalMart...</li>
            <li> I have had more success with a 1 1/4\\&quot; iron.</li>
            <li> If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> It worked absolutely fantastic for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The surface works as advertised, hair moves over the surface smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;reason of 3 star is because the light of On/Off and the Temp control dial are not working.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron after reading the great reviews people had left.</li>
            <li> Otherwise...This is great for big curls or to straighten and take out frizz.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, so this helps smooth out the waves and gives a smooth look with lots of body.</li>
            <li> This is better then blow drying your hair and faster, it dose not give you curls is more for a straight hair look.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long (up to my waist) and this curling iron is PERFECT for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I miss that cover, however, so far so good on performance.</li>
            <li> Gets hot and works well, but it is too easy to accidentally turn it off without knowing it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with my new hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the loose hot roller waves.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 Hot Tools, saved a bundle &amp; they were at my door in no time!!</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for!!</li>
            <li> Barrel is very large, the curl turns is more of a wave when done.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools is always my favorite for curling irons &amp; the heat dial helps me so that I don&#x27;t fry my fine, processed hair.</li>
            <li> great price , I have a smaller one also its worn out love hot tool products.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I was pretty sure I could get some huge beachy waves.</li>
            <li> ; barrel seems huge at first, but it creates those lovely, covetable &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; waves - and can act as a straightener, in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Makes styling easy and quick.</li>
            <li> My new favorite curling iron!  </li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and full of body after using this.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, great for wavy curls for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Hot Tools products for many years because of their durability.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m pretty sure that would FRY my hair, so i keep it on the lower settings.</li>
            <li> I did not use it for the first time until just after that period and have not been able to return it, leaving me out-of-pocket for a ineffective product.</li>
            <li> Always love Hot tools and I was looking for a 2 inch Barrel.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Hot Tools -Supertool 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; gold curling iron.</li>
            <li> great size for long hair or if you just want some wave to your hair.</li>
            <li> All my curling irons are Hot Tools, I love the brand.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this curling iron</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and gets super hot just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> not real curl, just a nice bend and a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and has a smooth cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> and the cord is super long and its great.</li>
            <li> One thing that was good is that it does heat up very quickly and the clip handle is long so you won&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Even at the lowest setting, the unit quickly gets so hot that merely touching the handle can cause burns.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use medium/small ever, and I needed a large set with more than 5 in them.</li>
            <li> I love the large size for softer curls.</li>
            <li> It has lots of heat settings which is important to me since it gets SO hot!  </li>
            <li> , I have it on the second to lowest setting and it still makes my hair hot - this is great if you need the heat.  </li>
            <li> Nice and hot and holds hair very well.</li>
            <li> Not so good on the bangs because its just to big.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because I needed really lose but elegant curls for an upcoming beauty pageant.</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray because it&#x27;s flexible and really holds.</li>
            <li> The barrel is just too big for my length, so it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of curling.</li>
            <li> as for the item.. its good for SHORT hair.</li>
            <li> much needed on most irons who&#x27;s springs break, but the iron itself still works.</li>
            <li> so I really use it more for a straightener than anything....</li>
            <li> the tip is cool for holding while waiting for the curl to set, but the highest temp is 400</li>
            <li> For those with thick hair this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have to put a lot of hair spray to have it hold but was trying to find something where I wouldn&#x27;t have to fry my hair on top of putting so much chemical in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going for a good ceramic curling iron next time.</li>
            <li> However, I would not advise going full tilt until you know how your hair responds to the heat and tension.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, and for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in my hair&#x27;s texture (smoother) and appearance (shinier, more styled.)  </li>
            <li> Arrived really quickly without paying for special delivery.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have this--my hair is fine but can get a little frizzy in our humid air.  </li>
            <li> The iron stays hot and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it heats quick too and</li>
            <li> Can either be waves or super curly..</li>
            <li> quick curls</li>
            <li> and it heats up quickly within a couppla minutes</li>
            <li> I heats up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly for efficient styling.</li>
            <li> but it seems the springs wear out quick.  </li>
            <li> it heats up quickly and my hair don&#x27;t get stuck around the barrel.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my short in the back, longer on the sides haircut!</li>
            <li> I have used Conair many, many years ago and will NEVER go back to that brand again... ever.</li>
            <li> However, it does straighten my hair quickly and give it one stretced out S wave that allows for some body.  </li>
            <li> I love the option to select the temperature the iron heats up to as I don&#x27;t like to use high heats on my hair to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> Between Tunu and the ionizing Hot Tools, my hair is super shiny, holds curl and volume all day and just looks fabulous.    </li>
            <li> the Hot Tools is worth every cent in quality of barrel, time to heat, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily straighten my hair with it and make it look normal and smooth</li>
            <li> Beware, it gets very hot</li>
            <li> These irons get very hot and will cook your hair if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the iron gives off nice even heat and most of the time I receive the desired style.</li>
            <li> this curler DOES get VERY HOT though.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how it gets very hot</li>
            <li> Very hot.</li>
            <li> It did get very hot</li>
            <li> IT GETS VERY HOT</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product from Hot Tools really leaves it smooth and silky and with a mild but strong curl.  </li>
            <li> I would have been happy with having just slight curls and some volume</li>
            <li> The quality is good -- I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for several months with no problems.  </li>
            <li> You can easily create a straight style that has roundness to it, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; was recommended to me by my hair stylist, however it stopped working after one use!</li>
            <li> The curling iron is the same quality that you would find in a salon supply store, just much more affordable!</li>
            <li> First thing: this iron does not have an auto-off switch!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Hot Tools Products have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s really hot on highest setting!</li>
            <li> After about one year of great use, the hinge and clamp were no longer tightly closing anyway.</li>
            <li> Lastly, as with most curling iron&#x27;s barrel, long hair would benefit from a longer length barrel to more effectively curl the hair.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot fast but know the 2 inch is a HUGE barrel so this just gives hair a bit of a wave.</li>
            <li> The look it gives when working is great, but check out other 2-inch irons first.</li>
            <li> My hair is stubbornly wavy, but this curling iron does a great job smoothing it out and giving it a little bounce at the ends.  </li>
            <li> With the very large size, I use this to straighten parts of my hair when I need a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I have heavy hair and this tool didn&#x27;t work so great for my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very silky and smooth looking but gives it body too.</li>
            <li> but they dropped and broke a few years ago,just happy</li>
            <li> (i also put biosilk wich helps calm my hair)</li>
            <li> ; iron is more for creating a bit of volume, to mimick a professional blowout.</li>
            <li> Although my hair was kind of short.</li>
            <li> Pantene leave in overnight conditioner packets (which are now discontinued) worked in wet somehow styles my mop of hair into this gorgeous polished Dyan Cannon style, 2.</li>
            <li> It straitens my hair better than my old conair straightener, and it stays for two days with just a touch up on my bangs.</li>
            <li> Curls just enough to give nice body &amp; turns ends under</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I, who is usually pleased with anything done to my hair, was completely unsatisfied and I will be returning the curling iron.</li>
            <li> More of a natural look.</li>
            <li> make some nice big curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few 2 inch curling irons over the years and this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> This curling is great, but bear in mind its just for really giving body to your hair not real curl.</li>
            <li> Nice big curling iron, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO worth it-</li>
            <li> I love how much volume I get when using this iron on all my hairs layers separately, and I especially like how it works to give my hair direction, more than curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more user friendly than my smaller one...</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, heats up fast and works really well on thick/long hair.</li>
            <li> Between Tunu and the ionizing Hot Tools, my hair is super shiny, holds curl and volume all day and just looks fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curling iron did get super hot</li>
            <li> Gets super hot, but also adjustable.</li>
            <li> They get really hot really quick and the curls don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very high quality - definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous curlers and to be completely honest my long hair holds curls amazingly for days without any hairspray.</li>
            <li> I section my hair and put the heat setting all the way to maximum and it does get hot very fast!</li>
            <li> With the large barrel, strong spring grip, and high heat level, I&#x27;m able to curl large chunks of my hair at a time, which really saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I checked in-store&#x27;s and online but amazon had the right price and the right merchandise.</li>
            <li> Has all the control settings you need &amp; gives you just the right size curl.  </li>
            <li> I bought it from Italy, I don&#x27;t think there could be electrical mismatches since I correctly used the right plug.</li>
            <li> Right there that tells you something</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> cuz theres a temperature setting right on the handle.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right one.</li>
            <li> I have other hot tools curling irons from this line in different sizes, and they are the best.</li>
            <li> The grip isn&#x27;t too tight around the hair, and I can still pull strands through very smoothly without touching the spring.</li>
            <li> I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons.</li>
            <li> I have another 2 inch curling iron and gets hot quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and heats up quickly and gives me the exact look for my hair that I want.</li>
            <li> Not only was this product an amazing price, but shipping was reasonable and it got to me pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Something to smooth out my normally semi-frizzy hair and give it some body.</li>
            <li> Wish I could put a before and after pic, it truely does work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron, especially that the adjustments can&#x27;t be changed while you are using it like many others I have purchased!  </li>
            <li> This iron is more for big waves, but take forever to heat up and then doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Gets real hot fast and saves time getting ready!</li>
            <li> You can do a quick large curl or a straighter look with the tips of your hair curled under or up.</li>
            <li> It will mostly straighten the hair and give a little volume but mostly do the straightening thing.</li>
            <li> Makes large curls, gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, this curling iron does not seem to get as hot, as I don&#x27;t really get the large barrel curl that I&#x27;m looking for, if anything, it will just kind of give a soft curl to the ENDS of my hair without anything higher up along my hair.</li>
            <li> New out of the box and the power indicator light does not work.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and appears to be a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It creates a gentle pressed smoothing action more than a curly effect</li>
            <li> It will smooth your hair and give it a nice bend at the ends as though you&#x27;ve blown it out with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look</li>
            <li> It works well as far as the quality and easy use of it.</li>
            <li> I am a retired cosmetologist and recently my Pro Star curling iron died a good death after nearly 20 years of service.</li>
            <li> It looks nice but really not even worth the 30 something that is sold for.</li>
            <li> When you first curl your hair with this, yes, for the first five minutes, you&#x27;ll have fun, bouncy 2 inch curls.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 inch barrel curling rod that I have been using for years which gives great curls and was looking for the larger softer curls that a larger barrel could offer.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and the tight spring would be great for someone with thin hair, but if the texture of your hair is as mine, get ready for alot pulling &amp; snagging.  </li>
            <li> Was a little concerned that it might not be a good quality product but was happy to find that it is as good if not better than previous ones.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as my other one! &lt;3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing because compared to the Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron (that I also own) the 1 1/2&amp;#34;  does a great job curling and it lasts even a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Sets a nice loose curl.  </li>
            <li> Product shipped very fast and product was as listed online.</li>
            <li> the product is okay, however the curls drop quite quickly and the different heat setting do not seem to have that much of an effect upon the curl or its durability</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have stated it&#x27;s really good for that &#x27;blown out salon look&#x27; without having to be very skilled at using a round brush.</li>
            <li> It has put in many hours of service already a little more than halfway through the project and showing itself to be a very durable product.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is I keep burning my forehead because I&#x27;m not used to the huge size!  </li>
            <li> lot)&lt;br /&gt;Smoked more often than not (and that was on low heat)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its hot tools or just this size, but for that price, I don&#x27;t want to find out.</li>
            <li> I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to.</li>
            <li> I love Hot tools curling irons they usually last me while</li>
            <li> I find that it is not as hot as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> This one is well made and gets plenty hot.</li>
            <li> More like a big wave.</li>
            <li> It doesn exactly what I needed to my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; to the 1-1/2\\&quot; and the spring 2\\&quot; curling iron as well as their ionizing blow dryer and the interchangeable size hot air brush.</li>
            <li> (Hot Tools Hairsetter 12 pc.)</li>
            <li> If I use the hot air brush, this is where I stop.</li>
            <li> Sometimes for more of a spiral perm look, I roll the hair with the rollers perpendicular to the floor and alternate rolling away/towards the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This iron get hot but for some reason it does not curl.  </li>
            <li> I have never used hot tools before so this is my first experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hot Tools 2 inch iron after a friend gave me rave reviews.</li>
            <li> My favorite look is to curl all my hair first, then lightly hairspray it for soft big curls.</li>
            <li> and this really gives me a lot of volume!</li>
            <li> (even at the lower end of the dial), but I&#x27;m getting consistent results now</li>
            <li> so I will see if I can get this to work another time ;)</li>
            <li> Although the curling iron did exactly what I wanted in terms of shape of curls (a 2 inch barrel is not meant to CURL...</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot..</li>
            <li> be aware</li>
            <li> This curling iron was exactly what I was looking for -</li>
            <li> this product is exactly as described, but it doesnt work with straight hair!</li>
            <li> barrel forever, and am so glad i finally found one.</li>
            <li> I can never keep rollers in, and this works so fast!</li>
            <li> My hair is only med length so the 1.5&amp;#34; better suits me for waves.</li>
            <li> I tried the product three different times using the hottest setting and holding the curl for 25 seconds or more.</li>
            <li> love the big curls it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li> First I blow it out and then use the iron.</li>
            <li> It did exactly that.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the first time, cranking it to its highest heat setting and allowing it to heat up for 10 mins before use.</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for several months now and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Ordered it to replace mine that I&#x27;d had for over 5 years and finally dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li> I am thinking I was not the first to return this iron.</li>
            <li> First purchase was from Ulta store.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize - the bigger the barrel, the more your curls fall out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I lost my first one</li>
            <li> This curling iron stays hot and doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this before a big day and got so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this line many times in the past and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> After heating, it starts to smell funny</li>
            <li> Gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li> Even the lowest setting was too hot</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the tip of the iron which does not get hot and helps with the process.</li>
            <li> Adjustable temps can keep from frying the more fragile hair.  </li>
            <li> Not so with this Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> The barrell is the exact size that I was after.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Hot tools/</li>
            <li> I will NEVER purchase a Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li> No matter how hot the setting.</li>
            <li> never had these problems with hot tools before.</li>
            <li> Too hot, burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it gives me the opportunity to wear my hair with more body and style.</li>
            <li> The gold plate makes hair shinny and smooth, but it sort of weighs hair down just a bit more than the ceramic barrels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a really long cord, which is nice, but as others noted, it comes with extra springs because they break easily</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and leaves my hair looking very sleek without damaging it too much.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite curling iron thus far.</li>
            <li> The good thing about this iron is that it does tame all my frizzy hair and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers said this indeed gets very HOT so people with fine hair should pay close attention to the temp!</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length, so when I use this product, it acts more like a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works better than my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Even though I havent been able to use this item as often as I should,I think this product will work better if your hair is not too thick.</li>
            <li> The end of the iron also has a large plastic tip that doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, so you won&#x27;t burn your hands holding the ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, long, and straight</li>
            <li> Great for long and very long hair.</li>
            <li> I paid over $40 for mine because all the reviews were positive.</li>
            <li> So while I find it works great on freshly washed and dried hair, if I take my shower the night before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out as well.</li>
            <li> also, the heat didn&#x27;t get as hot as fast as i would like it to.</li>
            <li> Love the 2\\&quot; &amp; long cord, but will be trading for a safer version.</li>
            <li> I bet it works even greater on those with long hair.</li>
            <li> When I first tried to curl my hair, it came out straight and looking as though I had not done anything to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how long you wait, or how many times you try to use this, it is just not meant for my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 2 inch barrel Hot Tools iron to see how it would work for how I style my hair, and I found I really like it.</li>
            <li> Solid, gets good and hot, has a temperature dial and a long cord.</li>
            <li> I must say, it curls the hair nicely, but it&#x27;s not worth the health risks.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this curling iron is the plastic tip -- you can actually put your fingers into it and hold the iron steady while you twist your hair around it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking nice and styled so you can avoid that slicked down to the side of your head</li>
            <li> I love the long cord, too!</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself due to it large size.</li>
            <li> When I want to add more curl, I just dry my hair and use the irons.</li>
            <li> Liked my previous one but the spring for the clamp broke after about a year.</li>
            <li> And actually, it&#x27;s easy to take the stand off and put it back on if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair.</li>
            <li> The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair.</li>
            <li> It creates a nice fullness to my hair, which generally has no volume, whatsoever (Asian hair).</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for long thick hair 2&amp;#34; is just what I needed</li>
            <li> Mine&#x27;s pretty thick, but it&#x27;s layered and had a good product in it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The size of this tool is only good if you have long hair or if you just want a flip at your ends.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like I just had it done in a salon with a full, but soft, gentle curl.</li>
            <li> For such a large barrel, it is surprisingly easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; diameter is also too large for the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> The Supertool 2\\&quot; curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter&#x27;s shorter hair style.  </li>
            <li> Too large of diameter to make any curl or even a wave.</li>
            <li> but returned it as it was an error on my part as the barrel was too large</li>
            <li> too large and combersom</li>
            <li> The size was too large; the curl did not hold.</li>
            <li> But this barrel is a bit too large.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the barrel is too large.</li>
            <li> The temp controls are great, so if you have weak hair, it won&#x27;t melt or burn your hair.</li>
            <li> While this iron heats up nicely, the spring and clip do not hold onto the hair tightly and the hair slips through before you can roll it up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 1&amp;#34; and really liked it, so I ordered the 2&amp;#34; for lift and body without tight curls.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the settings to different heat levels but since I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have used HOT tools for years, but never this particular one.  </li>
            <li> Does nice soft, loose curls.</li>
            <li> She had thigh-length straight hair and would roll it up on pop cans, then use large hair ties to figure-8 to hold the hair on the can.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gets to a high enough heat to style hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought but works great.</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; barrel makes for large, soft curls like those with rollers, but much more time-saving with its instant heat and adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t really work well to create waves.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the knowledge that a 2\\&quot; barrel will not curl as much as it smooths.   </li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it and it is also used by all her roommates, too.</li>
            <li> Curls fast..</li>
            <li> I found that the curls lasted much longer than those created with the blow brush.</li>
            <li> I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating.  </li>
            <li> I use the recommended setting for my hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t give you is much of a curl at all.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a real curl and you don&#x27;t have hair that holds curl</li>
            <li> I did not like the smaller curling barrels and enjoy the lose curls that can be constructed with this iron.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Also the cord on this thing is very aggravating.</li>
            <li> return was simple and hassle free.</li>
            <li> I needed a big honking curler to make those old fashioned rolls of hair that I love so much.</li>
            <li> not so much....</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great, but it still extends the life of your iron to maybe a year, after which both springs are broken and it&#x27;s time to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this iron.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Natural and shine and saved a lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> well adjust the temperature, starting at a low setting and going as higher in small increments as directed and figure out which works best for your hair type!  </li>
            <li> This iron did not cost much really, but it is now taking up space in my cabinet and I cannot even give this to a person who could use it.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron is really a monster.</li>
            <li> So it really does depend what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> my whole life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it maybe three times and will probably keep it but not use it very often since all it does is straighten.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I feel it works really well.</li>
            <li> However, on my hair it didn&#x27;t do much of a curly wave to it</li>
            <li> It has the feel of a cheap knock off of a salon quality iron, and given the price I guess that should have been obvious.</li>
            <li> I still use some product to protect my hair &amp; give it some shine, but the curling iron is really what makes it look polished.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect to get a curl out of it because it is a 2inch.</li>
            <li> A straight iron leaves it too straight with no lift and body.</li>
            <li> but like i said didn&#x27;t get much use.</li>
            <li> I was really disapointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe this works really well for people with hair strands that are fine/thin, but I have thicker strands of hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so much work to do.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast.  </li>
            <li> My old model (Revlon, no longer made) lasted over 10 years and had a cover that also was useful as a stand to store upright on the counter when not in use.  </li>
            <li> curling iron heats up lightning fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight.</li>
            <li> its very sturdy</li>
            <li> price on amazon was much nicer than Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Is there anyone out there who wants to purchase this?</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair holds curls really well</li>
            <li> I  really was,  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> She really like the size of the curl it produces.</li>
            <li> What this product gave me was soft, smooth, shiny waves that that feel so touchable soft.  </li>
            <li> It is still a nice product and I use mine everyday.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty cord....</li>
            <li> Waste of money, could have had a nice lunch with that cash...</li>
            <li> but I wanted to have more natural and big curl</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets hot enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect classic curl from this iron as the barrel is so large.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not course and curls fine with smaller barrel golden hot curlers and with my chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> the higher the heat setting the more prone to your hair smelling a little \\&quot;crispy.\\</li>
            <li> This 2 inch iron does not curl hair but it does create a smooth, full bodied look with little waves/curls at the bottom.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more than slightly curled ends, this iron is probably too large.</li>
            <li> The only product I own that&#x27;s not Hot Tools is my hot rollers, they are Remington Ceramic Rollers.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had when I first received - every time my right hand was working the curling iron, I turned it off.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure if a curling iron will tame your curls, then have a stylist try it in a salon first.</li>
            <li> but my hair is just not long enough to spiral or curl more than once.</li>
            <li> are my products in addition to the Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons from 1/2\\&quot;-2\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li> Here are my products in addition to the Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons from 1/2\\&quot;-2\\&quot; sizes.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I still like Hot Tool Professional products.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love having it in my collection of hair tools and have been using it the most lately.</li>
            <li> Its size makes it heavier than a typical iron, but you will curl more hair faster with the 2&amp;#34; rod so the effort is break-even.  </li>
            <li> So be careful when you unpack it that you don&#x27;t accidentally toss the spare springs because they are imbedded in the packaging and are easy to overlook.</li>
            <li> I totally burned my forehead right in the beginning when doing my bangs, but that was my inexperience with the large barrel....</li>
            <li> I use mainly for straitening.</li>
            <li> This gift was for my daughter, how will be are next top model hair designer of the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for longer layered hair, and for hard to tame hair.</li>
            <li> Since the barrel is so large it is a little clunky/awkward to use at first but for me it is well worth the results!</li>
            <li> There was a bit of a learning curve because it&#x27;s so big and very hot</li>
            <li> This curling iron smooths my almost-shoulder-length thick, dry, bleached hair beautifully...</li>
            <li> But i do think this will work for those who want more of a wave, it will not give you tight curls.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality curling iron.</li>
            <li> or we have a day of high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or we have a day of high humidity.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for shoulder length or longer hair.</li>
            <li> I would  highly recommend this item, for it&#x27;s quality and my needs.</li>
            <li> and this is on medium high temp.</li>
            <li> I will not order this brand again, and cannot recommend it highly based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am not particularly clever with smoothing irons, so I use this to give me just a hint of lift and smooth out frizziness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for short to medium length hair (mine is short), for that rounded slightly curled under look.</li>
            <li> This curling iron helps control that wave and gives a soft, large curl.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a large iron that would make soft waves.</li>
            <li> It is for creating large, classy (IMO) waves.</li>
            <li> I should have reviewed a 2&#x27;&#x27; curling iron a little better before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using a heat protectant, just like with any hot hair styling tool, but this won&#x27;t damage your hair any more than any other iron.  </li>
            <li> and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li> I wanted a really wide diameter curler to create a smooth curve.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.  </li>
            <li> But, after seeing all the rave reviews, I expected it to really smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair naturally waves as much as this did.</li>
            <li> really makes hair soft and a tad of a curl on ends....</li>
            <li> As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> B00092M2X2 Hot Tools Professional 1035 1875 Watt Direct Ion FastDry Anti-Static Hair Dryer]]  </li>
            <li> This is great for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy layered hair and need the heat and the clamp, and I love the huge barrell it really softens of the look and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> I normally have curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was really worried, especially reading a review where a women burned her hair off!</li>
            <li> It gives the long, full waves that I like.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s been blown out with a round brush</li>
            <li> Just curl each section normally, pin it and spray.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair the look of sweeping inward, without a stark contrast to the top part of my hair that the iron isn&#x27;t curling.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this brand and product, it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> I have always dreamt of having bouncing curls which only blow drying is able to deliver, however, I could never master the technique nor keep the curls all day long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I could use a curling iron on my type of hair, but my fabulous new hair stylist recommended a wide barrel curling iron to help create smoothness and movement.</li>
            <li> I burnt my forehead twice so easily please, please keep the temperature on as low as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using very small pieces of hair to curl and still end up with the same softly curled end, which is great if that was the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the wide barrel is great for loose curls.</li>
            <li> If you want curly hair, this one is not the right one for you, try getting a smaller one.</li>
            <li> Right now, I am growing it back out; it&#x27;s 3\\&quot; below my shoulders, all in one length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As others have said, the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> You have to have super long hair for this size</li>
            <li> The only reason it is not five stars is for the fact the company had to send me a new one, becaue it was not packaged right.</li>
            <li> The barrel is very smooth but the handle is sufficiently small and &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; enough to make the tool very simple and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the curler part is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They did infact send me a new one with a pre paid lable also.</li>
            <li> New works as advertised</li>
            <li> It is definately an item that I can live without.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, you can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> so they made it look new and sold it.</li>
            <li> so had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> and it works like new</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that smooth easy action that I need to straighten my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> As always, HOT tools are high quality; heat up hot and fast, handle well, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use Straight Smooth &amp; Sexty smoothing spray and even with that, the iron would not easily smooth through the 1\\&quot; sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic curling iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the big curls that it gives my because after I fluff it, it turns to body.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the on indicator light is on the side, (not visible), I left it on and it does not have an auto shut off feature.</li>
            <li> WOW, thank you, works GREAT, instead of frying my processed hair with a ( brand name expensive) flat iron, this gives my below the shoulder hair just the right bend and smoothness</li>
            <li> I have thin but unruly hair and this is perfect for smoothing my hair and giving the ends a slight curl under to give my hair that polished salon look!  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old 2 inch barrel that I used to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> A very professional product.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I expected, but it works great as a straightener and adds wave.  </li>
            <li> Extra long cord makes it easy to use, you don&#x27;t feel tethered to the electrical outlet.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the 2&amp;#34; curling iron since I have super long hair and wanted to get soft waves.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, works great, curls my very long, thick hair in a short time.</li>
            <li> This tool does it all, it does not create super curly strands, but soft, wavy ones, it also is able to make the curls last longer and feel bouncier for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This definitely isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve curled my hair, so I knew it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> great product- controls my thick, wavy hair faster than any other styling method...</li>
            <li> My first one lasted ten years</li>
            <li> Girlfriend here - This curling iron does not get hot enough, does not curl, and leaves dents.</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have had only Hot Tools curling irons</li>
            <li> As far as heat goes, this thing packs it!  </li>
            <li> NEVER GOT HOT ENOUGH.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why i got it, but because the curling  iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the 2nd Hot Tools Ive gotten.</li>
            <li> But on Amazon, the exact same item is even</li>
            <li> Classy hollywood curls, here I come!</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curly.</li>
            <li> It comes out relaxed and soft!</li>
            <li> This barrel is far too large, apparently.</li>
            <li> I liked this product as it has a variety of temperatures and seems to heat evenly; I had been using a 1&amp;#34;inch barrel on my long hair and the results were a little too curly for my liking.</li>
            <li> I typically wear it naturally curly or flat iron it, but I had really been wanting a big curling iron to style it for nice events.  </li>
            <li> The previous reviewer is correct in that it gives you smooth hair, but with volume and curve.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle , not too heavy for the size of the barrel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to smooth my hair in less than half the time of a flat iron (and without burning myself) and curling iron combination.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed since I was expecting a tool that gets super hot while mine gets nearly warm.</li>
            <li> as this may just be a bit too large (is that possible?)</li>
            <li> and instead I use it to smooth from root to almost the tip and then to add a little flip to the end - no hairspray needed and the flip stays all day.  </li>
            <li> For my hair, which is a bit past my shoulders, medium thickness, and mostly straight with just a touch of natural wave, this curling iron works more like a flat iron than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair comes to the middle of my back, so I thought this would give me a nice little bump at the end...</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as  Christmas gift for one of my young adult daughters.</li>
            <li> If yours is much shorter than that the barrel may be too big for you.</li>
            <li> it works like a professional curling Iron....10 stars......</li>
            <li> Its also perfecton bangs because it gives them the natural swept look.  </li>
            <li> Professional</li>
            <li> 1035 1875 Watt Direct Ion FastDry Anti-Static Hair Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE your time or money on this.  </li>
            <li> so my hair&#x27;s usually left straight.</li>
            <li> Really provides waves because it is so big, not curls.</li>
            <li> Gives me natural curls and body.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools always last a long a time and you can really crank the heat.</li>
            <li> The 2 inch curler didn&#x27;t curl very well because I&#x27;ve learned the bigger the barrel</li>
            <li> It tames my hair when my natural wave begins to take over.  </li>
            <li> I really would suggest going smaller.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it now squeeks when I life the curling lever piece which probably annoys the people around me more than it annoys myself.</li>
            <li> This makes natural looking curls and if your hair is shorter, it will just curl it under.  </li>
            <li> Even though I turned it all the way up, it still barely curled my hair, and was only somewhat successful when I used really thin chunks of hair.</li>
            <li> hairstylist, who works in a professional salon, also uses this brand.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted the  big curls</li>
            <li> heats up fast and curlers last all day!</li>
            <li> as a professional i have used this every tool every week now for a year and its still working well.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t really curl your hair in a traditional sense.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just below my shoulders and is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6.My hair looks professionally styled after I use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I use this iron to create soft curls.  </li>
            <li> You should order through a salon or your beautician and get a professional model.  </li>
            <li> My old one broke though..</li>
            <li> After much deliberation, I ultimately decided on this one.</li>
            <li> The metal stand is attached to the thumb clamp, but there are separate screws in it that actually hold the whole iron together.</li>
            <li> Recommend this  for girls who want a natural look.</li>
            <li> This item rusted after 2 months, it looks 10yrs old.</li>
            <li> thus far.</li>
            <li> Looks cool in theory - but in use, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Most curling irons would leave my hair either flat or too tight of a curl.  </li>
            <li> I hope I could come to US to prove if it really works and gets deadly hot down there.</li>
            <li> all my other curlers work fine, heat up in a minute and curl my hair in about ten seconds</li>
            <li> after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I dry until damp, then use the hot air brush to style and complete the drying process.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair normally, apply heat protectant, then I use it to straight my hair.</li>
            <li> It comes out straight with a slight curve, which is fine with me because thats what I expected.</li>
            <li> Instead if makes my hair very flat--like a flat iron would.</li>
            <li> Great for loose wave on long hair or subtle bend on medium length hair..</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have hair that&#x27;s at least 4 inches past your shoulder, this probably isn&#x27;t a great choice for you.</li>
            <li> I recently started to travel more with my job than I did in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one the first one last 4 years!!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these curling irons in the past 2 years and they NEVER last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes heating element would stay on high even though I had it set on low</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tryna figure out why they have such high reviews...</li>
            <li> This one came with 2 extra springs and instructions on how to remove old and install new.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it heats up fast</li>
            <li> I have long, layered hair and this doesn&#x27;t really curl it -</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair</li>
            <li> (Before they came out with the jumbo hot rollers, I would use empty pop cans.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s not made as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> The first few uses , I wanted to send it back because it wasn&#x27;t even getting hot.</li>
            <li> I like the enormous size, but the spring is TOO TIGHT to create a \\&quot;smooth out\\&quot; fashion for straightening.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron fell off of the counter and for one brief quarter of a second, bumped against my right ankle, resulting in second degree burns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Spring kept coming off (put a new spring on, same thing)&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand, and I&#x27;m ready for my third because I wear them out with years of use.</li>
            <li> but my opinion is no matter how long or coarse your hair is, don&#x27;t get a 2 inch curler unless it has a higher wattage than 430 or else</li>
            <li> it is very professional with different heat settings a hanging hook and a stand to sit on counter if no hook to hang on.  </li>
            <li> When curling, I start at the crown, roll the top of the head with 1\\&quot; thick by 2\\&quot; wide sections and do them left to right and roll back away from the face.</li>
            <li> I thought I would like the 2&amp;#34; curl, but I went back to using my 1.5&amp;#34; or my flat iron to get a large curl.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about it coming in the mail because despite the other bad reviews, the good ones won me over.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to preheat these like other irons because they get hot within seconds.</li>
            <li> You can use other types of rollers as well, I just happen to have hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I normally use the highest setting on curling irons and flat irons</li>
            <li> Something I can&#x27;t seem to do with any other hot curler.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to people who have long hair and wants natural wave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s getting quite as hot as other irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> ; I turn it into a loose curl thats mostly straight.</li>
            <li> Put the hair tie over one end, flip the tie over so it crosses over the center of the hair, then secure over the other end of the can.)</li>
            <li> a flat iron really can&#x27;t create enough lift--</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, but the strands themselves are fine.</li>
            <li> Depending on how tight your curls are naturally, yours might need to be blown out first.</li>
            <li> I have really long black straight hair down to my waist, and I feel that I&#x27;m better off using a smaller barrel rather than 2 inches.2 inches</li>
            <li> I have long straight, layered, fine but fairly thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use any general cleansers because these will damage the surface of your tools.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use any general cleansers because these will damage the surface of your tools.   </li>
            <li> I love the look of curly/wavy hair, but it usually takes such a long time for me to curl ALL of my hair</li>
            <li> I tried different techniques: I tried curling a whole bunch of hair, I left it on longer, and I even went out and bought a smaller size (1 inch) to see if it made a difference.</li>
            <li> barely a wave to it.</li>
            <li> was using my 5-year-old Chi straightener at the same time, and let me tell you: that old Chi is three times hotter than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want the same look as a professional blow out....</li>
            <li> I have long Straight hair and this tool is big enough to make the curls look natural.</li>
            <li> Item is heavier than I expected, doesn&#x27;t really curl the hair</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t get that hot, and I was somewhat disappointed because I normally love this brand.</li>
            <li> I have thick healthy long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this works wonderfully to smooth it out and make it look like it&#x27;s been blown out.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are true, if you have thick hair this iron is too big to curl it (even though it gets smokin&#x27; hot!  </li>
            <li> I first tried the iron on the lowest setting - other reviews said the iron literally burned their hair out on the highest setting!</li>
            <li> Most of my other tools last a few years.</li>
            <li> Was missing a few parts, other than that loved the size and heat control.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools curling irons typically give me 5+ years of use.</li>
            <li> The large barrel on this iron essentially straightens the hair while giving it a little bit of turn at the ends (as opposed to stick straight hair from a flat iron).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on  this one doesn&#x27;t seem to compare to the others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Am old school; actually used to utilize an actual iron to get it done!</li>
            <li> have been using Hot Tools brand professional line styling products for the past 20+ years.</li>
            <li> I have long medium thick hair, and was excited to have large loose curls.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that Hot Tools has constructed this iron by separately screwing in thumb clamp, and not just using the little metal stand to hold it in.</li>
            <li> The weight of it is barely noticeable for the size being so much bigger..</li>
            <li> NOT long hair (which I have)</li>
            <li> all the way up, yes i left it in my hair for even over a minute or two and it barely made any shape.</li>
            <li> Pretty stupid to loose a good customer over $25.00.</li>
            <li> Curling iron works very well to give my hair a slight lift and fullness.</li>
            <li> It has an extra long cord (probably because it is often used professionally in salons,) and it has lots of heat settings so it can be customized for all hair types.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old daughter with long coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this Curling Iron to smooth out my long, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The first iron I bought was fine for the first couple of uses, then the spring came off track and it was hard to open and close the clamp -- needed extra force and screeched the entire time I used it, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It gets hot hot hot, which is so bad for your hair but whatever I can wear wigs if it falls out.&lt;br /&gt;took</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my sister&#x27;s thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> So if something happens and the little stand gets knocked off, the whole iron falls apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a huge barrel for super-long hair.</li>
            <li> Not loving it but am trying to adjust heat and work with it a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Because picking the right size barrel is extremely hard, I want to share a picture to show the result of using a 2 inch curling iron.</li>
            <li> It is a bit have and awkward to use at first, but I got used to it quickly and managed not to burn myself or drop it.  </li>
            <li> My wavy hair is straight in an instant with a little curl at the end for a finished look!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a flat iron that works well enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> that flat iron wouldn&#x27;t - and that a smaller curling iron would overdo.</li>
            <li> Other cons with this product is that it is super heavy!</li>
            <li> You def don&#x27;t have to worry about it being hot enough for those with thick and coily hair.</li>
            <li> So much volume in so little time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curing iron as I have long hair (down to mid-back, not super thick, easily holds curls) and have been looking for a larger diameter barrel to create soft waves.</li>
            <li> I discovered too along with other reviewers that this unit gets VERY hot--I back it down to medium and wear leather gloves to work the wood.  </li>
            <li> These 2 inchers are hard to find, and since Conair no longer carries this size I decided to go for Hot Tools.   </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly blunt layered and also is fragile while having natural curl.</li>
            <li> I have super thin wavy hair and my cousin, who is a hairdresser, used it on me before to give me big, flowy curls.</li>
            <li> I have hair with long layers a couple inches past my shoulders and it&#x27;s texture is somewhat coarse with natural curl that tends to look frizzy if left to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was shocked at how big around it was but after using it, I have fallen in love!</li>
            <li> Some folks complained that this was too hot...</li>
            <li> your hair wouldn&#x27;t be long enough to be curled with this.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, almost to my butt, and I wanted a product that would give me big curls.</li>
            <li> (twist 2\\&quot; of hair into a curl between your fingers and then flat iron each for 8 seconds (it lasts for 4 days)</li>
            <li> When my hair is long, I don&#x27;t use anything smaller than the 1\\&quot;--even</li>
            <li> It made my hair flat looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair completely flat to my head</li>
            <li> long enough to move around a bit without coming unplugged!!</li>
            <li> I have long searched for a cross between a curling iron and a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> I have curly and coarse long hair.</li>
            <li> The Jilbere was like a flat iron but for curling hair, it had heating plates on both sides.</li>
            <li> wrapped around the barrel long enough to get the body and lift</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it gives just enough body and wave.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this over a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It seems my hair is not quite long enough for that.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this to using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Slowly remove hair from the iron then roll it up on a jumbo hot roller.</li>
            <li> but like any new hair tools it takes a little time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When my BedHead curling iron I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years finally died on me, I went searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> When using other irons it takes forever to curl my hair, I can do all my hair in &amp;#60;10 minutes (and I have super thick hair!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not sure if they tried to turn down the heat after so many complaints of it being TOO hot, but either way both are useless.</li>
            <li> with short hair it will give you bounce, and that blow dry look.</li>
            <li> FINALLY i can transform my crazy curls into more uniform cascading curls/waves.</li>
            <li> The product arrived several days earlier than expected in spite of the Holiday Season.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, and the Hot Tools 2 inch is the strongest curling iron to curl or straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to quickly curl my hair, maybe separated into 8-10 sections (I have thin hair).</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this tool helps to smooth out my hair and give it a little flip in just minutes.</li>
            <li> its not good it wont culr properly and curls open so fast even if i use hair spray wont recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this woukld give me big loose curls or waves even, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Always hard to find a really large barrel curling iron.</li>
            <li> Worked great, but for less than 1 year :(  </li>
            <li> This curling iron gives me the soft bend at the ends and takes so little effort.  </li>
            <li> Hot Tools is not a good brand and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist</li>
            <li> My hair is long now so</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> LONG hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> So, as long as I can replace the spring when it breaks</li>
            <li> now lets see how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> I have hair to my shoulder blades, so unless your hair is extremely long I would not recommend this size.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS REALLY LONG</li>
            <li> As long as you have experience with a curling iron this size, then you are all set.</li>
            <li> and I have long frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Like ridiculously long.</li>
            <li> This is either for long hair or if you just want a wave to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I can roll out all of my long hair in 9 segments vs the 15</li>
            <li> except it wasn&#x27;t long before my hair straightened out again.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on too long.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and literally straighten it up a bit with these, though never completely</li>
            <li> and i expect it to hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> Because of its size, it doesn&#x27;t curl unless (I would imagine) if you had really long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> You need really, really long hair for this one.</li>
            <li> and I have alot of hair and long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but when I do, I can straighten all of my long locks with 2-4 segments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my daughter who has long thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> and I love the thin handle because my hands are fairly small.</li>
            <li> The spring that allows you to open the iron and for it to clamp down on your hair doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try a less expensive brand against my better judgement.</li>
            <li> I keep it at about 350 degrees, which is only half its total heat capacity.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 other hot tools curling irons and use them at least 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> I realized I was buying a large iron and was expecting very loose curls, but this hardly gave ANY curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I do not feel that the spring holds as tight as the smaller one.  </li>
            <li> &quot; curling iron before and although the curl is a little larger with this iron, it really isn&#x27;t a vastly different look.</li>
            <li> one for my bangs and this one for my long hair!  </li>
            <li> I have used the highest setting and the curl only lasts about an hour or 2 despite hairspray, perhaps due to humidity.    </li>
            <li> The only con to the product is the handle is a little smaller than they used to be made   </li>
            <li> My long thick hair naturally dries into massive frizzy untamed curly ringlets, so I have three choices to style it - 1.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted at least 5 years!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and was hoping to straighten my hair (with other iron) then make larger waves with this.</li>
            <li> After only 6 months of minimal use the curling iron no longer works!  </li>
            <li> I bought this iron hoping it would give me long loose curls.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and it gives me the nicest curls and waves.</li>
            <li> However, they probably won&#x27;t stay like that for very long.</li>
            <li> I was never able to master the flat iron, but this iron smooths my hair, makes it very shiny and gives it just a little bend.  </li>
            <li> When It&#x27;s dry, I start pulling sections to curl with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a pain to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to blow dry my hair to achieve that volume and bit of wave.</li>
            <li> I just set it in my (dry) sink.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I wash  and dry my hair</li>
            <li> Just a few days ago my Conair 2\\&quot; finally gave out (after 6 years of daily use).</li>
            <li> Poor quality and absolutely does not last even a year.</li>
            <li> i have wicked thick naturally curly hair, and smaller barrels do not do what i need my hair to do.</li>
            <li> I have hair that isn&#x27;t that hard to curl, but with this, the curls came out faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I have had every single hair styling product on the market and</li>
            <li> Or I use this Hot Tools 2\\&quot; curling iron to quickly straighten my hair (even without blowdrying, which I hate to do anyway).</li>
            <li> (and also my hair is long, past mid back).</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> The 2&amp;#34; makes very loose curls that don&#x27;t hold up for long.</li>
            <li> this 2 inch does not really curl or even wave long hair...</li>
            <li> I knew this big iron wouldnt make tight curls, but I have long hair and it didnt even wave my hair...</li>
            <li> However, I was looking for loose curls.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I spend less time with the bigger cylinder!  </li>
            <li> As you can see, you get a blow dry effect with very loose curls at the end.</li>
            <li> The bigger the barrel, the less of a curl you get</li>
            <li> The only thing it did was slightly add a bend to the ends, but I can do that with a hair straightener already.</li>
            <li> Well, I have natural wavy hair, and it&#x27;s thick and long.  </li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair and this iron made a fizzy mess out of it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair half way down my back.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and this gives it a little lift and has it all going in the same direction</li>
            <li> If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!ight before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time I turned this curling iron on to use it the gold started PEELING OFF!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if the major chunks of metal showing through will damage my hair or not...</li>
            <li> I have always had a large, 2\\&quot; curling iron for the last 10 years but they have become increasingly hard to find (at least in my area).</li>
            <li> If you want big loose waves or just a slight bend this is for you!</li>
            <li> The only thing that will curl my straight, thin hair!</li>
            <li> However, within a short amount of time (a few months), the iron started to smell.</li>
            <li> the barrel is too wide...</li>
            <li> since i have thin hair, this product didn&#x27;t clamp onto it very well...</li>
            <li> it kept slipping out of the clamp when i turn it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I really expected from this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I wanted or needed.</li>
            <li> Maybe the barrel is too wide?</li>
            <li> Instead, it left my (otherwise-healthy) hair limp and a bit fried-looking.</li>
            <li> It makes very loose curls -</li>
            <li> very loose waves, similar to round brush)</li>
            <li> Not only did I find one on Amazon that had a few more features than past curling irons, it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> There are right and wrong ways to use this product.</li>
            <li> if you have hair length that&#x27;s half as long as your torso, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product bc</li>
            <li> While this curling iron does not make ringlets, keeping in mind that I have it set below half heat, it actually mimics a blow dry with a round brush at the salon.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, Asian hair and A LOT of it.</li>
            <li> I could curl my thick, long hair in ten minutes!</li>
            <li> I can use other irons with no issues.</li>
            <li> Although it is well past the shoulders, it does not reach the bra strap line at my back.</li>
            <li> Tunu doesn&#x27;t lather like other products do since it doesn&#x27;t contain any detergents.</li>
            <li> Tunu doesn&#x27;t lather like other products do since it doesn&#x27;t contain any detergents.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the other reviews about this curling iron before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my iron is defective, but nonetheless, I am extremely disatisfied with this product and would never recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> so be careful!  </li>
            <li> I assumed it did since all of my other ones do</li>
            <li> Other than that, the performance of this curling iron is acceptable.</li>
            <li> you will get burned due to the size of the barrel.</li>
            <li> The highest heat didnt burn my hair off as other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> Please, be careful!  </li>
            <li> The other curling irons never get used anymore.</li>
            <li> the heat was not applied evenly, took longer than usual to do my hair with with the same curler in 1&#x27;1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> contrary to all the other reviews mine</li>
            <li> The tip seems to be enough that I didn&#x27;t burn myself, so I&#x27;m not sure how others are using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Pro Star no longer makes the 1.5 inch size, so I ordered the Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> The swivel cord is extremely convenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading other reviews, I am reluctant to crank the heat all the way up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually looking to just curl the hair under for a finished look and to add volume, rather than using an iron to make actual curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should have gone with a smaller barrel (maybe 1.5 inch?)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pretty as I have &amp;#34;sponge like hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, however, the curling iron does not slip through my hair, it leaves a soft, loose, semi curl.</li>
            <li> I have decently thick hair and its long as well, i sectioned my hair into smaller portions and began curling, it did nothing for my hair except flipped the ends slightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be NEW, but it&#x27;s broken?</li>
            <li> The final straw was the frustrating return policy of only one month.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and all I want to do is tame friz (dratted grays).</li>
            <li> Sad that I loved hot tools just HATED this product!!</li>
            <li> Depending on how you use it it&#x27;ll make your hair have a loose wave or look like you blow dried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;h had irons in the past, where the little metal stand you use to prop up the iron is actually what holds the thumb clamp to the iron itself.</li>
            <li> only negative is that it does not have an automatic shut off....</li>
            <li> It came with extra springs so it must be a common problem and known by the  seller/manufacturer.</li>
            <li> At least Amazon makes the return process relatively painless.</li>
            <li> Average, doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> and I have waist length, thick, naturally curly hair that usually frizzes instead of curls.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, asian hair</li>
            <li> I usually use a 1 inch curling iron for my long (about 6 inches below shoulders), thick hair, but decided to try for bigger curls and waves.</li>
            <li> Thick hair types find a smaller curler, I would recommend a 1 1/2\\&quot;, which I had before I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> This product was a let down.</li>
            <li> My hair has ranged from a crew cut to one length down to my knees.</li>
            <li> Then apply the revitalizing mist leave-in conditioner and toner and then flip upside down and blow out my hair.</li>
            <li> n down when im curling n messes up my temperature.</li>
            <li> When it all cools off, let it down.</li>
            <li> It feels little heavy, therefore a bit awkward at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as easy as I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is just a little hard on your hair.</li>
            <li> : I believe that this only works on long hair( I mean, at least hair like mine)</li>
            <li> it takes much less time.  </li>
            <li> Also, just last week the plastic piece covering the lever to open the clamp broke off, rendering the iron useless.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I knew that it would not create curls, but I did expect it to put curl or volume in my hair none the less.</li>
            <li> but this I had torn almost half way off.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the previous reviewers.</li>
            <li> barrel because it give a slight wave and curled end</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve cornered the market due to not many other irons having a 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My only problem is weight, is heavy and a little hard to handle</li>
            <li> I have long thick black hair.</li>
            <li> It does all that is expected... burned once though, not sure I can blame product... &#x3D;s</li>
            <li> Not good for travel since this only works on 110v sockets.</li>
            <li> CAUTION:  This Hot Tools Supertool 2&amp;#34; Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control is downright DANGEROUS.  </li>
            <li> maybe if you had really, really long and thick hair, this product would work for you.</li>
            <li> I have medium long, thick curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have long  thick course hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> but it gets wound tight anyway, in a skinny minute.</li>
            <li> Curls aren&#x27;t tight but that&#x27;s What I like.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine had a spring too tight, but it pulled out a lot of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something to straighten my hair yet have a little bounce.</li>
            <li> It gives it just a little volume &amp; sexiness without overdoing it.  </li>
            <li> Not even a little wave at the bottom like others said.</li>
            <li> it straightens my hair and gives it a little curl on the ends for a \\&quot;fuller\\</li>
            <li> it got a little hotter though.</li>
            <li> And after reviewing it AFTER I purchased it, (dumb), a lot of people have said the same thing.</li>
            <li> As someone who has only gotten curls professionally done, either I am just not good at it or something is wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> that adds a little bit of wave.</li>
            <li> they also started including extras of the little spring which wears over time.</li>
            <li> But of the little time that I used it, it worked well.</li>
            <li> I needed to cut down on the amount that I pack!  </li>
            <li> So if you have long hair and want something that will give you curls, this is not a good buy.</li>
            <li> and it is heavy by comparison.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I&#x27;m actually using this tool to bend thin strips of wood for an art piece I&#x27;m doing (check &amp;#34;Rolling Down&amp;#34; at ArtPrize.org).  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times</li>
            <li> I would recommend this iron ONLY if you have thin hair (which I do).  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste</li>
            <li> Despite trying it several times since, it has continued to perform poorly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that reaches to the center of my shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> Heavy is an understatement for this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned lots of curling irons, but I have NEVER owned one that was as heavy as this one.</li>
            <li> I bought the same iron in hopes it was a defect in just the one, but alas this one also had trouble with the spring.</li>
            <li> I think this would give you curls if your hair goes down past your bust.  </li>
            <li> so bad the skin just literally fell right off.</li>
            <li> I use this tool for straightening my hair as I don&#x27;t have the patience for flat irons to heat up - my hair is very thick and course.</li>
            <li> Still spend less time though!  </li>
            <li> As much as I love the curl results, the quality of the iron is terrible and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I took a star away because the clamp is extremely tight!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, dark hair....</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, and it&#x27;s not so much the weight as that it is lopsided and being very heavy on one end makes it awkward to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, and it&#x27;s almost impossible for you to recreate that movie-star look at home with a blow dryer, then this tool is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li> It usually takes over an hour to tame my hair into something manageable.  </li>
            <li> *slightly* hard to curl, this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment, waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I turn it on and leave the room to finish up my routine in the bathroom, not more than 2-3 min</li>
            <li> The curling iron is the size I need, a size that I have been unable to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a 1 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I have small hands</li>
            <li> (always had a problem with the tip on Conair&#x27;s version -too small).  </li>
            <li> so I even tried taking it in really small sections and nothing...</li>
            <li> Finally, the spring broke off altogether, probably from being stressed at the wrong points too often.</li>
            <li> I watched 3 different youtube videos in hopes that I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> It is a pointless iron to have.</li>
            <li> the next one did the same thing :(  </li>
            <li> (I use it on the hottest setting) and hold in my hair for no more than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It is big and bulky but I didn&#x27;t find it so difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I also had to put a bandied on the small bar because it burned my finger.</li>
            <li> The iron itself works but if you have difficult to curl hair, try a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s time to break them in and put a few miles on them!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll usually start to wave after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> power cord doesn&#x27;t tangle and the temperature controls are small and out of the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru about three of them in the past 9 years,</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on the lower temperatures.</li>
            <li> it took me like 5 min on one section to get a semi wave that fell flat minutes later. :(</li>
            <li> and so I had really high hopes, but I was unfortunately a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Technically that was my fault, but almost all other brands have the shutoff, it&#x27;s bad that this one doesn&#x27;t.   </li>
            <li> I will keep it because i hate the hassle of exchanging but it will not be the first curling iron i reach for.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very heavy and hard to maneuver...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always been difficult for it to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; a curl for very long.</li>
            <li> So, i blow dry somewhat carelessly</li>
            <li> It is a hard to find tool</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have hard to curl hair either.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t leave the clamp line in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy and frizzy hair, that is hard to tame.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars a rating for this product, I would.  </li>
            <li> this product sucks</li>
            <li> The iron did begin to heat, which is quite dangerous as it is not possible to tell by looking at it whether it is on or not.</li>
            <li> This iron sucks.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not what it works for (at least for my hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to tool for when I&#x27;m running late and need a polished look for my super-long hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement curling iron for my medium-long thick hair</li>
            <li> Always start at the slow settings and work your way up until you find a setting that works for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> For people with thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is rather thick and the adjustable heat setting is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just leaving the curls down as I go but with my hair being so thick and long, I get frustrated.</li>
            <li> but just do not love this one !</li>
            <li> I might even grab it before the cat if my house was on fire (kidding, but you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean that it is constructed with sub-par components.  </li>
            <li> Then, all of a sudden, it stopped heating,, and became completely useless!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean arms and abs.</li>
            <li> So no more burning off your fingers!  </li>
            <li> , that I tend to let get very long before finally cutting it.</li>
            <li> However, they are dealing with a serious manufacturer&#x27;s error that they&#x27;re not bothering to remedy.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this product is a east of money an</li>
            <li> It was very hard to find a curling iron that was at least 2&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Gives hair a little shape without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was rather disappointed, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am completely disappointed and will not purchase any future products from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have bought this 2 x same thing : (</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use it because it is too big :(</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> and I feel the clamp release is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> so my curly/wild/tina turner hair could be straight without being so boring....</li>
            <li> It made curling so frustrating.</li>
            <li> Watch the area&#x27;s behind your ears &amp; neckline...</li>
            <li> Was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> so hand can get tired trying to do all of my hair</li>
            <li> Like if it is broken or something.</li>
            <li> cuz this product is just crazy heavy.</li>
            <li> When the spring is broken the iron won&#x27;t grab and hold your hair in place.</li>
            <li> It is extremely annoying to constantly be untangling it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I see small clamp marks in my hair which drives me crazy</li>
            <li> The curl is very subtle.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to get this curling iron out of the box without destroying the box, so returning it was not an option.</li>
            <li> my flat iron --which are bad and fry your hair anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Yaye!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed this product did not last quite 1 year before malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was somewhat skeptical about buying the 2\\&quot; jumbo curling iron, I have always use the 1.5\\&quot; from Conair.  </li>
            <li> I didn´t find it difficult or bulky to use either.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, until I find one, I&#x27;ll keep buying these once a year.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda useless</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had a problem with twisted cords.</li>
            <li> This makes me wary of the long-term use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this curler couldn&#x27;t keep a curl in my hair for longer than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> sadly i had to return this item twice.</li>
            <li> so the cord won&#x27;t get twisted up into knots.</li>
            <li> This size barrel is useless on my hair.</li>
            <li> Wtf?</li>
            <li> the fact that it won&#x27;t with this make me sad.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to return the 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> maybe im doing it wrong</li>
            <li> not five stars is that I bought the wrong size.</li>
            <li> I was was also shocked at how clunky it was to use/ difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I use it at the lowest heat, even, which is crazy.</li>
            <li> needless to say I about fainted when I opened the box!  </li>
            <li> but any time I got mad.</li>
            <li> This curling iron was recommended to me by my hair stylist and she did not steer me wrong!</li>
            <li> This item was suppose to arrive in 1 week, instead it took 14 days, plus the shipping is VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t say that it is a bad curler</li>
            <li> The bad news is the 2\\&quot; curling iron does not curl hair.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just completely shocked that the gold peeled off.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying off amazon for a year now and never have I been so disappointed in a product.</li>
            <li> nothing :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely disappointed.</li>

            <li> Perfect just as described</li>
            <li> Great for long and very long hair. The 2&amp;#34; barrel is HUGE and if you don&#x27;t have hair that&#x27;s at least 4 inches past your shoulder, this probably isn&#x27;t a great choice for you. The difference between a 1.25&amp;#34; to 1.5&amp;#34; iron isn&#x27;t huge, but the jump to 2&amp;#34; is drastic. This 2&amp;#34; iron is more for creating a bit of volume, to mimick a professional blowout. It won&#x27;t really work well to create waves. If you&#x27;re looking for a took to make beach waves, I&#x27;d suggest a 1.25&amp;#34; or 1.5&amp;#34; iron instead.</li>
            <li> ok, doesn&#x27;t heat up as well as I had anticipated, I find that a lot in this product. wouldn&#x27;t buy one again</li>
            <li> Pros;&lt;br /&gt;Curled great&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;Spring kept coming off (put a new spring on, same thing)&lt;br /&gt;Hair got caught in spring (a lot)&lt;br /&gt;Smoked more often than not (and that was on low heat)&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes heating element would stay on high even though I had it set on low&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. Talked to a friend, who is a hairdresser, she had the same problems. I don&#x27;t know if its hot tools or just this size, but for that price, I don&#x27;t want to find out. I paid over $40 for mine because all the reviews were positive. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron, especially that the adjustments can&#x27;t be changed while you are using it like many others I have purchased!  Easy to handle , not too heavy for the size of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it does not have an automatic shut off.... that&#x27;s why the 4 stars....</li>
            <li> While this iron heats up nicely, the spring and clip do not hold onto the hair tightly and the hair slips through before you can roll it up.  I have purchased this item twice and same issue both times.</li>
            <li> One of the best 2&amp;#34; curling irons I have ever used! The iron stays hot and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product fit my need. I wanted something to straighten my hair yet have a little bounce. It&#x27;s perfect! I checked in-store&#x27;s and online but amazon had the right price and the right merchandise.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length hair that has a bit of a wave to it. This curling iron helps control that wave and gives a soft, large curl. I had a 1-1/2\\&quot; curling iron before and although the curl is a little larger with this iron, it really isn&#x27;t a vastly different look. The size of this iron is quite a bit larger, though, and will be cumbersome in my suitcase. Beware, it gets very hot, I have it on the second to lowest setting and it still makes my hair hot - this is great if you need the heat.  Overall a great product that feels like its quality built.</li>
            <li> This may have been a very good product.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It arrived in time and looked good.  However when she opened it on Christmas and tried to use it, the curling iron did not heat up.  I was able to return it with no questions asked and my account was credited for the amount I  had been charged.  For that reason I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This works just like I want.  It does all that is expected... burned once though, not sure I can blame product... &#x3D;s</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. One for home and one to take on travels. I am pleased with the durability of the curling iron as well the results of the curling iron.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was shocked at how big around it was but after using it, I have fallen in love! It straightens as it curls. The curl is very subtle. I like being able to adjust the temperature. I would definitely recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement curling iron for my medium-long thick hair and I thought this was the same size as the one I was replacing...needless to say I about fainted when I opened the box!  It&#x27;s huge!  I thought about sending it back and thought..-my fault I didn&#x27;t order the appropriate size (should have been 1 inch) To my surprise, I spend less time with the bigger cylinder!  Only drawback is I keep burning my forehead because I&#x27;m not used to the huge size!  Now I use two irons...one for my bangs and this one for my long hair!  Still spend less time though!  I recommend it highly!  I turn it on and leave the room to finish up my routine in the bathroom, not more than 2-3 min and I come back and its heated perfectly!  I like the switch on/off button.  It&#x27;s more user friendly than my smaller one... The weight of it is barely noticeable for the size being so much bigger..Just keep in mind if you are moving up in size it will require adjustments on your part.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and is perfect love it ..i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair. This is better then blow drying your hair and faster, it dose not give you curls is more for a straight hair look. If you want curly hair, this one is not the right one for you, try getting a smaller one. My hair looks like i just got out of the hair salon... Oh one last thing it heats quick too and medium heat is great it does it&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have waist length, thick, naturally curly hair that usually frizzes instead of curls.  It usually takes over an hour to tame my hair into something manageable.  I purchased this product with the knowledge that a 2\\&quot; barrel will not curl as much as it smooths.   It worked beautifully for this.  I was able to smooth my hair in less than half the time of a flat iron (and without burning myself) and curling iron combination.  What this product gave me was soft, smooth, shiny waves that that feel so touchable soft.  I hope this review helps you make your decision.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m not as picky as some of the reviewers here.  The curling iron is the size I need, a size that I have been unable to find locally.  It heats up and has different settings.  It&#x27;s a good weight and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Totally satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> This iron did work well. However, within a short amount of time (a few months), the iron started to smell. I thought it needed a good cleaning, but that didn&#x27;t seem to fix it. If I use the iron, my hair smells (others notice it). I can use other irons with no issues.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a 2\\&quot; curling iron in any store, even in a beauty supply place.  I am so happy to have this--my hair is fine but can get a little frizzy in our humid air.  I was never able to master the flat iron, but this iron smooths my hair, makes it very shiny and gives it just a little bend.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Super fast shipping! I ordered this item on the Monday (Sept 22nd) and I received it that Thursday (Sept 23rd)! This is an awesome curling iron! Super easy to use, heats up fast and works really well on thick/long hair. Only one downfall....the higher the heat setting the more prone to your hair smelling a little \\&quot;crispy.\\&quot; Overall, this was a great buy for the price!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and appears to be a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i personally didn&#x27;t like this 2\\&quot; curling iron bc the barrel is too wide... if you have hair length that&#x27;s half as long as your torso, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product bc your hair wouldn&#x27;t be long enough to be curled with this. since i have thin hair, this product didn&#x27;t clamp onto it very well... it kept slipping out of the clamp when i turn it. also, the heat didn&#x27;t get as hot as fast as i would like it to. maybe if you had really, really long and thick hair, this product would work for you.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was somewhat skeptical about buying the 2\\&quot; jumbo curling iron, I have always use the 1.5\\&quot; from Conair.  But I was pleasantly surprised to discover it works great on my hair...I have very thick, wavy and frizzy hair, that is hard to tame. This product from Hot Tools really leaves it smooth and silky and with a mild but strong curl.  I didn´t find it difficult or bulky to use either. For the price, you can´t beat it.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> All went well! I received it quickly and in good condition. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> The stand for this iron is not sufficient to have the top sit off the counter.  Because of this, it left a burn mark on my counter.  Also does not have an auto shut off feature and it is heavy by comparison.  Love the 2\\&quot; &amp; long cord, but will be trading for a safer version.</li>
            <li> Little bigger than I thought but works great. My hair was smooth and full of body after using this. Not so good on the bangs because its just to big. But would recomend this product for anyone woth longer hair. My hair felt like like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> This was a hard to find item that I was delighted to find online for a great price. My daughter absolutely loves it and it is also used by all her roommates, too. The 2\\&quot; barrel makes for large, soft curls like those with rollers, but much more time-saving with its instant heat and adjustable heat settings. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I had revived this as 4 star because it does work great. I have long thick black hair. I love it!!! The only reason it is not five stars is for the fact the company had to send me a new one, becaue it was not packaged right. They did infact send me a new one with a pre paid lable also.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is good but it&#x27;s very heavy and hard to maneuver... It gets very hot fast but know the 2 inch is a HUGE barrel so this just gives hair a bit of a wave. Not a curl at all.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist and I was looking for something to give me beachy waves that a 1\\&quot; curler does not. I guess I can&#x27;t say that it is a bad curler but it definitely does not make curls, it simply straightens hair and makes it curl out or in at the bottom. I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to. This one was just TOO big!</li>
            <li> The 2\\&quot; diameter is also too large for the length of my hair. Although it is well past the shoulders, it does not reach the bra strap line at my back. The result is the ends are curled but my hair is just not long enough to spiral or curl more than once. I have used the highest setting and the curl only lasts about an hour or 2 despite hairspray, perhaps due to humidity.    Not good for travel since this only works on 110v sockets.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Hot Tools\\&quot; was recommended to me by my hair stylist, however it stopped working after one use!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, came as advertised and great quality product. Had to return for a smaller size but no issues with that either.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Has all the control settings you need &amp; gives you just the right size curl.  I got it so my curly/wild/tina turner hair could be straight without being so boring.... It gives it just a little volume &amp; sexiness without overdoing it.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Super savings on this amazing 24K gold hot iron!  Terrific Christmas present for my daughter!  She will LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice curling iron for any hair type. The only con to the product is the handle is a little smaller than they used to be made   (I would have given it a 5 star rating if the handle was larger). It is still a nice product and I use mine everyday. You can do a quick large curl or a straighter look with the tips of your hair curled under or up.</li>
            <li> The iron was delivered on time, but when I used it on the highest level it will not put a curl in my hair! I have long hair, almost to my butt, and I wanted a product that would give me big curls. I used a curl busting moose and with dry hair tried to create a curl, although it does give my hair beautiful waves, it will not curl! So if you have long hair and want something that will give you curls, this is not a good buy. But if you want something that gives none frizzy waves, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because I needed really lose but elegant curls for an upcoming beauty pageant. I was so excited about it coming in the mail because despite the other bad reviews, the good ones won me over. Upon its arrival, I immediately tried it out. My hair no product in it when I tried the iron. I have thick, coarse hair to the middle of my back. I first tried the iron on the lowest setting - other reviews said the iron literally burned their hair out on the highest setting! Nothing happened. I turned it up about 120 degrees and tried again. Nothing. I finally got the courage to turn it up to the highest setting - nothing. Although, I did manage to burn my ear so bad the skin just literally fell right off. This definitely isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve curled my hair, so I knew it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;. I even tried it on my sister&#x27;s thin, fine hair. Once again, nothing. The following morning it was back in the mail. It did NOTHING for my hair. Very disappointed. Not even a little wave at the bottom like others said. I personally do NOT recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real happy with my new purchase, I have used hot tools for years and the quality on  this one doesn&#x27;t seem to compare to the others I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s not made as good as the others I&#x27;ve owned, Maybe it&#x27;s an after market who knows.  I love Hot tools curling irons they usually last me while but just do not love this one !</li>
            <li> Not only was this product an amazing price, but shipping was reasonable and it got to me pretty quickly. The curling iron is the same quality that you would find in a salon supply store, just much more affordable! Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Gives big curls.  Curls fast..Can either be waves or super curly..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find a huge barrel for super-long hair. This is amazing. Great control, great heat-up, awesome size.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality curling iron. The gold barrel coating allows my hair to slide over when I want it to. There are loads of temperature settings. When I received this curling iron I immediately began working on my hair. I found that the curls lasted much longer than those created with the blow brush. I am very happy with this iron and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Huge inch curler, haven&#x27;t tried it yet..&lt;br /&gt;But with the hair I got I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get them gorgeous curls!</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as  Christmas gift for one of my young adult daughters. She was quite happy when received it and since as indicated it works well for her. I was pleased with the prompt service. The product arrived several days earlier than expected in spite of the Holiday Season.</li>
            <li> New works as advertised</li>
            <li> When I use this item it doesn&#x27;t hold my locks. I find that it is not as hot as it claims to be. Although my hair was kind of short. My hair is long now so when I do curl my hair again I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I was nervous the 2\\&quot; barrel would be too big but it produces great, loose beach waves that I love. My hair&#x27;s a little past my shoulders. If yours is much shorter than that the barrel may be too big for you. Also, my hair holds curl well and I could see this iron not working on someone with fine or silky hair.</li>
            <li> Its GREAT I Love it works like a professional curling Iron....10 stars......</li>
            <li> I have thin but unruly hair and this is perfect for smoothing my hair and giving the ends a slight curl under to give my hair that polished salon look!  It has lots of heat settings which is important to me since it gets SO hot!  Its also perfecton bangs because it gives them the natural swept look.  I love how quick and easy my hair fixes with this and I love the compliments, too!  Oh, and I&#x27;ve used it for years and its still going strong!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this as the price was great on amazon, but all it did was straighten out my hair... So I returned to using my 1 inch and 1 1/2 inch barrels instead.</li>
            <li> When this curling iron came with extra springs, I should have known what was coming. I used it twice and the spring tweaked and wouldn&#x27;t roll correctly, I have replaced both springs it came with and it did the same thing, so now I have to push on the thing to get it to close around my hair everytime I use it. I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My long thick hair naturally dries into massive frizzy untamed curly ringlets, so I have three choices to style it - 1. Pantene leave in overnight conditioner packets (which are now discontinued) worked in wet somehow styles my mop of hair into this gorgeous polished Dyan Cannon style, 2. A flatiron to make waves from curls (twist 2\\&quot; of hair into a curl between your fingers and then flat iron each for 8 seconds (it lasts for 4 days) 3. Or I use this Hot Tools 2\\&quot; curling iron to quickly straighten my hair (even without blowdrying, which I hate to do anyway). I only use this brand, and I&#x27;m ready for my third because I wear them out with years of use. I&#x27;ve tried others but this one is stronger, gets hotter, and it seems to lock when you grab the hair so it doesnt slip out. I&#x27;ve taken this one with me all over the world. It&#x27;s the closest thing I have in my posession to creating the look of a salon blowout. If you&#x27;re anything like me, and it&#x27;s almost impossible for you to recreate that movie-star look at home with a blow dryer, then this tool is an absolute must have. The previous reviewer is correct in that it gives you smooth hair, but with volume and curve. It&#x27;s perfect for longer layered hair, and for hard to tame hair. I might even grab it before the cat if my house was on fire (kidding, but you know what I mean). P.S. If you aren&#x27;t sure if a curling iron will tame your curls, then have a stylist try it in a salon first. Depending on how tight your curls are naturally, yours might need to be blown out first.</li>
            <li> The Supertool 2\\&quot; curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter&#x27;s shorter hair style.  I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating.  Lamerchendise replied to my emails promptly with specific directions and waived a portion of their restocking fee. As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and this gives it a little lift and has it all going in the same direction 😉. I had a large curling before and loved it but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in the stores any more. This one is well made and gets plenty hot. I use the recommended setting for my hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> This product was a let down. I have long hair and it&#x27;s not thick. My hair always holds a curl, but this curling iron just doesn&#x27;t give it any kind of curl. More like a big wave.</li>
            <li> I like this curler iron but is not to easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used HOT tools for years, but never this particular one.  It doesn exactly what I needed to my medium length hair.  I am not particularly clever with smoothing irons, so I use this to give me just a hint of lift and smooth out frizziness.  As always, HOT tools are high quality; heat up hot and fast, handle well, and last a long time.  I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, but the strands themselves are fine. My hair has ranged from a crew cut to one length down to my knees. Right now, I am growing it back out; it&#x27;s 3\\&quot; below my shoulders, all in one length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Hot Tools brand professional line styling products for the past 20+ years. I have found that they are the best of the best and will not buy any other. You don&#x27;t need to preheat these like other irons because they get hot within seconds. I own every size Marcel curling iron from the 1/2\\&quot; to the 1-1/2\\&quot; and the spring 2\\&quot; curling iron as well as their ionizing blow dryer and the interchangeable size hot air brush. The only product I own that&#x27;s not Hot Tools is my hot rollers, they are Remington Ceramic Rollers. HT didn&#x27;t make a set that I liked, so I picked these since I needed large rollers. I don&#x27;t use medium/small ever, and I needed a large set with more than 5 in them. HT does make a set of 12 (Hot Tools Hairsetter 12 pc.), but I don&#x27;t know of anyone that was satisfied with the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the look you want to create, the best size that I use the most often is the 1-1/2 inch iron. The 2\\&quot; gives me volume and a bit of curl, while the 1-1/2\\&quot; gives me volume but more curl and that it&#x27;s more versatile. When my hair is long, I don&#x27;t use anything smaller than the 1\\&quot;--even then, it&#x27;s pushing my luck because of the curl size and the amount of hair I have. Sometimes I will use the combo of both 1-1/2\\&quot; and 2\\&quot; and alternate, so I get more vavoom without looking like an 80s rock star groupie. I can put more hair in the curl and get more of a volume look vs. a curled look. As my irons need replaced, I will be switching to their ceramic line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I do my hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I use Ojon Tunu Elastik hair smoothing cleanser and conditioner. Then apply the revitalizing mist leave-in conditioner and toner and then flip upside down and blow out my hair. Sometimes, I dry until damp, then use the hot air brush to style and complete the drying process. If I use the hot air brush, this is where I stop. When I want to add more curl, I just dry my hair and use the irons. When It&#x27;s dry, I start pulling sections to curl with the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I apply the Tunu Elastik flexible finishing hairspray to the underside of the hair section, then curl with the iron. The heat settings I use are 3-4. Always start at the slow settings and work your way up until you find a setting that works for your hair. These irons get very hot and will cook your hair if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing. Only the thickest, coarsest hair should use the highest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When curling, I start at the crown, roll the top of the head with 1\\&quot; thick by 2\\&quot; wide sections and do them left to right and roll back away from the face. The back and the sides are the same size section but it&#x27;s rolled under with the rollers parallel to the floor. Sometimes for more of a spiral perm look, I roll the hair with the rollers perpendicular to the floor and alternate rolling away/towards the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Slowly remove hair from the iron then roll it up on a jumbo hot roller. (Before they came out with the jumbo hot rollers, I would use empty pop cans. I learned that trick from my mother. She had thigh-length straight hair and would roll it up on pop cans, then use large hair ties to figure-8 to hold the hair on the can. Put the hair tie over one end, flip the tie over so it crosses over the center of the hair, then secure over the other end of the can.) You can use other types of rollers as well, I just happen to have hot rollers. This is to help set the curl, but also to keep the hair out of the way as I work. I&#x27;ve tried just leaving the curls down as I go but with my hair being so thick and long, I get frustrated. Once I am done and all my hair is up, then I spray my head with the finishing hairspray. I love the hairspray because it&#x27;s flexible and really holds. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not wearing hairsprayat all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. After doing my make-up I take the rollers out. I don&#x27;t use a brush or comb on my hair. I just finger-style it. I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished, I spray with the finishing spray again. With the Tunu line, I find my hair holds for my day 10-12 hour shift, then I teach at night for 3 hours. I don&#x27;t need to touch up unless it&#x27;s raining or we have a day of high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is board-straight and won&#x27;t hold a curl to save my life. I had perms when I was younger, but my hair literally broke off in my hand. I&#x27;ve done the gentlest perms and just do a body wave, but no luck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything product-wise over the years and the Ojon Tunu line is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair-type. It&#x27;s detergent-free and doesn&#x27;t harm my hair. It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much. For my hair, I use about a nickel-sized amount, add it to a 2 oz travel bottle, add water, then apply to my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t deposit wax on the hair like Pantene does. Tunu doesn&#x27;t lather like other products do since it doesn&#x27;t contain any detergents.

I don&#x27;t use a brush or comb on my hair. I just finger-style it. I gently separate the curls and when I&#x27;m finished, I spray with the finishing spray again. With the Tunu line, I find my hair holds for my day 10-12 hour shift, then I teach at night for 3 hours. I don&#x27;t need to touch up unless it&#x27;s raining or we have a day of high humidity.    My hair is board-straight and won&#x27;t hold a curl to save my life. I had perms when I was younger, but my hair literally broke off in my hand. I&#x27;ve done the gentlest perms and just do a body wave, but no luck with it.     I&#x27;ve tried everything product-wise over the years and the Ojon Tunu line is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair-type. It&#x27;s detergent-free and doesn&#x27;t harm my hair. It&#x27;s also super-concentrated, so it doesn&#x27;t take much. For my hair, I use about a nickel-sized amount, add it to a 2 oz travel bottle, add water, then apply to my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t deposit wax on the hair like Pantene does. Tunu doesn&#x27;t lather like other products do since it doesn&#x27;t contain any detergents.

            <li> DO NOT BUY this iron.  It does NOT curl your hair.  I went and got another one at CVS for $20 and it works so much better.  This iron get hot but for some reason it does not curl.  DO NOT WASTE your time or money on this.  Go to the drug store and get one!</li>
            <li> I have never used hot tools before so this is my first experience. I love the fat curling iron. It straitens my hair better than my old conair straightener, and it stays for two days with just a touch up on my bangs. Also, with the great price, I didn&#x27;t have to pack up my boys and drive to a salon to get the tool; I was just able to order it and it came to my front door.</li>
            <li> This is great for long, thick hair. I have thick, asian hair and it is a pain to blow dry.  So, i blow dry somewhat carelessly and then I use this curling iron and it looks like a salon blow out.  it takes much less time.  not real curl, just a nice bend and a nice shine. get it, but dont expect curl</li>
            <li> It heats up quick, and with the many temperature options it is perfect for any hair type.  I have had it for several months and can report nothing but great curls from it!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I&#x27;m actually using this tool to bend thin strips of wood for an art piece I&#x27;m doing (check &amp;#34;Rolling Down&amp;#34; at ArtPrize.org).  I discovered too along with other reviewers that this unit gets VERY hot--I back it down to medium and wear leather gloves to work the wood.  It has put in many hours of service already a little more than halfway through the project and showing itself to be a very durable product.</li>
            <li> Great product! This product, in my opinion, is for longer hair. My hair is medium length, so when I use this product, it acts more like a flat iron. Still love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 1 3/4&amp;#34; curling iron, but no company seems to make one that size. I usually use a 1 1/2&amp;#34; Conair iron, but I decided to try this one. For my hair, which is a bit past my shoulders, medium thickness, and mostly straight with just a touch of natural wave, this curling iron works more like a flat iron than a curling iron. The barrel is just too big for my length, so it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of curling. It&#x27;s got a really long cord, which is nice, but as others noted, it comes with extra springs because they break easily (I haven&#x27;t used mine enough to have that happen yet). Overall, I was rather disappointed, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I really expected from this curling iron.  What it doesn&#x27;t give you is much of a curl at all.  Not really what I wanted or needed. Too big to curl.</li>
            <li> Its definitely a big barrel. It creates a gentle pressed smoothing action more than a curly effect but I like it</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that I found these on Amazon! I ordered 3 Hot Tools, saved a bundle &amp; they were at my door in no time!!</li>
            <li> I had to return my curling iron for a smaller one this was was Hugh.</li>
            <li> Too large of diameter to make any curl or even a wave.</li>
            <li> after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat. i use hair spray so it&#x27;s not that. if you have the same problem, get a ceramic iron , not this one</li>
            <li> Gets hot and works well, but it is too easy to accidentally turn it off without knowing it!</li>
            <li> Overall I like the product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is just a little hard on your hair. After a couple times of using it, I noticed my ends didn&#x27;t look very healthy.</li>
            <li> I usually use a 1 inch curling iron for my long (about 6 inches below shoulders), thick hair, but decided to try for bigger curls and waves. I purchased the Hot Tools 2 inch iron after a friend gave me rave reviews. I have used it a few times and I like it, but dont love it. Sometimes I see small clamp marks in my hair which drives me crazy and I feel the clamp release is a little awkward. On the other hand, the iron gives off nice even heat and most of the time I receive the desired style.</li>
            <li> Returned. Curls fell out even when I pinned them.</li>
            <li> WOW, thank you, works GREAT, instead of frying my processed hair with a ( brand name expensive) flat iron, this gives my below the shoulder hair just the right bend and smoothness I have been trying to achieve for YEARS. My hair is slightly blunt layered and also is fragile while having natural curl. It always looks kind of frizzy dependant upon the conditioner or shampoo I use. While this curling iron does not make ringlets, keeping in mind that I have it set below half heat, it actually mimics a blow dry with a round brush at the salon. I love this !!!</li>
            <li> Just a few days ago my Conair 2\\&quot; finally gave out (after 6 years of daily use). These 2 inchers are hard to find, and since Conair no longer carries this size I decided to go for Hot Tools.   I have to say I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s heavier than Conair&#x27;s version but better quality all around. I love the handle (soft and perfect width for my hand- and I have small hands so it&#x27;s great!). The holding end of it is big which makes it easier to grip (always had a problem with the tip on Conair&#x27;s version -too small).  This size is the only size I use anymore. It&#x27;s great for short to medium length hair (mine is short), for that rounded slightly curled under look. Like other reviews have stated it&#x27;s really good for that &#x27;blown out salon look&#x27; without having to be very skilled at using a round brush. If you&#x27;re looking for a real curl and you don&#x27;t have hair that holds curl well this might not be for you.  I LOVE this! Hope it lasts as long as my other one! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I tried using this curling iron several times and it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all... I have thick hair so I even tried taking it in really small sections and nothing... Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I got zero results with this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Barrel is very large, the curl turns is more of a wave when done. Would recommend for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item through a lightning deal.Overall,it is a good item. Even though I havent been able to use this item as often as I should,I think this product will work better if your hair is not too thick. My hair is very thick and I think I should&#x27;ve gone with a  smaller than a 2 inch. I dont regret buying it. Hot tools has great products which is why I bought this item. It is definately an item that I can live without.</li>
            <li> I think that the 1.5&amp;#34; might have worked better on my hair.  The 2&amp;#34; makes very loose curls that don&#x27;t hold up for long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a year ago. I&#x27;m quite disappointed since I was expecting a tool that gets super hot while mine gets nearly warm. I bought it from Italy, I don&#x27;t think there could be electrical mismatches since I correctly used the right plug. I tried to used it twice but any time I got mad. Just hate it. I hope I could come to US to prove if it really works and gets deadly hot down there.</li>
            <li> great product- controls my thick, wavy hair faster than any other styling method...and i&#x27;m a hairdresser so i have many tools</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2\\&quot; curling iron for my daughter.  The good news is that it  arrived very quickly and the price was competitive.  The bad news is the 2\\&quot; curling iron does not curl hair.  I guess it is just tooo big of a diameter and because of that, it only gives a very gentle curl on the very bottom of the hair.  It acts more like a hair straightener than a curling iron.  I would not recommend purchasing this curling iron.    I wish I would have read the other reviews about this curling iron before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars a rating for this product, I would.  I received this curling iron as a gift for my birthday and it has never once worked on my hair.  The only \\&quot;curl\\&quot; I achieve is a bent burnt line through my hair.  Perhaps my iron is defective, but nonetheless, I am extremely disatisfied with this product and would never recommend it to anyone. I sincerely hope Amazong will look into this and rectify the situation.</li>
            <li> Works great! I have shoulder length hair and this curling iron makes beautiful big waves in it, like a just got my hair done at the salon kind of look. I bet it works even greater on those with long hair. Definitely reccommend!</li>
            <li> We bought it as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It got warm but would not make a curl. When we tried to return it they refused to take it back. We are so upset with this vender and Amazon that we will not be using either in the future. Pretty stupid to loose a good customer over $25.00.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron...I went for it because of the 2&amp;#34; barrel and it is very professional with different heat settings a hanging hook and a stand to sit on counter if no hook to hang on.  I totally burned my forehead right in the beginning when doing my bangs, but that was my inexperience with the large barrel....so be careful!  I did not like the smaller curling barrels and enjoy the lose curls that can be constructed with this iron.  Would totally recommend to others. Great price and great iron!</li>
            <li> I have always had a large, 2\\&quot; curling iron for the last 10 years but they have become increasingly hard to find (at least in my area). Not only did I find one on Amazon that had a few more features than past curling irons, it was less expensive. Was a little concerned that it might not be a good quality product but was happy to find that it is as good if not better than previous ones. Happy camper!!</li>
            <li> Hot tools makes a great product at a great price.  And the curls from this look great and hold all day. Wife loves having the diversity of this big barreled beauty for getting that extra wave/curl.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; great price. Curls just enough to give nice body &amp; turns ends under w/out looking like I put my hair in rollers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the waves this curling iron leaves, it was worth every penny and Iove it!!  I get compliments  Everytime I use it</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase! I have long, thick, Asian hair and A LOT of it. I love the look of curly/wavy hair, but it usually takes such a long time for me to curl ALL of my hair so my hair&#x27;s usually left straight. But ever since I got this curling iron, all that has changed! With the large barrel, strong spring grip, and high heat level, I&#x27;m able to curl large chunks of my hair at a time, which really saves a lot of time. My favorite look is to curl all my hair first, then lightly hairspray it for soft big curls. I definitely recommend this product! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> She loves it and that is all that matters it is the second one I purchased for and I would do it again.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, great for wavy curls for long hair.</li>
            <li> First thing: this iron does not have an auto-off switch! I assumed it did since all of my other ones do and it got so hot through the day when I forgot to turn it off that it burned through its own wire and the countertop. Technically that was my fault, but almost all other brands have the shutoff, it&#x27;s bad that this one doesn&#x27;t.   After about one year of great use, the hinge and clamp were no longer tightly closing anyway. It made curling so frustrating. The look it gives when working is great, but check out other 2-inch irons first. Most of my other tools last a few years.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, FINE/THIN hair and this really gives me a lot of volume! Highly recommend for shoulder length or longer hair.</li>
            <li> This item was suppose to arrive in 1 week, instead it took 14 days, plus the shipping is VERY expensive. $[...]. And there is NO contact info. So if you want to speak to someone there is NO number to call. You are better off ordering through [...]. as for the item.. its good for SHORT hair. NOT long hair (which I have) with short hair it will give you bounce, and that blow dry look. LONG hair it does nothing for.</li>
            <li> I wanted a really wide diameter curler to create a smooth curve. Smaller rollers and irons made my hair too curly and a flat iron really can&#x27;t create enough lift-- It made my hair flat looking. There was a bit of a learning curve because it&#x27;s so big and very hot (even at the lower end of the dial), but I&#x27;m getting consistent results now and I&#x27;m very pleased with my new hair.</li>
            <li> This iron is the perfect size for what I wanted and it came with 2 replacement springs..much needed on most irons who&#x27;s springs break, but the iron itself still works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this 2&#x27;&#x27; iron a couple times now, and I&#x27;m still not seeing curls. Maybe the barrel is too wide? I have long hair so I thought the 2&#x27;&#x27; would work well...maybe not? I have the 1 1/4&#x27;&#x27; one, and I love that one. I gave it 3 stars because I still like Hot Tool Professional products.  I will give this 2&#x27;&#x27; iron another shot. There&#x27;s a GOOD chance I don&#x27;t know the correct way to curl hair haha so I will see if I can get this to work another time ;)</li>
            <li> 2&amp;#34; does not work curl at all.</li>
            <li> I had a curling iron years ago that was extra-hot and it seems to me that it got hotter than this one does. Also the cord on this thing is very aggravating. It has a swivel feature but it gets wound tight anyway, in a skinny minute. I&#x27;m always having to unravel it and I find that annoying. Other than that, the performance of this curling iron is acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is a hard to find tool and I love it!  If you have curly hair, you can&#x27;t live without it.  My first one lasted ten years so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews, it was a no brainer to pick this curling iron among others. I got the 2 inch one and there was nothing about it that worked for me. 1) Its too bulky, my hands were hurting while trying to curl my hair. 2) It does not glide smoothly through the hair and I ended up pulling my hair a bunch of times. It ended up going back.&lt;br /&gt;A good word for the seller: return was simple and hassle free.</li>
            <li> Although the curling iron did exactly what I wanted in terms of shape of curls (a 2 inch barrel is not meant to CURL... very loose waves, similar to round brush) I had issues with the spring on TWO of these curling irons. The first iron I bought was fine for the first couple of uses, then the spring came off track and it was hard to open and close the clamp -- needed extra force and screeched the entire time I used it, very frustrating. Finally, the spring broke off altogether, probably from being stressed at the wrong points too often. I bought the same iron in hopes it was a defect in just the one, but alas this one also had trouble with the spring. Even after realigning it multiple times, the spring would revert back off track. Also, just last week the plastic piece covering the lever to open the clamp broke off, rendering the iron useless. As much as I love the curl results, the quality of the iron is terrible and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this iron ONLY if you have thin hair (which I do).  The other reviews are true, if you have thick hair this iron is too big to curl it (even though it gets smokin&#x27; hot!  I&#x27;ve already burnt my scalp twice!). The iron is no thrills, but it&#x27;s cheap, so it&#x27;s a deal for the money. Thick hair types find a smaller curler, I would recommend a 1 1/2\\&quot;, which I had before I bought this one.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to that width once this one blows.</li>
            <li> I bought this Curling Iron to smooth out my long, thick, wavy hair.  I like the enormous size, but the spring is TOO TIGHT to create a \\&quot;smooth out\\&quot; fashion for straightening.  I use Straight Smooth &amp; Sexty smoothing spray and even with that, the iron would not easily smooth through the 1\\&quot; sections of my hair. Watch the area&#x27;s behind your ears &amp; neckline...you will get burned due to the size of the barrel. It is a very good product and the tight spring would be great for someone with thin hair, but if the texture of your hair is as mine, get ready for alot pulling &amp; snagging.  The product itself is great and I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. It feels little heavy, therefore a bit awkward at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I needed a big honking curler to make those old fashioned rolls of hair that I love so much. This did the trick. It gets hot hot hot, which is so bad for your hair but whatever I can wear wigs if it falls out.&lt;br /&gt;took a few times to figure out best way to use it, so there isnt that annoying crimp. But I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great! It&#x27;s my 2nd one already!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Hot Tools products for many years because of their durability. Hot Tools curling irons typically give me 5+ years of use. But this 2\\&quot; Curling Iron stopped working after 13 months! I bought this from Amazon seller, Housewares. I am completely disappointed and will not purchase any future products from this seller.</li>
            <li> My hair comes to the middle of my back, so I thought this would give me a nice little bump at the end...not so much....doesn&#x27;t do anything, no curl....nothing. My hair is not course and curls fine with smaller barrel golden hot curlers and with my chi flat iron. This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and great for creating large curls/waves.  My new favorite curling iron!  But it is a larger diameter so hand can get tired trying to do all of my hair (i have a lot) and am 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; so maybe not for petite hands unless you use both.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I knew that it would not create curls, but I did expect it to put curl or volume in my hair none the less. When I first tried to curl my hair, it came out straight and looking as though I had not done anything to it. I spend about an hour curling my hair in different ways hoping to see some sort of curl to it, but I saw nothing. I, who is usually pleased with anything done to my hair, was completely unsatisfied and I will be returning the curling iron. If you are hoping to see big curls, or any curls in that matter, do not get this iron.</li>
            <li> With the very large size, I use this to straighten parts of my hair when I need a quick fix. It comes out straight with a slight curve, which is fine with me because thats what I expected.</li>
            <li> gives no curl, basically a straightner</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gets to a high enough heat to style hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Liked my previous one but the spring for the clamp broke after about a year. Went ahead and bought another one hoping it wouldn&#x27;t happen again. It came with extra springs so it must be a common problem and known by the  seller/manufacturer. So, as long as I can replace the spring when it breaks I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.  The temp control is good, and it tells you on the box what temp to use for your hair texture.  I use mainly for straitening.</li>
            <li> I am on my third of these curling irons.  Right there that tells you something, right?  This iron is perfect for my long, wavy hair, because it gives nice soft curls and smooths frizz.  However, they are dealing with a serious manufacturer&#x27;s error that they&#x27;re not bothering to remedy.  The spring that allows you to open the iron and for it to clamp down on your hair doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  So, they give you an additional spring.  That&#x27;s great, but it still extends the life of your iron to maybe a year, after which both springs are broken and it&#x27;s time to replace it.  It heats up quickly and gets hot enough for me.  If there was another manufacturer who made a curling iron with a two-inch barrel, I would try it.  Unfortunately, until I find one, I&#x27;ll keep buying these once a year.  (Then again- maybe that&#x27;s their plan!)</li>
            <li> I love it! It is perfect for my hair, giving it a fullness and smoothness without curl. It heats up immedidately - no waiting for it to heat up. The handle and release clip are user-friendly. It is everything I expected and more. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Heavier than I would like.  Somewhat difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Really provides waves because it is so big, not curls.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all the way I&#x27;d hoped ... It&#x27;s kinda useless</li>
            <li> These are the worst curling irons.  They don&#x27;t get hot..I tried using smaller sections of hair and it still didn&#x27;t work...waste if $40...I&#x27;m tryna figure out why they have such high reviews...this product sucks</li>
            <li> I really like this iron. it does wonders for my hair. great price , I have a smaller one also its worn out love hot tool products.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long (up to my waist) and this curling iron is PERFECT for me.&lt;br /&gt;10 quick curls and I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Natural and shine and saved a lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;But be aware: I believe that this only works on long hair( I mean, at least hair like mine) otherwise you won&#x27;t see the curls since this tool only makes a big &amp;#34;s&amp;#34; shape on my hair.</li>
            <li> 2&amp;#34; is way too big doesn&#x27;t do anything to my hair, I recommend 1&amp;#34; or 1 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have thick healthy long hair. I bought the 2inch. The highest heat didnt burn my hair off as other reviews stated. What I&#x27;m thinking is their hair was fragile and couldn&#x27;t tolerate the heat. Gives me natural curls and body. Curls aren&#x27;t tight but that&#x27;s What I like. More of a natural look. Definitely gives you shape. Love it! now lets see how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> These irons are the hottest, literally on the market. I have been using them exclusively for over 10 years. If you try them you&#x27;ll see the difference!</li>
            <li> The iron itself is very nice and I&#x27;m sure works great. My problem with it is it is SO BIG!!! I realized I was buying a large iron and was expecting very loose curls, but this hardly gave ANY curl to my hair. I have hair to my shoulder blades, so unless your hair is extremely long I would not recommend this size.</li>
            <li> I wanted big wavy curls...I knew this big iron wouldnt make tight curls, but I have long hair and it didnt even wave my hair...it took me like 5 min on one section to get a semi wave that fell flat minutes later. :(</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day.  I have wavy hair and this smoothes it out.  I don&#x27;t care for flat irons.  The large barrel on this iron essentially straightens the hair while giving it a little bit of turn at the ends (as opposed to stick straight hair from a flat iron).  Do not expect classic curl from this iron as the barrel is so large.  This is a quality iron.  Solid, gets good and hot, has a temperature dial and a long cord.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS TO DO MY FARRAH FACUETT CURLS BUT ITS TOO BIG THE CURLS DONT HOLD MY HAIR IS REALLY LONG SO IT JUST GIVES A BODY WAVE LOOK</li>
            <li> This curling iron was exactly what I was looking for - it&#x27;s great!!  I get so many compliments on my hair all the time. I have thick, coarse hair so I really use it more for a straightener than anything....it straightens my hair and gives it a little curl on the ends for a \\&quot;fuller\\&quot; look to my hair. I don&#x27;t like my hair completely flat to my head and this gives me a nice look of straight hair with alot of body. The only feature I wish it had was the automatic shut-off feature just in case you ever left it on. Nice heavy duty cord....long enough to move around a bit without coming unplugged!!</li>
            <li> this product is exactly as described, but it doesnt work with straight hair! i didnt have the results i expect</li>
            <li> i have wicked thick naturally curly hair, and smaller barrels do not do what i need my hair to do. i&#x27;d been looking for the 2&amp;#34; barrel forever, and am so glad i finally found one. as everyone else has said, hot tools is probably the best in the business, and this curler did not disappoint. FINALLY i can transform my crazy curls into more uniform cascading curls/waves. this curler DOES get VERY HOT though. the tip is cool for holding while waiting for the curl to set, but the highest temp is 400*.... idk about anyone else, but i&#x27;m pretty sure that would FRY my hair, so i keep it on the lower settings.</li>
            <li> So much volume in so little time! I love this for my bob-type haircut! I can never keep rollers in, and this works so fast! The cord rotates too so I haven&#x27;t had a problem with twisted cords.</li>
            <li> but returned it as it was an error on my part as the barrel was too large so I went back on line to order the 1.5&amp;#34; by the same maker. It&#x27;s a nice iron and comes with extra springs which I am happy about. My hair is only med length so the 1.5&amp;#34; better suits me for waves.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; great customer service from start to finish!</li>
            <li> This curling iron does magical things to the volume at my crown. I have very long hair, and it gives me the nicest curls and waves.</li>
            <li> Some folks complained that this was too hot... well adjust the temperature, starting at a low setting and going as higher in small increments as directed and figure out which works best for your hair type!  This curling iron smooths my almost-shoulder-length thick, dry, bleached hair beautifully... helps it get that bounce and shine we girls love!  Great product and great price... highly recommend.  I love the long cord, too!</li>
            <li> I have long medium thick hair, and was excited to have large loose curls. However when I used this iron, my hair didnt even wave. I watched 3 different youtube videos in hopes that I was doing something wrong. I tried the product three different times using the hottest setting and holding the curl for 25 seconds or more. I dont know if it would work on ppl with shorter hair, but i also have layers, and it didnt even work on the short ones.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this iron to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;But I will say that the customer service has been good so far:&lt;br /&gt;-Timely shipping&lt;br /&gt;-Quick response for return request&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s only been a week since i shipped it back sooooo idk about the rest</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed by this product. It was advertised as being salon quality. It neither effectively curled my hair nor helped to even smooth areas into a semi-curl. Any kinks from sleeping were visible even after use. I was was also shocked at how clunky it was to use/ difficult to maneuver. Finally, the clamp would catch and then break my hair. The final straw was the frustrating return policy of only one month. I did not use it for the first time until just after that period and have not been able to return it, leaving me out-of-pocket for a ineffective product. Despite trying it several times since, it has continued to perform poorly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great buying experience</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the wide barrel is great for loose curls. I&#x27;ve had this iron for over 6 months with no issues, it works great.</li>
            <li> I love it.. but the spring will start to loosen up and wont hold your hair.  I have bought this 2 x same thing : (</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to blow dry my hair to achieve that volume and bit of wave. I used the 2 inch iron to achieve the &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; look and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Because picking the right size barrel is extremely hard, I want to share a picture to show the result of using a 2 inch curling iron. As you can see, you get a blow dry effect with very loose curls at the end. The gold plate makes hair shinny and smooth, but it sort of weighs hair down just a bit more than the ceramic barrels.</li>
            <li> For those with thick hair this is perfect. I normally use the highest setting on curling irons and flat irons but this I had torn almost half way off. I burnt my forehead twice so easily please, please keep the temperature on as low as possible. You def don&#x27;t have to worry about it being hot enough for those with thick and coily hair.</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down. Excellent tool for long thick hair 2&amp;#34; is just what I needed</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how it gets very hot so I use it on the low setting.  Sets a nice loose curl.  Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> A 2-inch barrel curling iron WILL NOT CURL your hair, so be warned.  It will smooth your hair and give it a nice bend at the ends as though you&#x27;ve blown it out with a round brush.  A fine buy.</li>
            <li> This iron is more for big waves, but take forever to heat up and then doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  I have another 2 inch curling iron and gets hot quick and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I love this size of curling iron for when you don&#x27;t necessarilly want curls but more volume and body. The 2&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for that. Hot Tools always last a long a time and you can really crank the heat.</li>
            <li> The curling iron fell off of the counter and for one brief quarter of a second, bumped against my right ankle, resulting in second degree burns.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and the burn is still blistered and trying to heal.  I must say, it curls the hair nicely, but it&#x27;s not worth the health risks.  Please, be careful!

            <li> Bought Iron for my granddaughter and she was delighted! Loves the way it curls her hair!  Warms up very quickly and works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> it arrived broken-never even turned on</li>
            <li> Love these 2&amp;#34; curling irons! They do tend to wear out after about a year but I use them quite a bit and will continue to purchase as needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron for my daughter who has long thick straight hair.  She says it&#x27;s the best one she has out of the three she owns because it easily gives so much control and body.  The other curling irons never get used anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  It does everything she needs it too and I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased cheap curling irons from Target/WalMart...the Hot Tools is worth every cent in quality of barrel, time to heat, easy to use. I love the size to add body with a curl under or over.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend here - This curling iron does not get hot enough, does not curl, and leaves dents. It is a pointless iron to have. I use a clipless Enzo Milano and it gives me waves/curls that last for two days. If your hair is super bleached and fried, this iron might work for you, if you have any sort of healthy hair that is even *slightly* hard to curl, this is a waste of money. I am no novice and have tried many hair tools in my 20 years of self styling. I thought I would try a less expensive brand against my better judgement. Should have just listened to myself and stuck with more quality brands. This iron did not cost much really, but it is now taking up space in my cabinet and I cannot even give this to a person who could use it. Waste of money, could have had a nice lunch with that cash...</li>
            <li> great product. love the big curls it creates.&lt;br /&gt;wish it got a little hotter though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but in that one time, I like it.  The barrel is very smooth but the handle is sufficiently small and &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; enough to make the tool very simple and easy to operate.  The only reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it has a manual sliding on/off switch.  I prefer the push-button styles more; I guess because I&#x27;m more convinced they will automatically shut off in case of emergency that a manual functioning device.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the weight of the tool, though.  For such a large barrel, it is surprisingly easy to maneuver.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean that it is constructed with sub-par components.  I have a concern about the spring mechanism ... as it shipped with TWO replacement springs.  This makes me wary of the long-term use.  We shall see!  I will update.</li>
            <li> I should have reviewed a 2&#x27;&#x27; curling iron a little better before purchasing this. I was looking for big bouncy curls from this and that&#x27;s not what you get. And after reviewing it AFTER I purchased it, (dumb), a lot of people have said the same thing. That&#x27;s not what this curling iron is for. It will mostly straighten the hair and give a little volume but mostly do the straightening thing. So for my review I give it 2 stars because its not what I was expecting. If someone wants this to straighten hair then it would be a great product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this curling iron! As someone who has only gotten curls professionally done, either I am just not good at it or something is wrong with the product. I tried ALL settings and the lowest to medium settings were just not putting any curls at all, anythibg above medium I was smelling burnt hair. Suffice to say I now have some burnt ends. I heard great things about this product but for me it just didn&#x27;t work...it&#x27;s promptly being returned.</li>
            <li> My favorite tool. You can&#x27;t find irons this big anywhere in stores. It gives a very good flipped under look.</li>
            <li> I received this curling iron as a Pollyanna gift this Christmas and I was extremely disappointed with it! I have super thin wavy hair and my cousin, who is a hairdresser, used it on me before to give me big, flowy curls. I received the 2 inch and the same day I used it is the same day I immediately packed it all back up to send back. The curling iron did get super hot once I turned it to the highest setting. I left it on my hair for about 12 seconds and guess what? NO CURL! It actually appeared that it straightened my hair rather than curl it. I tried different techniques: I tried curling a whole bunch of hair, I left it on longer, and I even went out and bought a smaller size (1 inch) to see if it made a difference. NOTHING. Hot Tools is not a good brand and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works curling iron works well. Very hot. They make great products. I have purchased them for years. I love the large size for softer curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous curlers and to be completely honest my long hair holds curls amazingly for days without any hairspray. Unfortunately this curler couldn&#x27;t keep a curl in my hair for longer than 5 minutes. The 2 inch curler didn&#x27;t curl very well because I&#x27;ve learned the bigger the barrel the more heat it will need to curl hair and it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. I don&#x27;t own hairspray so it might work better using it but my opinion is no matter how long or coarse your hair is, don&#x27;t get a 2 inch curler unless it has a higher wattage than 430 or else the curl won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic curling iron, especially for the price. I have thick, curly hair and this works wonderfully to smooth it out and make it look like it&#x27;s been blown out. It gets super hot and leaves my hair looking very sleek without damaging it too much. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> its not good it wont culr properly and curls open so fast even if i use hair spray wont recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that reaches to the center of my shoulder blades. I wanted to get a large iron that would make soft waves. This barrel is far too large, apparently. I have had more success with a 1 1/4\\&quot; iron. I&#x27;m going to try turning the heat setting all the way up and using some hairspray on the hair while it&#x27;s in the roller.</li>
            <li> A little larger than I expected, but it works great as a straightener and adds wave.  It tames my hair when my natural wave begins to take over.  Heats quickly and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is wonderful! I got it and started using it and I love it. There are right and wrong ways to use this product. As long as you have experience with a curling iron this size, then you are all set.Again, I absolutely love it and am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> If you want curl, please do not buy this item. If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you. This \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron is really a monster. I was hoping for some bigger volume curls but it didn&#x27;t turn out so well. I really would suggest going smaller. You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look but that&#x27;s not personally what I needed. So it really does depend what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product after I returned a curling iron with no clamp for my hair (beware I didn&#x27;t know they made irons with no clamp).  I have long, thick, wavy layered hair and need the heat and the clamp, and I love the huge barrell it really softens of the look and takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> too large and combersom</li>
            <li> The only thing that will curl my straight, thin hair!</li>
            <li> This did not work on my hair. It would not get hot enough. Like if it is broken or something. It&#x27;s supposed to be NEW, but it&#x27;s broken? Maybe this curling iron I purchased was use before and stopped heating up so they made it look new and sold it. Returning.</li>
            <li> I love this buy another one hey it&#x27;s taking a lot of abuse it&#x27;s easy to clean and I&#x27;ve definitely put its paces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for a couple years now and it still works like a charm! I like having the feature of being able to adjust the heating setting.  My biggest complaint is that it now squeeks when I life the curling lever piece which probably annoys the people around me more than it annoys myself. I like to use this curling iron at my roots to give my hair some extra volume.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair that is fairly thin. Even on the highest heat setting, the most this iron does is straighten my hair with a light curl at the end. It doesn&#x27;t even give me any volume. I have had only Hot Tools curling irons my whole life and I love their products. I was under the impression that this woukld give me big loose curls or waves even, but it doesn&#x27;t. I have easy-to-curl hair too, so it&#x27;s not just me. I think I&#x27;d be better off with a 1.5 inch iron. If you are looking for curl: get a smaller iron. I&#x27;ve used it maybe three times and will probably keep it but not use it very often since all it does is straighten.</li>
            <li> This is a great \\&quot;curling\\&quot; iron even though it doesn&#x27;t really curl. I wanted something bigger so I wouldn&#x27;t end up with such curly/wavy hair with my smaller one. This 2 inch iron does not curl hair but it does create a smooth, full bodied look with little waves/curls at the bottom. I love it because it looks like I just got a salon blowout with just using this curling iron. If you want something to create ringlets, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you like the just blown out smooth salon look, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Would buy again</li>
            <li> perfect for adding waves and curls!! heats up very quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Was missing a few parts, other than that loved the size and heat control.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted at least 5 years!  Hopefully they&#x27;re still around when this one dies 5+ years from now.</li>
            <li> I recently started to travel more with my job than I did in the past.  I needed to cut down on the amount that I pack!  This was one place I was able to do it. This is not only good as a curling iron, when you use it, you don&#x27;t need a straightner either!  As far as heat goes, this thing packs it!  This makes natural looking curls and if your hair is shorter, it will just curl it under.  I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This thing is huge. I love the heat settings on this . For people with thick hair I feel it works really well.</li>
            <li> the heat was not applied evenly, took longer than usual to do my hair with with the same curler in 1&#x27;1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have heavy hair and this tool didn&#x27;t work so great for my hair. I have to put a lot of hair spray to have it hold but was trying to find something where I wouldn&#x27;t have to fry my hair on top of putting so much chemical in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool!  It&#x27;s a great brand and works well with my shorter hair style - gives me the volume I need!!!</li>
            <li> I love the curls it made but unfortunately it&#x27;s not made as well as I expected. I bought my 1st and it just stopped working. My 2nd one the handle spring broke. Very disappointed !!</li>
            <li> It works well as far as the quality and easy use of it. However, on my hair it didn&#x27;t do much of a curly wave to it like I thought it would. I have really long black straight hair down to my waist, and I feel that I&#x27;m better off using a smaller barrel rather than 2 inches.2 inches didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair...barely a wave to it.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot love it</li>
            <li> New out of the box and the power indicator light does not work. The iron did begin to heat, which is quite dangerous as it is not possible to tell by looking at it whether it is on or not. It has the feel of a cheap knock off of a salon quality iron, and given the price I guess that should have been obvious. At least Amazon makes the return process relatively painless.</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality tool that&#x27;s easy to use and okay for the price. But, after seeing all the rave reviews, I expected it to really smooth out my hair. Instead, it left my (otherwise-healthy) hair limp and a bit fried-looking. I&#x27;m going for a good ceramic curling iron next time.</li>
            <li> I normally have curly frizzy hair.  This curling Iron is awesome I can easily straighten my hair with it and make it look normal and smooth I have had every single hair styling product on the market and this curling iron tops everything I love it and would just about die if it broke.  This is my second one the first one last 4 years!!  4 years!!!  that&#x27;s amazing for me considering how much hair I have!!  If you ae in the market for a curly iron that works as a straightener this one is it!!  I am amazed at its powers!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron!  My hair is stubbornly wavy, but this curling iron does a great job smoothing it out and giving it a little bounce at the ends.  I still use some product to protect my hair &amp; give it some shine, but the curling iron is really what makes it look polished.  My hair falls about 4 inches below my shoulders, and this size barrel straightens my hair, gives it just a little volume with a perfect bouncy curl at the ends.</li>
            <li> Always love Hot tools and I was looking for a 2 inch Barrel.  Very pleased with this iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works better than my flat iron. I have shoulder length hair and wanted something to straighten and give a little curl at the ends and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> The size was too large; the curl did not hold. I returned it to the seller and am still waiting for a refund, although the product was delivered to the seller 10 days ago.</li>
            <li> I have been buying off amazon for a year now and never have I been so disappointed in a product. I bought this curling iron because I wanted wavy hair (and also my hair is long, past mid back). I didn&#x27;t really expect to get a curl out of it because it is a 2inch. Regardless, I was pretty sure I could get some huge beachy waves. This thing wouldn&#x27;t even wave my hair and I don&#x27;t have hard to curl hair either. Major disappointment, waste of my money and time. Sad that I loved hot tools just HATED this product!!</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly.  Exactly what I wanted and needed.  I could not find it in a store.  I needed the 2\\&quot; because of the length of my hair to give it more body.  I would  highly recommend this item, for it&#x27;s quality and my needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using a 1 1/2 barrel for years and just love this 2 inch one. It leaves my hair very silky and smooth looking but gives it body too. A straight iron leaves it too straight with no lift and body. I have hair with long layers a couple inches past my shoulders and it&#x27;s texture is somewhat coarse with natural curl that tends to look frizzy if left to dry naturally. First I blow it out and then use the iron. Love it! price is great too!</li>
            <li> sadly i had to return this item twice. contrary to all the other reviews mine NEVER GOT HOT ENOUGH. i htought maybe it was a fluke and i just received a defective one so i ordered another. the next one did the same thing :(  YES a gave it plenty of time to heat up, yes i started low and eventually had it turned all the way up, yes i left it in my hair for even over a minute or two and it barely made any shape. my hair naturally waves as much as this did. not sure if they tried to turn down the heat after so many complaints of it being TOO hot, but either way both are useless. i was fine with the design n such but like i said didn&#x27;t get much use. i tried it multiple times in mulitple plugs in the house. nothing :( .. all my other curlers work fine, heat up in a minute and curl my hair in about ten seconds</li>
            <li> At first, I was really worried, especially reading a review where a women burned her hair off! But I saw the stylists in Ulta using this same make/model and didn&#x27;t think they would stock an item where it would do that to their clientele. My hair is very fine, long, and straight and I wanted this for a big wave &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; at the end of my hair and to give body. It did exactly that. It did get very hot (I use it on the hottest setting) and hold in my hair for no more than 10 seconds. It is big and bulky but I didn&#x27;t find it so difficult to use. The tip seems to be enough that I didn&#x27;t burn myself, so I&#x27;m not sure how others are using it. Overall, I love having it in my collection of hair tools and have been using it the most lately.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Hot Tools -Supertool 2&amp;#34; Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control&lt;br /&gt;Still have to get to use it better but like any new hair tools it takes a little time.&lt;br /&gt;I make some nice big curl it looks great&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have long searched for a cross between a curling iron and a straightening iron. Something to smooth out my normally semi-frizzy hair and give it some body. This curling iron is perfect. If you&#x27;re looking for more than slightly curled ends, this iron is probably too large.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the first time, cranking it to its highest heat setting and allowing it to heat up for 10 mins before use. I have decently thick hair and its long as well, i sectioned my hair into smaller portions and began curling, it did nothing for my hair except flipped the ends slightly. I washed my hair the day before so it couldnt have been that. im very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was really disapointed with the quality.  It worked absolutely fantastic for about 3 months.  Then, all of a sudden, it stopped heating,, and became completely useless!</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of YouTube beauty gurus use this curling iron and so I had really high hopes, but I was unfortunately a little disappointed.  Didn&#x27;t hold my curl as well as I had hoped and my hair would get pinched and ripped out by the clamp.</li>
            <li> Huge BUMP iron. Not curling. Works but you have to leave it in for a bit. I also had to put a bandied on the small bar because it burned my finger. But it&#x27;s the largest one I could find and I like it.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once but does as promised. This is a huge barrel. Would like to try to un-tighten the screw to the clamp though, it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t leave the clamp line in your hair.</li>
            <li> Even though I turned it all the way up, it still barely curled my hair, and was only somewhat successful when I used really thin chunks of hair. Mine&#x27;s pretty thick, but it&#x27;s layered and had a good product in it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using my 5-year-old Chi straightener at the same time, and let me tell you: that old Chi is three times hotter than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gives beautiful, sexy bedhead curls that last.</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools and was very pleased with this curling iron. The bigger the barrel, the less of a curl you get so if you are wanting defined curls, this iron isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want lots of body and movement this is perfect! I love that it has a rotating cord so the cord won&#x27;t get twisted up into knots. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This size barrel is useless on my hair. The iron itself works but if you have difficult to curl hair, try a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> This iron sucks. I couldn&#x27;t curl my hair at all and I have long frizzy hair. Great for straighten</li>
            <li> Wtf? This thing came in like broke, even the iron from the handle up was crooked. It won&#x27;t heat up to its degrees and it just doesn&#x27;t curl hair it&#x27;s not hot enough. It won&#x27;t get hot enough. I sincerely suggest you don&#x27;t get anything electronic off the internet, everything I&#x27;ve gotten that&#x27;s electronic off here never worked. I&#x27;m infuriated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few 2 inch curling irons over the years and this is the best one so far.  It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li> Product shipped very fast and product was as listed online. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works perfect so far.  Read mixed reviews and took a chance anyway.  Very happy with the product at this time.  Will repost later if every any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw videos on Youtube of people who were able to get glamorous bombshell waves out of this product. I also like the idea of the gold plating because I heard that it really gives hair a nice smooth shine. In terms of getting hair to shine, this product does that. In terms of giving a huge and beautiful curl, it does not. Maybe this works really well for people with hair strands that are fine/thin, but I have thicker strands of hair. Even with the highest heat setting and leaving it to curl a bit longer, I couldn&#x27;t get this to curl my hair at all. The only thing it did was slightly add a bend to the ends, but I can do that with a hair straightener already. This tool was also really effective in straightening my hair, but again, I already have a hair straightener to do that. Other cons with this product is that it is super heavy! My arm felt like it was going to fall off cuz this product is just crazy heavy. As others have said, the cord is super long. Like ridiculously long. I think it would be great if you were in a room where the outlet is far away, but otherwise the cord just makes my bathroom counter so cluttered. One thing that was good is that it does heat up very quickly and the clip handle is long so you won&#x27;t burn yourself. The end of the iron also has a large plastic tip that doesn&#x27;t get hot at all, so you won&#x27;t burn your hands holding the ends. Overall, I think while this product might work for some hair types, it didn&#x27;t work for mine.</li>
            <li> This is either for long hair or if you just want a wave to your hair.  Hot Tools is always my favorite for curling irons &amp; the heat dial helps me so that I don&#x27;t fry my fine, processed hair. You do have to be careful you don&#x27;t hold it near the dial &amp; adjust it accidentally but that shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult for most people.</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for several months now and I absolutely love it. It is the perfect size for getting a nice subtle curl on the ends of my hair and for accentuating the shorter layers. I love the option to select the temperature the iron heats up to as I don&#x27;t like to use high heats on my hair to avoid damage. This curling iron was recommended to me by my hair stylist and she did not steer me wrong! It&#x27;s the only curling iron that my salon will use as it helps to prevent damage to hair.</li>
            <li> hot as hell, does great curls.  i didnt give it a 5 star cuz theres a temperature setting right on the handle. sometimes it gets turn up n down when im curling n messes up my temperature.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron...perfect size bouncy natural curls..easy to use...always delivers a perfect lasting hair do...very happy with the product</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean arms and abs. This magic wand will keep eyes on your face with its ability to amplify the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; in your hair!</li>
            <li> This curling is great, but bear in mind its just for really giving body to your hair not real curl. Also, it&#x27;s very easy to burn yourself due to it large size.</li>
            <li> Ordered it to replace mine that I&#x27;d had for over 5 years and finally dropped one too many times. Exactly what I wanted and heats up quickly and gives me the exact look for my hair that I want.</li>
            <li> I really love this iron, I have long straight hair and this adds the perfect &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to the ends. A lot of reviewers complain that this iron does not hold a curl, well that&#x27;s because it is 2&amp;#34;! If you want it to hold you need to use hairspray and probably a lot of it! I purchased this knowing the curls were not going to stay and instead I use it to smooth from root to almost the tip and then to add a little flip to the end - no hairspray needed and the flip stays all day.  I still cannot master the blowout so I use this instead - it&#x27;s perfect! I took a star away because the clamp is extremely tight!</li>
            <li> If you want the same look as a professional blow out....this iron is for you!  I LOVE it!!  Its size makes it heavier than a typical iron, but you will curl more hair faster with the 2&amp;#34; rod so the effort is break-even.  I can roll out all of my long hair in 9 segments vs the 15+ I used to have to do.  The finished result is just like a blow out.  Very satisfied customer!!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived really quickly without paying for special delivery. Larger than I imagined but as I use it to straighten my hair it worked out great. Even came with a couple extra hinge springs (added bonus).    I use this tool for straightening my hair as I don&#x27;t have the patience for flat irons to heat up - my hair is very thick and course. I have yet to find a flat iron that works well enough for my taste. Am old school; actually used to utilize an actual iron to get it done! LOL!</li>
            <li> I am a retired cosmetologist and recently my Pro Star curling iron died a good death after nearly 20 years of service. Unfortunately, Pro Star no longer makes the 1.5 inch size, so I ordered the Hot Tools. I am pleased with this tool. My hair is long and all I want to do is tame friz (dratted grays). The surface works as advertised, hair moves over the surface smoothly. My hair is rather thick and the adjustable heat setting is a plus. However, I would not advise going full tilt until you know how your hair responds to the heat and tension. I have had this product for a month and have used it several times. So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the previous reviewers. This curling iron is so big that it straightens the mid section of the hair and curls like a blow dryer on the bottom of the hair. It heats up very quickly and it holds my hair. However, I was looking for loose curls. I suppose now I am going to give the 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron a try.</li>
            <li> Love this Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; gold curling iron. Has an adjustment heat that works perfectly for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron.  It gives the long, full waves that I like.  The quality is good -- I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for several months with no problems.  People always compliment me on my hair when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist, who works in a professional salon, also uses this brand.  I would definitely recommend using a heat protectant, just like with any hot hair styling tool, but this won&#x27;t damage your hair any more than any other iron.  It&#x27;s also nice that you can pick your heat setting, if you want to spare your hair.  The swivel cord is extremely convenient.  Will definitely buy one of these again if mine ever gives out.</li>
            <li> Always hard to find a really large barrel curling iron. This one is great. It smooths and locks the curl in. Tames my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when it&#x27;s been blown out with a round brush but it&#x27;s so much work to do.  This curling iron gives me the soft bend at the ends and takes so little effort.  I love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Maybe mine had a spring too tight, but it pulled out a lot of my hair.  I&#x27;ve had several curling irons and I&#x27;ve never had one rip at my hair like this one.  Also, when I opened the box the curling barrel had finger prints on it.  I am thinking I was not the first to return this iron.</li>
            <li> I received it when I was told I would get it.  It worked perfect and the price was great compared to the regular stores that sell this product (almost half the price). I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;ve used it before so I knew how it was suppose to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the loose hot roller waves. Gives hair a little shape without looking fake. Love it.</li>
            <li> great size for long hair or if you just want some wave to your hair. I have a bob hair style so I use it to give volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reason of 3 star is because the light of On/Off and the Temp control dial are not working.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how long you wait, or how many times you try to use this, it is just not meant for my hair. I have curly hair, and was hoping to straighten my hair (with other iron) then make larger waves with this. This does nothing but fry my hair. My hairdresser agrees- she would never use this on me.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t just work for me that&#x27;s why i returned it about four days after i received it. I really wanted the  big curls that&#x27;s why i got it, but because the curling  iron is big, and gets really hot, i could not get the curls i wanted. Hence, i ended up getting burnt. i guess it might be perfect for people with very long hair (mine is in neck). may be in the future i will buy a 1inch curling iron.</li>
            <li> Nice big curling iron, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for my daughter and she has to return it because it does not curl at ALL.  The only thing the product did was leave crimp marks where the clamp held the hair.  This was a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> OMG I love love love this curling iron! The 2&amp;#34; barrel seems huge at first, but it creates those lovely, covetable &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; waves - and can act as a straightener, in a pinch.  I keep it at about 350 degrees, which is only half its total heat capacity.  The stand doesn&#x27;t automatically move in place, though, so that&#x27;s a bit cumbersome. I just set it in my (dry) sink.  Definitely recommend getting some cleaner to go with it if you use a lot of hair product.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  Great to smooth out curls and frizz for curly hair. I have purchased these 2 inch barrels in past and the first thing to go is the spring. When the spring is broken the iron won&#x27;t grab and hold your hair in place. This one came with 2 extra springs and instructions on how to remove old and install new. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you want big curls then best curler I&#x27;ve ever used! heats up fast and curlers last all day! fast delivery and great item!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, and the Hot Tools 2 inch is the strongest curling iron to curl or straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd Hot Tools Ive gotten. First purchase was from Ulta store.  But on Amazon, the exact same item is even cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch out if you&#x27;re getting this delivered at home.  I get my packages delivered at work, and when it was sent, a signature was required.</li>
            <li> I have medium long, thick curly/wavy hair. I bought this for voluminous waves. That&#x27;s not what it works for (at least for my hair). However, it&#x27;s awesome. I dry my hair normally, apply heat protectant, then I use it to straight my hair. Just curl each section normally, pin it and spray. When it all cools off, let it down. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron, adds body and just a bit of curl on ends. All and more than I hoped for!!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!!.. really makes hair soft and a tad of a curl on ends....</li>
            <li> Average, doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an auto off button. Also the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; gets pretty warm so moving the stand out of the way once it is heated is tricky. This curling iron is better suited to professionals, who keep it heated and who have metal holders and aren&#x27;t relying on the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW I PUT 3 STARS BECAUSE THIS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMEONE ELSE BUT NOT ME IT GETS VERY HOT BUT DO NOT CURL MY HAIR AT ALL I HAVE BRA LENGTH HAIR</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize - the bigger the barrel, the more your curls fall out.  My hair curls fairly easily - so the fact that it won&#x27;t with this make me sad.  Looks cool in theory - but in use, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this 2 inch does not really curl or even wave long hair... it just gives it a nice polished look that is curled in at the ends.</li>
            <li> as a professional i have used this every tool every week now for a year and its still working well. i like the adjustable temperature and it heats up quickly within a couppla minutes, i would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;it should come with a marcel handle, as the spring clip and rubber top is for amateurs.</li>
            <li> If the 2&amp;#34; curling iron is meant to just give your hair some volume then this curling does its job.  It won&#x27;t really curl your hair in a traditional sense.  The barrel being 2&amp;#34; helps to efficiently curl all my hair in a short time.  I have long hair half way down my back.  The good thing about this iron is that it does tame all my frizzy hair and makes it shiny.  I would have been happy with having just slight curls and some volume except it wasn&#x27;t long before my hair straightened out again.  It&#x27;s disappointing because compared to the Hot Tools 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron (that I also own) the 1 1/2&amp;#34;  does a great job curling and it lasts even a couple of days.  Unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to return the 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, works great, curls my very long, thick hair in a short time. Heats up quickly and has worked great!</li>
            <li> Very awkward to use. . . easy to burn self.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a gift so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s the right one. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  Most curling irons would leave my hair either flat or too tight of a curl.  I read the reviews and the directions and started off on a low setting and worked my way up to a medium setting.  I love the big curls that it gives my because after I fluff it, it turns to body.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my hair when I use this. My hair is just below my shoulders and is naturally curly. Using this iron doesn&#x27;t curl my hair, but smooths it, adds even volume from root to end. My hair not holding the curl is not this irons fault. My hair never does unless I do pin curls. Upon moving to TX my hair has been even more disagreeable and this iron fights those battles for me.</li>
            <li> I have curly and coarse long hair. I use this iron for when I want big volume and waves. I lost my first one so had to get a new one. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I dropped mine and broke handle and ordered another. I&#x27;m not complaining as&lt;br /&gt;1.this worked great&lt;br /&gt;2 price savvy.&lt;br /&gt;3 This is my favorite styler.&lt;br /&gt;4 I have long hair and it heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;5. does a great job as size so large.&lt;br /&gt;6.My hair looks professionally styled after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;7. Something I can&#x27;t seem to do with any other hot curler.</li>
            <li> Makes large curls, gets very hot.  As curls fall out leaves hair nice and full.  No problems with spring yet but do not use it every day.</li>
            <li> my wife like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  I have long  thick course hair. This curling iron stays hot and doesn&#x27;t fry up my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Well, I have natural wavy hair, and it&#x27;s thick and long.  I typically wear it naturally curly or flat iron it, but I had really been wanting a big curling iron to style it for nice events.  I used this before a big day and got so many compliments.  My favorite thing about this curling iron is the plastic tip -- you can actually put your fingers into it and hold the iron steady while you twist your hair around it.  So no more burning off your fingers!  SOOOOO worth it- and the price is excellent.  Gets super hot, but also adjustable.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have purchased this line many times in the past and have always been satisfied. The adjustable heating control makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and has a smooth cord that doesn&#x27;t get tangled. The size of this tool is only good if you have long hair or if you just want a flip at your ends.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron after reading the great reviews people had left. It looks nice but really not even worth the 30 something that is sold for. After heating, it starts to smell funny and this is on medium high temp. I have thick straight hair and this iron made a fizzy mess out of it. I returned it immediately. If you need a curling iron please save some money and get a good brand.  your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> CAUTION:  This Hot Tools Supertool 2&amp;#34; Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control is downright DANGEROUS.  Even at the lowest setting, the unit quickly gets so hot that merely touching the handle can cause burns.  I discovered this fact with firsthand (!) experience, so back it goes to the seller.  &#x27;Nough said.</li>
            <li> I love this iron! It mimics the salon blowout with out the effort! the gold plating keeps the frizzies at bay.</li>
            <li> It makes very loose curls - I guess I was looking more for 1.5&amp;#34; than 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you want big loose waves or just a slight bend this is for you! The length and thickness of your hair as well as the technique you use will determine the type of curl/wave that results. I liked this product as it has a variety of temperatures and seems to heat evenly; I had been using a 1&amp;#34;inch barrel on my long hair and the results were a little too curly for my liking. I personally do not use the clamp; rather wrap the hair around the barrel like a wand; I will probably unscrew the clamp altogether as it just gets in my way.  Since the barrel is so large it is a little clunky/awkward to use at first but for me it is well worth the results! Lastly, as with most curling iron&#x27;s barrel, long hair would benefit from a longer length barrel to more effectively curl the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron! It gives me nice volume that holds through out the day.. Very pleased, well worth the money&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, and for the price, can&#x27;t complain too much.  It is very heavy, and it&#x27;s not so much the weight as that it is lopsided and being very heavy on one end makes it awkward to hold and use.  I bought this to replace a very old 2 inch barrel that I used to straighten my hair.  I&#x27;ll need to play around with the heat settings more, but is seems to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; in my hair and I don&#x27;t get that smooth easy action that I need to straighten my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to a flat iron.  I have long thick hair and this tool helps to smooth out my hair and give it a little flip in just minutes.</li>
            <li> I have the 1 and 1/2&amp;#34; and thought it was great, but my stylist used this one when he styled my hair and I was amazed!  I instantly ordered it when I got home.  I am very happy.  The only downside is that I do not feel that the spring holds as tight as the smaller one.  I will have to look at that and see if I can adjust it.  Otherwise...This is great for big curls or to straighten and take out frizz. I love Hot Tools Appliances!!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very high quality - definitely worth the money!  It has an extra long cord (probably because it is often used professionally in salons,) and it has lots of heat settings so it can be customized for all hair types.  It has really made a difference in my hair&#x27;s texture (smoother) and appearance (shinier, more styled.)  Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this product bc of the big roller part. I heats up fairly quickly. for someone looking for big curl this will do.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this curling iron EXCEPT for the cord - why can&#x27;t these appliance manufactuers use a non-tangling cord???  It is extremely annoying to constantly be untangling it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 2&amp;#34; curling iron since I have super long hair and wanted to get soft waves. This is such a great curling iron, I can divide my hair into 4 large sections and this has the ability to semi-straighten and get rid of frizzies while providing nice waves at the ends of my hair. I love this! It&#x27;s my go-to tool for when I&#x27;m running late and need a polished look for my super-long hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers said this indeed gets very HOT so people with fine hair should pay close attention to the temp!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and gets super hot just as I expected.  Hot Tools Products have never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Heats fast.  Extra long cord makes it easy to use, you don&#x27;t feel tethered to the electrical outlet.  Makes styling easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Worked great, but for less than 1 year :(  I was very disappointed this product did not last quite 1 year before malfunctioning.  It was not misused or damaged, but stopped working for some reason.  I will not order this brand again, and cannot recommend it highly based on my experience.</li>
            <li> Nice and hot and holds hair very well. But this barrel is a bit too large. I have long, layered hair and this doesn&#x27;t really curl it - it&#x27;s more of a smoother that adds a little bit of wave.</li>
            <li> Great, great iron, Totally worth it. I use to quickly curl my hair, maybe separated into 8-10 sections (I have thin hair). What this does for me is give me a really nice volume. it takes me 15 minutes and makes my hair look especially nicer all day, VS putting some product in it, blow drying and going. So, signfigantly nicer. :) That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the cord is super long and its great. 5 STARZ!</li>
            <li> the product is okay, however the curls drop quite quickly and the different heat setting do not seem to have that much of an effect upon the curl or its durability</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its fine but my wife wanted a smaller one.</li>
            <li> Gets way too hot.  Even the lowest setting was too hot</li>
            <li> Gift for daughter, she loves it</li>
            <li> Great for loose wave on long hair or subtle bend on medium length hair..&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly for efficient styling.</li>
            <li> Iron heats up very quickly.  I have long straight hair and I use this iron to create soft curls.  Wish it had an automatic shut off in case I leave it on too long.  Otherwise, I have no problem with this iron.</li>
            <li> I love them and they work just fine. I had a pair but they dropped and broke a few years ago,just happy I was able to replace them. Now it&#x27;s time to break them in and put a few miles on them! Will always be my go to for body and bounce for my hair.</li>
            <li> The first few uses , I wanted to send it back because it wasn&#x27;t even getting hot. But after a while I got it to work and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a timer but it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair easily like my conair on but I do love the size</li>
            <li> I have other hot tools curling irons from this line in different sizes, and they are the best. They get really hot really quick and the curls don&#x27;t fall out. When using other irons it takes forever to curl my hair, I can do all my hair in &amp;#60;10 minutes (and I have super thick hair!).&lt;br /&gt;I got a great price from this vendor, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great Super Tool! ! Absolutely love it and i can&#x27;t say enough about it.  This is my new favorite curling iron thus far. Thank you Amazon! !</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Does nice soft, loose curls. Get&#x27;s really hot on highest setting!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Uses it for every wedding we have</li>
            <li> My old model (Revlon, no longer made) lasted over 10 years and had a cover that also was useful as a stand to store upright on the counter when not in use.  I miss that cover, however, so far so good on performance.</li>
            <li> I am thinking this is more like 3 inches! It is HUGE. Not loving it but am trying to adjust heat and work with it a little bit more. Definitely not as easy as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron.  It gets hot very quickly and it makes very lose wavy hair, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased 3 of these and once again the spring is broke.  I love the size and the heat but something needs to be done about the spring.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for!!</li>
            <li> After only 6 months of minimal use the curling iron no longer works!  Very disappointed.  You should order through a salon or your beautician and get a professional model.  Poor quality and absolutely does not last even a year.</li>
            <li> Loved this but 2inches is just too big. Wish there was a 1.75 inch!</li>
            <li> Does not work! Don&#x27;t get this product unless your hair is thicker than honey. Seriously, this product is a east of money an</li>
            <li> Classy hollywood curls, here I come!</li>
            <li> Returned. Way too big to manage. Recommend Remington Keratin Therapy wand instead - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because Jilbere doesn&#x27;t make my favorite anymore. The Jilbere was like a flat iron but for curling hair, it had heating plates on both sides. I could curl my thick, long hair in ten minutes! I am not aure why that kind of curling iron isn&#x27;t made anymore so i went with the best option I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron heats up lightning fast. But i do think this will work for those who want more of a wave, it will not give you tight curls. My hair is naturally straight. This iron gives my hair more of a smooth, shiny, finished look. It curls my hair at the ends and I do like the sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I am reluctant to crank the heat all the way up. I have it at about 3/4s of the way up. The swivel cord is great and I love the thin handle because my hands are fairly small. I also appreciate the tip of the iron which does not get hot and helps with the process.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling iron for the price.  Adjustable temps can keep from frying the more fragile hair.  The handle / stand ratio to the size of the barrel is good (doesn&#x27;t feel clunky or have issues staying up on stand).  I enjoy the 2&amp;#34; barrel because it give a slight wave and curled end that flat iron wouldn&#x27;t - and that a smaller curling iron would overdo.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers. My hair hasn&#x27;t damaged since I switched. they also started including extras of the little spring which wears over time. Good on them. My old one broke though.. I&#x27;m sad but its probably because of how I twist the cord up, which is my fault; I know better. Treat your curler good.. these will last you awhile if you do. I have curly hair and literally straighten it up a bit with these, though never completely; I turn it into a loose curl thats mostly straight. The larger barrel is perfect for my longer hair. I use it at the lowest heat, even, which is crazy.</li>
            <li> Curling iron works very well to give my hair a slight lift and fullness. Makes hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to find a curling iron that was at least 2&amp;#34;.  This is a nice product.  I have thin hair, however, the curling iron does not slip through my hair, it leaves a soft, loose, semi curl.</li>
            <li> Came on time, and packaged well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a 2&amp;#34; curling iron. Gets real hot fast and saves time getting ready!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. My daughter likes it but it seems the springs wear out quick.  2nd one we have bought.</li>
            <li> My wife burned up her 2 inch barrel curler and couldn&#x27;t find another one locally.  This one works great and came with some spare springs for the clip should they wear out.  So be careful when you unpack it that you don&#x27;t accidentally toss the spare springs because they are imbedded in the packaging and are easy to overlook.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to people who have long hair and wants natural wave. I have 1 1/2 in curling iron but I wanted to have more natural and big curl and this was perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> good iron for the price</li>
            <li> I was debating between the 1 1/2 inch and the 2 inch. After much deliberation, I ultimately decided on this one. Note: THIS IS NOT FOR FULL-ON CURLING YOUR HAIR. It is for creating large, classy (IMO) waves. I have hair that isn&#x27;t that hard to curl, but with this, the curls came out faster than normal. They&#x27;ll usually start to wave after 30 minutes. I used a lot of hair spray, but they still started to unravel. When you first curl your hair with this, yes, for the first five minutes, you&#x27;ll have fun, bouncy 2 inch curls. However, they probably won&#x27;t stay like that for very long. So, if you want larger \\&quot;curls,\\&quot; get a 1 1/2 inch. If you want beautiful waves/some texture to your hair, then buy this curling iron. I absolutely am in love with it. The grip isn&#x27;t too tight around the hair, and I can still pull strands through very smoothly without touching the spring. This is definitely a brand I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Heavy is an understatement for this curling iron. I ordered the 1&amp;#34; and really liked it, so I ordered the 2&amp;#34; for lift and body without tight curls. It was impossible to get this curling iron out of the box without destroying the box, so returning it was not an option. I&#x27;ve owned lots of curling irons, but I have NEVER owned one that was as heavy as this one. I didn&#x27;t even try to use it because of its weight. Honestly, I was afraid my arm would give out before I left the hair wrapped around the barrel long enough to get the body and lift I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the barrel is too large. But of the little time that I used it, it worked well.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to hold a curl</li>
            <li> Excellent item, highly satisfied, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> i love this. so perfect. it heats up quickly and my hair don&#x27;t get stuck around the barrel. its very sturdy and i expect it to hold up for a long time. price on amazon was much nicer than Sally&#x27;s. i&#x27;ve dropped it twice but it&#x27;s still working nicely.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had when I first received - every time my right hand was working the curling iron, I turned it off. So, I taped the button &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34;. Works wonderfully otherwise!</li>
            <li> When my BedHead curling iron I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years finally died on me, I went searching for a new one. I had been using and iron with a 1.5 inch barrel, mostly for curling the ends of my hair in. I have thick hair, that I tend to let get very long before finally cutting it. I&#x27;m usually looking to just curl the hair under for a finished look and to add volume, rather than using an iron to make actual curls in my hair. I ordered this 2 inch barrel Hot Tools iron to see how it would work for how I style my hair, and I found I really like it. It gives my hair the look of sweeping inward, without a stark contrast to the top part of my hair that the iron isn&#x27;t curling. I love how much volume I get when using this iron on all my hairs layers separately, and I especially like how it works to give my hair direction, more than curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord doesn&#x27;t tangle and the temperature controls are small and out of the way. I appreciate that Hot Tools has constructed this iron by separately screwing in thumb clamp, and not just using the little metal stand to hold it in. I&#x27;h had irons in the past, where the little metal stand you use to prop up the iron is actually what holds the thumb clamp to the iron itself. So if something happens and the little stand gets knocked off, the whole iron falls apart. Not so with this Hot Tools curling iron. The metal stand is attached to the thumb clamp, but there are separate screws in it that actually hold the whole iron together. So that means even if the metal stand that holds the iron up from burning your bathroom sink was to come off, the iron will still work and stay together. And actually, it&#x27;s easy to take the stand off and put it back on if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about this is even with the setting on the highest, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it it&#x27;s getting quite as hot as other irons I&#x27;ve used. So while I find it works great on freshly washed and dried hair, if I take my shower the night before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out as well. The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair. If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!ight before and try and style my hair with it the next morning instead, my hair doesn&#x27;t come out as well. The iron doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to smooth out the results of bed-head hair. If it would just get a little hotter, it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this curler. I&#x27;ve gone thru about three of them in the past 9 years, if you take care of it, it&#x27;ll last you a while. The only reason I had to replace my last one which had lasted about 4 years was because I dropped it and broke the handle off. Other than that the curler part is fantastic. You can adjust the settings to different heat levels but since I have fine hair I usually leave it on the lower temperatures. The 2&amp;#34; barrel is perfect for long hair. Depending on how you use it it&#x27;ll make your hair have a loose wave or look like you blow dried it. Definitely recommend this brand and product, it&#x27;s well worth the price (which is still cheaper than Target or Walmart).</li>
            <li> It was too fat, and I didn&#x27;t care for it.  I thought I would like the 2&amp;#34; curl, but I went back to using my 1.5&amp;#34; or my flat iron to get a large curl.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! It creates a nice fullness to my hair, which generally has no volume, whatsoever (Asian hair). If you learn how to tease your hair just-so, couple that with this enormous curling iron and you&#x27;ve got yourself a sleek, curved style. You can easily create a straight style that has roundness to it, if that makes any sense. The temp controls are great, so if you have weak hair, it won&#x27;t melt or burn your hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I am looking for. I have long Straight hair and this tool is big enough to make the curls look natural. Recommend this  for girls who want a natural look.</li>
            <li> great to give hair texture and waves.</li>
            <li> came in a huge box nicley packaged so it wouldnt break on its journey to my house. it didnt work well on my hair tho idk maybe im doing it wrong</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this four and not five stars is that I bought the wrong size. I bought the 2&amp;#34;, hoping that it would have been smaller, but I misjudged it and realised it was too big!!! It is still in the box, untouched, with the packaging still intact. Based on the reviews, I know it&#x27;s a good curling iron but I didn&#x27;t use it because it is too big :( Is there anyone out there who wants to purchase this? Please see photo attached. I can be contacted via my e-mail at kim_deza@hotmail.com. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My only problem is weight, is heavy and a little hard to handle</li>
            <li> I have wavy-curly fine hair that frizzes easily. Didn&#x27;t think I could use a curling iron on my type of hair, but my fabulous new hair stylist recommended a wide barrel curling iron to help create smoothness and movement. She specifically showed me the one she uses--Hot Tools.  It works! People have noticed and complimented me!  I have thrown out my flat iron --which are bad and fry your hair anyway!&lt;br /&gt;Yaye!</li>
            <li> This item rusted after 2 months, it looks 10yrs old. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I officially retired my straightener after purchasing this. Leaves hair looking nice and styled so you can avoid that slicked down to the side of your head look straighteners can give you. All my curling irons are Hot Tools, I love the brand.</li>
            <li> This does the trick for me. I have wavy hair, so this helps smooth out the waves and gives a smooth look with lots of body. It&#x27;s a must for me hair type.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works perfectly</li>
            <li> This 2&amp;#34; curling iron is great! My hair looks like I just had it done in a salon with a full, but soft, gentle curl. It is perfect for my short in the back, longer on the sides haircut!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Curling iron gets good and hot.  Love the multi-heat control. The barrell is the exact size that I was after.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Although the curling iron was bigger than i thought, it&#x27;s worked out for me.  I have long hair and it gives just enough body and wave.  Because of its size, it doesn&#x27;t curl unless (I would imagine) if you had really long hair.</li>
            <li> This curling tools is so big I had to give it away . You have to have super long hair for this size</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curly. DON&#x27;T buy this item.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and I thought the 2\\&quot; would make big curls and since its a good brand work really great like at the salon but didn&#x27;t at all. My hair holds curls really well and they didn&#x27;t hd at all</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great. It has adjustable heat settings. I have long straight, layered, fine but fairly thick blonde hair. I did not want curls but just body and this works perfectly for me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the on indicator light is on the side, (not visible), I left it on and it does not have an auto shut off feature. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item is heavier than I expected, doesn&#x27;t really curl the hair but it does give volume and body. Thank you</li>
            <li> Ooops what was I thinking ordering a 2 inch curling iron.  After my last hair cut, mine is too short.  You need really, really long hair for this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curing iron as I have long hair (down to mid-back, not super thick, easily holds curls) and have been looking for a larger diameter barrel to create soft waves. I have a 1 inch barrel curling rod that I have been using for years which gives great curls and was looking for the larger softer curls that a larger barrel could offer. I also have a Hot Tools 1 inch curling iron which I have been very pleased with for a couple years now. For some reason, this curling iron does not seem to get as hot, as I don&#x27;t really get the large barrel curl that I&#x27;m looking for, if anything, it will just kind of give a soft curl to the ENDS of my hair without anything higher up along my hair. I&#x27;ve tried using very small pieces of hair to curl and still end up with the same softly curled end, which is great if that was the look I was going for. Not sure if I should have gone with a smaller barrel (maybe 1.5 inch?) as this may just be a bit too large (is that possible?) Either way, I love this brand, and will keep the iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly. I ordered the 2&amp;#34; barrel and wish I had bought the 1 1/2 &amp;#34;. You can adjust the temperature to you liking. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I finally graduated from a 1 1/2 in to this 2 inch. and I&#x27;m very satisfied... thus far. I&#x27;ve had this for a couple weeks already and I have alot of hair and long. I have to style my hair as soon as Im done washing it, otherwise it will frizz, curl and be wavy and it&#x27;s not pretty as I have &amp;#34;sponge like hair&amp;#34; (what my stylist has said). As soon as I wash  and dry my hair (i also put biosilk wich helps calm my hair) I section my hair and put the heat setting all the way to maximum and it does get hot very fast! I take a section and do not keep it around my hair for longer than 5 seconds before I see steam. It comes out relaxed and soft! Wish I could put a before and after pic, it truely does work very well. I have used Conair many, many years ago and will NEVER go back to that brand again... ever. Hot tools/ Helen of Troy is the best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for big, voluminous curls.  Instead if makes my hair very flat--like a flat iron would.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! I have purchased 3 of these curling irons in the past 2 years and they NEVER last more than 6 months. They&#x27;ve cornered the market due to not many other irons having a 2&amp;#34; barrel but I guess I will go for a smaller one. I will NEVER purchase a Hot Tools product again.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, dark hair....because of the sheer weight of my hair it&#x27;s always been difficult for it to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; a curl for very long. This is the best curling iron i&#x27;ve ever used. Gives my hair great body, provides a smooth curl and it lasts nearly all day. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does not curl. No matter how hot the setting.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this curling iron I  really was,  I am a hair tools hoarder and i do hair styling as well.&lt;br /&gt;so i had eyed this at my local sally&#x27;s beauty supply and well that it. I had to finally buy it and i ordered it on here.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with saying that i have blonde processed hair. so i don&#x27;t expect for my hair to get that awesome curl, however i was expecting this to add waved body to my hair. It did not. i had to hold over 30 seconds before it gave me a &amp;#34;swirl&amp;#34; i would be satisfied with. I tried this on one of my clients &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair if you will and same. I will keep it because i hate the hassle of exchanging but it will not be the first curling iron i reach for. Will serve as a back up.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18 year old daughter with long coarse hair. She absolutely loves it. The heat settings are perfect and it comes with 2 extra springs in case one on the curling iron breaks. A very professional product. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other hot tools curling irons and use them at least 3 days a week. I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons. Unfortunately the first time I turned this curling iron on to use it the gold started PEELING OFF! I didn&#x27;t even know that this was possible! I&#x27;m not really sure if the major chunks of metal showing through will damage my hair or not...but I&#x27;m just completely shocked that the gold peeled off. Maybe I just got a defective one...never had these problems with hot tools before.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this baby gets HOT!!!! I have long, thick, wavy hair. This curling iron does not &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my hair, but rather straightens it very nicely. I prefer this over a flat iron.  I don&#x27;t use it often, but when I do, I can straighten all of my long locks with 2-4 segments. Meaning, I can part all of my hair into three or four sections, use the curling iron for each section and hold for about 10-15 seconds. Voila! My wavy hair is straight in an instant with a little curl at the end for a finished look!</li>
            <li> omg i love this product i have had it over a year and it works like new</li>
            <li> This works great to do waves on a lower heat setting or makes gorgeous curls on higher head settings.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better curling iron!</li>
            <li> Too hot, burned my hair. Rusted after a year.</li>
            <li> I absolutely in love with this tool. I have always dreamt of having bouncing curls which only blow drying is able to deliver, however, I could never master the technique nor keep the curls all day long. This tool does it all, it does not create super curly strands, but soft, wavy ones, it also is able to make the curls last longer and feel bouncier for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This really doesn&#x27;t get that hot, and I was somewhat disappointed because I normally love this brand. It had almost no effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> This gift was for my daughter, how will be are next top model hair designer of the future. She really like the size of the curl it produces.</li>
            <li> I love this iron. I have short hair and it gives me the opportunity to wear my hair with more body and style. It gives lift and shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that reaches just below my shoulders.  I bought this iron hoping it would give me long loose curls.  It seems my hair is not quite long enough for that.  However, it does straighten my hair quickly and give it one stretced out S wave that allows for some body.  I prefer this to using a flat iron.  I think this would give you curls if your hair goes down past your bust.  It is a bit have and awkward to use at first, but I got used to it quickly and managed not to burn myself or drop it.  I am glad I purchased this iron.</li>
