            <li>Great product, keeps my hair looking fabulous.</li>
            <li>The package advises using one tube every 2-3 days, which I can&#x27;t imagine anyone keeping up, but this is a nice option as I am working on getting my hair into better condition.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, this keratin repair product makes your hair more manageable and softer.</li>
            <li>Make my hair softer and more managable.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>My hair felt softer, more manageable, easier to style and no tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That helps me use this more often.</li>
            <li>I was able to get three conditioning from one tube.</li>
            <li>but it did make my hair smooth!</li>
            <li>I find it is ok, just the perfume is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my dry hair!</li>
            <li>After 3 uses 3 days apart my hair is more manageable and smooth to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is not weighed down but it still come out smooth and beautiful!!</li>
            <li>and my hair stays shiny, silky and smooth</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s working so much, my hair looks even better than it did after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have only been using once a week, but will order more:)</li>
            <li>It really works as a advanced repair on the hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair extremely soft, very shiny (my greys were the color of mercury), and super easy to handle.</li>
            <li>i have processed hair that tends to get dry, especially right after coloring and in the summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and it definitely does what it claims to do for hair like mine (dry, color processed), but I wish it were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product line and it saved me from the dry damaged hair from dying all these years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products by John Frieda that have scents so strong they remain until the next washing - this was nothing like that.</li>
            <li>feels.definetely I would recommend this product very highly for any type of hair,..</li>
            <li>If you do not have problem with the intense smell then, I commend</li>
            <li>However, using this product really helped my hair shine</li>
            <li>I used my regular sulfate free shampoo and used this as conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think amazon pricing is reasonable.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I use the Pantene Pro-V collection of shampoo, conditioner and split end fuser (Advanced Keratin Repair Collection) which have proven very beneficial for my dry, split end frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have collar length hair and a full tube is definitely needed.</li>
            <li>I have waist long and full hair</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong but not a problem for me since I find the fragrance very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and sleek texture of the &amp;#34;ampoule&amp;#34; tubes are poorly designed for using in the shower when your hands are super slippery.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth after use, but the problem is, I don&#x27;t use it often, due to the price.</li>
            <li>It instantly gave me a migraine the first time I used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair gets so soft that I had to order another package,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these three times now because they leave my hair feeling so soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>So far it has stopped the breakage of hair.</li>
            <li>made my hair soft and managable</li>
            <li>For the first application I used the entire ampule(subsequent application I only needed 70%).</li>
            <li>This treatment left my coarse, dry 45-year old color-treated hair significantly softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Scents are major triggers for me.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair very soft and heals the dry over processing feeling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This treatment left my coarse, dry 45-year old color-treated hair significantly softer and shinier.  Unlike the earlier reviewer I used the entire ampule as directed- can&#x27;t imagine getting 3 uses out of one tube with just-past shoulder length hair.  The package advises using one tube every 2-3 days, which I can&#x27;t imagine anyone keeping up, but this is a nice option as I am working on getting my hair into better condition.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and color it!!  I also have a thyroid  condition so I am looking for something to help soften my hair!!  This product does the trick and the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> i have processed hair that tends to get dry, especially right after coloring and in the summer. One tube takes care of the dry ends instantly. I have collar length hair and a full tube is definitely needed. I was shocked to read the review that said strong odor. I&#x27;m hypersensitive to perfumes and odors and suffer from both severe asthma and migraines. Scents are major triggers for me. Yes, there is fragrance in this product but it&#x27;s very light. I had to sniff the tube to notice it. I&#x27;ve used products by John Frieda that have scents so strong they remain until the next washing - this was nothing like that.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extremely soft, very shiny (my greys were the color of mercury), and super easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I use the Pantene Pro-V collection of shampoo, conditioner and split end fuser (Advanced Keratin Repair Collection) which have proven very beneficial for my dry, split end frizz.  I tried the 60 second repair but did not find any additional benefits to the other products.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and I can see the results immediately.&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets so soft that I had to order another package,</li>
            <li> I find it is ok, just the perfume is a bit strong for me. If you do not have problem with the intense smell then, I commend</li>
            <li> My beautician said not to use this product because is weighs the hair down &amp; causes a dull looking build up. I only used it once. It felt nice! But not using it again.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this keratin repair product makes your hair more manageable and softer. I have thin long hair in which I tend to blow dry and/or curl more than I want to because of the heat damage you get from using these types of appliances. However, using this product really helped my hair shine and I didn&#x27;t have a need to trim my dry ends that I usually get with blow drying and curling. It&#x27;s been almost two months since I ran out of this product and I&#x27;m missing it! I&#x27;m subscribing so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having to continually order this. I&#x27;ve never subscribed to an Amazon product before, but this keratin repair product is a must! Plus, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these three times now because they leave my hair feeling so soft and luxurious. The smell is quite strong but not a problem for me since I find the fragrance very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape and sleek texture of the &amp;#34;ampoule&amp;#34; tubes are poorly designed for using in the shower when your hands are super slippery.</li>
            <li> It really works as a advanced repair on the hair. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Make my hair softer and more managable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product line and it saved me from the dry damaged hair from dying all these years. You will not be disappointed in the least. A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> This product does everything that the company says that it will, BUT it has a very STRONG perfume smell! I have even tried washing it out multiple times, and was not able too. It instantly gave me a migraine the first time I used. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell just a very STRONG perfume smell. I love the shampoo and conditioner, but am unable to use the treatment due to the odor.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps my hair looking fabulous.</li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my hair feel after using. I have only been using once a week, but will order more:)</li>
            <li> So far it has stopped the breakage of hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a little to soft so it wa hard th do anything with it but it would be great for someone with courser or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair very soft and heals the dry over processing feeling. I use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> If you have dry damaged hair buy these they help a lot!! I love them they leave your hair soft but without a heavy feeling!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it once a week and my hair stays shiny, silky and smooth</li>
            <li> After 3 uses 3 days apart my hair is more manageable and smooth to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have below shoulder thin color treated hair. I used my regular sulfate free shampoo and used this as conditioner. For the first application I used the entire ampule(subsequent application I only needed 70%). After 60 seconds I washed and styled by blow drying. My hair felt softer, more manageable, easier to style and no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight chemical smell after applying this product which wares off in few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other masks and smoothening treatments this takes only 60 seconds. That helps me use this more often. I am not sure why this has to be packaged in ampules though. I think amazon pricing is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like Pantene, but I was looking for a hot oil treatment and bought this by accident. Turns out it actually works! Works better than the expensive conditioner I use.    Update, a couple days later: I like this even better now! I have been using half a tube in the shower every other day (I only was my hair every other day) I love how it&#x27;s working so much, my hair looks even better than it did after the first use. I finally found something that saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that will help my dry ends. I have very thin hair with dry ends and oily roots, and iv tired all different things but nothing seemed to work. I used 1/2 tube on my ends (one tube was way to much and a waste with thin hair) and though it definitely helped smooth and soften my hair it felt weighed down after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now what i do, is mix 1/4th pantene repair and 3/4 normal conditioner and use it everyday! my hair is not weighed down but it still come out smooth and beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Did not see a big diference</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my dry hair! The fragrance is refreshing too!</li>
            <li> I have waist long and full hair and I had to use 4 of the 5 vials of Pantene 60 seconds therapy,beautifull shine so managable my hair feels.definetely I would recommend this product very highly for any type of hair,..defenitely I&#x27;ll keep the amazonprime with the Pantene collection,Love it!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth after use, but the problem is, I don&#x27;t use it often, due to the price. It&#x27;s a great product, and it definitely does what it claims to do for hair like mine (dry, color processed), but I wish it were a bit cheaper.</li>
