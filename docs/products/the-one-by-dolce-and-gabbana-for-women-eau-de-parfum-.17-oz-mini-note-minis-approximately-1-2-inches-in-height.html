            <li> smaller than what I expected!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1.6 ounce and a tiny little bottle for travel.</li>
            <li> One little spritz will do, so it lasts a long time, though.</li>

            <li> it¬¥s prety small for the price</li>
            <li> Are you kidding it is so small</li>
            <li> only downside is that with very expensive shipping the amount of perfume I received verses the cost was totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was shocked its smaller than my little</li>
            <li> Smells very subtle, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, with a hint of floral, with ever-so-slight undertones of sandalwood or musk?</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointment:(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> tiny ..nothing like pic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this perfume!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas.  It was perfectly priced-not $65 at Macy&#x27;s or elsewhere, arrived in plenty of time &amp; is exaclty what she wanted!  Yay!</li>
            <li> Is not what I want to</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! I&#x27;ve searched all over the Internet and in stores and the price is always the same. I would even accept a watered down version of it if I could find it. One little spritz will do, so it lasts a long time, though. I have the lotion and the perfume. I bought the 1.6 ounce and a tiny little bottle for travel. I often just use the lotion on my pressure points so that it lasts longer. Smells very subtle, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower, with a hint of floral, with ever-so-slight undertones of sandalwood or musk?</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, but it&#x27;s a good perfume. I would never buy a smaller size again. You&#x27;re better off buying the larger one.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all but I also got the rose one d&amp;g and that one smells great! I guess it just depends on what u like! I&#x27;m a happy Clinique kinda girl... LAMB... Aqua digio... Poppy coach.. :) versace Chrystal</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful bouquet of fragrances, yet very lite and feminine.  I tried it in a major department store last Christmas and fell in love with it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.com at a much more reasonable price...now I can afford the parfum, body lotion and bath gel.  I receive lots of compliments when I wear this parfum, everyone including some men want to know what fragrance it is.  I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. smaller than what I expected!</li>
            <li> The lid on the bottle was not secure.  It could easily fall off.  Love the porduct it just needs a different type of lid.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell I&#x27;m addicted great product fast shipping very light perfume not &#x27;in your face offensive&#x27; smell very unique I&#x27;d stay with it for a while</li>
            <li> Has a rich smell ,wonderful</li>
            <li> R u serious?????&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked its smaller than my little finger!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I want to return it now!!!! I dont want and dosent have any smelll water!!</li>

            <li> The perfume arrived very quickly order placed 11/16 received 11/21, I even got some sample perfumes and offers included with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that with very expensive shipping the amount of perfume I received verses the cost was totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, light and flowery not overpowering or heavy like some fragrances that are popular today.  Unique scent too.</li>
            <li> Its so small it was a gift the person I gave it to will have to use it sparingly I should have been warned that it was a teaspoonful of THE ONE and a sample.  It smells great just not big enough for the money hey $20.00 more bucks and I could have gotten a real one.</li>
