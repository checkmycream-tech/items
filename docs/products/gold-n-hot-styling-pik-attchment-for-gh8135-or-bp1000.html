    <ol>
            <li> great product love it best hair comb ever great blower dryer as well love it love it i will buy there product again</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one. The first replacement from the original broke, and I&#x27;m on my 2nd. I have very strong &amp; thick hair. I would not recommend this attachment if you wash, blow/straighten weekly. Works very well when it&#x27;s brand spankin&#x27; new, after about 5-6 uses, beware.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere for this replacement head! Sooo happy to have found it. It is holding up well along with the dryer!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to lock into dryer, otherwise comb works for me. Just be careful with placement of fork heads, could scratch scalp.</li>
            <li> This only fits this brand hair dryer. I thought is was a universal piece but i had to end up doing some magic trick to get the inner ring off and pry it open to fit on my helen of troy</li>
            <li> The attachment is okay its just the hard plastic with the sharp teeth I don&#x27;t like.  Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> I needed this replacement part and it did exactly what I needed it to. Good product. This is a great brand.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted ... perfect factory fit.  Renewed dryer</li>
            <li> I only needed it because my teeth on the pik where damaged from having super thick hair. just snap on and use.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with this item....</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these attachments at local beauty supply stores. I&#x27;m so happy I checked for it on Amazon before purchasing a new hair dryer! It fits perfectly and allows me to dry my hair fast! Good deal, fast shipping &amp; exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a attachment in any of the stores near me. I want to order another one. Its great.</li>
            <li> The makers needs 2 better plastic the heat  is to hot for that type of plastic 2 pieces have broken</li>
            <li> I purchased it to use on my revlon blow drying which didn&#x27;t come with a comb attachment. It worked but it also kept popping off because it doesn&#x27;t lock when put on. It just twist on which if you keep twisting it will come off then lock on over and over. It was flustrating I eventually took some tape and taped it on. Next time I wil invest in a blow dryer that already had the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Lucky and HAPPY to find the right attachment.  I wish I could have ordered more than one. Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t come close to fitting my hair dryer.  The sleeve was exactly the same size as the dryer barrel.</li>
            <li> I have been doing without my dryer for a while because of the abused attachment. I am so happy to be back in business with this dryer. I have others, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect attachment for my hair dryer.  It locks into place which makes it easy to handle while using.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Gold N Hot, so glad that I was able to find the Pik for my blow dryer</li>
            <li> I purchaed 2 of them 2 years ago and they were great.  They last me for a year and are cheaper than buying a dryer when the break.  I save so much by purchasing via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fits.  Works as expected.  I think the teeth should be made stronger though, that&#x27;s why 4 stars.  I don&#x27;t know that there is another option though.</li>
