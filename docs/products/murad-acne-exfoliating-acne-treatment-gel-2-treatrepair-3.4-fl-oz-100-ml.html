            <li>I use this along side of Tea Tree Oil love them both!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love!</li>
            <li>As someone who once suffered from acne issues, this product has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good oli-free face moisturizer over this.</li>
            <li>That said, this gel is effective at reducing acne flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>get acne mostly from stress</li>
            <li>I use the entire acne line from face wash to exfoliator to toner to moisturizer to spot acne treatment and it works together to keep my skin looking its best.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better care should be taken to packing the items.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use the Murad clarifying cleanser and love it.  </li>
            <li>you can afford it, treat yourself to a smooth exfoliator that works nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tried benzoyl peroxide based treatments but this has the best results on my skin overall.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product again for 6 months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My face has beome clearer and more radiant and I am very excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>and I could tell it was becoming embarrassing for her</li>
            <li>Great product, but don&#x27;t buy if you think your skin will clear up overnight.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference very quickly after i started using this.  </li>
            <li>This treatment is very mild but I can notice a change with the use in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I suppose $15 per month for clearer, softer skin is a good deal, but I am pretty bummed that I&#x27;ve found a good product that ended up being not as reasonable as it was at first.</li>
            <li>It keeps the fine lines and crepeness away from my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>She was showing fine lines around her mouth, forehead, eyes and neck.  </li>
            <li>This product is strong and works fantastic for breakouts.  </li>
            <li>She is on the third week now and is really happy now.  </li>
            <li>Been temporarily made available http://www.murad.com/exfoliate-acne/</li>
            <li>So far so good with their acne line of products.</li>
            <li>This is a nice non-irritating product though that goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Pimples and blackheads are flaking away and my pores are so clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Murad acne products before and they are good products.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel kind of tight, but most acne face creams will do that.</li>
            <li>Its more like a clear serum.</li>
            <li>I had used a lot of acne products (proactiv, clinique, Netrogena, etc) and by far this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>but if you have acne it is worth getting through this stage.</li>
            <li>I was uncertain, but the other reviews were really good.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and the service was fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>My face is definitely smoother (don&#x27;t really care about that so much, but my wife likes it), but more importantly, it&#x27;s clearer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this same product for many years and it never fails me.</li>
            <li>First, a caveat:</li>
            <li>love this, it keeps my acne under control better than anything else I have tried in the past, and believe me I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>this is better than actual skin doctor treatments.</li>
            <li>This time around, I broke out for the first 2 months</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how quickly it worked.  </li>
            <li>Salicylic acid helps fight bacterial acne, as well as certain immune system flare ups that produce acne blisters.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived and had leaked everywhere, though the bottle was not broken, so I kept it.  </li>
            <li>and with Murad, i&#x27;ve been doing that way too much because Murad works that well.</li>
            <li>Spent many hours and money with a dermatologist and tried every prescription acne medicine in the world.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been breaking out nearly as much.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey for what you might otherwise pay for salicylic acid but the reduced percentage of acid in the gel makes it gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen so much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Read seller reviews before buying to ensure you get the real thing</li>
            <li>Murad is better then proactive in my opinion, it works quickly to clear acne and prevents future breakouts...</li>
            <li>After the first few days, I started to break out more</li>
            <li>I was previously using this, but then I switched to peter thomas roth&#x27;s AHA/BHA exfoliating gel and it works better.</li>
            <li>I still break out as I&#x27;m getting older and wanted to try this product based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would say within 5 days all the pimples were drying up and were becoming dark.  </li>
            <li>regularly finally got my skin on the right track.  </li>
            <li>they were very large and red when she started.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>like with many other acne products, it can be drying, thus keeping a balance between fighting the acne and NOT overdrying the skin is crucial.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear......</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>Had adult acne and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff, I am on my second bottle now and it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne since I have 12 years old</li>
            <li>You can use it every day all over and as often as you want directly on a break out.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely see a huge change in my skin and would recommend this and the other Murad acne products to anyone dealing with acne, young or old.</li>
            <li>it takes the pimple out so dont be affraid if your pimple is bigger the first days it is just the beginning of the cure, functions on scars left by breakouts too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to using facial care products, so I haven&#x27;t got much frame of reference outside of shaving cream and razors.    </li>
            <li>But as soon as I started using it again, I started to clear back up.</li>
            <li>I dont know how necessary the facewash and moisturizer are, but the acne gel has kept my face clear for some months now.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing because it uses a chemical exfolitation, always removing the dead cells and junk that can clog your pores and make your skin look dull.</li>
            <li>According to her, this did not dry out her forehead at all.  </li>
            <li>Also if you do no regularly exfoliate after the first few uses you may experience some peeling and redness-</li>

            <li> Also if you do no regularly exfoliate after the first few uses you may experience some peeling and redness-</li>
            <li> Buyer beware:amazon and ebay are not auth resellers, products may be old, expired, or imitation.</li>
            <li> I got it (earlier than expected) and started using it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have any annoying scent.</li>
            <li> So you have clear skin and less wrinkles!</li>
            <li> My skin is quite oily so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out, in fact, it seems like it helps keep my skin from getting so oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it wont dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Within the end of the second week, her forehead was already clearing up and the dark bumps were now flattening.  </li>
            <li> less white heads also.</li>
            <li> When I was a little younger</li>
            <li> but I persevered for a few weeks, and now, several months later, I haven&#x27;t seen ANY pimples on my face for a while, except when I get too lazy to wash my face before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use the gel every evening and every other day.</li>
            <li> No more than 2 months later, her face was radiant, plump and moist looking.  </li>
            <li> It will keep breakouts at bay due to the 1% salycylic acid.</li>
            <li> the other one is tea tree oil from Body Shop.</li>
            <li> and I only get a small pimple once and awhile.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks were discouraging as breakouts continued, although my skin has never really been THAT bad, just a few breakouts here and there, but enough to keep me wearing makeup every day.</li>
            <li> Breakouts have seemed to cease all over my face, it has also helped with the dark spots previous acne has caused.</li>
            <li> it seems, so my breakouts are unpredictable ...</li>
            <li> Be prepared - if you have not used glycolic you may have a slight burning tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using this along with Murad Clarifying Toner and have noticed that my skin feels less oily and have only broken out once since using it which is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I was skeptical as I was afraid to clog up the pores, but apparently Moroccan and Indian women have been using the argan oil for centuries on their skin to fight aging and its healing properties.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and the wrinkles seem to be few in number according to friends.</li>
            <li> I told my daughter to give it a few months</li>
            <li> After a few days your skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> I had acne pretty bad and using this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> and I used the Acne Complex trial kit that this product comes in as well.</li>
            <li> Mom did not believe me until I forced her to use it.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin very oily &amp; broke me out real bad.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin worse</li>
            <li> Sorry the company isn&#x27;t making it anymore.</li>
            <li> Too Expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> She was shocked.  </li>
            <li> People are shocked when they learn my age.</li>
            <li> so I have a feeling it is being discontinued :(</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very disappointed that the price has gone up $10 since I purchased it 3 months ago.</li>

            <li> This is a great product! Keeps my skin clear......love Murad!  Have used it for years and will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day after murad acne face wash...&lt;br /&gt;I get acne mostly from stress it seems, so my breakouts are unpredictable ... this combats them every time they arise</li>
            <li> I use the entire acne line from face wash to exfoliator to toner to moisturizer to spot acne treatment and it works together to keep my skin looking its best.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for me. But I&#x27;m very disappointed that the price has gone up $10 since I purchased it 3 months ago. I suppose $15 per month for clearer, softer skin is a good deal, but I am pretty bummed that I&#x27;ve found a good product that ended up being not as reasonable as it was at first.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use the clarifying cleanser, this product, the perfecting lotion and the clay mask. My skin simply glows. I also drink a lot of water. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived and had leaked everywhere, though the bottle was not broken, so I kept it.  Better care should be taken to packing the items.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sorry the company isn&#x27;t making it anymore.</li>
            <li> Too Expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using this for a while to use another Murad product that would help fade my scars and pigmentation and my skin GREATLY protested! But as soon as I started using it again, I started to clear back up. My skin is quite oily so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out, in fact, it seems like it helps keep my skin from getting so oily throughout the day. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years now and I am a big fan.  It has very good control, non-drying, and you dont even feel it after it has been applied.</li>
            <li> Only face wash I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> The first few weeks were discouraging as breakouts continued, although my skin has never really been THAT bad, just a few breakouts here and there, but enough to keep me wearing makeup every day. but I persevered for a few weeks, and now, several months later, I haven&#x27;t seen ANY pimples on my face for a while, except when I get too lazy to wash my face before I go to bed. and with Murad, i&#x27;ve been doing that way too much because Murad works that well. I dont know how necessary the facewash and moisturizer are, but the acne gel has kept my face clear for some months now. I have naturally oily skin so I dont have problems with overdrying or irritation. I use the gel every evening and every other day. Murad has saved my life - and now the only time I wear makeup/foundation is when I go out - I don&#x27;t ever wear it to work anymore, which I would have never thought possible before I started using Murad! now if I could only find a product that reduces the blackheads / clogged pores on my nose!!</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product.  I&#x27;ve used it since 1997.  It keeps the fine lines and crepeness away from my face and neck.  I put it on from hairline to bra line.  I use it like a toner after I wash my face, twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Mom did not believe me until I forced her to use it.  She was shocked.  At that time, she was nearing 70.  She was showing fine lines around her mouth, forehead, eyes and neck.  No more than 2 months later, her face was radiant, plump and moist looking.  One bottle was all she used, almost 2 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I would give up the moisturizer before I give this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Murad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ss</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. Had adult acne and nothing worked. Spent many hours and money with a dermatologist and tried every prescription acne medicine in the world. This has cured me</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel kind of tight, but most acne face creams will do that. I feel is has improved the surface of my skin and had helped eliminate breakouts. Be sure to use a good oli-free face moisturizer over this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same product for many years and it never fails me. I am in my 60&#x27;s and the wrinkles seem to be few in number according to friends. I attribute that to this product recommended by my spa lady.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, I am on my second bottle now and it has really helped my skin. I haven&#x27;t been breaking out nearly as much.</li>
            <li> First, a caveat: I&#x27;m not used to using facial care products, so I haven&#x27;t got much frame of reference outside of shaving cream and razors.    That said, this gel is effective at reducing acne flare-ups.  It goes on pretty smoothly and doesn&#x27;t have any annoying scent. I used it with Murad&#x27;s facial toner and their moisturizer.  My face is definitely smoother (don&#x27;t really care about that so much, but my wife likes it), but more importantly, it&#x27;s clearer.</li>
            <li> My best acne gel at the moment, in reality Murad safe my confidence. I suffer from acne since I have 12 years old, now I&#x27;m 27 I&#x27;ve been using Murad since my 20.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years.  As someone who once suffered from acne issues, this product has been amazing.  I have found nothing that compares.</li>
            <li> Murad is better then proactive in my opinion, it works quickly to clear acne and prevents future breakouts...I use this along side of Tea Tree Oil love them both!</li>
            <li> Great product. Salicylic acid helps fight bacterial acne, as well as certain immune system flare ups that produce acne blisters.</li>
            <li> I use the Murad clarifying cleanser and love it.  I still break out as I&#x27;m getting older and wanted to try this product based on the reviews.  After the first few days, I started to break out more and it caused itching.  I did return this product and changed to Clinque.  So far so good with their acne line of products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey for what you might otherwise pay for salicylic acid but the reduced percentage of acid in the gel makes it gentle on the skin. You can use it every day all over and as often as you want directly on a break out. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin peel or cause it to turn red.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, treat yourself to a smooth exfoliator that works nicely. Dries up break outs and speeds skin turn over and healing.</li>
            <li> This product has improved the texture of my skin. I love it! If you have oily skin and clogged pores, consider using this product.</li>
            <li> love this, it keeps my acne under control better than anything else I have tried in the past, and believe me I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter.  I also bought the CeraVe foaming facial cleaner with it.  My daughter had A LOT of pimples on her forehead and I could tell it was becoming embarrassing for her so we tried Proactive.  This did not work so I Murad before going to the doctor.  I would say within 5 days all the pimples were drying up and were becoming dark.  Keep in mind they were very large and red when she started.  Within the end of the second week, her forehead was already clearing up and the dark bumps were now flattening.  She is on the third week now and is really happy now.  According to her, this did not dry out her forehead at all.  I could have saved my money on the moisturizer.  Great product, but don&#x27;t buy if you think your skin will clear up overnight.  I told my daughter to give it a few months and she is overwhelmed in just three weeks.</li>
            <li> it takes the pimple out so dont be affraid if your pimple is bigger the first days it is just the beginning of the cure, functions on scars left by breakouts too</li>
            <li> I was uncertain, but the other reviews were really good.  I got it (earlier than expected) and started using it.  It really does work.  Pimples and blackheads are flaking away and my pores are so clean.  I was really surprised at how quickly it worked.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing because it uses a chemical exfolitation, always removing the dead cells and junk that can clog your pores and make your skin look dull. Also it uses retinol which increases cellular turn over aiding in the prevention of wrinkles as well. So you have clear skin and less wrinkles! win win!!!</li>
            <li> My face has beome clearer and more radiant and I am very excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I have been using this along with Murad Clarifying Toner and have noticed that my skin feels less oily and have only broken out once since using it which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and the service was fast and easy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is better than actual skin doctor treatments. Absolutely love! Third purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve used it for 15+ years.  People are shocked when they learn my age.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles for me. I have tried benzoyl peroxide based treatments but this has the best results on my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Murad acne products before and they are good products.&lt;br /&gt;Just like with many other acne products, it can be drying, thus keeping a balance between fighting the acne and NOT overdrying the skin is crucial. For that reason, my girlfriend from India gave me a bottle of Vitaville Argan oil. First I was skeptical as I was afraid to clog up the pores, but apparently Moroccan and Indian women have been using the argan oil for centuries on their skin to fight aging and its healing properties.</li>
            <li> This came in a kit. Made my skin very oily &amp; broke me out real bad. The wash is gd tho. I substitute the gel w/ witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for the past 2 years and I have seen so much improvement in my skin. I know that sephora doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore so I have a feeling it is being discontinued :(</li>
            <li> Does a great job to help heal blemishes.  I noticed a difference very quickly after i started using this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, this is the refill, does wonders!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product again for 6 months now, and I love it. I can definitely see a huge change in my skin and would recommend this and the other Murad acne products to anyone dealing with acne, young or old.</li>
            <li> Im 35 and I used the Acne Complex trial kit that this product comes in as well. I seen results on my skin after 3 days and I love this gel. Its more like a clear serum. A little goes a long way. Rub it on after cleansing your face, twice daily. It will keep breakouts at bay due to the 1% salycylic acid. Wash your hands after or you&#x27;ll notice your palms peeling. Buyer beware:amazon and ebay are not auth resellers, products may be old, expired, or imitation. Read seller reviews before buying to ensure you get the real thing</li>
            <li> My skin: oily acne skin. This treatment is very mild but I can notice a change with the use in 2 weeks. less white heads also. it wont dry my skin. 4 star is because it takes time to see the effect. I had used a lot of acne products (proactiv, clinique, Netrogena, etc) and by far this is one of my favorite. the other one is tea tree oil from Body Shop.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know why they have stopped making it. Product was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Been temporarily made available http://www.murad.com/exfoliate-acne/</li>
            <li> Murad Acne Exfoliating acne treatment gel works great.  Murad Acne Exfoliating acne treatment gel. My wife use it all the time each AM. I like what it does for my wife.</li>
            <li> Breakouts have seemed to cease all over my face, it has also helped with the dark spots previous acne has caused.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne since the day I hit puberty. I have literally tried everything. I used Murad briefly when I was around 18 and it made my skin worse so I stopped. I wish I would have just stuck with it. This time around, I broke out for the first 2 months but I kept on using it every night. Now it&#x27;s been about 6 months and I only get a small pimple once and awhile. My skin has not looked this good since I was a child. I use it at night, just a  couple of pumps of it. The bottle lasts for about 5 months when used once a day. It costs $54 on Murad.com so this is a wonderful deal.</li>
            <li> This product is strong and works fantastic for breakouts.  Anytime I see a blemish start I use it and it is gone by the next day.  When I was a little younger I had acne pretty bad and using this product regularly finally got my skin on the right track.  Be prepared - if you have not used glycolic you may have a slight burning tingling sensation.  After a few days your skin gets used to it.  Also if you do no regularly exfoliate after the first few uses you may experience some peeling and redness- but if you have acne it is worth getting through this stage.</li>
            <li> I was previously using this, but then I switched to peter thomas roth&#x27;s AHA/BHA exfoliating gel and it works better. BHA (aka salycylic acid) exfoliates the inside of your pores and AHA (aka gycolic acid) exfoliates the surface of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could definitely tell a difference when I switched to the combination product because now the surface of my skin is being exfoliated in addition to the inside of my pores. My skin feels smoother and is clearer. This is a nice non-irritating product though that goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
