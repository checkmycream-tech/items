    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the appearance of my skin now, and the cellulite I do have appears to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>I feel that if I was heavier and not in the best shape that it would not be a solution or magic</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Just stay away from this product if you love your money!    </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer</li>
            <li>Nice lotion</li>
            <li>The lotion smells &amp; feels good, but trust me and not the company who occationally writes outstanding reviews using made-up names...</li>
            <li>I believe this product is a good thing to combine to a healthy routine.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer, but for this price, it doesn&#x27;t worth a try.</li>
            <li>Does give legs a better look.</li>
            <li>This item cost more than what was sold on a TV show where I saw it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better results with fat girl slim</li>
            <li>I would say more like a 30% reduction in results as opposed to what the advertising claims.</li>
            <li>With this product I enjoyed the beach without worrying about my thighs.</li>
            <li>you still have to eat healthy and exercise.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day is great but it only lasted two weeks from the day I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was excited about ordering the product.</li>
            <li>I am not overweight, I have just completed Insanity workout 60 days challenge, therefore I believe I am pretty fit.</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the $70.</li>
            <li>I am very excited and surprised to say how well this product works.</li>
            <li>I called the customer service of company and told them it is not working at all and asked them what is going on, they told me you may not see the results right away</li>
            <li>When I received the product I tried it right away exactly as they have recommended, I have waited for 9 minutes, nothing happened, 20 minutes still nothing happened, it is just a rip off.</li>
            <li>After receiving the bottle I used it and waited for 9 min and nothing happened there was no difference, so I decided to continue using it twice a day and did exactly what it said and it finished in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>First off, I followed the instructions</li>
            <li>Bought 3 tubes and used it exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I used on just one leg-  </li>
            <li>Adonia leg tone is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I had seen this product reviewed on the Doctors TV show and it certainly seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I used it mainly for the area between my bum and thighs...and BAM!</li>
            <li>I bought this product after seeing the ads and positive reviews, I was really excited that finally I could get rid of my cellulite in just 9minutes.</li>
            <li>I really got my hopes up and thought this would be a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Use a whole tube as instructed and then buy another for maintenence.</li>
            <li>When I started using this product, I really did see results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other cellulite creams and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>Well back to eating healthy and exercising which seems to be the only answer.  </li>
            <li>I will not order this particular product again plus it is</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make a huge difference if you&#x27;re obese or have a large amount of cellulite, but if you&#x27;re an average weight and want to tighten skin and dramatically reduce the appearance of cellulite, try it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the changes like I did on the Rachel Ray show with a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; but live and learn.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It was my first and last cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>Get out of the line and RUN FAR AWAY if you think that this product is going to work.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised  with the results.  </li>
            <li>Though I really like the item of exercise and cream helps the effects of the universal problem.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again at least it is better than the others.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money, but because it is so expensive won&#x27;t be able to purchase it as often as I like.</li>
            <li>I sent the bottle back half full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and get good results, however due to the high price of the product I did not continue hoping that improved results will not change, but I was wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews and was excited about ordering the product. After receiving the bottle I used it and waited for 9 min and nothing happened there was no difference, so I decided to continue using it twice a day and did exactly what it said and it finished in 2 weeks and I saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li> First off, I followed the instructions and I didn&#x27;t see any results in 9 minutes (I tried this 2 different times). I was a little disappointed, and wondered if this product would even work. Since I paid a lot for the product, I decided that I would at least use all of the bottle to see if it would work. I&#x27;ve been using the product everyday for about 3 weeks now, and I can say I definately see results! I&#x27;m really happy with the appearance of my skin now, and the cellulite I do have appears to be disappearing. I was considering if I should spend the extra money to buy another bottle, or just try a different product. Well, my husband noticed my legs, and asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing because they look a lot different. With that said, I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle of the Adonia LegTone! I would have given it 5 stars but as I stated before, I didn&#x27;t see any results after 9 minutes, and it did take a couple weeks before I could see any results. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing the ads and positive reviews, I was really excited that finally I could get rid of my cellulite in just 9minutes. When I received the product I tried it right away exactly as they have recommended, I have waited for 9 minutes, nothing happened, 20 minutes still nothing happened, it is just a rip off. I called the customer service of company and told them it is not working at all and asked them what is going on, they told me you may not see the results right away -even though they claim to see results in 9 minutes- and told me to keep using it, and I DID use it the way they recommend until 2 of my bottles is finished -I used it for 6 weeks total- and the results? Still no difference! Just stay away from this product if you love your money!    Cons- Does not work at all even after 6 weeks, expensive    Pros- Nice moisturizer</li>
            <li> Tried it religiously for over a week. Took before and after photos after every use. Never saw an any difference. As a matter of fact I would have to say that it looked slightly worst after.. don&#x27;t know why. But none the less it didn&#x27;t work. Well back to eating healthy and exercising which seems to be the only answer.  Good luck</li>
            <li> It was my first and last cellulite cream. I used it as directed for the 4 weeks and saw no changes or difference at all. It is a good moisturizer, but for this price, it doesn&#x27;t worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I really got my hopes up and thought this would be a miracle in a bottle. It however was not.I have been using this product for a month and seen very little- no results.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but I did not have the results some of the other Byers had.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Saw it on the Rachael Ray show. Bought 3 tubes and used it exactly as described.  Total waste of $210.</li>
            <li> I am very excited and surprised to say how well this product works. I&#x27;ve tried many other cellulite creams and this one beats them all. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Get out of the line and RUN FAR AWAY if you think that this product is going to work. I used half of the bottle and I&#x27;m furious at the company and at myself for falling for the HYPE that cellulite will vanish in 9 minutes. The lotion smells &amp; feels good, but trust me and not the company who occationally writes outstanding reviews using made-up names...It didn&#x27;t work!! I sent the bottle back half full. Just curious if I will ever see my money again/refund that the company promised.</li>
            <li> Does give legs a better look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype like I did. It hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me in several weeks, applying as directed. And what is this business of showing both legs – one has treatment and the other doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s no way to show before and after - it should be the same leg, people.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me....it was a waste of money. I used Nivea it worked way better than this.....and its cheap. :-(</li>
            <li> I am 52 years young and exercise daily- my thighs do have cellulite and I thought I would give this a try. The first time I tried it I used on just one leg-  I was shocked that I did see a difference in tone and texture, a small difference but I thought I was imagining things.  I put it on both legs at night before bed and again in the morning as per instructions. I SAW a difference!  I am so surprised  with the results.  I will stick to the regimen for 10 days and see what it truly does for me. I feel that if I was heavier and not in the best shape that it would not be a solution or magic lotion- but  -  for me I like it. If I continue to see the results in 10 days I will have no problem spending the money to give me some confidence !</li>
            <li> TWO  ADONIA ADONIA LEGTONE SERUM  MISSING IN THE BOX.AND  I PAY 3.  IN ROMANIA EVERYTHING  IS  POSSIBLE.THIS  IS  THE  TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;  TRIF  ADINA  ,22/07/2013</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. Mind you that it takes some time to see results , but you do see them!</li>
            <li> This item cost more than what was sold on a TV show where I saw it. It was $79.00. I was disappointed at the ten dollar increase in price. I am not sure how much the cream has helped. Though I really like the item of exercise and cream helps the effects of the universal problem.</li>
            <li> Helped a little bit did not live up to expectation . I&#x27;ve seen better results with fat girl slim</li>
            <li> I did not see any results</li>
            <li> I would say more like a 30% reduction in results as opposed to what the advertising claims. I would purchase again at least it is better than the others.</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the $70. I saw results within 2 weeks. I was going to the beach and wanted to take advantage of wearing short shorts. Being over 40 I had not done that in some time. With this product I enjoyed the beach without worrying about my thighs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the changes like I did on the Rachel Ray show with a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; but live and learn.  Things like this don&#x27;t work with creams but with hard work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see any different. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Use a whole tube as instructed and then buy another for maintenence.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, I really did see results. I&#x27;ve used this product for a month and get good results, however due to the high price of the product I did not continue hoping that improved results will not change, but I was wrong. Only after not using the product for 2 weeks, it reversed the situation back, and I drink 8+ glasses of water daily. It is not effective in long term, you have to keep using it and with this price range I doubt anyone would do it.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make a huge difference if you&#x27;re obese or have a large amount of cellulite, but if you&#x27;re an average weight and want to tighten skin and dramatically reduce the appearance of cellulite, try it! It didn&#x27;t even take 9 minutes for this stuff to make a difference in my skin tone and texture! I love this stuff...not crazy about the cost, but it is worth it if you&#x27;re not too heavy. I used it mainly for the area between my bum and thighs...and BAM! Gorgeous! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I had seen this product reviewed on the Doctors TV show and it certainly seemed to work. After the 1st use, I was hopeful because there did seem to be a little improvement, after that however, nothing changed. I will not order this particular product again plus it is&lt;br /&gt;a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Not what it promised!</li>
            <li> Thia product does not work in 9 minutes as described. Moreover, the bottle doesnt last a month as described neither, as you have to apply it twice in the AM and twice in the evening. I have used it for about 2 weeks and I am already at 3/4 of the bottle. I have seen some results, but I still have cellulite. I am not overweight, I have just completed Insanity workout 60 days challenge, therefore I believe I am pretty fit. I have 3 kids though so pregnancies have changed my body. I am not sure yet if this product works properly, I just want you to be aware that DOES NOT work in 9 minutes... you still have to eat healthy and exercise. I believe this product is a good thing to combine to a healthy routine.</li>
            <li> Does not even deserve a 1 star rating.... Worthless</li>
            <li> I got a different bottle, but it said it was the same thing. It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but it did work.  It made those &#x27; dimples&#x27; in my thighs less obvious.  I have not tried the other products</li>
            <li> Adonia leg tone is great, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Using it twice a day is great but it only lasted two weeks from the day I purchased it.  It is definitely worth the money, but because it is so expensive won&#x27;t be able to purchase it as often as I like.</li>
            <li> used two days no result yet as soon as I see result will write review. Shipping took long but not complaining yet!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Do not buy</li>
    </ol>
