            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use mine and what makes me really love it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t add too many beads tothe container</li>
            <li>I tried Micheal&#x27;s Arts &amp; Crafts store to create an attractive make up space, but nothing really did the job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says!!!</li>
            <li>Good quality too;)</li>

            <li>It goes perfectly with my other acrylic organizers.  </li>
            <li>Easy to move around, but won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful next to my acrylic drawer organizer.</li>
            <li>2-3 pounds was fine for this application, and the pearl beads cost about $4.00 per pound.</li>
            <li>acrylic holder arrived fast, clean, clear, and perfect.</li>
            <li>I have about 40 brushes and they all fit comfortably in here with some eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I bought this holder hoping to fit all of my cosmetic brushes (I have about 50).  </li>
            <li>I use mine for makeup brushes but would be great for different sized hair brushes as well.  </li>
            <li>Works and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is very cute and not too big for my bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>Good for holding daily brushes, eyeliners, and mascaras.</li>
            <li>The beads absolutely make this brush holder that much more functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good make up brush holder for a long time.  </li>
            <li>sleek and clean look, sturdy enough to hold hair brushes and hair blower fits neatly and nicely on my shelf</li>
            <li>/&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name - it can hold any thing and is a great fit on any small counter space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for organization!!!</li>
            <li>It really keeps my brushes available for use.  </li>
            <li>so far. :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This makeup brush holder is just  right size.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size for me and not too bulky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s footprint is small for all of the items that it holds and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Nice and large enough to hold  my make up brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great thick acrylic material.</li>
            <li>did not report it or ask to send it back, as I don&#x27;t want to pay more for shipping it than what I paid for the item itself.  </li>
            <li>Looks to be pretty durable acrylic too...</li>
            <li>This product is such a cute way to store all my brushes.</li>
            <li>took the advice of CeeCee (who gave a very helpful review of this item!) and purchased the 4mm glass pearl beads to go inside the compartments.</li>
            <li>So much easier than having to keep opening a drawer!</li>
            <li>Looks so pretty as it stores my makeup brushes, lip liners and eye liners.</li>
            <li>Looks good on my vanity, and holds quite a few brushes and tubes.</li>
            <li>It is made from very sturdy clear acrylic.(Not cheap)</li>
            <li>She was surprised that Amazon carries cool makeup accessories like this.</li>
            <li>....makes it look elegant next to all my other acrylic cosmetic holders &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My brushes stay separated and are easy to pull out and put back as opposed to leaning together.</li>
            <li>This holds all of my make up brushes+ in the large cylinder.  </li>
            <li>It holds my large face brushes, eye brushes, tweezers and even fits my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>But if they had a bigger size available I would get that instead.</li>
            <li>Too much stuff...</li>
            <li>The material didn&#x27;t hold my bracelets and for some reason was very lose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be so much  happier if it was twice the size, but still I can use...</li>
            <li>I purchased this to hold my assortment of art brushes in my studio,  I know its made more for makeup, but it holds a wide range of of sizes of brushes of an type.  </li>
            <li>Well not only do my cosmetic brushes fit, but all my lip liners, eye liners and lipsticks fit in the smaller holders.  </li>
            <li>Robert wants you to know he has no opinion when it comes to these cosmetic reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result of all that fiddling, I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>This makeup organizer holds all my makeup brushes, mascara, eyeliners etc and does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this because I needed something that was not large.</li>
            <li>I placed small smooth black rocks in the bottom of each space and it looks great.</li>
            <li>I nearly missed this when I first looked for counter-top storage for my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I filled each compartment with some of those tiny clear glass beads you&#x27;ve seen at Sephora in the cosmetic brush department.</li>
            <li>The compartment are wide and can fit a lot of tools.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that by adding the additional clear crystal, it will hide the crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also clear.</li>
            <li>Was going to add the clear acrylic beads as per &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34;, but found I did not need them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty to look at and although 2 of the cups are low in height, I am going to add the small smooth crystals to it, so that the brushes are held upright without all leaning to the sides.  </li>
            <li>My tweezerman hair and face scissors, nail pushy and cleaner, slant and pointed tweezers, big cup has gentle eye lash curler by bobbi brown, and Dior heated lash curler..</li>
            <li>This happens frequently when you store them in the drawer.</li>
            <li>I really like the three compartment sizes for different brushes.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and even though it might not look like it initially, it can hold a lot of things.</li>
            <li>I suggest a smooth, small, lightweight bead.  </li>
            <li>While I flipped through more I came back to this and said - if it sucks I can return it.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is very sturdy and thick worth the money</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough for it to require a cleaning, so I can&#x27;t tell you much about maintaining it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it has been incredibly useful.</li>
            <li>However, constantly shoving all those fat brushes into those skinny tubes and rolling the whole thing up got on my last little nerve.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also clear.</li>
            <li> Was going to add the clear acrylic beads as per &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34;, but found I did not need them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty to look at and although 2 of the cups are low in height, I am going to add the small smooth crystals to it, so that the brushes are held upright without all leaning to the sides.  </li>
            <li> My tweezerman hair and face scissors, nail pushy and cleaner, slant and pointed tweezers, big cup has gentle eye lash curler by bobbi brown, and Dior heated lash curler..</li>
            <li> This happens frequently when you store them in the drawer.</li>
            <li> I really like the three compartment sizes for different brushes.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and even though it might not look like it initially, it can hold a lot of things.</li>
            <li> I suggest a smooth, small, lightweight bead.  </li>
            <li> While I flipped through more I came back to this and said - if it sucks I can return it.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is very sturdy and thick worth the money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough for it to require a cleaning, so I can&#x27;t tell you much about maintaining it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has been incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> However, constantly shoving all those fat brushes into those skinny tubes and rolling the whole thing up got on my last little nerve.</li>
            <li> Beads that are too large or have jagged edges will make it harder to push the brush handles down and may even cause wear/tear on the brush handles over time.</li>
            <li> Really just too small..</li>
            <li> Rather thick, well made, sturdy, exactly what I was looking for for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought little clear beads to put in the bottom..then added my make up brushes</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> The two smaller front cylinders are different sizes and offset slightly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two of the 1-lb bags of beads and still have about half of one bag left.</li>
            <li> I eschewed it intitally due to the use of the word &#x27;makeup&#x27; and &#x27;cosmetics&#x27;</li>
            <li> This has to be the awesomest product it holds big, medium, and small brushes its just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Liquid foundation on a powder brush ruins my morning routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> or they will spill out when you push all the brushes down into the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After filling each of the compartments about halfway with beads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my largest powder brush, foundation brush, and blush brushes in the largest compartment with the bristles up and the handles sticking down in the glass beads (plenty of room to spare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wife loves this little device...</li>
            <li> My daughter has her brushes in here as well as her round cotton make-up remover pads.</li>
            <li> Added some small sparkly beads to add some color and bling.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if Amazon sells the beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put small stones in the bottom the help stabilize a lot of small brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have at least 60-80 brushes in my holder.  </li>
            <li> ..love this product..nice and thick..</li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to locate scattered tools, and I don&#x27;t want liquid/gel products transferring between brushes.</li>
            <li> got this acrylic holder for my expensive MAC makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> , I bought an expensive MAC brush roll for storage.</li>
            <li> I decided to leave one of the circle empty to put my dirty brushes in, so I don&#x27;t use filthy brushes</li>

            <li> Smaller than expected. Good for holding daily brushes, eyeliners, and mascaras. Sturdy. But if they had a bigger size available I would get that instead.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and sturdy container and I am very happy with it!  Only problem is I think I need another one!  lol  Too much stuff...</li>
            <li> It is so cute, and holds most of my makeup brushes, I really like it!!!</li>
            <li> The material didn&#x27;t hold my bracelets and for some reason was very lose.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s just perfect and exactly what you can expect. Great thick acrylic material.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item and think it is very beautiful, sold, strong and of excellent quality. I would have loved to give it a 5 as I believe if you get one that does not have a crack on the bottom like mine, you too will love it.  It&#x27;s pretty to look at and although 2 of the cups are low in height, I am going to add the small smooth crystals to it, so that the brushes are held upright without all leaning to the sides.  I am hoping that by adding the additional clear crystal, it will hide the crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not report it or ask to send it back, as I don&#x27;t want to pay more for shipping it than what I paid for the item itself.  I believe I will buy from them again. I think their products are quality and at this time of year, shipping is a gamble.</li>
            <li> This is very cute and not too big for my bathroom counter top. Looks to be pretty durable acrylic too...so far. :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice-looking, sturdy cosmetic holder.  Looks good on my vanity, and holds quite a few brushes and tubes.</li>
            <li> I nearly missed this when I first looked for counter-top storage for my bathroom.  I eschewed it intitally due to the use of the word &#x27;makeup&#x27; and &#x27;cosmetics&#x27; didn&#x27;t jive with my obvious manliness.  While I flipped through more I came back to this and said - if it sucks I can return it.  IT DOESN&#x27;T SUCK! It&#x27;s the perfect set of holes for the stuff I keep in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name - it can hold any thing and is a great fit on any small counter space in the bathroom. It&#x27;s also clear.</li>
            <li> Make this twice as big and I&#x27;ll take three please! Well, got it to hold brushes... Really just too small.. Largest cup was okay but that&#x27;s it... So therefore using it for all my tools. My tweezerman hair and face scissors, nail pushy and cleaner, slant and pointed tweezers, big cup has gentle eye lash curler by bobbi brown, and Dior heated lash curler.. Finding more tools too!! Fill it with beads or filler so they stand. I&#x27;d be so much  happier if it was twice the size, but still I can use... Great packaging and came on time..!! Good quality too;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and fits all of my brushes in two of the compartments and has room for more. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I bought it to store my make up brushes. They look great in this. I have 10-15 brushes in each cup and there&#x27;s still room for more. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I purchased three of these brush holders. I have a multitude of makeup brushes and they hold them all perfectly. I placed small smooth black rocks in the bottom of each space and it looks great. These holders are well crafted and not at all flimsy. I will purchase more if I happen to buy more makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> sleek and clean look, sturdy enough to hold hair brushes and hair blower fits neatly and nicely on my shelf</li>
            <li> Nice and large enough to hold  my make up brushes.  Added some small sparkly beads to add some color and bling.  Which also helped hold my brushes upright.</li>
            <li> The product is very very good, however , I saw it in Harmon yesterday and it was 9 dollors. I was heart broken!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is such a cute way to store all my brushes. I have about 40 brushes and they all fit comfortably in here with some eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Product just as described and look in the picture. Great product! The compartment are wide and can fit a lot of tools.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush holder is just  right size.  Also tall enough so the brushes don&#x27;t brushes don&#x27;t fall out. Great purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hold my assortment of art brushes in my studio,  I know its made more for makeup, but it holds a wide range of of sizes of brushes of an type.  Looks nice, functions great, good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Rather thick, well made, sturdy, exactly what I was looking for for my bathroom. I&#x27;ll be buying a second one as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!!! Great size and excellent weight.  I have at least 60-80 brushes in my holder.  It goes perfectly with my other acrylic organizers.  I highly recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking for organization!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this little device...I love the reduction in clutter on our twin sink bathroom setup, lmao.</li>
            <li> This item holds all my brushes and some of my lip glosses! it is big and deep enough so my brushes and lip glosses don&#x27;t fall out.  I also like the style and material....makes it look elegant next to all my other acrylic cosmetic holders &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Very solid construction</li>
            <li> I bought little clear beads to put in the bottom..then added my make up brushes..love this product..nice and thick..</li>
            <li> This holds all of my make up brushes+ in the large cylinder.  The two smaller front cylinders are different sizes and offset slightly.  It works nicely.  They hold a lot of stuff.  This has helped to organize my grooming items.  So glad I found this because I needed something that was not large.</li>
            <li> I love this holder. It&#x27;s footprint is small for all of the items that it holds and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to corral my makeup brushes and it works perfectly. I use it everyday and it has been incredibly useful.</li>
            <li> This holds my makeup brushes perfectly, and i also use one side for my tweezers and mascara. Very pretty design and is a perfect compliment to my vanity.</li>
            <li> I bought this holder hoping to fit all of my cosmetic brushes (I have about 50).  Well not only do my cosmetic brushes fit, but all my lip liners, eye liners and lipsticks fit in the smaller holders.  This is a great item to have to make more room in your vanity or bathroom area for anyone that wears makeup and it looks nice too!</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush holder! The acrylic is sturdy and looks attractive on my bathroom vanity. It holds my large face brushes, eye brushes, tweezers and even fits my eyelash curler. I love being able to keep my brushes organized and grouped together by use with the three compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of CeeCee (who gave a very helpful review of this item!) and purchased the 4mm glass pearl beads to go inside the compartments. The beads absolutely make this brush holder that much more functional. My brushes stay separated and are easy to pull out and put back as opposed to leaning together. This definitely keeps the bristles from losing shape. I purchased two of the 1-lb bags of beads and still have about half of one bag left.</li>
            <li> This has to be the awesomest product it holds big, medium, and small brushes its just what i was looking for. I love it :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup brush holder for awhile and was happy to find this! It&#x27;s perfect! Beautiful, elegant design that holds a ton of makeup brushes. Love how it looks alongside my makeup box on my vanity!</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER:  This is CeeCee, Robert&#x27;s wife. Robert wants you to know he has no opinion when it comes to these cosmetic reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this acrylic holder for my expensive MAC makeup brushes. I got tired of trying to locate scattered tools, and I don&#x27;t want liquid/gel products transferring between brushes. This happens frequently when you store them in the drawer. Liquid foundation on a powder brush ruins my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remedy this, I bought an expensive MAC brush roll for storage. However, constantly shoving all those fat brushes into those skinny tubes and rolling the whole thing up got on my last little nerve. As a result of all that fiddling, I didn&#x27;t use it much. With this acrylic brush holder, you can organize and segregate your brushes so they stay cleaner and are easier to identify and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic holder arrived fast, clean, clear, and perfect. I really like the three compartment sizes for different brushes. The holder is lightweight, but not flimsy. Easy to move around, but won&#x27;t tip over. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough for it to require a cleaning, so I can&#x27;t tell you much about maintaining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use mine and what makes me really love it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I filled each compartment with some of those tiny clear glass beads you&#x27;ve seen at Sephora in the cosmetic brush department. I bought the beads at a craft store online called save-on-crafts. They are actually called 4mm \\&quot;glass pearls\\&quot;. I think approx. 2-3 pounds was fine for this application, and the pearl beads cost about $4.00 per pound. They also sell colored beads and different sizes. I am not sure if Amazon sells the beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 4mm size of bead was perfect for holding the brush handles in place. Beads that are too large or have jagged edges will make it harder to push the brush handles down and may even cause wear/tear on the brush handles over time. I suggest a smooth, small, lightweight bead.  Don&#x27;t add too many beads tothe container or they will spill out when you push all the brushes down into the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After filling each of the compartments about halfway with beads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my largest powder brush, foundation brush, and blush brushes in the largest compartment with the bristles up and the handles sticking down in the glass beads (plenty of room to spare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my eye concealer brush and eye shaddow brushes in the second-largest compartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the smallest compartment for my covered lip brushes, tweezers, and folding lash/brow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy, and I haven&#x27;t searched for a tool since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps...&lt;br /&gt;CeeCee</li>
            <li> I use mine for makeup brushes but would be great for different sized hair brushes as well.  It really keeps my brushes available for use.  So much easier than having to keep opening a drawer!</li>
            <li> This makeup organizer holds all my makeup brushes, mascara, eyeliners etc and does not take up too much space. It is just the right size for me and not too bulky. My friend saw the organizer when she was over and she really liked it! She was surprised that Amazon carries cool makeup accessories like this.</li>
            <li> I use this hold a lot of different things and it&#x27;s so perfect. It is very sturdy and even though it might not look like it initially, it can hold a lot of things. I use this in addition to a set of drawers and it fits all my needs. Plus, it looks really nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent  product for holding makeup brushes and even makeup like lipglosses and mascara.  The plastic is very sturdy and thick worth the money</li>
            <li> My daughter has her brushes in here as well as her round cotton make-up remover pads.</li>
            <li> good quality ,pretty and does organize a lot of things&lt;br /&gt;come with really nice packaging and i loved it&lt;br /&gt;worth to buy!</li>
            <li> Looks so pretty as it stores my makeup brushes, lip liners and eye liners. Was going to add the clear acrylic beads as per &amp;#34;Sephora&amp;#34;, but found I did not need them. Brushes etc stay put.</li>
            <li> I put small stones in the bottom the help stabilize a lot of small brushes.  Works and looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good make up brush holder for a long time.  I tried Micheal&#x27;s Arts &amp; Crafts store to create an attractive make up space, but nothing really did the job.  I stumbled upon this on amazon and bought it. I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it hold all of my make up brushes (about 60), it gives an entire different look to my vanity. I decided to leave one of the circle empty to put my dirty brushes in, so I don&#x27;t use filthy brushes - it&#x27;s a nice way to keep them separated and a reminder that these brushes need to be washed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a holder that would hold my makeup brushes so I can easily see what I am looking for and this is working perfectly.  Also made sturdy enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and it was at my house on Monday! It is made from very sturdy clear acrylic.(Not cheap) Looks beautiful next to my acrylic drawer organizer. This is a must have for any makeup junky!</li>
            <li> loved it it&#x27;s perfect, would&#x27;ve perferred it to me a little taller but very nice</li>
