    <ol>
            <li>Bravo and a great price for 6 bottles!</li>
            <li>Excellent Soap for Garden use .  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the Ivory.</li>
            <li>Ivory liquid is especially kind to your hands and for those who wear contact lenses.  </li>
            <li>Ivory smells wonderful without leaving a perfumed smell and my skin does not break into blisters or rashes when I use it.</li>
            <li>I was so hoping the liquid would be as wonderful as the bar soap.</li>
            <li>Some salesperson must  have done a very good selling job on you Ivory people to get you to do a  &amp;#34;so called improvement&amp;#34; on a perfect product/  After multi years of using this,I&#x27;m considering pitching out my remaining bottles and looking for something a senior citizen can operate without help.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always loved it!  </li>
            <li>I am happy as could be with these plunger type hand soap bottles.</li>
            <li>Great product at great price.</li>
            <li>Great soap for people with allergies.</li>
            <li>Product is great.</li>
            <li>However, the soap is very nice.</li>
            <li>It is a good price too.</li>
            <li>Good soap.  </li>
            <li>but none are as good as Ivory.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty and the soap is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this - it cleans very well, and without leaving any scents or anything that sets off my friends skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li>What kind of chemical reaction is that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans thoroughly without the use of controversial anti-bacterial components.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance free liquid Ivory soap!  </li>
            <li>Ivory is a favorite of mine</li>
            <li>While one can get 45 oz here, one can get much more for a lower price by going here</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the service and the product from Amazon and Ivory.  </li>
            <li>My favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Easy, clean, convenient, and safe for septic tanks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find the hand soap in the stores when I can easily find the bar soap and the body wash.  </li>
            <li>Even more economical in refill bottles.</li>
            <li>Searched for a non-bacterial soap that is septic friendly.  </li>
            <li>Also loved the scenic pictures on the former bottles.  </li>
            <li>My family has used this mild soap on our skin for 50 years.  </li>
            <li>Then a friend came for a week, to help me out, and her skin sensitivity made me very aware of it.  </li>
            <li>But I notice the hint of some fragrance and that it isn&#x27;t exactly 100% free.</li>
            <li>The new pumps aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the old ones though</li>
            <li>It seems like a nice enough hand soap - but not &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;, as some people prefer.</li>
            <li>Smells great, was difficult to find soap that wasn&#x27;t the antibacterial kind.</li>
            <li>Thank the Lord for liquid Ivory hand soap --  a fragrance-free, mild, liquid hand soap that isn&#x27;t contributing to new strains of super resistant bacteria!     </li>
            <li>Please convey this to the manufacturer that the pump does not work as smoothly as the older version.  </li>
            <li>A perfect hand soap for everyone, but especially the elderly,  It now takes a hydraulic piece of machinery to press down on the pump.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like so many other soft-soaps, so we keep it in every bathroom.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is good as expected, but the dispensers just don&#x27;t seem to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Getting the spout in the right position to dispense a bit challenging, but not a major problem.</li>
            <li>People at work have some sensitivities, so I became aware of it.  </li>
            <li>Ivory Liquid Hand Soap is one of the few appropriate liquid hand soaps that are currently available.  </li>
            <li>My husband has fought cancer for a long time, and one of the side effects of many chemo treatments is a sensitivity to fragrances.</li>
            <li>You feel clean after using and no perfumes to bother folks like me that are sensitive to such strong smells.</li>
            <li>Had I known this I could just have bought the large refill.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it here and a six pack will last me for a little while.</li>
            <li>Using the pump now is a real challenge.  </li>
            <li>so know that I wouldn&#x27;t do too much bad-mouthing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many clear soap brands in my integrated soap dispenser next to my kitchen faucet.</li>
            <li>Still love the soap, but the new pump is so hard to use I have to have someone else with strong hands even to get it started,  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>me, the product has a fairly strong fragrance compared to other liquid hand soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The product description on Amazon&#x27;s web page doesn&#x27;t say much about what&#x27;s in Ivory Liquid Clear Hand Soap.</li>
            <li>I received the 2nd bottle from the right as depicted in the stock picture and another bottle with a boy riding a bike into town.  </li>
            <li>So happy to be healing from the damage done by other harsh soaps!</li>
            <li>New comments:  </li>
            <li>Still am surprised at how inexpensive it remains after all these years!</li>
            <li>Regular soap removes germs sufficiently for most purposes and antimicrobial soaps can unnecessarily sensitize skin leading to damage...thus negating their original intent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen counterfeit for even more mundane lesser items which have been discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>PLEASE, PLEASE at least give everyone a choice of new or lovely old scenic bottles of Ivory Liquid Hand Soapl  </li>
            <li>Use the liquid soap as natural insecticide.</li>
            <li>We really like the Ivory liquid hand soap but can no longer  find it in our local stores.</li>
            <li>and I had to save the ones from the old containers.</li>
            <li>Am putting the soap in my old bottles.</li>
            <li>Would love to know the reason for this ridiculous so-called &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I was already tired of having so many layers of scents - washing clothes, washing me.  </li>
            <li>However, the packaging has been changed to plain blue and white - not like the picture shows - and I don&#x27;t like the new packaging - not decorative!!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and which I previously purchased in the local grocery or box stores.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I wanted and which I previously purchased in the local grocery or box stores.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use at the kitchen sink and in the bathroom because my hands are so sensitive to ingredients in the other soaps.</li>
            <li> With the 6 pack I should have enough to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Like the soap, but not the plain bottle and the pump does work as well as the older ones.</li>
            <li> While there are detergents that are make for this, I was having a hard time finding a soap - especially the liquid hand soap I prefer for fast hand washing.  </li>
            <li> My hand don&#x27;t feel dry after multiple washes a day either.</li>
            <li> Everything else is too harsh for frequent hand cleaning needed in this germ infested world!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to contradict other customers, who may be accustomed to even stronger fragrances, may have a different sense of smell, or may have received a product with a different formulation.</li>
            <li> Plain old Ivory soap is used for cleaning CPAP machine parts.  </li>
            <li> On my earlier orders, about half worked.  </li>
            <li> Or at the very least put the old pumps back</li>
            <li> I refuse to use this due to additives.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brick-and-mortar store shelves are loaded with more toxic soaps and it is sometimes impossible to find liquid Ivory in stores, especially the refill bottles.  </li>
            <li> This review 100% reversed from my previous 5-star review.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few liquid soaps from the grocery/drugstore</li>
            <li> use for cleaning leather chairs and sofas, works well, and unable to find in stores near me.</li>
            <li> I quit using liquid hand soaps because they all have awful &#x27;anti-bacterial&#x27; ingredients which are contributing to the evolution and existence of new strains of super bacteria that are hard to kill.   </li>
            <li> RANCID smelly gory and Gross Green.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is another product that is hard to find in stores now; I am so grateful to Amazon for carrying it!  </li>
            <li> I was wrong--</li>
            <li> I used this soap for years and have found as of 2014 that this is now difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but I knew Amazon wouldn&#x27;t fail me.  </li>
            <li> Fail!</li>
            <li> Pumps STILL IMPOSSIBLE to operate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very simple and does what is it supposed to do. You feel clean after using and no perfumes to bother folks like me that are sensitive to such strong smells. Bravo and a great price for 6 bottles!</li>
            <li> I was already tired of having so many layers of scents - washing clothes, washing me.  People at work have some sensitivities, so I became aware of it.  Then a friend came for a week, to help me out, and her skin sensitivity made me very aware of it.  While there are detergents that are make for this, I was having a hard time finding a soap - especially the liquid hand soap I prefer for fast hand washing.  I searched in stores, and finally tried Amazon, and searched for my childhood friend, Ivory Soap.  I am very happy with this - it cleans very well, and without leaving any scents or anything that sets off my friends skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance free liquid Ivory soap!  It cleans thoroughly without the use of controversial anti-bacterial components.  I received the 2nd bottle from the right as depicted in the stock picture and another bottle with a boy riding a bike into town.  The bottles are pretty and the soap is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was trying to find a product without smell that would trigger my allergies/chemical sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not it.  It seemed tolerable until it mixed with water.  Oh my goodness, the resulting smell made me feel like I was going to vomit.  What kind of chemical reaction is that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave product away.</li>
            <li> Excellent Soap for Garden use .  Use to keep deer and insects away from Garden.  Use the liquid soap as natural insecticide.</li>
            <li> Thank the Lord for liquid Ivory hand soap --  a fragrance-free, mild, liquid hand soap that isn&#x27;t contributing to new strains of super resistant bacteria!     WHY DON&#x27;T THE STORES CARRY IVORY LIQUID HAND SOAP ANYMORE?       I quit using liquid hand soaps because they all have awful &#x27;anti-bacterial&#x27; ingredients which are contributing to the evolution and existence of new strains of super bacteria that are hard to kill.   I&#x27;ve looked and looked for Ivory liquid hand soap in Target, Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc. and CANNOT FIND IT ANYMORE!      Somebody please tell these stores to start carrying it again.    In the meantime, our family all use Ivory soap bars.  Anybody know who carries Ivory liquid hand soap on a regular basis?</li>
            <li> This is another product that is hard to find in stores now; I am so grateful to Amazon for carrying it!  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like so many other soft-soaps, so we keep it in every bathroom.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is good as expected, but the dispensers just don&#x27;t seem to work very well.  Still, it was cheaper per ounce of soap to buy the dispensers than it was to buy the refill.</li>
            <li> Fail! If I can&#x27;t get the pump to unlock, it&#x27;s just a bottle of soap with a fancy cap!  Had to use a cap from an old empty.</li>
            <li> My husband has fought cancer for a long time, and one of the side effects of many chemo treatments is a sensitivity to fragrances. This is the only hand soap we use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Moved to a house with a septic system so changed what we use. Very happy with the Ivory. Easy, clean, convenient, and safe for septic tanks. Will be using routinely.</li>
            <li> We really like the Ivory liquid hand soap but can no longer  find it in our local stores. The new pumps aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the old ones though and I had to save the ones from the old containers. Had I known this I could just have bought the large refill. Please convey this to the manufacturer that the pump does not work as smoothly as the older version.  You have to pump several times instead of once and sometimes it just shoots across the room!  Ivory liquid is especially kind to your hands and for those who wear contact lenses.  Still am surprised at how inexpensive it remains after all these years!</li>
            <li> I have used this had soap for years and cannot find it on the store shelves anymore. It is a good price too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and which I previously purchased in the local grocery or box stores.</li>
            <li> None of the 6 dispensers worked.  Not one.  Not at all.  On my earlier orders, about half worked.  They&#x27;ve perfected it now, so I am giving up.</li>
            <li> I am happy as could be with these plunger type hand soap bottles. I like that they do not excess drip, leaving dollops on the counter.</li>
            <li> I, and all my mechanic and geek friends, can&#x27;t get any of the pumps to pump out the product. I could have bought the cheaper giant re-fill size instead.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to beeswax, nickel, and several antibiotics and I also have sensitivity to fragrances. Ivory smells wonderful without leaving a perfumed smell and my skin does not break into blisters or rashes when I use it. So happy to be healing from the damage done by other harsh soaps!</li>
            <li> The product description on Amazon&#x27;s web page doesn&#x27;t say much about what&#x27;s in Ivory Liquid Clear Hand Soap. However, several customer reviews appear to indicate that it&#x27;s odorless or fragrance-free, which influenced my purchase. I was looking for a liquid hand soap without antibacterials (while the FDA investigation of triclosan is underway), and preference for no fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the product has a fairly strong fragrance compared to other liquid hand soaps I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s not to contradict other customers, who may be accustomed to even stronger fragrances, may have a different sense of smell, or may have received a product with a different formulation. But the bottles I received (June 2014) state &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; in the list of ingredients. They also list citric acid - I don&#x27;t know whether that would contribute to the smell. It seems like a nice enough hand soap - but not &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;, as some people prefer.</li>
            <li> Like the soap, but not the plain bottle and the pump does work as well as the older ones. Am putting the soap in my old bottles.</li>
            <li> As a doctor, I recommend to my patients, family and friends to use soaps that do NOT contain additional antimicrobial ingredients.  Ivory Liquid Hand Soap is one of the few appropriate liquid hand soaps that are currently available.  Unfortunately, the brick-and-mortar store shelves are loaded with more toxic soaps and it is sometimes impossible to find liquid Ivory in stores, especially the refill bottles.  Regular soap removes germs sufficiently for most purposes and antimicrobial soaps can unnecessarily sensitize skin leading to damage...thus negating their original intent.  Look at it this way:  you&#x27;re just washing your hands for dinner, not prepping for bare-handed cardiothoracic surgery!</li>
            <li> I inspected the carton and the bottles and they seem legit. I&#x27;ve seen counterfeit for even more mundane lesser items which have been discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;This is last of the ivory. I&#x27;ve tried many clear soap brands in my integrated soap dispenser next to my kitchen faucet. All (ALL)got rancid. Let me clarify ALL GOT RANCID smelly gory and Gross Green. I replaced the soap receptacle and pump twice in short order since 2004 because there is no getting rid of rancid. Ivory was only liquid soap that didn&#x27;t get greeny goopy smelly rancid. But it&#x27;s the last... If anyone has found a soap that can be transfered without going rancid please let us know. RIP Ivory.</li>
            <li> This review 100% reversed from my previous 5-star review.  Still love the soap, but the new pump is so hard to use I have to have someone else with strong hands even to get it started,  Then it takes muscle just to pump it.  Why on earth did Ivory EVER change from the easy-to-press-down pump? Using the pump now is a real challenge.  Also loved the scenic pictures on the former bottles.  We all KNOW it&#x27;s Ivory soap or we wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.  Why do we need to be told this every time we wash out hands? PLEASE, PLEASE at least give everyone a choice of new or lovely old scenic bottles of Ivory Liquid Hand Soapl  Or at the very least put the old pumps back so it doesn&#x27;t take calling in 911 to help use the pump!!!!!!  New comments:  Pumps STILL IMPOSSIBLE to operate. A perfect hand soap for everyone, but especially the elderly,  It now takes a hydraulic piece of machinery to press down on the pump.  Would love to know the reason for this ridiculous so-called &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34;.  Some salesperson must  have done a very good selling job on you Ivory people to get you to do a  &amp;#34;so called improvement&amp;#34; on a perfect product/  After multi years of using this,I&#x27;m considering pitching out my remaining bottles and looking for something a senior citizen can operate without help.  Meantime, I am asking Amazon to reduce my one-star review to a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; star review!</li>
            <li> Good soap.  No smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this liquid soap for years and always had several in my closet in reserve.  Suddenly this year, I could not find this in any of the stores and then discovered online that the manufacturer does not make Ivory soap in any form anymore.  I tried a few liquid soaps from the grocery/drugstore but none are as good as Ivory.</li>
            <li> Searched for a non-bacterial soap that is septic friendly.  This is it.  Great product at great price. Even more economical in refill bottles.</li>
            <li> Ivory is a favorite of mine so know that I wouldn&#x27;t do too much bad-mouthing. But I notice the hint of some fragrance and that it isn&#x27;t exactly 100% free. Still, I prefer this over anything else (soap-wise) in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I had to donate these to a food pantry. I was so hoping the liquid would be as wonderful as the bar soap. I refuse to use this due to additives.</li>
            <li> I thought this soap was going to have different scents. I was wrong-- they are all the same. However, the soap is very nice.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Great soap for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why local stores stopped carrying this product.  My family has used this mild soap on our skin for 50 years.  Everything else is too harsh for frequent hand cleaning needed in this germ infested world!</li>
            <li> Product is great. Getting the spout in the right position to dispense a bit challenging, but not a major problem.</li>
            <li> I used this soap for years and have found as of 2014 that this is now difficult to find in stores. While one can get 45 oz here, one can get much more for a lower price by going here [[ASIN:B0039H2Q26 Ivory Liquid Hand Soap Refill 48 oz each (Pack of 4)]]. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Plain old Ivory soap is used for cleaning CPAP machine parts.  You can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but I knew Amazon wouldn&#x27;t fail me.  With the 6 pack I should have enough to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the service and the product from Amazon and Ivory.  I wanted something that equaled the bar soap but easier to use.  This is it!</li>
            <li> Good deal. My favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find the hand soap in the stores when I can easily find the bar soap and the body wash.  I was happy to find it here and a six pack will last me for a little while.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use at the kitchen sink and in the bathroom because my hands are so sensitive to ingredients in the other soaps. My grocery store stopped carrying this hand pump size.</li>
            <li> use for cleaning leather chairs and sofas, works well, and unable to find in stores near me.</li>
            <li> Smells great, was difficult to find soap that wasn&#x27;t the antibacterial kind. My hand don&#x27;t feel dry after multiple washes a day either.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this hand soap and could not find it in any stores but I&#x27;ve always loved it!  However, the packaging has been changed to plain blue and white - not like the picture shows - and I don&#x27;t like the new packaging - not decorative!!!!</li>
