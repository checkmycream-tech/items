            <li>Also, many of the ingredients are good for your skin, so that&#x27;s an added bonus :)</li>
            <li>This product does not cause any of those, it is all natural and comes from a great tasting fruit - raspberries!  </li>
            <li>but so far I am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use these with the garcinia cambogia infrequently and they really help me get that metabolism boost that I need, I strongly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li>This helps me plan meals better and factor more healthy choices into my meals</li>
            <li>/&gt;Resveratrol&#x3D; - promotes a healthy heart and reduces blood sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar --</li>
            <li>received this at a reduced price or for free in exchange for an honest review.  </li>

            <li>I wanted to wait for atleast a month of using this product before reviewing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be getting more soon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better pills I have tried</li>
            <li>It works, and as we all know there are SO many out there that say lose all this weight</li>
            <li>Now I am so glad that I did, because if it keeps me going and losing weight</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I love taking this with the hopes that I will lose weight.  </li>
            <li>Ok I have continued to take it but have upped my dosage to 2 capsules in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking them so they aren&#x27;t a &amp;#34;weight loss magic pill&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and if I could excersize I would lose even more weight.</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are may own</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;all of these things give you maximum results because the work together to promote weight loss and a healthy metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in easy to swallow capsules and all you do is take 2 a day.</li>
            <li>So far they have worked great as an appetite suppressant and I have lost all desire to snack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>So no worrying about extra additives or fillers - it is all good!  </li>
            <li>Which is nice since I&#x27;ve been  on vacation and have been eating really fattening food and not been able to exercise.</li>
            <li>, It works , it is easy to swallow, do not give after taste or burps</li>
            <li>I have also lost my cravings for sweet things which is huge!</li>
            <li>i just started using this product &amp; find it to be fine for crving my appetite although i thought the description said i would be geting 3 bottles fir that price .my</li>
            <li>Plus, It&#x27;s a stimulant free supplement so there are no annoying jitters either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month in addition to good diet and frequent exercise.</li>
            <li>sure which ingredient does that, or if it&#x27;s just me but just take caution to that if you plan on going somewhere right after taking it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;African Mango  -- is proven to support weight loss, reduce body fat, and significantly improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels without any undesirable side effects.</li>
            <li>This product is a HUGE waste of time, money and most of all, precious sleep!!</li>
            <li>I am now losing the 15 pounds I tried all summer to lose and (to toot my own horn) after a month, only have 10 more pounds to</li>
            <li>Most had positive feedback</li>
            <li>As I have been in a weight loss plateau for several months I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li>It is real and potent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got a lot of extra good stuff, too!\\</li>
            <li>but I really wish I had done more research.</li>
            <li>This product helps me tremendously control my cravings.</li>
            <li>I noticed, it did not suppress my appetite, but more actually gave me more energy to exercise.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick even though it was not a prime deal.  </li>
            <li>really love these because they are really complete and an fantastic price.</li>
            <li>Research shows that Raspberry Ketones works more effectively when combined with other fat burning agents.  </li>
            <li>Weight loss can be a real challenge for me since having children, but I prefer to use only natural products, so I was happy to discover this Potent Raspberry Ketone from Holistic Solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that people will see good results if they are not exercising and eating right with these vitamins, it&#x27;s not a free pass, but it definitely is a great boost for those who need the extra kick in their diet.  </li>
            <li>There are no side effects that I have noticed, and I have a super sensitive system, so I am pleased with the product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>and though I can not add it with Green Coffee Bean, it is a great compliment to Garcinia Cambogia and speeds up the process some.</li>
            <li>Overall, this supplement has worked great so far</li>
            <li>it is worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>Bleh, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it to feel this way again tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to give you that first boost to lose the first few pounds towards your goal weight.</li>
            <li>I will update later if I lose any weight, but so far I will say this is a pretty good appetite suppressant.****Update</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Holistic Solutions carries it.</li>
            <li>energy level was higher after just one day on the supplement and my afternoon lag time was gone.</li>
            <li>I lost 7 lbs in the first week Without exercise.</li>
            <li>The first time i took it (today)</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and do light weights 2x a week and cardio 2x a week for 30-45 mins</li>
            <li>but I do feel I have more overall energy.  </li>
            <li>And it is really amazing when you think about these little berries packing such a HUGE punch!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also supposed to act as a natural appetite suppressant and this I found to be true as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t weigh myself before taking them, so I can&#x27;t say exactly how much weight I lost, but I dropped roughly 5 pounds in the first 7 days of taking them and I&#x27;m still losing at a healthy rate.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item and Pure Saffron arrived.</li>
            <li>The fidgety feeling went away after a few days and now I LOvE it!</li>
            <li>make no mistake tho without working hard with a good diet and exercise</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will update to review product soon.</li>
            <li>I can go much longer on the machines now than I could without the ketones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have had too much caffeine.  </li>
            <li>Adiponectin  is responsible for regulating your body&#x27;s metabolism, which then helps weight loss.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it smell</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think these work.</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and on time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effectiveness of the product - unknown, as I will not be able to take them.</li>
            <li>I felt like I drank too much alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but I really do like them.  </li>
            <li>They come in a bottle of 60 and are very well packaged</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think this product really can help anyone who is going through that or who may need to boost their metabolism</li>
            <li>but she hasn&#x27;t given me any feedback regarding how she liked or disliked it ...</li>
            <li>I also do not reccomend taking in the late afternoon as I read in 1 or 2 reviews, because it does contain a good amount of caffiene.</li>
            <li>I have notice more energy, inches lost, and what I think may be a boost in metabolism due to increase in sweating.</li>
            <li>I already work out regularly, but this product along with the green coffee captules helped me to lose a few extra pounds and best of all maintain it while not having to make too many drastic changes to my diet.</li>
            <li>but I did notice that they made me feel full, without needing to constantly snack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, after months of using this along with regular exercise and a good diet, there was little to no difference in my weight loss.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned earlier, I do workout regularly and maintain a healthy diet as well, so</li>
            <li>The apple cider vinegar in this supplement help keep my tummy feeling well and the Acai is also proven to help control hunger pangs and cravings, adding just a little more umph to this supplement.</li>
            <li>- -Alkali to balance pH levels to regulate normal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine by itself, do not combine with any other fat burning supplements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking it every day and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I noticed my appetite was less ravenous than usual, and weight came off more easily.</li>
            <li>This product is a bit different than my usual Raspberry Ketones because its more complete and has more in it to help you loose weight and speed up the metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Raspberry Ketone, and the other ingredients were very new to me but after reviewing them individual and hearing doctor oz recommend most of them i pulled the trigger, i have been taking them for several weeks now and i am shedding pounds.</li>
            <li>Being a huge fan of apple cider vinegar, I came across this product when searching for a little jumpstart to tackle some of my post-baby weight.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clearly disclose how much of each ingredient is in each capsule, so you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Any parent could use this and anyone looking for an energy boost or a natural way to lose weight should look into this product from Holistic Solutions.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve lost 78 lbs using this stuff....</li>
            <li>so I suggest taking it the morning and not at night in case you are sensitive to caffeine.</li>
            <li>So far it is still working as an appetite suppressant and I am still not craving sweets.</li>
            <li>and it really does help to curb the desire to constantly snack.</li>
            <li>I am also a stress-eater, and I have noticed a marked decline in my &amp;#34;hunger&amp;#34; which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is also all natural.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>I started taking them 3 days ago and so far have lost 3 lbs.  </li>
            <li>like that this Raspberry Ketone with African Mango supplement by Holistic Solutions is also made with Acai Berry, Green Tea Extract, Resveratrol, Apple Cider Vinegar and Kelp to help out even more.  </li>
            <li>In fact, though they get a lot of attention for their ability to &amp;#34;melt off weight&amp;#34;, their main benefit is actually liver health.</li>
            <li>3 pounds might not sound like a lot, but in all honestly I will pay 20 bucks to lose another few pounds of fat.</li>
            <li>and I definitely still have much less sweet craving.</li>
            <li>I am ALWAYS hungry, but on the ketones, I barely had an appetite when it was time to eat.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful what I mix it with, though, because too much caffeine or supplements that enhance energy</li>
            <li>I think the last time I took some was early 2000s when Xenadrine was where it was at.  </li>
            <li>I will say that once I switched back to my old formula (without meaning to advertise, thank you Botanic Choice)</li>
            <li>ketone is a naturally occurring compound found in red raspberries that is said to increase Adiponectin, which is a specific hormone in your body.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I wanted to see if some natural vitamins would actually push me over the weight loss &amp;#34;hump&amp;#34; of those last 5-10 pounds.  </li>
            <li>At first it made me a little fidgety</li>
            <li>I did notice I was a little more anxious at one point</li>
            <li>Only thing I would caution is DO NOT take this with any other caffiene containing product especially before an intense workout.</li>
            <li>If I would have continued with them, I would have certainly dropped a few pounds.</li>
            <li>(not always a bad thing, but not always good either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i just started using this product &amp; find it to be fine for crving my appetite although i thought the description said i would be geting 3 bottles fir that price .my</li>
            <li> Plus, It&#x27;s a stimulant free supplement so there are no annoying jitters either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month in addition to good diet and frequent exercise.</li>
            <li> sure which ingredient does that, or if it&#x27;s just me but just take caution to that if you plan on going somewhere right after taking it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;African Mango  -- is proven to support weight loss, reduce body fat, and significantly improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels without any undesirable side effects.</li>
            <li> This product is a HUGE waste of time, money and most of all, precious sleep!!</li>
            <li> I am now losing the 15 pounds I tried all summer to lose and (to toot my own horn) after a month, only have 10 more pounds to</li>
            <li> Most had positive feedback</li>
            <li> As I have been in a weight loss plateau for several months I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li> It is real and potent.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s got a lot of extra good stuff, too!\\</li>
            <li> but I really wish I had done more research.</li>
            <li> This product helps me tremendously control my cravings.</li>
            <li> I noticed, it did not suppress my appetite, but more actually gave me more energy to exercise.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick even though it was not a prime deal.  </li>
            <li> really love these because they are really complete and an fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Research shows that Raspberry Ketones works more effectively when combined with other fat burning agents.  </li>
            <li> Weight loss can be a real challenge for me since having children, but I prefer to use only natural products, so I was happy to discover this Potent Raspberry Ketone from Holistic Solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that people will see good results if they are not exercising and eating right with these vitamins, it&#x27;s not a free pass, but it definitely is a great boost for those who need the extra kick in their diet.  </li>
            <li> There are no side effects that I have noticed, and I have a super sensitive system, so I am pleased with the product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> and though I can not add it with Green Coffee Bean, it is a great compliment to Garcinia Cambogia and speeds up the process some.</li>
            <li> Overall, this supplement has worked great so far</li>
            <li> it is worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> Bleh, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it to feel this way again tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to give you that first boost to lose the first few pounds towards your goal weight.</li>
            <li> I will update later if I lose any weight, but so far I will say this is a pretty good appetite suppressant.****Update</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Holistic Solutions carries it.</li>
            <li> energy level was higher after just one day on the supplement and my afternoon lag time was gone.</li>
            <li> I lost 7 lbs in the first week Without exercise.</li>
            <li> The first time i took it (today)</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and do light weights 2x a week and cardio 2x a week for 30-45 mins</li>
            <li> but I do feel I have more overall energy.  </li>
            <li> And it is really amazing when you think about these little berries packing such a HUGE punch!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are also supposed to act as a natural appetite suppressant and this I found to be true as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t weigh myself before taking them, so I can&#x27;t say exactly how much weight I lost, but I dropped roughly 5 pounds in the first 7 days of taking them and I&#x27;m still losing at a healthy rate.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item and Pure Saffron arrived.</li>
            <li> The fidgety feeling went away after a few days and now I LOvE it!</li>
            <li> make no mistake tho without working hard with a good diet and exercise</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will update to review product soon.</li>
            <li> I can go much longer on the machines now than I could without the ketones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have had too much caffeine.  </li>
            <li> Adiponectin  is responsible for regulating your body&#x27;s metabolism, which then helps weight loss.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it smell</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think these work.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and on time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effectiveness of the product - unknown, as I will not be able to take them.</li>
            <li> I felt like I drank too much alcohol.  </li>
            <li> but I really do like them.  </li>
            <li> They come in a bottle of 60 and are very well packaged</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think this product really can help anyone who is going through that or who may need to boost their metabolism</li>
            <li> but she hasn&#x27;t given me any feedback regarding how she liked or disliked it ...</li>
            <li> I also do not reccomend taking in the late afternoon as I read in 1 or 2 reviews, because it does contain a good amount of caffiene.</li>
            <li> I have notice more energy, inches lost, and what I think may be a boost in metabolism due to increase in sweating.</li>
            <li> I already work out regularly, but this product along with the green coffee captules helped me to lose a few extra pounds and best of all maintain it while not having to make too many drastic changes to my diet.</li>
            <li> but I did notice that they made me feel full, without needing to constantly snack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, after months of using this along with regular exercise and a good diet, there was little to no difference in my weight loss.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, I do workout regularly and maintain a healthy diet as well, so</li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar in this supplement help keep my tummy feeling well and the Acai is also proven to help control hunger pangs and cravings, adding just a little more umph to this supplement.</li>
            <li> - -Alkali to balance pH levels to regulate normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine by itself, do not combine with any other fat burning supplements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking it every day and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I noticed my appetite was less ravenous than usual, and weight came off more easily.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit different than my usual Raspberry Ketones because its more complete and has more in it to help you loose weight and speed up the metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone, and the other ingredients were very new to me but after reviewing them individual and hearing doctor oz recommend most of them i pulled the trigger, i have been taking them for several weeks now and i am shedding pounds.</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of apple cider vinegar, I came across this product when searching for a little jumpstart to tackle some of my post-baby weight.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clearly disclose how much of each ingredient is in each capsule, so you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Any parent could use this and anyone looking for an energy boost or a natural way to lose weight should look into this product from Holistic Solutions.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve lost 78 lbs using this stuff....</li>
            <li> so I suggest taking it the morning and not at night in case you are sensitive to caffeine.</li>
            <li> So far it is still working as an appetite suppressant and I am still not craving sweets.</li>
            <li> and it really does help to curb the desire to constantly snack.</li>
            <li> I am also a stress-eater, and I have noticed a marked decline in my &amp;#34;hunger&amp;#34; which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is also all natural.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> I started taking them 3 days ago and so far have lost 3 lbs.  </li>
            <li> like that this Raspberry Ketone with African Mango supplement by Holistic Solutions is also made with Acai Berry, Green Tea Extract, Resveratrol, Apple Cider Vinegar and Kelp to help out even more.  </li>
            <li> In fact, though they get a lot of attention for their ability to &amp;#34;melt off weight&amp;#34;, their main benefit is actually liver health.</li>
            <li> 3 pounds might not sound like a lot, but in all honestly I will pay 20 bucks to lose another few pounds of fat.</li>
            <li> and I definitely still have much less sweet craving.</li>
            <li> I am ALWAYS hungry, but on the ketones, I barely had an appetite when it was time to eat.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what I mix it with, though, because too much caffeine or supplements that enhance energy</li>
            <li> I think the last time I took some was early 2000s when Xenadrine was where it was at.  </li>
            <li> I will say that once I switched back to my old formula (without meaning to advertise, thank you Botanic Choice)</li>
            <li> ketone is a naturally occurring compound found in red raspberries that is said to increase Adiponectin, which is a specific hormone in your body.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I wanted to see if some natural vitamins would actually push me over the weight loss &amp;#34;hump&amp;#34; of those last 5-10 pounds.  </li>
            <li> At first it made me a little fidgety</li>
            <li> I did notice I was a little more anxious at one point</li>
            <li> Only thing I would caution is DO NOT take this with any other caffiene containing product especially before an intense workout.</li>
            <li> If I would have continued with them, I would have certainly dropped a few pounds.</li>
            <li> (not always a bad thing, but not always good either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is no easy way or legal way to get in shape if your eating fastfood soda pizzas ice cream chips and cookies , just accept who you are or get a backbone and stop.</li>
            <li> (29 year old, active female)</li>
            <li> I am returning these supplements, for some reason they got me very depressed mood,  Not sure if they affect everyone like this</li>
            <li> Initially, I did not see results, but after supplementing this with regular exercise, I can really see results, my weight slowly dropped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have already lost weight on this product and I would highly recommend it because it is all natural and gives you energy without any dangerous chemicals or high doses of caffeine, and there is no crash later either.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works long term.</li>
            <li> It has other things in it such as African mango, Acai Berry, Green Tea, Apple Cider vinegar, and though it isn&#x27;t advertised, it also has caffeine in it.</li>
            <li> This only helps speed things up a little</li>
            <li> As a final count I lost 3 pounds or perhaps a little over and an inch off my hips.</li>
            <li> Delivered what I expected</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL IF YOU SUFFER FROM HYPERTENTION.  </li>
            <li> and they do what was expected</li>
            <li> Also contains African Mango Extract, Acai Berry, Green Tea Extract, Kelp, and Grapefruit Extract.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only been a few days</li>
            <li> After looking for a product without caffeine, and reading the statement - WITHOUT CAFFEINE - I received the product to find that it contains not only green tea extract, which I expected, but CAFFEINE ANHYDROUS.  </li>
            <li> The past few years there has been an onslaught of new studies on &amp;#34;superfruits&amp;#34; like pomegranate and blueberries.  </li>
            <li> and I have lost a little weight - 150 down to 145 in a week since starting to take two caplets a day with the second bottle, eating very little food and exercising.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other raspberry ketone supplemments before</li>
            <li> The combination that Holistic Solutions uses has been proven to burn fat faster without adding Caffeine or any other stimulants.</li>
            <li> Since I cannot eat for at least an hour after my pill, and then I take the supplement, I do not have much of an appetite for at least four or five hours.</li>
            <li> These synergistic compounds are proven to help you lose weight faster and improve your health at the same time, all without any negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my only complaint is the claim that it is not added)</li>
            <li> It goes down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also supposed to assist your body in breaking down fat cells.  </li>
            <li> I am all for anything the helps break down fat!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tea Extract - - has been scientifically proven to reduce inflammation in the body, boost metabolism, and help you feel less hungry between meals.</li>
            <li> I take the raspberry ketones an hour and a half after my prescription</li>
            <li> yes they do have a slight raspberry flavor but nothing overbearing or yucky.</li>
            <li> I also ride my bike every day (unless I am away from my bike on a trip) and bike on average 4 miles everyday.</li>
            <li> Never noticed weight loss, but have felt an energy boost a little.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for almost 2 weeks and have lost a little over a pound.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients on this product a little closer and discovered \\&quot;Caffiene</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> If I miss a few days the scales go up.</li>
            <li> A few days into the routine and they are suppressing the appetite.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> At any rate, this supplement has helped me lose about 2 pounds a week and when added to Garcinia Cambogia and Green Coffee Bean, closer to 4-5 pounds a week.</li>
            <li> Man, I felt so jittery for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking them for a few months.</li>
            <li> Before I had my baby, I used a product that just had apple cider vinegar with green tea, so when I discovered this formula, I thought,</li>
            <li> &quot; Unfortunately, after a summer of weight loss futility, I found it to be completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down 7 pounds over the past 5 weeks...</li>
            <li> The capsules made my stomach hurt and capsules were hard to keep down when swallowed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to lose weight, even while taking my medication and despite the fact that I am a zumba instructor who teaches high intensity classes 3-5 times per week.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree after just a few weeks of use!  </li>
            <li> I noticed this after several difficult nights of sleeping.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> I dont plan to stay up late night,  </li>
            <li> I am edgy and shaky.  </li>
            <li> But no it sucks!</li>
            <li> And for the first two weeks I had a horrible stomach ache</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact it doesn&#x27;t even help you, my biggest complaint with this product is that it contains caffeine and DOES NOT WARN YOU ABOUT IT!</li>
            <li> The first time I took this i got a terrible headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually too scared to take it again because I hate that jittery feeling.  </li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed when the item arrived with the label of &amp;#34;pure saffron&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I unfortunately saw no change while taking these pills.</li>
            <li> For me losing weight is extremely difficult because I have asthma</li>
            <li> I do NOT have any jitters or weird feelings</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I was nauseous, shaking and broke out in a cold sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have not taken it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Every time I have tried to take this, it makes me sick at my stomach</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> bad !</li>
            <li> There is NO caffeine in this product so you will not get the nasty stimulant side effects.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping will update to review product soon.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product a few weeks ago. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. I have tried other raspberry ketone supplemments before so I went into my trial with this prodcut knowing what it was supposed to deliver. I was not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My energy level was higher after just one day on the supplement and my afternoon lag time was gone. I have noticed an increase in my workout endurance as well. I can go much longer on the machines now than I could without the ketones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also supposed to act as a natural appetite suppressant and this I found to be true as well. I am ALWAYS hungry, but on the ketones, I barely had an appetite when it was time to eat. This helps me plan meals better and factor more healthy choices into my meals so I do not just eat carbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already lost weight on this product and I would highly recommend it because it is all natural and gives you energy without any dangerous chemicals or high doses of caffeine, and there is no crash later either. Any parent could use this and anyone looking for an energy boost or a natural way to lose weight should look into this product from Holistic Solutions.</li>
            <li> I am returning these supplements, for some reason they got me very depressed mood,  Not sure if they affect everyone like this but they did me ~</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any weight loss while taking this ketones but I did notice that they made me feel full, without needing to constantly snack. If I would have continued with them, I would have certainly dropped a few pounds.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Delivered what I expected</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve lost 78 lbs using this stuff.... make no mistake tho without working hard with a good diet and exercise this will not work at all! This only helps speed things up a little</li>
            <li> Excelent for weight loss.</li>
            <li> boycott anything with claims of dr oz . every cent netted by companies adding dr oz&#x27;s name to a product description should be given to dr oz . lf a product can&#x27;t stand on its own merit , its bs! Always do research when putting things into your body. there is no easy way or legal way to get in shape if your eating fastfood soda pizzas ice cream chips and cookies , just accept who you are or get a backbone and stop.</li>
            <li> I already work out regularly, but this product along with the green coffee captules helped me to lose a few extra pounds and best of all maintain it while not having to make too many drastic changes to my diet. It&#x27;s great to give you that first boost to lose the first few pounds towards your goal weight.</li>

            <li> I bought it for my wife but she hasn&#x27;t given me any feedback regarding how she liked or disliked it ... sorry</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t clearly disclose how much of each ingredient is in each capsule, so you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting. I&#x27;m all for better product labeling!</li>
            <li> Never noticed weight loss, but have felt an energy boost a little. It is real and potent. The smell alone tells u that. I like.</li>
            <li> Weight loss can be a real challenge for me since having children, but I prefer to use only natural products, so I was happy to discover this Potent Raspberry Ketone from Holistic Solutions.&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry ketone is a naturally occurring compound found in red raspberries that is said to increase Adiponectin, which is a specific hormone in your body. Adiponectin  is responsible for regulating your body&#x27;s metabolism, which then helps weight loss.  Research shows that Raspberry Ketones works more effectively when combined with other fat burning agents.  The combination that Holistic Solutions uses has been proven to burn fat faster without adding Caffeine or any other stimulants. These synergistic compounds are proven to help you lose weight faster and improve your health at the same time, all without any negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the Raspberry Ketones, the ingredients included are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;African Mango  -- is proven to support weight loss, reduce body fat, and significantly improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels without any undesirable side effects. It also reduces fat cell growth and increases breakdown of fats.&lt;br /&gt;Acai Berry -- has been proven to reduce cholesterol and aid in weight loss&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea Extract - - has been scientifically proven to reduce inflammation in the body, boost metabolism, and help you feel less hungry between meals. .&lt;br /&gt;Resveratrol&#x3D; - promotes a healthy heart and reduces blood sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar -- is an appetite suppressant and also promotes digestive health.&lt;br /&gt;Kelp - -Alkali to balance pH levels to regulate normal weight.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced price or for free in exchange for an honest review.  The words and opinion are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I know there are reasons for this product the work. I don&#x27;t understand them.  I do understand my bathroom scale.  It goes down.  If I miss a few days the scales go up. I get back on my raspberry ketones, and in just a couple of days those extra pounds are gone.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the different brands that are similar out there. I was originally only looking for raspberry ketones and decided to try this one out because it also had African mango. I have been losing weight and feel great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taking them for 30 days and lost 10 pounds. They work.</li>
            <li> A few days into the routine and they are suppressing the appetite.  Do not know yet if they are effective for weight loss.  These are gelatin capsules, not veggie.</li>
            <li> Excellent, aids in my weight loss journey!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews made it seem wonderful. But no it sucks! Doesn&#x27;t give you energy like it states. Haven&#x27;t lost any weight and I&#x27;ve been taking it for 3 weeks. And for the first two weeks I had a horrible stomach ache and I felt bloated. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i just started using this product &amp; find it to be fine for crving my appetite although i thought the description said i would be geting 3 bottles fir that price .my bad ! i would not recommend to a frind for the price.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it does NOT work!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Raspberry Ketones off and on for the last couple of years whenever I am in weight loss mode or wanting to maintain my weight.  It&#x27;s one of those supplements that just works for me.  It not only helps suppress my appetite but it also helps boost my metabolism.  It&#x27;s also supposed to assist your body in breaking down fat cells.  I am all for anything the helps break down fat!&lt;br /&gt;I like that this Raspberry Ketone with African Mango supplement by Holistic Solutions is also made with Acai Berry, Green Tea Extract, Resveratrol, Apple Cider Vinegar and Kelp to help out even more.  Plus, It&#x27;s a stimulant free supplement so there are no annoying jitters either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> This raspberry ketone does help me to lose the belly fat, now I can put on a jacket and not having my belly protrude, this along with the Fucoxan and exercise will help you do the trick. You have to exercise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this knowing that later I will edit it based one whether or not this product works for me.  I have been in a weight plateau for months and decided to try it after a friend took it for a week and lost some weight. I feel like I just needed a push.  I also ride my bike every day (unless I am away from my bike on a trip) and bike on average 4 miles everyday. My calorie intake is between 1200 and 1500 a day. So hopefully some weight loss will occur.  So far they have worked great as an appetite suppressant and I have lost all desire to snack. I have also lost my cravings for sweet things which is huge! I did notice I was a little more anxious at one point but that passed and could be from something besides the ketones. But if you take them and notice you are more jittery that might be the cause.  This product also has caffeine in it so I suggest taking it the morning and not at night in case you are sensitive to caffeine. I will update later if I lose any weight, but so far I will say this is a pretty good appetite suppressant.****Update**** I have been taking this for almost 2 weeks and have lost a little over a pound. Which is nice since I&#x27;ve been  on vacation and have been eating really fattening food and not been able to exercise. So far it is still working as an appetite suppressant and I am still not craving sweets. Hopefully after the supply is gone I will have lost more, I will keep posting on my progress.***Final Update*** As a final count I lost 3 pounds or perhaps a little over and an inch off my hips. As I have been in a weight loss plateau for several months I am pretty happy. I&#x27;m the thinnest I&#x27;ve been in over 5 years. Next time I hit a plateau I will be using this again. 3 pounds might not sound like a lot, but in all honestly I will pay 20 bucks to lose another few pounds of fat.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these on a whim because I have a thyroid condition and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to lose weight, even while taking my medication and despite the fact that I am a zumba instructor who teaches high intensity classes 3-5 times per week.  Anyway, I wanted to see if some natural vitamins would actually push me over the weight loss &amp;#34;hump&amp;#34; of those last 5-10 pounds.  It really works great for me!  I didn&#x27;t weigh myself before taking them, so I can&#x27;t say exactly how much weight I lost, but I dropped roughly 5 pounds in the first 7 days of taking them and I&#x27;m still losing at a healthy rate.  I just take two capsules with dinner every evening and that&#x27;s that.  As I mentioned earlier, I do workout regularly and maintain a healthy diet as well, so I don&#x27;t think that people will see good results if they are not exercising and eating right with these vitamins, it&#x27;s not a free pass, but it definitely is a great boost for those who need the extra kick in their diet.  Also, many of the ingredients are good for your skin, so that&#x27;s an added bonus :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. I joined Weight Watchers for weight loss, but I still have an unsatisfiable craving for starchy carbs. This product helps me tremendously control my cravings. It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m happy that Holistic Solutions carries it. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I use these with the garcinia cambogia infrequently and they really help me get that metabolism boost that I need, I strongly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> I would first like to point out that Raspberry Ketones-any Raspberry ketones from ANY company are not a magic weight loss pill. In fact, though they get a lot of attention for their ability to &amp;#34;melt off weight&amp;#34;, their main benefit is actually liver health. I don&#x27;t take Raspberry Ketones to lose a ton of weight-which I may add-it isn&#x27;t TRULY advertised to do. While weight loss is a great benefit of taking Raspberry ketones, optimum weight loss won&#x27;t happen until the liver is functioning properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being said, Holistic Solutions Raspberry Ketone is different than others. It has other things in it such as African mango, Acai Berry, Green Tea, Apple Cider vinegar, and though it isn&#x27;t advertised, it also has caffeine in it. (my only complaint is the claim that it is not added) At any rate, this supplement has helped me lose about 2 pounds a week and when added to Garcinia Cambogia and Green Coffee Bean, closer to 4-5 pounds a week. I have to be careful what I mix it with, though, because too much caffeine or supplements that enhance energy and I get jittery and can&#x27;t stop moving. (not always a bad thing, but not always good either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this supplement I have had much more energy and though I can not add it with Green Coffee Bean, it is a great compliment to Garcinia Cambogia and speeds up the process some. The apple cider vinegar in this supplement help keep my tummy feeling well and the Acai is also proven to help control hunger pangs and cravings, adding just a little more umph to this supplement. I only take one a day, but it says you can take up to two a day. To stop evening cravings, they suggest taking one after dinner. Overall, this supplement has worked great so far and I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it works long term.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait for atleast a month of using this product before reviewing, and I&#x27;m glad I did. Initially, I did not see results, but after supplementing this with regular exercise, I can really see results, my weight slowly dropped.  I&#x27;ve always been weary to try Ketone, but when this was offered at a great price, I decided to go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. I noticed, it did not suppress my appetite, but more actually gave me more energy to exercise.</li>
            <li> I really like how it smell, It works , it is easy to swallow, do not give after taste or burps</li>
            <li> It really does work. I have taken it for 3 months and lost about 10 pounds. Would recommend as i didn&#x27;t experience any side effects</li>
            <li> this product did not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking for a few months now - it seems to really work.</li>
            <li> This shipping eas wonderful now I just started using this product by my appetite is already being curbed ! I&#x27;m going to be getting more soon</li>
            <li> I like it and it seem to work but I was a little disappointed when the item arrived with the label of &amp;#34;pure saffron&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take diet pills a lot.  I think the last time I took some was early 2000s when Xenadrine was where it was at.  Lol!  The instructions just said take 2 a day.  So I just took 2 in the morning.  Man, I felt so jittery for a few hours.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m supposed to break up the dosage, like one in the morning and one in the evening, but I thought it advertised that there was no jitteriness.  I&#x27;m assuming the jittery feeling helps burn fat?  I have no clue.  I&#x27;m actually too scared to take it again because I hate that jittery feeling.  I feel like I&#x27;m going to have a heart attack.  I may try again later and update my review.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think these work. I&#x27;ve been taking them for a few months.</li>
            <li> Saw myself losing weight each week.</li>
            <li> As all products are designed differently and everyone reacts differently to them. I unfortunately saw no change while taking these pills. I know there are a lot of good reviews out there which are great, but not for me. I would recommend people to try them though, everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone, and the other ingredients were very new to me but after reviewing them individual and hearing doctor oz recommend most of them i pulled the trigger, i have been taking them for several weeks now and i am shedding pounds. this mixture of metabolism boosting products is perfect.</li>
            <li> HELPS DECREASE APPITITE.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU SUFFER FROM HYPERTENTION.  MONTER BLOOD PRESSURE.  I TAKE ONE A DAY INSTEAD OF TWO A DAY.</li>
            <li> I find these help with digestion and also appetite suppression if taken twice a day.</li>
            <li> It works well! I take the capsules and it really does help to curb the desire to constantly snack. There are no side effects that I have noticed, and I have a super sensitive system, so I am pleased with the product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick even though it was not a prime deal.  The product is amazing.  Helps you lose weight and gives you energy.  At first it made me a little fidgety but I don&#x27;t drink caffiene so that was just my body adjusting.  The fidgety feeling went away after a few days and now I LOvE it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and on time. Once you opened the bottle you can smell the raspberry. You can also taste the raspberry.  There are not any directions on it. So I assumed you take them 2x a day. 30 minute before breakfast and dinner and with plenty of water. Haven&#x27;t finished trhe bottle. So I will write another review with results</li>
            <li> take these and they do what was expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the better pills I have tried</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I have been using this for about a month in addition to good diet and frequent exercise. I have notice more energy, inches lost, and what I think may be a boost in metabolism due to increase in sweating. Only thing I would caution is DO NOT take this with any other caffiene containing product especially before an intense workout. I did by accident once and my heart rate went through the roof,i thought I was going to have a heart attack. I also do not reccomend taking in the late afternoon as I read in 1 or 2 reviews, because it does contain a good amount of caffiene. I dont plan to stay up late night,  so I only take in the morning before my workout or around 12pm with lunch. I noticed increase bowel movement within 1-2 hours after consumption. Mot sure which ingredient does that, or if it&#x27;s just me but just take caution to that if you plan on going somewhere right after taking it. It&#x27;s fine by itself, do not combine with any other fat burning supplements. I only take a multivitamin, calcium, and joint support. I am going to continue to purchase monthly for about another 3-4 months or until my weight loss goals are achieved. (29 year old, active female)</li>
            <li> After looking for a product without caffeine, and reading the statement - WITHOUT CAFFEINE - I received the product to find that it contains not only green tea extract, which I expected, but CAFFEINE ANHYDROUS.  There is no website for the company so I cannot contact them and ask about the caffeine levels that are actually in the product.  Would not have bought it had I known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness of the product - unknown, as I will not be able to take them.</li>
            <li> For me losing weight is extremely difficult because I have asthma and I am on steroid inhalers.  And I don&#x27;t exercise as I should, but I just need something to help me along the way.  Dr Oz has called this &amp;#34;the #1 miracle in a bottle for weight loss&amp;#34;.  I have to agree after just a few weeks of use!  It works, and as we all know there are SO many out there that say lose all this weight but they all have harmful side effects or leave you trembling from the caffeine content.  This product does not cause any of those, it is all natural and comes from a great tasting fruit - raspberries!  The past few years there has been an onslaught of new studies on &amp;#34;superfruits&amp;#34; like pomegranate and blueberries.  But this is one I had not heard of until I started doing product reviews.  Now I am so glad that I did, because if it keeps me going and losing weight it is worth it for me.  I am also a stress-eater, and I have noticed a marked decline in my &amp;#34;hunger&amp;#34; which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also all natural.  So no worrying about extra additives or fillers - it is all good!  And it is really amazing when you think about these little berries packing such a HUGE punch!  Also contains African Mango Extract, Acai Berry, Green Tea Extract, Kelp, and Grapefruit Extract.  There is NO caffeine in this product so you will not get the nasty stimulant side effects.  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
            <li> great. I&#x27;m taking it every day and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> We all know that, without changing your diet and exercise, supplements aren&#x27;t going to fix everything for you. However, I found that by incorporating these into a lifestyle plan with diet and exercise, they can be a very handy tool. I&#x27;m down 7 pounds over the past 5 weeks... it took some effort, but it was easier than before with these Ketones. I noticed my appetite was less ravenous than usual, and weight came off more easily. I&#x27;m pleased that I received them promotionally for review!</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of apple cider vinegar, I came across this product when searching for a little jumpstart to tackle some of my post-baby weight. Before I had my baby, I used a product that just had apple cider vinegar with green tea, so when I discovered this formula, I thought, \\&quot;Wow, it&#x27;s got a lot of extra good stuff, too!\\&quot; Unfortunately, after a summer of weight loss futility, I found it to be completely ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact it doesn&#x27;t even help you, my biggest complaint with this product is that it contains caffeine and DOES NOT WARN YOU ABOUT IT! I noticed this after several difficult nights of sleeping. I couldn&#x27;t figure out the culprit, until I decided to check out the vitamins I was taking. I read the ingredients on this product a little closer and discovered \\&quot;Caffiene Anhydrous\\&quot;. So, if you have a sensitive stomach and can only take pills in the evening, there is absolutely no way you can take this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after months of using this along with regular exercise and a good diet, there was little to no difference in my weight loss. I will accept the fact that there are a lot of different factors that can affect weight, so I can&#x27;t solely blame this product. I will say that once I switched back to my old formula (without meaning to advertise, thank you Botanic Choice) I am now losing the 15 pounds I tried all summer to lose and (to toot my own horn) after a month, only have 10 more pounds to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: This product is a HUGE waste of time, money and most of all, precious sleep!!</li>
            <li> Seems to have helped for a while.</li>
            <li> its okay. didn&#x27;t have any awesome experience with energy or weight loss. didn&#x27;t bother my stomach</li>
            <li> great pills. Absolutley amazed by these. I lost 7 lbs in the first week Without exercise. I do watch what I eat though, but its a faster weight loss than dieting alone. It also gives me good energy. So I&#x27;m always moving around doing something like cleaning. I didn&#x27;t feel any bad side effects.</li>
            <li> I find it keeps my anemia under control.  Use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give the percentage of each ingredient on the label. It didn&#x27;t help me to lose any weight.</li>
            <li> The capsules made my stomach hurt and capsules were hard to keep down when swallowed. I did not lose any weight with 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Makes my blood sugar go up.</li>
            <li> I began taking this supplement 10 days ago. I also am on a 1500 calorie a day diet. I am also on thyroid medication- albeit a very low dose.  I have lost 2 pounds and do not exercise. I take the raspberry ketones an hour and a half after my prescription and I haven&#x27;t had any side effects. Since I cannot eat for at least an hour after my pill, and then I take the supplement, I do not have much of an appetite for at least four or five hours. I do drink 3-4 bottles of water a day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t list caffeine.  No way to figure out the percentages of what&#x27;s in it.  The first time i took it (today) it made me so nauseous I felt like I drank too much alcohol.  I&#x27;ll just try one pill tomorrow but I really wish I had done more research. Bleh, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it to feel this way again tomorrow.  I took it with food both times today (lunch/dinner). But there&#x27;s no inductions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love taking this with the hopes that I will lose weight.  I believe it does work along with a very low calorie/low fat diet  This is my second bottle and I have lost a little weight - 150 down to 145 in a week since starting to take two caplets a day with the second bottle, eating very little food and exercising.  I feel good when I take this so, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am not severely overweight or anything but I have always had an extra 20lbs haunting me.  I am 43 years old and do light weights 2x a week and cardio 2x a week for 30-45 mins so I am not a couch potato.  I was reading up on the Raspberry Ketones for a month or so and found this brand on Amazon.  I read about 25 verified reviews from buyers.  Most had positive feedback so I decided to try a bottle.  I started taking them 3 days ago and so far have lost 3 lbs.  I only am taking 1 capsule in the morning (7am) 1/2 hour before breakfast and another around 4pm.  I do NOT have any jitters or weird feelings but I do feel I have more overall energy.  My cravings for sweets, which is always been my weakness, has subsided a lot.  I know it&#x27;s only been a few days but so far I am very happy with this product.  It was worth the money and I will be purchasing another bottle if my progress continues. UPDATE:  Ok I have continued to take it but have upped my dosage to 2 capsules in the morning.  Sometimes before breakfast and sometimes after but I really do like them.  I have lost a total of 5 lbs in the month I have been taking them so they aren&#x27;t a &amp;#34;weight loss magic pill&amp;#34; BUT they do give me a nice boost of energy and I definitely still have much less sweet craving. I have continued with my exercise regime of weights and cardio 3x a week.   I have missed a day of so here or there so it&#x27;s not like you get dependent on them but I will notice by middle of the day if I didn&#x27;t take them.  If I take them later in the day I only take 1 capsule.  I just ordered my second bottle so I will continue updating my progress.  Oh yea for those who are wondering...yes they do have a slight raspberry flavor but nothing overbearing or yucky.</li>
            <li> I take these with the Garcinia Cambogia Extract to help me keep the weight loss off and if I could excersize I would lose even more weight. I WON&#x27;T do without either!</li>
            <li> This product is a bit different than my usual Raspberry Ketones because its more complete and has more in it to help you loose weight and speed up the metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holistic Solutions - Raspberry Ketones has in it a number of things to help you they are in a proprietary formula and&lt;br /&gt;all of these things give you maximum results because the work together to promote weight loss and a healthy metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in easy to swallow capsules and all you do is take 2 a day. They come in a bottle of 60 and are very well packaged and they ship really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love these because they are really complete and an fantastic price. I have had a lot of problem with my weight since starting menopause and I think this product really can help anyone who is going through that or who may need to boost their metabolism a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are may own</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and Pure Saffron arrived. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but I feel that I need to share my experience. The first time I took this i got a terrible headache. By the end of the day I was nauseous, shaking and broke out in a cold sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I have not taken it again.</li>
    </ol>
