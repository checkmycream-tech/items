            <li>This is a great set of oils with a fantastic variety of smells none of which I don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Our favorite is Serenity.</li>
            <li>We LOVE it and we agreed to ALWAYS use the oils.  </li>
            <li>The fragrances are not relaxing or enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and we enjoyed trying them out.</li>
            <li>but, we love the oils.</li>
            <li>so you can pick your favorite</li>
            <li>I like most</li>
            <li>Will buy it again Love it</li>
            <li>We have tried a couple of the scents and really enjoy them!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I order this</li>
            <li>These were the perfect present for my boyfriends birthday!</li>
            <li>We also dropped it (4ft) onto a hardwood floor and broke the top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our favorite is Harmony Blend (not Healing Blend like it is advertised) and Pleasure Garden.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of scents.</li>
            <li>enjoying 4 out of 5 of them.</li>
            <li>She should be the one writing this, not me, but being that I have knowledge of how great they work, I can say that they really relax the muscles.  </li>
            <li>so much more than lotion :)</li>
            <li>I ENJOYED RUBBING IT ON HER AND SEEING EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>As a learning massage therapist these are reasonably priced and smell great.</li>
            <li>Love the variety that each has to offer.</li>
            <li>so many variety of smell.</li>
            <li>I love the bag that the oils come in.</li>
            <li>Let the sexy times begin.</li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>( well really the massages are the gift) very nice.</li>
            <li>someone looking for a new favorite or just wanting to explore this pack is great to get.</li>
            <li>but it seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say harmony blend and sweet almond are definitely our favorites, but the rest are great as well and good for keeping this interesting with a variety.</li>
            <li>Amazing smells and quickly absorbs in your skin.  </li>
            <li>For 5 good sized bottles at this price point, there really isn&#x27;t any product on Amazon that I found that was a better deal.</li>
            <li>They all kind of have a strong tea tree oil smell, except for sweet almond, which has more of a dainty, romantic scent.</li>
            <li>Better suited for light touch, Swedish, sensual massage.  </li>
            <li>I used Prime and got my oils in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Packed safe and secure, no leakers.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>My husband and I are extremely happy because when we give each other massages, we each pick our own favorite smell.</li>
            <li>SHINE.CLEAN UP WAS EASY</li>
            <li>Greasy, strong smells .</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond was my favorite of the 5 scents.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self was light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Quick efficient delivery!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because my boyfriend and I both enjoy massages.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that wasn&#x27;t too greasy and that would work into the skin allowing for a smooth massage.  </li>
            <li>Really relaxing and the scents are amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want to try different scents of massage oils.  </li>
            <li>These oils are smooth and do not leave the skin sticky.</li>
            <li>We enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>A great starting sample pack for massages.</li>
            <li>I love these, my girlfriend and I definitely use them fairly frequently, and they are so relaxing and great!</li>
            <li>I have not used all the oils so far but the two we used are good and my wife loves them.</li>
            <li>and many selections of Massage oils also love to change it up to give massage&#x27;s Highly recomend</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it its amazing</li>
            <li>i have tried this brand before but was really excited to try additional fragrances.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Been married 30 years, and one of our favorite ways &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just get the sweet almond scent</li>
            <li>u will never experience such a good feeling from anything else</li>
            <li>only like two out of the 5, good product.</li>
            <li>Not just that I ordered the pack that had the cool Indian picture on it</li>
            <li>Scents are ok overall, with the sweet almond being our favorite.</li>
            <li>Giving it 4 stars because a couple of the oils did not smell that great, but the other 3 made up for it.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied and enjoyed the purchase.</li>
            <li>After a massage it seems like the oil has dried up to an acceptable level leaving skin smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product was as described.</li>
            <li>Purchased one of the Kama Sutra massage oils before, liked the ability to try the different scents available.  </li>
            <li>Kama Sutra makes high quality products for enhancing your love life.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a romantic evening, or helping that special someone relax after a long day!</li>
            <li>I really liked the larger sweet almond</li>
            <li>Great little sample package.</li>
            <li>It worth to use it.</li>
            <li>Range of beautiful and sensual fragrances in small bottles.</li>
            <li>The oils smelled nice, but they weren&#x27;t oily enough.  </li>
            <li>You can get dozens of massages out of each bottle, so if you get this set you won&#x27;t need more for years (unless you do this professionally).</li>
            <li>when you smell the 3 florals at first it is strong when smelled in the bottle, but when used its very aromatherapeutical.</li>
            <li>You can get their massage oils on anything and it washes right out.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like some nice scented oil giving your a significant other a relaxing massage.</li>
            <li>The scents are a little bit strong, there is an almond, minty kind and 3 floral ones..</li>
            <li>A blend of five different oils all with great scents that really last forever.</li>
            <li>This is such a great set to just try the different oil.</li>
            <li>Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>We are pleased with the product overall.</li>
            <li>Customers love Kama Sutra products and we will continue to sell them in our romantic room packages on our Uberoom website.</li>
            <li>the scents were nice, nothing crazy good but definitely fun</li>
            <li>Giving massages it worked pretty well, im no pro</li>
            <li>Deep tissue would require alot more oil.</li>
            <li>First try...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>These massage oils are really good they don&#x27;t leave a messy grease</li>
            <li>These smell amazing and do not get you all oily like some other brands do.  </li>
            <li>Received them quickly and we&#x27;ll try one of new flavors this weekend.</li>
            <li>Massages are a great way to calm down the noise of a hectic life and really focus on your significant other.</li>
            <li>It works just like the first 2-3 minutes of lotion except for a whole lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottles have nice scents but they are not very strong.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased and look forward to my next massage!</li>
            <li>The oils themselves are of a pretty good quality and comes with a decent travel bag kinda plastic bag, the problem is the smells are really not appealing, I bought this for my gf</li>
            <li>OHH YEA SLAPPED SOME OF THIS GOOD STUFF ALL OVER MY LADY, HAD THE CANDLES ON MUSIC DOWN LOW RIGHT STUFF</li>
            <li>And I like the fact that it is edible oil so after a nice sensual massage I can give little kisses and not leave that oily feel in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Husband loved the oils on his hard working feet.</li>
            <li>They do not irritate, you can use them in the intimate parts without worring of burning sensation.</li>
            <li>a couple of the scents are a bit much</li>
            <li>Bought the whole sample pack to try them out.</li>
            <li>, one isn&#x27;t really for me because it is a bit  too flowery .  </li>
            <li>Will buy again, fast shiping.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and spreads very well.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to leave any noticeable residue and work well for a gentle, intimate massage.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing not to oily</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anybody who wants to&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product makes things that much easier</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I have enjoyed several very nice evenings of massage from these little bottles and they are not even close to empty!</li>
            <li>I do not use as much oil as I do with other products, it stays on/in the skin much better.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed using the oils on each other.  </li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews, our favorite was the almond.</li>
            <li>I would advise people to not lay directly on their nice bedding as these will leave oil marks on bedding so throw down some comfy blanket that you don&#x27;t care to much about.</li>
            <li>The sweet almond is really the only scent we like.</li>
            <li>the only scents i like are pleasure garden (which smells like roses), and sweet almond.</li>
            <li>only about 15% of the bottle is gone after 8 20 minute full body</li>
            <li>None of these are greasy, they don&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and you feel refreshed after a nice massage!</li>
            <li>Arrived REALLY quickly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neatly packaged and brand new.</li>
            <li>and I agree with others, the sweet almond is really nice (a couple of the other scents are a bit heavy for my liking, very floral).</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of different scented oils for sensual massage, I like it, I was only hoping that the bottles were larger, for some reason I did not look at the size of the bottles on the written description</li>
            <li>Its worth the price, you get 5 bottles and they last.</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy a larger, easy to dispense oil of the far glance</li>
            <li>Perhaps the set was very old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for nice smelling oils, and wanted to find something inexpensive yet of high quality - my lady and I typically exchange massages every now and again, and have used oils from big box stores that often had odd textures/smells, and also more sticky than smooth.  </li>
            <li>Are Kama Sutra Oils the secret to our long, happy marriage?  </li>
            <li>only used the Sweet Almond (thanks to the recommendation of other users) and Healing blend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading other reviews I got the impression that these were Trial bottles that would run out quickly.</li>
            <li>The 5 pack of different flavors is a little much for most of our customers (thus 3/5), so we only sell one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised with these.  </li>
            <li>The majority of these oils had very soothing fragrances (especially the Almond and Lavender</li>
            <li>not super greasy, but lasts long enough for a good back rub.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t crazy about my first oil I opened but the rest I liked.</li>
            <li>so we could try the other flavors in case there are other ones we like better.</li>
            <li>so a light squeeze isnt enough and sometimes a hard squeeze results in too much.</li>
            <li>The oil lasts long, much longer than the scent.</li>
            <li>and it really helps set the mood or even just to relax after a long week.</li>
            <li>They dry up way too fast.</li>
            <li>application generally does the trick.</li>
            <li>If that is happening, you are using too much or not massaging long enough!</li>
            <li>or they do have larger single bottles if you just want one certain scent or larger size</li>
            <li>(I have a black comforter on my bed and after the first message it took about 6 or 7 washings to totally get the oily marks out of it, but it did all come out.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting and made with natural ingredients.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is not too strong, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice oils with very nice fragrances.  </li>

            <li> Most of the oils are great.</li>

            <li> Nice to have a sampler</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary, but we liked it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> texture is nice, though.</li>
            <li> nice fragrances, not sticky like some massage oils</li>
            <li> Nicely scented.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> but they do make a handy travel kit.</li>
            <li> Their massage oils are the best, very fragrant, and absorb well.</li>
            <li> Having never bought any massage oil before, I tried this pack to see what I liked.</li>
            <li> I couldnt find this kind of oil anywhere else, it comes it</li>
            <li> honestly neither</li>
            <li> what a nice selection of their oils.</li>
            <li> A nice variety pack.</li>
            <li> The oils work great and finish clean.</li>
            <li> Plenty for many, many uses and all smell quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> We love this product, because we get a variety of scents in nice, travel-sized bottles.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re all refreshing in their own way.</li>
            <li> These are great and each fun to use for a variety of fragrances.</li>
            <li> a nice massage to a love one</li>
            <li> happy with oil, not greasy, goes on just right</li>
            <li> This is a great set of oils with a fantastic variety of smells none of which I don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for such a great product.  </li>
            <li> Our favorite is Serenity.</li>
            <li> We LOVE it and we agreed to ALWAYS use the oils.  </li>
            <li> The fragrances are not relaxing or enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and we enjoyed trying them out.</li>
            <li> but, we love the oils.</li>
            <li> so you can pick your favorite</li>
            <li> I like most</li>
            <li> Will buy it again Love it</li>
            <li> We have tried a couple of the scents and really enjoy them!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I order this</li>
            <li> These were the perfect present for my boyfriends birthday!</li>
            <li> We also dropped it (4ft) onto a hardwood floor and broke the top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our favorite is Harmony Blend (not Healing Blend like it is advertised) and Pleasure Garden.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety of scents.</li>
            <li> enjoying 4 out of 5 of them.</li>
            <li> She should be the one writing this, not me, but being that I have knowledge of how great they work, I can say that they really relax the muscles.  </li>
            <li> so much more than lotion :)</li>
            <li> I ENJOYED RUBBING IT ON HER AND SEEING EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> As a learning massage therapist these are reasonably priced and smell great.</li>
            <li> Love the variety that each has to offer.</li>
            <li> so many variety of smell.</li>
            <li> I love the bag that the oils come in.</li>
            <li> Let the sexy times begin.</li>
            <li> I love this product  </li>
            <li> ( well really the massages are the gift) very nice.</li>
            <li> someone looking for a new favorite or just wanting to explore this pack is great to get.</li>
            <li> but it seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say harmony blend and sweet almond are definitely our favorites, but the rest are great as well and good for keeping this interesting with a variety.</li>
            <li> Amazing smells and quickly absorbs in your skin.  </li>
            <li> For 5 good sized bottles at this price point, there really isn&#x27;t any product on Amazon that I found that was a better deal.</li>
            <li> They all kind of have a strong tea tree oil smell, except for sweet almond, which has more of a dainty, romantic scent.</li>
            <li> Better suited for light touch, Swedish, sensual massage.  </li>
            <li> I used Prime and got my oils in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Packed safe and secure, no leakers.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> My husband and I are extremely happy because when we give each other massages, we each pick our own favorite smell.</li>
            <li> SHINE.CLEAN UP WAS EASY</li>
            <li> Greasy, strong smells .</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond was my favorite of the 5 scents.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self was light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Quick efficient delivery!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my boyfriend and I both enjoy massages.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that wasn&#x27;t too greasy and that would work into the skin allowing for a smooth massage.  </li>
            <li> Really relaxing and the scents are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to try different scents of massage oils.  </li>
            <li> These oils are smooth and do not leave the skin sticky.</li>
            <li> We enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> A great starting sample pack for massages.</li>
            <li> I love these, my girlfriend and I definitely use them fairly frequently, and they are so relaxing and great!</li>
            <li> I have not used all the oils so far but the two we used are good and my wife loves them.</li>
            <li> and many selections of Massage oils also love to change it up to give massage&#x27;s Highly recomend</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it its amazing</li>
            <li> i have tried this brand before but was really excited to try additional fragrances.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Been married 30 years, and one of our favorite ways &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just get the sweet almond scent</li>
            <li> u will never experience such a good feeling from anything else</li>
            <li> only like two out of the 5, good product.</li>
            <li> Not just that I ordered the pack that had the cool Indian picture on it</li>
            <li> Scents are ok overall, with the sweet almond being our favorite.</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because a couple of the oils did not smell that great, but the other 3 made up for it.</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied and enjoyed the purchase.</li>
            <li> After a massage it seems like the oil has dried up to an acceptable level leaving skin smooth and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product was as described.</li>
            <li> Purchased one of the Kama Sutra massage oils before, liked the ability to try the different scents available.  </li>
            <li> Kama Sutra makes high quality products for enhancing your love life.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a romantic evening, or helping that special someone relax after a long day!</li>
            <li> I really liked the larger sweet almond</li>
            <li> Great little sample package.</li>
            <li> It worth to use it.</li>
            <li> Range of beautiful and sensual fragrances in small bottles.</li>
            <li> The oils smelled nice, but they weren&#x27;t oily enough.  </li>
            <li> You can get dozens of massages out of each bottle, so if you get this set you won&#x27;t need more for years (unless you do this professionally).</li>
            <li> when you smell the 3 florals at first it is strong when smelled in the bottle, but when used its very aromatherapeutical.</li>
            <li> You can get their massage oils on anything and it washes right out.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like some nice scented oil giving your a significant other a relaxing massage.</li>
            <li> The scents are a little bit strong, there is an almond, minty kind and 3 floral ones..</li>
            <li> A blend of five different oils all with great scents that really last forever.</li>
            <li> This is such a great set to just try the different oil.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with the product overall.</li>
            <li> Customers love Kama Sutra products and we will continue to sell them in our romantic room packages on our Uberoom website.</li>
            <li> the scents were nice, nothing crazy good but definitely fun</li>
            <li> Giving massages it worked pretty well, im no pro</li>
            <li> Deep tissue would require alot more oil.</li>
            <li> First try...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> These massage oils are really good they don&#x27;t leave a messy grease</li>
            <li> These smell amazing and do not get you all oily like some other brands do.  </li>
            <li> Received them quickly and we&#x27;ll try one of new flavors this weekend.</li>
            <li> Massages are a great way to calm down the noise of a hectic life and really focus on your significant other.</li>
            <li> It works just like the first 2-3 minutes of lotion except for a whole lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottles have nice scents but they are not very strong.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased and look forward to my next massage!</li>
            <li> The oils themselves are of a pretty good quality and comes with a decent travel bag kinda plastic bag, the problem is the smells are really not appealing, I bought this for my gf</li>
            <li> OHH YEA SLAPPED SOME OF THIS GOOD STUFF ALL OVER MY LADY, HAD THE CANDLES ON MUSIC DOWN LOW RIGHT STUFF</li>
            <li> And I like the fact that it is edible oil so after a nice sensual massage I can give little kisses and not leave that oily feel in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Husband loved the oils on his hard working feet.</li>
            <li> They do not irritate, you can use them in the intimate parts without worring of burning sensation.</li>
            <li> a couple of the scents are a bit much</li>
            <li> Bought the whole sample pack to try them out.</li>
            <li> , one isn&#x27;t really for me because it is a bit  too flowery .  </li>
            <li> Will buy again, fast shiping.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and spreads very well.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to leave any noticeable residue and work well for a gentle, intimate massage.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing not to oily</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anybody who wants to&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product makes things that much easier</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I have enjoyed several very nice evenings of massage from these little bottles and they are not even close to empty!</li>
            <li> I do not use as much oil as I do with other products, it stays on/in the skin much better.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed using the oils on each other.  </li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews, our favorite was the almond.</li>
            <li> I would advise people to not lay directly on their nice bedding as these will leave oil marks on bedding so throw down some comfy blanket that you don&#x27;t care to much about.</li>
            <li> The sweet almond is really the only scent we like.</li>
            <li> the only scents i like are pleasure garden (which smells like roses), and sweet almond.</li>
            <li> only about 15% of the bottle is gone after 8 20 minute full body</li>
            <li> None of these are greasy, they don&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and you feel refreshed after a nice massage!</li>
            <li> Arrived REALLY quickly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neatly packaged and brand new.</li>
            <li> and I agree with others, the sweet almond is really nice (a couple of the other scents are a bit heavy for my liking, very floral).</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of different scented oils for sensual massage, I like it, I was only hoping that the bottles were larger, for some reason I did not look at the size of the bottles on the written description</li>
            <li> Its worth the price, you get 5 bottles and they last.</li>
            <li> Next time I will buy a larger, easy to dispense oil of the far glance</li>
            <li> Perhaps the set was very old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for nice smelling oils, and wanted to find something inexpensive yet of high quality - my lady and I typically exchange massages every now and again, and have used oils from big box stores that often had odd textures/smells, and also more sticky than smooth.  </li>
            <li> Are Kama Sutra Oils the secret to our long, happy marriage?  </li>
            <li> only used the Sweet Almond (thanks to the recommendation of other users) and Healing blend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading other reviews I got the impression that these were Trial bottles that would run out quickly.</li>
            <li> The 5 pack of different flavors is a little much for most of our customers (thus 3/5), so we only sell one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised with these.  </li>
            <li> The majority of these oils had very soothing fragrances (especially the Almond and Lavender</li>
            <li> not super greasy, but lasts long enough for a good back rub.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about my first oil I opened but the rest I liked.</li>
            <li> so we could try the other flavors in case there are other ones we like better.</li>
            <li> so a light squeeze isnt enough and sometimes a hard squeeze results in too much.</li>
            <li> The oil lasts long, much longer than the scent.</li>
            <li> and it really helps set the mood or even just to relax after a long week.</li>
            <li> They dry up way too fast.</li>
            <li> application generally does the trick.</li>
            <li> If that is happening, you are using too much or not massaging long enough!</li>
            <li> or they do have larger single bottles if you just want one certain scent or larger size</li>
            <li> (I have a black comforter on my bed and after the first message it took about 6 or 7 washings to totally get the oily marks out of it, but it did all come out.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting and made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> They are more expensive but the the quality is there and in the long run it is actually cheaper.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are a bit hard to squeeze but at the same time I think that assists in not dumping out too much!</li>
            <li> Useful to massage those tense muscles after a stressful workday.</li>
            <li> and I thought the little bottles were convenient, but the other 4 scents are very flowery.</li>
            <li> They go a long way too.</li>
            <li> Some of the other scents were a little on the strange side for my taste, but then again I have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> Lotion tends to dry out and get sticky.</li>
            <li> actually i have no idea how it works in terms of camasutra but the truth is that that oil smells very very hard , some ofthem are even disgusting not everyone would love that smell , if we would have a chose of flavores that would be better</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s hard to get the exact amount of oil out of the little bottles.</li>
            <li> In a typical 20 minute massage I found myself reapplying lotion multiple times.</li>
            <li> so they will last a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Only 4 stars due to the oil is SLIGHTLY watery.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> This was money well spent.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed no shower is needed after with this product and it leaves the skin softer compared to other oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews about placing a blanket over your sheets, I haven&#x27;t came across this need.</li>
            <li> lt;still&gt; to unwind and reconnect is by giving each other massage.</li>
            <li> I like to get variety sets, but I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers about the scents.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, it won&#x27;t disappointment me.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the lotion would dry up.</li>
            <li> I initially bought them so my girlfriend can use them on me after a hard days work</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottles are very small, only 2 oz.  </li>
            <li> A few of them don&#x27;t smell well.</li>
            <li> I guess you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing if you never experience it.</li>
            <li> I have used them up over the past few months.</li>
            <li> Had very little fragrance.</li>
            <li> We tried them one time, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to get into the mood.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all of the other ones are too spicy and harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard plastic</li>
            <li> did I, they are overpowering and not popular</li>
            <li> Discovered Kama Sutra products 30 years ago at a lingerie party, and have never gotten tired of them.  </li>
            <li> behind which was what I was concerned about.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a product is just disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also... if the massage leads to something else, they don&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste (just sayin&#x27;).</li>
            <li> the one I don&#x27;t like isn&#x27;t bad, just not for me.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used yet. :(</li>
            <li> Treat yourself and your spouse to these - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Smells awful!  </li>
            <li> these were some of the worst massage oils I have ever gotten.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Most of the oils are great. A few of them don&#x27;t smell well.</li>
            <li> We are pleased with the product overall. The bottles have nice scents but they are not very strong. The oil lasts long, much longer than the scent. We would probably try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> The variety of these is nice and they smell great.  They go a long way too.</li>
            <li> All provide excellent massage sensation, takes us to another place.  Plenty for many, many uses and all smell quite pleasant.  Our favorite is Serenity.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product because of the variety of scents to choose from and rubs into the body well</li>
            <li> Surprisingly great scents!</li>
            <li> My financee loves it, we&#x27;ve had really good times with these. The fragrance is not too strong, very pleasant. They do not irritate, you can use them in the intimate parts without worring of burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My wife loved these. They made for a great footrub experience. I thought all of the scents were great and this was well worht the money.</li>
            <li> Kama Sutra makes high quality products for enhancing your love life.  You can get their massage oils on anything and it washes right out.  The 5 pack of different flavors is a little much for most of our customers (thus 3/5), so we only sell one at a time.  Customers love Kama Sutra products and we will continue to sell them in our romantic room packages on our Uberoom website.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for all of the smells but the ones I didn&#x27;t like, my wife did. That&#x27;s the idea of a sample set though so it worked out and the oils worked well.</li>
            <li> I like the each smell and product. My Girlfriend like this product as well. It worth to use it. Lucky for me, it won&#x27;t disappointment me.</li>
            <li> One word...AMAZING!  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed using the oils on each other.  Amazing smells and quickly absorbs in your skin.  We LOVE it and we agreed to ALWAYS use the oils.  A MUST buy!</li>
            <li> Sometimes a product is just disappointing. This is one of them. The fragrances are not relaxing or enjoyable. Keep looking for massage oils.</li>
            <li> used this on the honeymoon and after. Good variety, we enjoyed using them. the scents were nice, nothing crazy good but definitely fun and we enjoyed trying them out. Giving massages it worked pretty well, im no pro but it seemed pretty good. Overall satisfied and enjoyed the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good stuff smells good.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a sampler but I did not like some of the fragrances. Next time I will buy a larger, easy to dispense oil of the far glance I like</li>
            <li> a couple of the scents are a bit much but, we love the oils. The oils work great and finish clean.</li>
            <li> Bought the whole sample pack to try them out. Decided sweet almond oil was the best, but it&#x27;s a matter of opinion so I recommend doing the same thing so you can pick your favorite</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. A blend of five different oils all with great scents that really last forever. My girlfriend and I have been using them for a while now and it really helps set the mood or even just to relax after a long week. Nothing like some nice scented oil giving your a significant other a relaxing massage. I&#x27;d say harmony blend and sweet almond are definitely our favorites, but the rest are great as well and good for keeping this interesting with a variety.</li>
            <li> i have tried this brand before but was really excited to try additional fragrances. I like most, one isn&#x27;t really for me because it is a bit  too flowery .  Overall I am very pleased and look forward to my next massage!</li>
            <li> Scents are ok overall, with the sweet almond being our favorite.</li>
            <li> Range of beautiful and sensual fragrances in small bottles. These oils do not irritate the skin. Will buy it again Love it +++</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with these.  They stink.  We tried them one time, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to get into the mood.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of oils with a fantastic variety of smells none of which I don&#x27;t enjoy. They are great as an after bath treat or to spice things up with your partner in the bedroom. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the larger sweet almond and I thought the little bottles were convenient, but the other 4 scents are very flowery. I&#x27;ll probably just end up using for baths.</li>
            <li> Best line of products out there.  They are more expensive but the the quality is there and in the long run it is actually cheaper.  I do not use as much oil as I do with other products, it stays on/in the skin much better.  I have also noticed no shower is needed after with this product and it leaves the skin softer compared to other oils.  And I like the fact that it is edible oil so after a nice sensual massage I can give little kisses and not leave that oily feel in my mouth.  Will buy again, fast shiping.</li>
            <li> the oils smell great and it came on time. My wife loves the smell of the oils and it was great to have when I give her a massage. I will order again when we run out of the oils.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my boyfriend and I both enjoy massages.  I was looking for a product that wasn&#x27;t too greasy and that would work into the skin allowing for a smooth massage.  We have tried a couple of the scents and really enjoy them!  I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys massages!</li>
            <li> 4 of the scents are great, one is just a bit off.</li>
            <li> This is such a great set to just try the different oil. Really relaxing and the scents are amazing. Had a wonderful time with them!</li>
            <li> I decided to get this sample pack to see which scent I liked best and I agree with others, the sweet almond is really nice (a couple of the other scents are a bit heavy for my liking, very floral). My boyfriend and I have enjoyed several very nice evenings of massage from these little bottles and they are not even close to empty! I would advise people to not lay directly on their nice bedding as these will leave oil marks on bedding so throw down some comfy blanket that you don&#x27;t care to much about. (I have a black comforter on my bed and after the first message it took about 6 or 7 washings to totally get the oily marks out of it, but it did all come out. Lesson learned, now we toss a fleece throw over the bed and it&#x27;s not a problem.) And after a shower I don&#x27;t feel oily (big plus in my book). Next time I order I&#x27;ll probably just get the sweet almond scent but I&#x27;m glad I order this so I could see which one I liked best.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my GF but I haven&#x27;t used yet. :( She will be getting a massage soon. But she loves the smells of these</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond was my favorite of the 5 scents. They all were applied well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for nice smelling oils, and wanted to find something inexpensive yet of high quality - my lady and I typically exchange massages every now and again, and have used oils from big box stores that often had odd textures/smells, and also more sticky than smooth.  The majority of these oils had very soothing fragrances (especially the Almond and Lavender I believe is what it was). Some of the other scents were a little on the strange side for my taste, but then again I have a sensitive nose. I could see getting used to all of the scents. The oil is long-lasting and of great quality, and the fragrances for the most part add to the relaxing quality - living up to the Kama Sutra name.  For 5 good sized bottles at this price point, there really isn&#x27;t any product on Amazon that I found that was a better deal. Your mileage may vary, but we liked it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> These were the perfect present for my boyfriends birthday! Along with a massage technique book, and a 1 hour massage coupon, he was elated. Giving it 4 stars because a couple of the oils did not smell that great, but the other 3 made up for it.</li>
            <li> For the price, i feel like the bottles should have been a bit bigger. the only scents i like are pleasure garden (which smells like roses), and sweet almond. texture is nice, though.</li>
            <li> Perfect size products to try out!  Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Did not like the products at all. Greasy, strong smells . Was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good oils.  Not greasy at all and spreads very well.  Better suited for light touch, Swedish, sensual massage.  Deep tissue would require alot more oil.</li>
            <li> Convert from Lotion to Massage Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I don&#x27;t offend you. I don&#x27;t believe in couples massages. That is to say that I have an obligation to my girlfriends back. Massages are a great way to calm down the noise of a hectic life and really focus on your significant other. We had been using body lotion for years and it worked great. I guess you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing if you never experience it. Stepping into the world of massage oils has made great alone time even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application generally does the trick. In a typical 20 minute massage I found myself reapplying lotion multiple times. After a few minutes the lotion would dry up. The Massage oils put an end to that and with perfect balance. They do not overdo it, we dont slip off the bed or anything. It works just like the first 2-3 minutes of lotion except for a whole lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve only used the Sweet Almond (thanks to the recommendation of other users) and Healing blend. only about 15% of the bottle is gone after 8 20 minute full body massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dock a star for the plastic build quality. I find it&#x27;s hard to get the exact amount of oil out of the little bottles. It&#x27;s a hard plastic so a light squeeze isnt enough and sometimes a hard squeeze results in too much. We also dropped it (4ft) onto a hardwood floor and broke the top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews about placing a blanket over your sheets, I haven&#x27;t came across this need. After a massage it seems like the oil has dried up to an acceptable level leaving skin smooth and smelling great. We never notice any residue anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews I got the impression that these were Trial bottles that would run out quickly. Again, that hasn&#x27;t been the case for us. I can see these lasting for quite awhile. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to try different scents of massage oils.  Our favorite is Harmony Blend (not Healing Blend like it is advertised) and Pleasure Garden.  My only complaint is that the bottles are very small, only 2 oz.  There are 5 of them so they will last a little bit.  Next time we will just get a larger bottle of either Harmony or Pleasure.</li>
            <li> Had very little fragrance. I could not tell a difference between them. Perhaps the set was very old. I have used this product before; the fragrance was definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> A great product - I love the variety of scents. The oil isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too soon, but it also doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Been married 30 years, and one of our favorite ways &amp;lt;still&gt; to unwind and reconnect is by giving each other massage. We love this product, because we get a variety of scents in nice, travel-sized bottles.  Discovered Kama Sutra products 30 years ago at a lingerie party, and have never gotten tired of them.  Wonderful scents and perfect weight/consistency for massage. Also... if the massage leads to something else, they don&#x27;t have an unpleasant taste (just sayin&#x27;). Are Kama Sutra Oils the secret to our long, happy marriage?  Probably not, but they sure haven&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> enjoying 4 out of 5 of them. really appreciate the chance to try few different smells. they&#x27;re all refreshing in their own way. the one I don&#x27;t like isn&#x27;t bad, just not for me.</li>
            <li> These are great and each fun to use for a variety of fragrances. I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I used Prime and got my oils in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Packed safe and secure, no leakers.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with oil, not greasy, goes on just right, you don&#x27;t need too much.&lt;br /&gt;You can get this sample pack of 5 or they do have larger single bottles if you just want one certain scent or larger size but we like having the different scents around to choose from.</li>
            <li> i loved each and every smell the price is amazing the product is amazing u will never experience such a good feeling from anything else buy this product i highly recommend it its amazing i love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> I like to get variety sets, but I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers about the scents. The sweet almond is really the only scent we like. Unfortunately all of the other ones are too spicy and harsh. They all kind of have a strong tea tree oil smell, except for sweet almond, which has more of a dainty, romantic scent.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product was as described. Would order again!</li>
            <li> My Kama Sutra Massage Oils, Set of Five Kit arrived on time and in good condition.  This is a great value for such a great product.  The scents of each are equally great.  I initially bought them so my girlfriend can use them on me after a hard days work, that didn&#x27;t happen.  Instead I ended up applying them on her, oh well.  She should be the one writing this, not me, but being that I have knowledge of how great they work, I can say that they really relax the muscles.  She literally falls asleep when I massage her with these Oils.  It must be a great feeling to be able to fall asleep while being massaged, I wouldn&#x27;t know.  I recommend this product, it does work.  I rate this a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Great oils for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these oils are great, the scents are lovely as well.&lt;br /&gt;for someone looking for a new favorite or just wanting to explore this pack is great to get. Great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;discreet packaging and easy to read labels.</li>
            <li> The oil leaks out of the bottle BEWARE! Never used for anything but a night foot massage. Husband loved the oils on his hard working feet.</li>
            <li> Great little sample package. First try... The fragrance weren&#x27;t the best but it helps to spark the night. Perfect for the prepared guy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about my first oil I opened but the rest I liked.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing and do not get you all oily like some other brands do.  They all smell awesome!  Love them!</li>
            <li> Smell good, works well, I like oils so much more than lotion :)</li>
            <li> nice fragrances, not sticky like some massage oils</li>
            <li> I bought these as a surprise for my wife for our 20th anniversary trip. This was money well spent. Like some of the other reviews, our favorite was the almond. None of these are greasy, they don&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and you feel refreshed after a nice massage! Treat yourself and your spouse to these - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great Delivery... and many selections of Massage oils also love to change it up to give massage&#x27;s Highly recomend</li>
            <li> Not so great, won&#x27;t get again</li>
            <li> Nicely scented.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Delivered very fast. The product is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good give package for those whose like massages.</li>
            <li> Purchased one of the Kama Sutra massage oils before, liked the ability to try the different scents available.  happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells awful!  I went back to using the lavender baby oil! Much cheaper and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> actually i have no idea how it works in terms of camasutra but the truth is that that oil smells very very hard , some ofthem are even disgusting not everyone would love that smell , if we would have a chose of flavores that would be better</li>
            <li> I bought these oils because my husband loves a back rub and these were just  what we needed. Lotion tends to dry out and get sticky. These oils are smooth and do not leave the skin sticky. I like 4 out of 5 of the scents.</li>
            <li> I have not used all the oils so far but the two we used are good and my wife loves them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of different scented oils for sensual massage, I like it, I was only hoping that the bottles were larger, for some reason I did not look at the size of the bottles on the written description so there is only about 2 oz in each but they do make a handy travel kit. I have used them up over the past few months. and you can let your massage partner pick the scent that they want.</li>
            <li> Great price for great oils....We have used them all and almond is the best!!</li>
            <li> The scents of these oils are wonderful. The bottles are a bit hard to squeeze but at the same time I think that assists in not dumping out too much! A little goes a long way. No problems with residue or stains. If that is happening, you are using too much or not massaging long enough!</li>
            <li> Nice oils with very nice fragrances.  They don&#x27;t seem to leave any noticeable residue and work well for a gentle, intimate massage.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift.( well really the massages are the gift) very nice. not super greasy, but lasts long enough for a good back rub.</li>
            <li> only like two out of the 5, good product. a must buy. bought it for my then boyfriend, i like how it rubs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good massage. Smells good and works great.</li>
            <li> Nice oils that smell good.</li>
            <li> Very nice scents! We enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> I love Kama Sutras products! Their massage oils are the best, very fragrant, and absorb well. They are not sticky at all, and did I mention they smell amazing?! Perfect for a romantic evening, or helping that special someone relax after a long day!</li>
            <li> I ENJOYED RUBBING IT ON HER AND SEEING EVERYTHING SHINE.CLEAN UP WAS EASY BUT WE DID IT ON THE FLOOR TO MAKE SURE WE DIDNT STAIN THE BED.</li>
            <li> I like the gift set but the Almond is the best. I had the Almond prior and wanted to try the others.  Most are fair at best.</li>
            <li> not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> As a learning massage therapist these are reasonably priced and smell great.</li>
            <li> The oils smelled nice, but they weren&#x27;t oily enough.  They dry up way too fast. Not just that I ordered the pack that had the cool Indian picture on it and I got one with a couple on it.</li>
            <li> Love the variety that each has to offer. They are silky and don&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. A great starting sample pack for massages.</li>
            <li> These were a great buy, the oils smell really great, it was a great buy, fast shipping, and i would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Having never bought any massage oil before, I tried this pack to see what I liked. Not all smelled good. Tossed two of the five because I thought they stunk!  This might be different for someone else though. The oil it&#x27;s self was light and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I couldnt find this kind of oil anywhere else, it comes it so many variety of smell. My husband and I are extremely happy because when we give each other massages, we each pick our own favorite smell. I love the bag that the oils come in.</li>
            <li> The oils themselves are of a pretty good quality and comes with a decent travel bag kinda plastic bag, the problem is the smells are really not appealing, I bought this for my gf and she didn&#x27;t like any of them, honestly neither did I, they are overpowering and not popular kinda smells, I would not have bought it if I had had the opportunity before hand to smell them</li>
            <li> I love these, my girlfriend and I definitely use them fairly frequently, and they are so relaxing and great! Let the sexy times begin. ;)</li>
            <li> Great value for a really great product.</li>
            <li> these were some of the worst massage oils I have ever gotten.  They do not have good smells and some are very similar.  I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Quick efficient delivery! Looks and smells delightful!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice selection of oils for a great price.  You can get dozens of massages out of each bottle, so if you get this set you won&#x27;t need more for years (unless you do this professionally).</li>
            <li> OHH YEA SLAPPED SOME OF THIS GOOD STUFF ALL OVER MY LADY, HAD THE CANDLES ON MUSIC DOWN LOW RIGHT STUFF</li>
            <li> What can I say about massage oils...but oh yeah!! Seriously, nice package...love it! I give this my stamp of approval.</li>
            <li> Very soothing not to oily I love this product  I recommend it to anybody who wants to&lt;br /&gt;give a nice massage to a love one</li>
            <li> what a nice selection of their oils. Very long lasting and made with natural ingredients. would buy this product again for gifts.</li>
            <li> A nice variety pack.Useful to massage those tense muscles after a stressful workday.Add this in with your four play!!</li>
            <li> Arrived REALLY quickly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neatly packaged and brand new. Only 4 stars due to the oil is SLIGHTLY watery. Nothing that effects the quality of the product but still awesome!</li>
            <li> this product makes things that much easier and i cannot say how using this and the book has relieved stress and done a number of things for me and my wife.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I have used the almond oil on multiple occasions over the last several years. I bought the oil set so we could try the other flavors in case there are other ones we like better. Received them quickly and we&#x27;ll try one of new flavors this weekend.</li>
            <li> These massage oils are really good they don&#x27;t leave a messy grease behind which was what I was concerned about. The scents are a little bit strong, there is an almond, minty kind and 3 floral ones.. when you smell the 3 florals at first it is strong when smelled in the bottle, but when used its very aromatherapeutical. Its worth the price, you get 5 bottles and they last.</li>
