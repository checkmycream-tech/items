            <li>The eye cream has so many wonderful ingredients...Organic Aloe, Alpha Hydroxy Acid, Vitamin E and Vitamin C, which is proven to be beneficial to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream was pleasant and did not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I guess this would would be perfect for preventing fine lines and wrinkles so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>This is a good cream for the eyes.</li>

            <li>I will say however, I did feel it was a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream and it feels good going on, but it&#x27;s not a miracle cream.</li>
            <li>Yalmeh Peerless Beauty was very nice and made sure to send me lots of information about their product.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I liked the gel over the cream which I was sent both of them to try out.</li>
            <li>All of my feedback and review are my own and 100%</li>
            <li>eye cream is a product that will protect and moisturize in an effective manner.  </li>
            <li>eye cream is a product that will protect and moisturize in an effective manner.  </li>
            <li>I would also definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good eye cream or even an excellent make up primer.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product as well, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the aloe!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results I got from using this Super Youth Eye Cream from Yalmeh!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying creams or serums on Amazon anymore, either to many fakes</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>I guess I have to continue to use it in order to see more results.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just preferred the consistency a bit more.</li>

            <li>This will not impact the rating because the product itself is most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however I do see that the area around my eyes are more hydrated after using the cream.</li>
            <li>so it was more preventative than any thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be trying more of the products</li>
            <li>most of the time anyway...</li>
            <li>The best thing about this eye cream, is that it&#x27;s NOT tested on animals and leaves not only my eye area, but my face so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I like the face moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it twice a day and can be used under makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to try this product.</li>
            <li>They continued to check up with me to make sure I was enjoying the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I did not say they magically disappeared, but they began to fade.</li>
            <li>My eyes are feeling much better now.</li>
            <li>Maybe you have to have more severe problems for it to work?</li>
            <li>I won this eye cream in a giveaway and think it is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with Yalmeh Super Youth Eyecream.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in lines, but I do like using this cream.  </li>
            <li>After using the product for 3 weeks, my eyes don&#x27;t look so sunken in and there aren&#x27;t as many fine lines and wrinkles anymore.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all but would be great for skin that needs help to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>These ingredients also allowed the oils and vitamins to nourish the area and most importantly, moisturize.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Thank you for making such a good product.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Super bummer</li>
            <li>a door opened and in came Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I noticed my eye area remained plump and just healthy in appearance, followed by feeling smooth and soft when touched.</li>
            <li>With the Super Youth Eye Cream I found that when I started using it, my eye makeup began to come off easier at night when I washed my face before bed.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>I honestly noticed a difference after the first week and so far I&#x27;m still seeing improvements.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference!!</li>
            <li>Yalmeh has such amazing products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I really like how light it is and how it glides on.</li>
            <li>Apply to freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye cream makes my eye area so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Companies that stand by their products are worth trying and the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty brand does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Companies that stand by their products are worth trying and the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty brand does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this luxurious soft cream on my eye area skin.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this product because I have very fair skin, so my dark circles are very noticeable without makeup.</li>
            <li>What I love about this eye cream is that it hydrates my skin, reduces the appearance of dark circles, brightens my eyes and helps me maintain a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>, I would not suggest using it out of the box without making sure you have no other eye products on.</li>
            <li>Still, it is quite gentle and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The cream is white with a very light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is plant derived including all natural ingredients, it is free of glutens and fillers,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I started to read the ingredient list first.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that the ingredient list consist of various organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Personally I do not like parfum in creams because that is just more chemicals</li>
            <li>After a couple times of using this eye cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eye puffiness is somewhat better, but with any facial product, I know it takes a longer time to see maximum results.  </li>
            <li>and I did try different foundation brands to make sure this did not occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first week, I noticed constant hydration to the eye area and this was more visible after I washed my face.</li>
            <li>This is a light soft cream for the under eye.</li>
            <li>It might work better on younger skin to prolong  a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I think my upper eyelids look a lot better than they did.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the coolness of the cream on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product it is part of my daily face routine</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far, it makes my  skin feel so very soft and the people sent complete instructions which I very much appreciate.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this eye cream after reading many good reviews but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>No matter how much I slept, what I ate/or gave-up, no matter how much I scrubbed or what I rubbed on - the weight of the world sagged under my eyes!</li>
            <li>In The Mail Pretty Fast</li>
            <li>and I think this is a good deal for the price compared to items I’ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight rose scent.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice little gift for someone who wants a hydrating eye cream instead of a eye gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I have to say the packaging is absolutely adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this won&#x27;t help at all really.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy was receiving several emails from the company to get my opinion on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li>I really like it because it is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use because I really like this product</li>
            <li>I only put on a light dot of cream in 4-5 places under each eye with my middle finger and gently smooth it on.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating .</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Yalmeh&#x27; s super youth eye cream treats and repairs wrinkles, dark circles and reduces the look of age spots and reduces fine lines around the eyes</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this!!!</li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes for many years and nothing seem to help.</li>
            <li>I would request a larger size next time as I like to keep using my products for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used it a short time but so far it leaves my skin feeling soothed and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently received Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream to try and review.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Good stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>:) I have using it for about a month n half and wow!</li>
            <li>I am an avid aficionado of anti aging products and Yalmeh’s eye creams have been one of my favorite products lately.</li>
            <li>You may notice it right away or later on.</li>
            <li>Its a wonderful product that women like myself can appreciate, working late nights, not getting enough sleep or for women who just struggle in getting rid of the dark circles around our eye area.</li>
            <li>I liked that this cream is visually thick, when dabbing a fingertip to apply it on the eye area it is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>and it made the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li>After using it, the skin around my eyes felt very soft.</li>
            <li>It does not take very much to moisturize each eye either, so the container should last quite some time.</li>
            <li>Now, the company makes the claim &amp;#34;Watch the fine lines in the corners of your eyes be reduced to the point that they are no longer visible.&amp;#34;... I have not seen that happen yet, but I have notice it has helped in the appearance of my wrinkles a bit, they do seem somewhat less noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Going on to week two, I noticed the same positive results but an even tone when it came to color/pigmentation of the area.</li>
            <li>After a few days, when I was sure it wasn’t going to dry my skin out or irritate my eyes, I started using it around my whole eye area: under eye, on cheekbones, side of eyes, and up to brow bone.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the jar was not well covered when you screw open the top which is a flaw because the little cap that was suppose to cover the cream was stuck in the spiral of the cap.</li>
            <li>Steer clear.</li>
            <li>Its soft as if I was putting lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>Thicker than yogurt and far from the watery consistency of lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought the larger size of this product, as I apply it much heavier than directed.</li>
            <li>Far I Like It</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy as some eye creams are.</li>
            <li>Been using this for nearly months with no visible effects.</li>
            <li>Then I got the opportunity to try some Super Youth Eye cream from Yalmeh for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This cream offers other benefits such as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it removes old skin and allows new skin to be produced and protects the skin around the eyes from further signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I did not notice differences when it came to fine lines and wrinkles because I have very little in those areas, but</li>
            <li>I did not notice differences when it came to fine lines and wrinkles because I have very little in those areas, but</li>
            <li>It is thick like a cream (not thin like a lotion or serum) which I love since I have dry</li>
            <li>Trying something new next month.</li>
            <li>and it has slightly reduced the dark circle under my eyes and have made my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>It looks thick but glides onto skin smoothly and leaves the eye area soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is, they do offer a 90 day money back guarantee, so if you&#x27;re not happy, you have nothing to lose if you want to try</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have dry or sensitive</li>
            <li>The only affect so far I have recieved is a moisturizing effect under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not sure how well this is working, but the order came quickly.  </li>
            <li>My eyes have become more youthful in 4 weeks dramatic results.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients range from natural oils, gels and extracts to natural plant based products, even some organic based.</li>
            <li>I used to wake up with puffy eyes…regardless of how much or how little sleep I get.</li>

            <li> Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I liked the gel over the cream which I was sent both of them to try out.</li>
            <li> All of my feedback and review are my own and 100%</li>
            <li> eye cream is a product that will protect and moisturize in an effective manner.  </li>
            <li> eye cream is a product that will protect and moisturize in an effective manner.  </li>
            <li> I would also definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good eye cream or even an excellent make up primer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product as well, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the aloe!  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I got from using this Super Youth Eye Cream from Yalmeh!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying creams or serums on Amazon anymore, either to many fakes</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to continue to use it in order to see more results.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I just preferred the consistency a bit more.</li>

            <li> This will not impact the rating because the product itself is most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however I do see that the area around my eyes are more hydrated after using the cream.</li>
            <li> so it was more preventative than any thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be trying more of the products</li>
            <li> most of the time anyway...</li>
            <li> The best thing about this eye cream, is that it&#x27;s NOT tested on animals and leaves not only my eye area, but my face so smooth!  </li>
            <li> I like the face moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it twice a day and can be used under makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to try this product.</li>
            <li> They continued to check up with me to make sure I was enjoying the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I did not say they magically disappeared, but they began to fade.</li>
            <li> My eyes are feeling much better now.</li>
            <li> Maybe you have to have more severe problems for it to work?</li>
            <li> I won this eye cream in a giveaway and think it is just okay.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Yalmeh Super Youth Eyecream.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in lines, but I do like using this cream.  </li>
            <li> After using the product for 3 weeks, my eyes don&#x27;t look so sunken in and there aren&#x27;t as many fine lines and wrinkles anymore.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all but would be great for skin that needs help to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> These ingredients also allowed the oils and vitamins to nourish the area and most importantly, moisturize.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> Super bummer</li>
            <li> a door opened and in came Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eye area remained plump and just healthy in appearance, followed by feeling smooth and soft when touched.</li>
            <li> With the Super Youth Eye Cream I found that when I started using it, my eye makeup began to come off easier at night when I washed my face before bed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> I honestly noticed a difference after the first week and so far I&#x27;m still seeing improvements.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference!!</li>
            <li> Yalmeh has such amazing products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I really like how light it is and how it glides on.</li>
            <li> Apply to freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this eye cream makes my eye area so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Companies that stand by their products are worth trying and the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty brand does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Companies that stand by their products are worth trying and the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty brand does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this luxurious soft cream on my eye area skin.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this product because I have very fair skin, so my dark circles are very noticeable without makeup.</li>
            <li> What I love about this eye cream is that it hydrates my skin, reduces the appearance of dark circles, brightens my eyes and helps me maintain a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> , I would not suggest using it out of the box without making sure you have no other eye products on.</li>
            <li> Still, it is quite gentle and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The cream is white with a very light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is plant derived including all natural ingredients, it is free of glutens and fillers,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I started to read the ingredient list first.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that the ingredient list consist of various organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Personally I do not like parfum in creams because that is just more chemicals</li>
            <li> After a couple times of using this eye cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eye puffiness is somewhat better, but with any facial product, I know it takes a longer time to see maximum results.  </li>
            <li> and I did try different foundation brands to make sure this did not occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first week, I noticed constant hydration to the eye area and this was more visible after I washed my face.</li>
            <li> This is a light soft cream for the under eye.</li>
            <li> It might work better on younger skin to prolong  a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I think my upper eyelids look a lot better than they did.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the coolness of the cream on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is part of my daily face routine</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far, it makes my  skin feel so very soft and the people sent complete instructions which I very much appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye cream after reading many good reviews but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> No matter how much I slept, what I ate/or gave-up, no matter how much I scrubbed or what I rubbed on - the weight of the world sagged under my eyes!</li>
            <li> In The Mail Pretty Fast</li>
            <li> and I think this is a good deal for the price compared to items I’ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight rose scent.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice little gift for someone who wants a hydrating eye cream instead of a eye gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I have to say the packaging is absolutely adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this won&#x27;t help at all really.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy was receiving several emails from the company to get my opinion on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Yalmeh.  </li>
            <li> I really like it because it is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use because I really like this product</li>
            <li> I only put on a light dot of cream in 4-5 places under each eye with my middle finger and gently smooth it on.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating .</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Yalmeh&#x27; s super youth eye cream treats and repairs wrinkles, dark circles and reduces the look of age spots and reduces fine lines around the eyes</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this!!!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes for many years and nothing seem to help.</li>
            <li> I would request a larger size next time as I like to keep using my products for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used it a short time but so far it leaves my skin feeling soothed and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently received Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream to try and review.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> :) I have using it for about a month n half and wow!</li>
            <li> I am an avid aficionado of anti aging products and Yalmeh’s eye creams have been one of my favorite products lately.</li>
            <li> You may notice it right away or later on.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product that women like myself can appreciate, working late nights, not getting enough sleep or for women who just struggle in getting rid of the dark circles around our eye area.</li>
            <li> I liked that this cream is visually thick, when dabbing a fingertip to apply it on the eye area it is not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> and it made the skin around my eyes very soft.</li>
            <li> After using it, the skin around my eyes felt very soft.</li>
            <li> It does not take very much to moisturize each eye either, so the container should last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Now, the company makes the claim &amp;#34;Watch the fine lines in the corners of your eyes be reduced to the point that they are no longer visible.&amp;#34;... I have not seen that happen yet, but I have notice it has helped in the appearance of my wrinkles a bit, they do seem somewhat less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Going on to week two, I noticed the same positive results but an even tone when it came to color/pigmentation of the area.</li>
            <li> After a few days, when I was sure it wasn’t going to dry my skin out or irritate my eyes, I started using it around my whole eye area: under eye, on cheekbones, side of eyes, and up to brow bone.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the jar was not well covered when you screw open the top which is a flaw because the little cap that was suppose to cover the cream was stuck in the spiral of the cap.</li>
            <li> Steer clear.</li>
            <li> Its soft as if I was putting lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li> Thicker than yogurt and far from the watery consistency of lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought the larger size of this product, as I apply it much heavier than directed.</li>
            <li> Far I Like It</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy as some eye creams are.</li>
            <li> Been using this for nearly months with no visible effects.</li>
            <li> Then I got the opportunity to try some Super Youth Eye cream from Yalmeh for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This cream offers other benefits such as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it removes old skin and allows new skin to be produced and protects the skin around the eyes from further signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I did not notice differences when it came to fine lines and wrinkles because I have very little in those areas, but</li>
            <li> I did not notice differences when it came to fine lines and wrinkles because I have very little in those areas, but</li>
            <li> It is thick like a cream (not thin like a lotion or serum) which I love since I have dry</li>
            <li> Trying something new next month.</li>
            <li> and it has slightly reduced the dark circle under my eyes and have made my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> It looks thick but glides onto skin smoothly and leaves the eye area soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is, they do offer a 90 day money back guarantee, so if you&#x27;re not happy, you have nothing to lose if you want to try</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have dry or sensitive</li>
            <li> The only affect so far I have recieved is a moisturizing effect under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this is working, but the order came quickly.  </li>
            <li> My eyes have become more youthful in 4 weeks dramatic results.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients range from natural oils, gels and extracts to natural plant based products, even some organic based.</li>
            <li> I used to wake up with puffy eyes…regardless of how much or how little sleep I get.</li>
            <li> I have nothing against perfume in cosmetics but some people are sensitive to perfume due to their chemical nature.</li>
            <li> The lifelong dark circles and their accompanying bags are so much diminished they are essentially negligible...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this cream because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also liked that the cream has a very faint scent similar to flowers.</li>
            <li> I can apply my makeup shortly after application and do not have to wait a long time for it to absorb.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is milky and slightly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream for a week and so far I do not see any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> The dark circle is getting smaller and smaller.</li>
            <li> Of course it is long and contains of names that I have never heard of.</li>
            <li> Also the price is far above reasonable for the amount you get, especially considering how expensive other eye creams can get!</li>
            <li> It has also helped in moisturizing the dry patches that I often get on the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It made my under eyes so dry that the skin was crinkled when I applied my makeup.</li>
            <li> my lips will look dry and so will the sides (corners) and bottom portion of my eye.</li>
            <li> Creamy texture and a little jar will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> cream is a milky white and almost look like yogurt beside the little bubble looking holes.</li>
            <li> My redness and pink skin was now just matching the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> not at all as written and expected</li>
            <li> and I have seen maybe, only a slight reduction with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This stuff also goes a long way with just a few dabs under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream deserves to stand alone(in terms of how it compares to other eye creams).</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped lines or dark circles, although I have minimal of both.</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past with eyecreams making my eyes itch &amp; swell (eye allergies) or actually “burning” my skin (it basically became red &amp; raw) because the ingredients were too harsh.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream has helped a lot with the puffiness and dark circles I sometimes get around my eyes.</li>
            <li> As for the dark circles I don’t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and my dark circles didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> Leaving dark coffee stains as if my face was a table and life forgot to use a coaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase it for wrinkles, but for dark eye bags.  </li>
            <li> Also, addresses dark circles, reduction in the look of age spots, moisturizes and softens the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had issues with eye creams/serums in the past where a few hours later my make-up appears as if I never blended it in and sort of floats on top of whatever base I used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles and can&#x27;t say if it would reduce them.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the dark circles were fading.</li>
            <li> It did not make my dark circles disappear</li>
            <li> Part is do to seasonal allergies and the other part is just my luck!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I am using less and less cover up for my dark circle in the morning.</li>
            <li> wrinkles by eyes seem to be less.  </li>
            <li> I typically use this at night after I wash my face</li>
            <li> It does not address the typical problems</li>
            <li> Stings a little, but like the smell.</li>
            <li> eye cream does not leave an oily or greasy feeling and makes, what little dark circles I have, diminish to where they&#x27;re not as noticeable!  </li>
            <li> LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> and it smooths the dried out look.</li>
            <li> Started to feel difference after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This really really helped clear out the nasty dark circles I had under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Finished the entire jar, religiously using it day and night and found ZERO change or improvement:-(</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the WORST I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
            <li> I found the cream (in a jar) to be very heavy and occlusive for the eye</li>
            <li> The dense cream inside is white(like the color and consistency of cold facial</li>
            <li> My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.t, to irritate the delicate skin we have around our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the delicate under eye skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using a very small amount just under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have been sadly amused by the dark circles that have set up camp under my eyes for longer than I care to admit.</li>
            <li> or they are not good to begin with.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from dark circles under my eyes I was hoping for a resolution.</li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t make them worse.</li>
            <li> The cream sort of calms the ill effects I experience from seasonal allergies and does not allow the tearing I may get, to irritate the delicate skin we have around our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within just moments I could see a dramatic improvement in the darkening baggage that surrounded my eyes.</li>
            <li> The price is hard to beat!!</li>
            <li> Anti-aging products can be really expensive</li>
            <li> Will stop buying expensive eye products and switch to this one.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a product made of organic aloe, grape seed oil, vitamin E and C etc!  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used product as directed and never saw any results for over a month. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying creams or serums on Amazon anymore, either to many fakes or they are not good to begin with. Super bummer</li>
            <li> excellent customer service and that must be recognized 1st. Besides that, this works great. My eyes have become more youthful in 4 weeks dramatic results. I will be buying more for Christmas gifts. Its a wonderful product that women like myself can appreciate, working late nights, not getting enough sleep or for women who just struggle in getting rid of the dark circles around our eye area. Give this a try</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any changes and Ive been using it for almost three weeks. The only affect so far I have recieved is a moisturizing effect under my eyes. Its soft as if I was putting lotion on my face. I guess I have to continue to use it in order to see more results. As someone who suffers from dark circles under my eyes I was hoping for a resolution. But it has yet to come.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Yalmeh and its products – most specially their eye creams! I am an avid aficionado of anti aging products and Yalmeh’s eye creams have been one of my favorite products lately. I used to wake up with puffy eyes…regardless of how much or how little sleep I get. This eye cream has helped a lot with the puffiness and dark circles I sometimes get around my eyes. It has also helped in moisturizing the dry patches that I often get on the corners of my eyes. I love it and I will keep on using/repurchasing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything different from before to after. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I been using it for about two weeks and it has slightly reduced the dark circle under my eyes and have made my skin feel very smooth. It has a slight rose scent. It does not leave a greasy, oily feeling when applied. I have sensitive skin and I have not had any issues. You can also use around your mouth, forehead, and cheek area to reduce fine. It works great.    *Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I liked the gel over the cream which I was sent both of them to try out. I just preferred the consistency a bit more. This really really helped clear out the nasty dark circles I had under my eyes. This stuff also goes a long way with just a few dabs under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Yalmeh has such amazing products and this one is no exception. This eye cream is plant derived including all natural ingredients, it is free of glutens and fillers, is GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) free and cruelty free, and is not tested on animals. What I love about this eye cream is that it hydrates my skin, reduces the appearance of dark circles, brightens my eyes and helps me maintain a more youthful appearance. This cream offers other benefits such as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it removes old skin and allows new skin to be produced and protects the skin around the eyes from further signs of aging. I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles at the moment so I cannot testify to its anti-aging effects but I will say that after applying this cream around my eyes they feel firmer. I guess this would would be perfect for preventing fine lines and wrinkles so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I honestly noticed a difference after the first week and so far I&#x27;m still seeing improvements. Also the price is far above reasonable for the amount you get, especially considering how expensive other eye creams can get! Thank you Yalmeh! This product is fantastic. - See more at: http://www.yalmeh.com/yalmeh-aloe-super-youth-eye-cream-eye-cream-for-wrinkles-for-men-women/#sthash.b7YiyzDm.dpuf</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for testing and reviewing purposes. All of my feedback and review are my own and 100% honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I have to say the packaging is absolutely adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the jar I noticed that the jar was not well covered when you screw open the top which is a flaw because the little cap that was suppose to cover the cream was stuck in the spiral of the cap. You may notice it right away or later on. This will not impact the rating because the product itself is most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to read the ingredient list first. Of course it is long and contains of names that I have never heard of. I was pleased to see that the ingredient list consist of various organic ingredients. I must point out that there was no “parfum” on the list because the scent of the cream does smell like it contains some sort of perfume or fragrance. I have nothing against perfume in cosmetics but some people are sensitive to perfume due to their chemical nature. Personally I do not like parfum in creams because that is just more chemicals and I do have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a milky white and almost look like yogurt beside the little bubble looking holes. The consistency is thick. Thicker than yogurt and far from the watery consistency of lotion. The fragrance is milky and slightly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cream for a week and so far I do not see any irritation or redness. I have dark circles under my eyes for many years and nothing seem to help. Of course I do not expect miracle from this product however I do see that the area around my eyes are more hydrated after using the cream. As for the dark circles I don’t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Really awful stuff! I purchased this and the moisturizer because of the wonderful reviews. Steer clear. Both products stink - literally and figuratively. It made my under eyes so dry that the skin was crinkled when I applied my makeup. I have never had that issue before except when I forgot my under eye cream on vacation. Hence - it does nothing and is like applying none at all. I would highly recommend NOT purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> great product works good buy it. I got free for exchange for review.</li>
            <li> this won&#x27;t help at all really. I used it for 3 weeks and my dark circles didn&#x27;t budge. But it won&#x27;t make them worse.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, I love the natural ingredients on it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be able to review Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream #eyecream15USA. Yalmeh&#x27; s super youth eye cream treats and repairs wrinkles, dark circles and reduces the look of age spots and reduces fine lines around the eyes, so I thought this would be great for me. This eye cream is really easy to apply. After using the product for 3 weeks, my eyes don&#x27;t look so sunken in and there aren&#x27;t as many fine lines and wrinkles anymore. I will definitely keep using the eye cream, because it says some people don&#x27;t see results for 3 months, and since I&#x27;m already seeing some improvements now, I can&#x27;t wait to see what my eyes look like in 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.**</li>
            <li> I was born with a CURSE on my face for all those around me to read night and day. No matter how much I slept, what I ate/or gave-up, no matter how much I scrubbed or what I rubbed on - the weight of the world sagged under my eyes! Leaving dark coffee stains as if my face was a table and life forgot to use a coaster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a door opened and in came Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just moments I could see a dramatic improvement in the darkening baggage that surrounded my eyes. Not only the color improved though, the skin tightened too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first sample of Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream at no cost in return for sharing my honest opinion about the product. I would highly recommend Yalmeh&#x27;s Super Youth Eye Cream and hope it works as good for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream....seems fine I&#x27;m in my 20s so it was more preventative than any thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t enjoy was receiving several emails from the company to get my opinion on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then today I received a PHONE CALL in the middle of my work day to ask me about the product and get me to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well- here is my review. The product seems fine but the company customer service is abrasive and annoying.</li>
            <li> Creamy texture and a little jar will last a very long time.  Started using it and hope it gets rid of my bags under my eyes...wrinkles by eyes seem to be less.  Stings a little, but like the smell.</li>
            <li> It seems to sting my eyes. I only use it on the lower lids for the discoloration.  It may help the discoloration if you can take the sting.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for the eyes. I would request a larger size next time as I like to keep using my products for more than 6 months. The dense cream inside is white(like the color and consistency of cold facial cream).I first tried it blindly on top of  another serum(I forgot I had already applied a serum and a lotion in the morning, I would not suggest using it out of the box without making sure you have no other eye products on. This cream deserves to stand alone(in terms of how it compares to other eye creams). Apply to freshly washed skin. Dab one finger lightly in the cream and apply around eyes. This cream to me seems to have a light emollient to it&#x3D; oil based. It is not heavy at all but would be great for skin that needs help to retain moisture. I also liked that the cream has a very faint scent similar to flowers. Very pretty and it goes away quickly. The packaging has a lot of writing on it which may be the ingredient list, however I wish it was easier to view. I liked that this cream is visually thick, when dabbing a fingertip to apply it on the eye area it is not heavy at all. The cream disappears into the skin no rubbing needed- just a light finger pressure. I found it to be most hydrating for my upper eyelids and that is where I continue to use it most! This would make a nice little gift for someone who wants a hydrating eye cream instead of a eye gel. If your a woman who likes to slather creams on buy two of these and you should be good for 3 months. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far, it makes my  skin feel so very soft and the people sent complete instructions which I very much appreciate.  It always helps to know how to use the product the correct  way.  I will be trying more of the products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought the larger size of this product, as I apply it much heavier than directed. Still, it is quite gentle and absorbs quickly. The lifelong dark circles and their accompanying bags are so much diminished they are essentially negligible... most of the time anyway...</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this is working, but the order came quickly.  I did not purchase it for wrinkles, but for dark eye bags.  I hope it makes some difference.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. It exfoliated the skin around my eyes, but non the wrinkles were diminish. It may work for someone younger where under eye lines are just starting to show.</li>
            <li> I Got This In The Mail Pretty Fast &amp; I Have Been Using This For A Week, So Far I Like It It Leaves Under Eye Skin Smooth And Moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review.**</li>
            <li> I love how this eye cream makes my eye area so soft and supple.  After a couple times of using this eye cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eye puffiness is somewhat better, but with any facial product, I know it takes a longer time to see maximum results.  The best thing about this eye cream, is that it&#x27;s NOT tested on animals and leaves not only my eye area, but my face so smooth!  The eye cream has so many wonderful ingredients...Organic Aloe, Alpha Hydroxy Acid, Vitamin E and Vitamin C, which is proven to be beneficial to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream does not leave an oily or greasy feeling and makes, what little dark circles I have, diminish to where they&#x27;re not as noticeable!  I love the smell of this product as well, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the aloe!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try a product from their eye cream line called, the Aloe Super Youth Eye cream. The product contains 100% Organic Aloe Vera, Vitamin E and Vitamin C. The other ingredients range from natural oils, gels and extracts to natural plant based products, even some organic based. Free of mineral oil, propylene glycol or parabens. The only preservatives within the cream are labeled natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effects: The eye cream is advertised as protection that helps treat and repair wrinkles. Also, addresses dark circles, reduction in the look of age spots, moisturizes and softens the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I did a 3 week trial and used the eye cream in the daytime and also at night. I figured I just replace my former brand and give Yalmeh&#x27;s eye cream it&#x27;s place. The texture of the cream was pleasant and did not leave an oily residue. My make-up glided on smoothly and did not separate hours after. I have had issues with eye creams/serums in the past where a few hours later my make-up appears as if I never blended it in and sort of floats on top of whatever base I used. Thankfully, Yalmeh played very nice and I did try different foundation brands to make sure this did not occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week, I noticed constant hydration to the eye area and this was more visible after I washed my face. I have &amp;#34;dry zones&amp;#34; that become noticeable after washing, like my lips will look dry and so will the sides (corners) and bottom portion of my eye. Part is do to seasonal allergies and the other part is just my luck! I noticed my eye area remained plump and just healthy in appearance, followed by feeling smooth and soft when touched. I continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going on to week two, I noticed the same positive results but an even tone when it came to color/pigmentation of the area. My redness and pink skin was now just matching the rest of my face. The cream sort of calms the ill effects I experience from seasonal allergies and does not allow the tearing I may get, to irritate the delicate skin we have around our eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week three is here and I do feel that the product is labeled correctly when it comes to calling it a moisturizer that protects, because it does just that. I did not notice differences when it came to fine lines and wrinkles because I have very little in those areas, but protecting the skin is something Yalmeh did well an even calmed it when stressed. The Aloe, Alpha Lipoic and Alpha Hydroxy acids did their job well. These ingredients also allowed the oils and vitamins to nourish the area and most importantly, moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yalmeh&#x27;s eye cream is a product that will protect and moisturize in an effective manner.  The product is made in the USA and is also backed by a 90 day money-back guarantee.  Companies that stand by their products are worth trying and the Yalmeh Peerless Beauty brand does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Yalmeh.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

            <li> This is a great product.  It actually stays on and makes your skin feel smoother.  The ingredients are excellent.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with a product made of organic aloe, grape seed oil, vitamin E and C etc!  The price is hard to beat!!</li>
            <li> Not bad but it isn&#x27;t as superb as I was lead to believe by these reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the face moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE SMELL, HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY CHANGE IN APPEARANCE SINCE USING, FELT LIKE I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye cream after reading many good reviews but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I received the Yalmeh Super Youth Eyecream from Tomoson to try for free.  It was sent through Amazon.com and the current retail value is $15.95 for the .5 oz size.&lt;br /&gt;This eyecream comes in a plastic tub with a twist lid.  The cream is white with a very light fragrance.  It is thick like a cream (not thin like a lotion or serum) which I love since I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using a very small amount just under my eyes.  After a few days, when I was sure it wasn’t going to dry my skin out or irritate my eyes, I started using it around my whole eye area: under eye, on cheekbones, side of eyes, and up to brow bone.I have been using this cream 1x a day for about 3 weeks now.  I really like it because it is very hydrating.  I typically use this at night after I wash my face but before I add my nighttime moisturizer.  I have had problems in the past with eyecreams making my eyes itch &amp; swell (eye allergies) or actually “burning” my skin (it basically became red &amp; raw) because the ingredients were too harsh.  This product has done nothing but soothe and moisturize.  I highly recommend this if you have dry or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use because I really like this product and I feel it helps my skin.  Also, the amount you get for the price is a good value.  Anti-aging products can be really expensive and I think this is a good deal for the price compared to items I’ve purchased in the past.  I am very satisfied with Yalmeh Super Youth Eyecream. #Sponsored</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this luxurious soft cream on my eye area skin. I only put on a light dot of cream in 4-5 places under each eye with my middle finger and gently smooth it on. I&#x27;ve also used it around some of the fine lines by my mouth that I have. You don&#x27;t need much of this cream because a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve just used it a short time but so far it leaves my skin feeling soothed and silky smooth. It&#x27;s got a light appealing scent to it. I love that you can use it twice a day and can be used under makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;I received free sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This is a light soft cream for the under eye. I really like how light it is and how it glides on. There is no scent and it gives my under eyes a cooling sensation. I like that I can apply my makeup shortly after application and do not have to wait a long time for it to absorb. It is very hydrating . I was sent this for rev, however it does not effect my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for two weeks.  I like the texture.  It looks thick but glides onto skin smoothly and leaves the eye area soft and supple.  Absorbs completely.  I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve noticed a significant decrease in lines, but I do like using this cream.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles and can&#x27;t say if it would reduce them.  Overall, not miraculous, but at my age (60), nothing short of plastic surgery is miraculous.  It might work better on younger skin to prolong  a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever. Period. Having persistent puffiness under my eyes for years, I started using nightly about 4 months ago and realized a while ago that my puffiness in eye area is totally gone!! Buy it and use nightly; you will be amazed. Oh a plus!--very tiny amount needed. This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> not at all as written and expected</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month on my eye area--once a day in the morning. The crosshatch wrinkles on my upper eyelids have faded--a lot. They were not deep wrinkles but they bothered me. I think my upper eyelids look a lot better than they did. I definitely will use this product on a go-forward basis. Good stuff and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Finished the entire jar, religiously using it day and night and found ZERO change or improvement:-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream and it feels good going on, but it&#x27;s not a miracle cream. I really wanted to try this product because I have very fair skin, so my dark circles are very noticeable without makeup. I have used this eye cream for almost a month and I have seen maybe, only a slight reduction with my dark circles. Now, the company makes the claim &amp;#34;Watch the fine lines in the corners of your eyes be reduced to the point that they are no longer visible.&amp;#34;... I have not seen that happen yet, but I have notice it has helped in the appearance of my wrinkles a bit, they do seem somewhat less noticeable. I believe this is the type of product, if it does work, it will take time for it to work and see actual results. I will say however, I did feel it was a good moisturizer and it made the skin around my eyes very soft. The nice thing is, they do offer a 90 day money back guarantee, so if you&#x27;re not happy, you have nothing to lose if you want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I recently received Yalmeh Super Youth Eye Cream to try and review. I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to try this product. I have been sadly amused by the dark circles that have set up camp under my eyes for longer than I care to admit. So, I was in the process of getting around to finding something that might scare them away. Then I got the opportunity to try some Super Youth Eye cream from Yalmeh for dark circles and wrinkles. Yalmeh Peerless Beauty was very nice and made sure to send me lots of information about their product. They continued to check up with me to make sure I was enjoying the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So upon receiving this eye cream in the mail, I began to use it regularly. The first thing I noticed was the coolness of the cream on my skin. It feels very refreshing. It is not heavy as some eye creams are. After using it, the skin around my eyes felt very soft. The cream smells very nice as well; it is not overbearing even being so close to my nose. It does not take very much to moisturize each eye either, so the container should last quite some time. With the Super Youth Eye Cream I found that when I started using it, my eye makeup began to come off easier at night when I washed my face before bed. I found it to be an excellent before makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, after I had been using it for a while, I could tell a difference in my skin. The skin around my eyes felt softer and firmer than before. I noticed that the dark circles were fading. Now, I did not say they magically disappeared, but they began to fade. I am very pleased with the results I got from using this Super Youth Eye Cream from Yalmeh! I will continue to use it daily! I would also definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good eye cream or even an excellent make up primer.</li>
            <li> In the morning I see the difference, it makes my skin look much younger and it smooths the dried out look. I have noticed that I am using less and less cover up for my dark circle in the morning.The dark circle is getting smaller and smaller. I do recommend this product and yes I would purchase again. Thank you Amazon for making this product available.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Started to feel difference after just a few uses. My eyes are feeling much better now. Will stop buying expensive eye products and switch to this one. Thank you for making such a good product.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the WORST I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many). Do not waste money on this!!!</li>
            <li> I truly love it!! :) I have using it for about a month n half and wow! I can really see the difference!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for nearly months with no visible effects. Hasn&#x27;t helped lines or dark circles, although I have minimal of both. Maybe you have to have more severe problems for it to work? I admit to being disappointed, based on reviews I thought I picked a winner. Trying something new next month.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Just a basic eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won this product in a giveaway.</li>
            <li> I won this eye cream in a giveaway and think it is just okay.  It did not make my dark circles disappear but, it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and works well. Pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is part of my daily face routine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now (twice a day and after showers), but I&#x27;ve noticed no change at all! I really don&#x27;t recommend this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I found the cream (in a jar) to be very heavy and occlusive for the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Though the ingredients listed seem otherwise, the cream does not moisturize enough,&lt;br /&gt;and leaves a feeling of dryness under eye.  It does not address the typical problems&lt;br /&gt;of the delicate under eye skin.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Eye cream that goes on smooth and I see and feel the difference</li>
