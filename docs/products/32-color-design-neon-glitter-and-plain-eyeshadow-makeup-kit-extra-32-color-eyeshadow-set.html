            <li>Great bright and bold colored eye shadows with glitter.  </li>
            <li>Looked amazing when applied</li>
            <li>The colors are nice on my brown toned skin.  </li>
            <li>It was very pigmented and the colors were beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think it works better this way.</li>
            <li>The glitter ones are made to layer on top of a color.</li>
            <li>So good thanks for amazing product</li>
            <li>and I think that they should give more of it</li>
            <li>The glitter is really cute to wear when going out or for a celebration.</li>
            <li>wish the palat was larger but it is beautiful on my skin</li>
            <li>Also the free gift I got with this was a all glitter pallet.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>Excellent for the price you pay at least 10$ for 4 colors at the store</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This is great for adding a little glitter for a sprinkle of sparkle.</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get on the mail but the glitter just would go by so fast that you can&#x27;t even use it two times</li>
            <li>I love the product it comes just as stated and the glitter affect is out of sight very glamourus, I just wish there was a little more product there in each compartment color, but a must buy</li>
            <li>I also recommend applying the shimmer powders first then go over it with the glitter shadow</li>
            <li>but I really wish I would have read the reviews bc</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price..  </li>
            <li>They are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The size of the shadow are fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear shadow everyday so this will last me awhile.  </li>
            <li>but the glitter is not really great to use by itself, I&#x27;ve noticed the glitter sits on top, once used the wax or gel is only left in the bottom.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product but I really wish I would have read the reviews bc the others are right on point the sparkles shadow sucks!</li>

            <li> Allot of colors and it will last me along time. Excellent for the price you pay at least 10$ for 4 colors at the store so love it !!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  For the price it is worth it.  I lucked up an received an all glitter palette for a total of 96 shades.  The size of the shadow are fine for me because I don&#x27;t wear shadow everyday so this will last me awhile.  The colors are nice on my brown toned skin.  Using a primer or a powder shade underneath will help make the color of the glitter pop.  The grey shadow did break up during shipping but I sprinkled the pieces in my hand and pressed them back into its spot.  You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price..  Stir the glitter into the gel to avoid just having del left over.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. None were broken and cases are small and portable which is exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I received this in great condition. The shimmer powders a good but the glitter is not really great to use by itself, I&#x27;ve noticed the glitter sits on top, once used the wax or gel is only left in the bottom.
