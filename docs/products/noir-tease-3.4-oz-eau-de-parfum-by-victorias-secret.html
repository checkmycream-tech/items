            <li>I think the cap/spray could be made better so this doesn&#x27;t occur.</li>
            <li>This is my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>she loves it, it&#x27;s what she wanted, so I love it too.</li>
            <li>She got the whole set from her boyfriend and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>I recently went to las vegas on vacation and was so excited that I would smell all delicious the whole time,</li>

            <li>I initially bought a smaller bottle in VS and fell in love!</li>
            <li>I spend WAAAAY too much in your store to be treated this way.  </li>
            <li>Very inviting.</li>
            <li>BUT once you put it on (skin, clothes) it has no smell (no matter how much you spray on you).</li>
            <li>Both much else to say...</li>
            <li>How do we know for sure the product was not tampered with or watered down?</li>
            <li>all cute with its little poof ball to spray</li>
            <li>There is no other way to describe it other than sexy and sultry.</li>
            <li>Im so upset because it was a brand new bottle</li>
            <li>Mine came literally new and in its box.</li>
            <li>I opened up my Christmas gift, only to find the whole bottle was gone, all in the package.  </li>
            <li>The paint on the bottle was completely melted off.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and was so excited to order this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Received this and after I put the squishy dispenser on, it doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>I was told by the cashier when trying to trade it for a new one, if it had leaked out the whole box would be wet.  </li>
            <li>I discovered the bottle had leaked all inside my suitcase :O</li>
            <li>Thanks Pensacola Mall Victoria&#x27;s Secret for your wonderful customer service (rolling of your eyes and bad attitude).  </li>

            <li> Completely watered down I agree now from experience.</li>
            <li> I spent over $50 on this and the scent is the same</li>
            <li> I had it packed well and wasn&#x27;t loose or pushing on anything.</li>
            <li> For some reason though, this big bottle of parfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the little purse size bottles...</li>
            <li> I should have just spent $10 and bought this directly from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> I believe the other reviews on here which others were saying this bottle seems watered down.</li>
            <li> and I can spray half of this freaking bottle on me and it acts just like body spray.</li>
            <li> I spraid it and the smell is gone with in a few minutes not worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My favorite, and buying it here saved me almost 20 dollars shipping from VS, crazy!!</li>
            <li> no sure what that is all about?</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, this scent is amaaazzziinngg.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> I am so unhappy.</li>
            <li> but I was really disappointed after using it 3 times and then sticking it in my travel bag for a work trip.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Great perfume, smells like heaven, so in love with it !&lt;br /&gt;A nd very good seller, I am very pleased with my purchase and totaly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Victoria&#x27;s Secret and was so excited to order this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Received this and after I put the squishy dispenser on, it doesn&#x27;t work right. and I can spray half of this freaking bottle on me and it acts just like body spray. NOT A PERFUME/COLOGNE. I am so unhappy. I spent over $50 on this and the scent is the same but it does not last AT ALL. I should just send it back. What a waste. I believe the other reviews on here which others were saying this bottle seems watered down. Completely watered down I agree now from experience. I don&#x27;t think I will ever order perfume on Amazon again. How do we know for sure the product was not tampered with or watered down? You don&#x27;t.  I should have just spent $10 and bought this directly from Victoria&#x27;s Secret. I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> My favorite, and buying it here saved me almost 20 dollars shipping from VS, crazy!!</li>
            <li> I opened up my Christmas gift, only to find the whole bottle was gone, all in the package.  I took it back to VS only to be treated like I was a thief trying to get away with something.  My mom purchased this for me for Christmas, I opened the package today only to discover all of the contents had leaked out.  The paint on the bottle was completely melted off.  I was told by the cashier when trying to trade it for a new one, if it had leaked out the whole box would be wet.  I have no idea when it started to leak from it&#x27;s bottle, but the package was saturated with the scent.  Thanks Pensacola Mall Victoria&#x27;s Secret for your wonderful customer service (rolling of your eyes and bad attitude).  I spend WAAAAY too much in your store to be treated this way.  VS, your packaging needs work.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Very inviting. Girlfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, this scent is amaaazzziinngg. I love it. Im a girl and I would turn lesbian for another girl wearing it. But it does not travel well at all. I recently went to las vegas on vacation and was so excited that I would smell all delicious the whole time, right? Wrong. I discovered the bottle had leaked all inside my suitcase :O Im so upset because it was a brand new bottle all cute with its little poof ball to spray, now gone...all gone...</li>
            <li> This product smells SO gooooood. Better price than in stores. Mine came literally new and in its box. This size is meant to last for about 4-6 months with daily wear.. and years if you only use it occasionally. I am a very happy customer after my purchase of Noir Tease 3.4 Oz Eau De Parfum by VS! :)</li>
            <li> I spraid it and the smell is gone with in a few minutes not worth the money.</li>
            <li> You MUST use the travel cap (the one on the bottle when you got it out of the packaging) regardless of flying or driving. Any elevation change will cause leakage with the spray. Hope this helps. :-)</li>
            <li> Holly loves this perfume so I got it for her for Christmas last year and she was very happy with this gift. She got the whole set from her boyfriend and loved it as well. God bless.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s my new favorite. There is no other way to describe it other than sexy and sultry. Needless to say, my husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells lovely. BUT once you put it on (skin, clothes) it has no smell (no matter how much you spray on you). To me, it&#x27;s just a waste of money. Reason why I give it one star</li>
            <li> It was $16 cheaper here than in the store. I&#x27;m very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume but I was really disappointed after using it 3 times and then sticking it in my travel bag for a work trip. When I arrived at my destination, all the perfume leaked out of the top of the bottle. I had it packed well and wasn&#x27;t loose or pushing on anything. It was a driving trip so the luggage wasn&#x27;t disturbed at all. I think the cap/spray could be made better so this doesn&#x27;t occur. It was a shame....a whole bottle wasted.</li>
            <li> This is my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite perfume. Both much else to say...she loves it, it&#x27;s what she wanted, so I love it too.</li>
            <li> Great. I would buy from this site again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents! Love it and surprisingly enough my mother whom is in her 50&#x27;s also loves this.</li>
            <li> The pump does not work, so I cannot even use it</li>
            <li> The bottle is very elegant.  For some reason though, this big bottle of parfume doesn&#x27;t smell like the little purse size bottles... no sure what that is all about?</li>
            <li> I initially bought a smaller bottle in VS and fell in love! I get tons of compliments on this perfume, and you will as well. You will not be disappointed!</li>
