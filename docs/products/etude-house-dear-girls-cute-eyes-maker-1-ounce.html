            <li>Great color and ease of use.  </li>

            <li>very easy to apply !</li>
            <li>The color is good.</li>
            <li>it makes my aegyosal look soooo good</li>
            <li>this product would be really good for you because it&#x27;ll make the aegyo-sal(s)</li>
            <li>make my eyes more charming!</li>
            <li>) made my eyes very cute and bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute</li>

            <li>Absoluteyy love it !</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>just the sparkly rose will come out , but</li>
            <li>I like it to look natural and these colors are perfect for that.</li>
            <li>not as great as i expect but worth.</li>
            <li>Works really good and super cute! :)</li>
            <li>The pink side is great, the colour is beautiful and I use it also as a eyeshadow,</li>
            <li>the -perfect- amount of shimmer for highlight, and the tiiiniest bit of shadow to add a hint of depth around my eyes when I&#x27;m not feeling the Entire face-full of makeup</li>
            <li>and i would just rather use a shadow brush and shadow sticks to make the cute aegyo sal</li>
            <li>but it looks cute</li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s user error,</li>
            <li>The purpose of this product is to make the aegyo-sal eye bags under one&#x27;s eye and give it that really cute Korean effect.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d be able to see it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;d probably like it more if it worked better for me.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>i love the effect it gives to your eye.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it is easy to smear it.</li>
            <li>I use my finger or brush after applying it to help give it a more smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>Blend lightly with fingers for better results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, recommend</li>
            <li>is fine.</li>
            <li>but it still was not as smooth as I would have liked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brown color is too light and the brightener gets smudgy and wrecks your eyeliner as the day goes by REGARDLESS of your eyeliner being waterproof so you end up looking like a panda....</li>
            <li>Useful for creating the aegyosal look :)</li>
            <li>This will make you look fresh and awake!</li>
            <li>:) Shipping was fast !</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s Sulli.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like holding a pencil, (fatter than most eye pencils, but very doable).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to apply it a lot for there to even really be a difference or to really be able to see it all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for something I ordered by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just wasn&#x27;t really useful for me.</li>
            <li>Very easy to create a eye bag and make my eyes look much bigger!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive the product and had high hopes from the reviews I saw on youtube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product, but it can be a little tricky to use.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty though.</li>
            <li>Great for when your running late to work</li>
            <li>I need to order more or just stock up when I go back to Korea</li>
            <li>The one I wanted was BIG eyes maker rather than CUTE eyes</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re good colors for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is a light brown and pink shimmer, and the shape of the tube made it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Really loving Etude house products, at first I thought the product was very minimal</li>
            <li>(I have to squint my eyes a certain way to make the one show</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really wakes me up with the &amp;#</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair-skinned caucasian who got turned onto the whole &amp;#34;Aegyo-Sal&amp;#34; thing while researching Korean cosmetics (my newest obsession)</li>
            <li>I think it really does make the eyes pop.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this very often.</li>
            <li>I didnt really like this product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>more apparent/ visible, especially if they aren&#x27;t there naturally</li>
            <li>so cute, is pink and just like for a princess !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use mine for aegyo-sal, I use the dark color on my top lid, and the pearly color under my eyes.</li>
            <li>but like the applicator is kind of hard to use</li>
            <li>it just popping off like a normal product.</li>
            <li>Product came new and unopened.</li>
            <li>packaging was cute and hygienic, the little sponges used to apply the product were soft, and the colors were flattering and natural</li>
            <li>you can just get a small thing of eyeshadow and do it way better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I thought shade/step one could&#x27;ve been a little more apparent.</li>
            <li>It gives you a shiny and beautiful line, but sadly the stick cushion is a bit too big...</li>
            <li>The packaging was fine and it came earlier than expected, but the product itself was a let</li>
            <li>I ended up using a soft blending brush</li>
            <li>I first applied it, it kinda just looked like I wiped glitter under my eyes and made my natural dark circles look worse.&lt;br /&gt;After about not looking in a mirror for about 4 hours</li>
            <li>, it didnt make my eyes cute , also i am not sure if it is empty ?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of useless</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been let down by an Etude House product and was not expecting it to be this s***ty.</li>
            <li>I have pretty pale skin</li>
            <li>the pinky color is lovely, however, the applicator is too hard and the color is really difficult to stick on your skin, and it fade out quickly.</li>

            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really work</li>
            <li> The brown side is a lil too dark to look natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t recommend this for under the eye area, the colors are pretty and subtle enough to use as a highlighter on parts of the face that you can blend makeup with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I only can make a crease under one of my eyes so it was hard to get this product to work for me on my second eye that I couldn&#x27;t get to have a natural crease for an aegyo-sal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed and didn&#x27;t know how long I was walking around like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product looks no different than if I were to use any other shimmery eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I found that I did have to put the applicator stick completely back in and screw the lid on a little bit to get enough product on.</li>
            <li> but I like to use the brown side on my crease and the other side on my inner corner</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the tip is a little too big.</li>
            <li> I received my product and it was dry, it didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with this makeup goes on a little clumpy and the spongy applicator pulls too much on the delicate skin under the eye when you try to blend it.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this product</li>
            <li> the step 1 part of the make up stick does not really show at all</li>
            <li> eh, its seriously not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumpy, and annoying that I have to screw off the top each time I want to use it instead of</li>
            <li> unfortunately the brown side is al most useless, maybe just mine is not right</li>
            <li> Sponge seems very wide until you use it!</li>
            <li> I does work under your eyes to make little shadows.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the product was dried up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it looks dried.</li>
            <li> its cap is broken, and it immediately dry out.</li>
            <li> Besides, the dark color is supposed to create a narrow shadow, but the cushion is just so big and wide, totally useless!!</li>
            <li> one side of this product is too dark, which makes my eyes look weird</li>
            <li> But subtly</li>
            <li> F(x) will not be the same without her :(</li>
            <li> But I feel is useless.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> but It failed to fulfill my expectations.</li>
            <li> If you wanted under eye youthful bags you end up looking like a homeless drunk girl.</li>
            <li> The product that I&#x27;ve received seems to be dried out and powdery, which makes it very difficult to apply :-(</li>
            <li> I wanted this product so badly</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about this item.</li>

            <li> product looks no different than if I were to use any other shimmery eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quick. Product came new and unopened. This is a Christmas gift so it has not been used yet but looks like it will work great! Thanks.</li>
            <li> This for those who want to create or enhance the happy eye look (aegyo sal). It&#x27;s got a pearl color for highlighting and a shimmery brown for shading. The biggest problem with this makeup goes on a little clumpy and the spongy applicator pulls too much on the delicate skin under the eye when you try to blend it. I ended up using a soft blending brush but it still was not as smooth as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t recommend this for under the eye area, the colors are pretty and subtle enough to use as a highlighter on parts of the face that you can blend makeup with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it is easy to smear it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a sponge type marker (Like a cushion) but it turns out that the actual eyeshadow is in the end caps! It&#x27;s going to be convienient for travel and they&#x27;re good colors for everyday use. I don&#x27;t use mine for aegyo-sal, I use the dark color on my top lid, and the pearly color under my eyes. It really wakes me up with the &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I do not use it as directed,  But, IT&#x27;s very nice makeup (: the -perfect- amount of shimmer for highlight, and the tiiiniest bit of shadow to add a hint of depth around my eyes when I&#x27;m not feeling the Entire face-full of makeup (:</li>
            <li> Its alright....but like the applicator is kind of hard to use and i would just rather use a shadow brush and shadow sticks to make the cute aegyo sal</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this product like I wanted to be. It&#x27;s clumpy, and annoying that I have to screw off the top each time I want to use it instead of it just popping off like a normal product. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.

            <li> Works really good and super cute! :)</li>
            <li> is fine. It is same like what it described. But I feel is useless. I could use eye shadow instead of using this maker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned caucasian who got turned onto the whole &amp;#34;Aegyo-Sal&amp;#34; thing while researching Korean cosmetics (my newest obsession) I think it really does make the eyes pop. I like it to look natural and these colors are perfect for that. The only problem is that the make-up itself is a wee bit clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers were having issues with there being no make-up on the applicator. I found that I did have to put the applicator stick completely back in and screw the lid on a little bit to get enough product on. So if you&#x27;re having the same issue, hopefully that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product, but it can be a little tricky to use.</li>
            <li> eh, its seriously not worth it. you can just get a small thing of eyeshadow and do it way better</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really work but I like to use the brown side on my crease and the other side on my inner corner</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about this item. the pinky color is lovely, however, the applicator is too hard and the color is really difficult to stick on your skin, and it fade out quickly. Besides, the dark color is supposed to create a narrow shadow, but the cushion is just so big and wide, totally useless!!</li>
            <li> The color is good. Only drawback is the tip is a little too big.</li>
            <li> Really loving Etude house products, at first I thought the product was very minimal but, once you apply it, it&#x27;s actually enough to use. Great for when your running late to work and you don&#x27;t have enough time to apply your make up. This will make you look fresh and awake!</li>
            <li> so cute, is pink and just like for a princess ! I like stuff like that :) Shipping was fast ! Color is cute! Absoluteyy love it !</li>
            <li> Easy to use, recommend</li>
            <li> I need to order more or just stock up when I go back to Korea it makes my aegyosal look soooo good</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the product was dried up. Useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually used this but it looks cute and I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s Sulli. F(x) will not be the same without her :(</li>
            <li> after applying this, my friend just asked me whether I stayed up last night. one side of this product is too dark, which makes my eyes look weird</li>
            <li> I had actually ordered this one by mistake. The one I wanted was BIG eyes maker rather than CUTE eyes maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I like this shade. It is a light brown and pink shimmer, and the shape of the tube made it easy to apply. It&#x27;s like holding a pencil, (fatter than most eye pencils, but very doable). Mine did come with a safety seal on both ends, so that&#x27;s another plus. I use my finger or brush after applying it to help give it a more smooth appearance. It&#x27;s not bad for something I ordered by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My seller was A-poly.</li>
            <li> Really good for making your eyes pop! But subtly</li>
            <li> Great product!! Will repurchase!! : ) made my eyes very cute and bright</li>
            <li> awesome! very easy to apply !</li>
            <li> The product that I&#x27;ve received seems to be dried out and powdery, which makes it very difficult to apply :-(</li>
            <li> The packaging was fine and it came earlier than expected, but the product itself was a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied it, it kinda just looked like I wiped glitter under my eyes and made my natural dark circles look worse.&lt;br /&gt;After about not looking in a mirror for about 4 hours, the glittery stuff looked cakey. I was embarrassed and didn&#x27;t know how long I was walking around like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s user error, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this very often.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the product and had high hopes from the reviews I saw on youtube. Unfortunately it is a waste of money. It in no way shape or form, enhanced my aegyo sal look. The brown side is a lil too dark to look natural. Boo.</li>
            <li> The purpose of this product is to make the aegyo-sal eye bags under one&#x27;s eye and give it that really cute Korean effect. You use step one to shade under the crease of the eye bag and then step two to highlight the upper part of the aegyo-sal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I thought shade/step one could&#x27;ve been a little more apparent. I have pretty pale skin and I&#x27;d have to apply it a lot for there to even really be a difference or to really be able to see it all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shade/ step two was a pearly pink/champagne color and it worked well. I&#x27;d only need to swipe it on once or twice and you&#x27;d be able to see it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d probably like it more if it worked better for me. I only can make a crease under one of my eyes so it was hard to get this product to work for me on my second eye that I couldn&#x27;t get to have a natural crease for an aegyo-sal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you&#x27;re someone who can get your eyes to have a crease under both (unlike me, who can only get one) this product would be really good for you because it&#x27;ll make the aegyo-sal(s) more apparent/ visible, especially if they aren&#x27;t there naturally (I have to squint my eyes a certain way to make the one show up).&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was cute and hygienic, the little sponges used to apply the product were soft, and the colors were flattering and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just wasn&#x27;t really useful for me.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect! It gives you a shiny and beautiful line, but sadly the stick cushion is a bit too big... it should be smaller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge and works amazingly. Sponge seems very wide until you use it!</li>
            <li> like it! make my eyes more charming!</li>
            <li> It is not THAT pigmented but it will work. I does work under your eyes to make little shadows.</li>
            <li> I didnt really like this product , it didnt make my eyes cute , also i am not sure if it is empty ? it like nothing come out from it just the sparkly rose will come out , but the Brown nooooo</li>
            <li> I received my product and it was dry, it didn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot... It&#x27;s very cute</li>
            <li> It took quite a while to get here but that&#x27;s okay, the step 1 part of the make up stick does not really show at all so it&#x27;s kind of useless but the step 2 part which is the part that actually matter works well and shows on my skin. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> not as great as i expect but worth.</li>
            <li> its cap is broken, and it immediately dry out.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product so badly but It failed to fulfill my expectations. The brown color is too light and the brightener gets smudgy and wrecks your eyeliner as the day goes by REGARDLESS of your eyeliner being waterproof so you end up looking like a panda....If you wanted under eye youthful bags you end up looking like a homeless drunk girl. I even tried to put on a lot of powder to prevent it from smudging but didnt work. Plus, the plastic package ended up braking on the ends within two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Great color and ease of use.  Creases somewhat. Blend lightly with fingers for better results.</li>
            <li> i love the effect it gives to your eye. i love it!</li>
            <li> The pink side is great, the colour is beautiful and I use it also as a eyeshadow, but of course is the perfect shade to do the aegyo sal....unfortunately the brown side is al most useless, maybe just mine is not right but it looks dried.</li>
            <li> I love it! Useful for creating the aegyosal look :)</li>
            <li> Very easy to create a eye bag and make my eyes look much bigger! Thanks</li>
