            <li>Great moisturizer for natural hair.</li>
            <li>From the first use of this product, my hair is more manageable, and my twist are more defined.  </li>
            <li>but that is just fine.  </li>

            <li>Grandsons&#x27; twists look just as good as his uncle&#x27;s whose were professionally done by a barber!</li>
            <li>Big difference in price, but I am still happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Good product keeps the hair curly and soft.</li>
            <li>I still have to use it some more before I can totally give a fair rating.</li>
            <li>(make sure you&#x27;re not in a humid or too hot environment as this will make the hair frizz).</li>
            <li>I took it with me to my last hair appointment and my stylist loved it so much, so bought some for her to use on her own hair.</li>
            <li>I use this for my twists out and it makes my hair really soft and gives it amazing mosisturization and volume.</li>
            <li>Gives curls good definition, I&#x27;m on my 3rd day of a wash-n-go</li>
            <li>It gives a nice soft hold.</li>

            <li>absolutely love this product for my natural hair</li>
            <li>In end EcoStyler wins</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.does</li>
            <li>I just returned this to the store; did not do a good enough job of defining my twist compared to Afro Stretch (love this product that&#x27;s now available for less at Walmart than online).</li>
            <li>This product has too much water in it and doesn&#x27;t give good hold for my 4a/4b hair which is fine and a little wavy.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It maybe better to get it at your local beauty shops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for wash-n-go&#x27;s and it defines pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like to try different products to retwist with, but this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I did do a dry twist out on next day hair and it looked great</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your twists crunchy feeling and sounding.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink up my hair afterwards and I am glad my wife has stopped saying that to me (from use of other hair products).  </li>
            <li>more like a conditioner, less like a gel</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Cantu line for a few years, and have never been able to find this Twist &amp; Lock Gel.</li>
            <li>Live everything about it.</li>
            <li>My jar lasts 2 to 3 months, cant live without this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, has natural ingredients, smells nice (a little heavily &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling, but I hate most scented products), and really does add shine and definition to my curls.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling pretty oily.</li>
            <li>I have only been natural for a couple of months but really like this.</li>
            <li>soft and shiny results</li>
            <li>The gel keeps my curls in line and is not heavy and it is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your kinky hair soft and silky....</li>
            <li>Oh yeah! Makes my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and brought out my curl.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t hold my new growth locs as stiff, for as long, as I would love it to.</li>
            <li>this one really help define my curls but by the end of the day my hair would be very dry.</li>
            <li>I scrunch in a bit of conditioner and the Cantu twist &amp; lock gel (don&#x27;t wet, brush, or touch your hair to much after scrunching the product in</li>
            <li>ever since I went natural, everyone was talking about this Cantu, well amazon had a offer I couldn&#x27;t resist, I bought some  back in February</li>

            <li> ever since I went natural, everyone was talking about this Cantu, well amazon had a offer I couldn&#x27;t resist, I bought some  back in February</li>
            <li> I wanted something less expensive and more natural.  </li>
            <li> After 15-20 minutes I take my hair out of the shirt and let it air dry for the remaining time</li>
            <li> Alternatively, I&#x27;ve heard some people dry their hair the rest of the way with a diffuser on the lowest heat</li>
            <li> A few weeks later my local Wal-mart start selling this item for $4.95.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve noticed after a few uses the product makes my hair feel a little coarse in the shower the next day, its not big deal because the feeling goes away as soon as I condition it</li>
            <li> Not what I expected being that I am a cantu Shea butter fan..</li>
            <li> While still in the shower and with my hair still wet</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair dry &amp; crunchy at all &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I let my locs air dry my retwist lasts about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> In case you were wondering, only a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I have been through at least 30 different mousses and gels (literally)</li>
            <li> After applying the product, I plop my hair down in a shirt and keep it like that for around 15 to 20 minutes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or flake.</li>
            <li> I also feel like the jar has me using less than when I was squeezing it out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li> (if you brush your hair after the shower or with a hairbrush, your hair will be a frizzy mess as soon as it drys it because the hairs that make up the curls become separated and begin to stick out everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t want to mess with your curls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The Cantu Shea Butter twist &amp; lock and well as the Cantu coconut curl activating cream are one of the few hair products I use every morning and which leave my curls defined and controlled all day.</li>
            <li> Works well but makes the hair stiff after it dries</li>
            <li> I spritz my hair with a bit of olive oil and water then rub a small amount into my hands and work into my curls.</li>
            <li> I co-wash my hair (which means I just wash my hair with conditioner) as I usually do every morning for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> once it dried it flaked badly in my hair.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Purchase it at target tho, its too expensive here.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was using the cheapest goo on the shelf previously, and my hair was miserable.  </li>
            <li> Oh and I forgot my hair has been growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> This item is so over priced that it&#x27;s pathetic</li>
            <li> but my hair felt horrible with build up.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. My twists hold longer and stay moisturized instead of drying out.</li>
            <li> smells like a pina colada.  I was looking for an alternative to my deva curls super hold gel.  I wanted something less expensive and more natural.  Tada!!!  I also feel like the jar has me using less than when I was squeezing it out of a bottle.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  It makes my curls look great.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well but makes the hair stiff after it dries</li>
            <li> I am in love with all the Cantu products. It does just what it says it will and more</li>
            <li> Works well with the sponge.</li>
            <li> I never use this product before but I love it</li>
            <li> This provides no hold for locs, it might work by giving curls for twist.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected being that I am a cantu Shea butter fan.. Felt great when applying, but what I look for in a product is what makes or breaks my decision on whether to repurchase..I look for how a product feels when applying and how it feels after it dries.. and in this case this product once it dried it flaked badly in my hair.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Just don&#x27;t use too much or it will make your twists crunchy feeling and sounding.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery. Smells great and it very effective. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Live everything about it. It conditions mybhair, love the scent and it controls my curls</li>
            <li> Love it. Make my hair curly</li>
            <li> This product really works and smells great. No built up left on your hair. Makes hair curly and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy from this seller as the product is overpriced. It maybe better to get it at your local beauty shops.</li>
            <li> This product held my curls better than a lot of the others i&#x27;ve used. I have only been natural for a couple of months but really like this.</li>
            <li> love this product for my hair</li>
            <li> soft and shiny results</li>
            <li> Best products to hold the twist in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, works great and my son now has curls for the first time!</li>
            <li> This item is so over priced that it&#x27;s pathetic, you can find this item at Walmart for $4.97. Its a great product and awesome curl definer</li>
            <li> Good product keeps the hair curly and soft.</li>
            <li> Very good for transitioning hair! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy!! I wish it specialized in preventing frizz but that&#x27;s OK. It gets the job done well. I use this for my twists out and it makes my hair really soft and gives it amazing mosisturization and volume. Definitely a staple product</li>
            <li> I used this for my twist outs and I love the moisture and hold it gives. My cousin also used it for his waves and it works lol</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and works well. Purchase it at target tho, its too expensive here. I&#x27;ve used it for wash-n-go&#x27;s and it defines pretty well. Gives curls good definition, I&#x27;m on my 3rd day of a wash-n-go and I use it to refresh the look. I spritz my hair with a bit of olive oil and water then rub a small amount into my hands and work into my curls. I do this all over and I&amp;#34;m good to go!</li>
            <li> I love it, my hair still has moisture and lots of shine.... I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Mi wish I could give it more stars but it left build up in my locs.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out but keeps it curly in SF fog.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and holds the curl!</li>
            <li> i love cantu products. this one really help define my curls but by the end of the day my hair would be very dry. i would recommend to mix this product with another to make your hair truly moistured.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair. this works better then everything I have tried to moisturize and manage my curls.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. The Cantu Shea Butter twist &amp; lock and well as the Cantu coconut curl activating cream are one of the few hair products I use every morning and which leave my curls defined and controlled all day. I have 3A type curly hair and I have been through at least 30 different mousses and gels (literally), none of which have worked for me as well as this has. It leaves my hair springy without feeling too crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I co-wash my hair (which means I just wash my hair with conditioner) as I usually do every morning for 2 weeks (I shampoo once every two weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. While in the shower I untangle my hair using either a wide-tooth comb or simply my fingers (if you brush your hair after the shower or with a hairbrush, your hair will be a frizzy mess as soon as it drys it because the hairs that make up the curls become separated and begin to stick out everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. While still in the shower and with my hair still wet I scrunch in a bit of conditioner and the Cantu twist &amp; lock gel (don&#x27;t wet, brush, or touch your hair to much after scrunching the product in, you don&#x27;t want to mess with your curls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After applying the product, I plop my hair down in a shirt and keep it like that for around 15 to 20 minutes (if you don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;plopping&amp;#34; is, simply google &amp;#34;HOW TO PLOP&amp;#34; and look at the site NaturallyCurly for a step by step instruction)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve noticed after a few uses the product makes my hair feel a little coarse in the shower the next day, its not big deal because the feeling goes away as soon as I condition it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. After 15-20 minutes I take my hair out of the shirt and let it air dry for the remaining time (make sure you&#x27;re not in a humid or too hot environment as this will make the hair frizz). Alternatively, I&#x27;ve heard some people dry their hair the rest of the way with a diffuser on the lowest heat</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will continue to use! ❤️</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my styling gel for about two weeks now, and I love it.  Admittedly, I was using the cheapest goo on the shelf previously, and my hair was miserable.  I wanted something that would help define my natural curls without being all alcohol and gooiness, and this is perfect.  It&#x27;s not expensive, has natural ingredients, smells nice (a little heavily &#x27;sweet&#x27; smelling, but I hate most scented products), and really does add shine and definition to my curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel after I became a &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;.  The gel keeps my curls in line and is not heavy and it is not sticky.  I took it with me to my last hair appointment and my stylist loved it so much, so bought some for her to use on her own hair.</li>
            <li> Does keep my hair moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> Works well for a gel but sometimes leaves white flakes</li>
            <li> I use this product for my wash and gos and it helps stretch my curls! Will purchase again</li>
            <li> makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cantu line for a few years, and have never been able to find this Twist &amp; Lock Gel. From the first use of this product, my hair is more manageable, and my twist are more defined.  The price could have been better. A few weeks later my local Wal-mart start selling this item for $4.95. Big difference in price, but I am still happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I used this product along with a hair butter and my twists came out well defined. My hair was super soft and shiny. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Worked great on half-breed hair!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product for my natural hair</li>
            <li> more like a conditioner, less like a gel</li>
            <li> This product has too much water in it and doesn&#x27;t give good hold for my 4a/4b hair which is fine and a little wavy. I think it could work if you have a tighter curl pattern. I did do a dry twist out on next day hair and it looked great but my hair felt horrible with build up. In end EcoStyler wins</li>
            <li> This is the best product for great twist out. It leaves your kinky hair soft and silky....I couldn&#x27;t believe the great results. A must buy! Buy from your local beauty supply its cheaper. My jar lasts 2 to 3 months, cant live without this product. Oh and I forgot my hair has been growing like crazy. I straighten my hair every 3 months and the growth is amazing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> It came all spilled and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it effectively. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.does the job</li>
            <li> Works great! Grandsons&#x27; twists look just as good as his uncle&#x27;s whose were professionally done by a barber!</li>
            <li> I like it, it feels nice and makes my hair smell nice</li>
            <li> ever since I went natural, everyone was talking about this Cantu, well amazon had a offer I couldn&#x27;t resist, I bought some  back in February so I just had the chance to use it, l love how it leaves my hair feeling. I still have to use it some more before I can totally give a fair rating.</li>
            <li> √√√√Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> I use this product to retwist my locs. It works very well.  It gives a nice soft hold. When I let my locs air dry my retwist lasts about a week and a half. Two weeks if I sit under the dryer. I like to try different products to retwist with, but this one is definitely my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or flake. It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It smells so good. I have 3b hair and it even lasts on my 4 day hair...I just put some water in my hair and a dime size of the product and scrunch. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say my hair smells like a drink you need to be having once you&#x27;ve applied this to it. Oh yeah! Makes my hair soft as well. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t hold my new growth locs as stiff, for as long, as I would love it to.</li>
            <li> great product a must buy</li>
            <li> This gel has a pleasant scent of coconut.  It fades away within an hour but that is just fine.  It doesn&#x27;t stink up my hair afterwards and I am glad my wife has stopped saying that to me (from use of other hair products).  I will be purchasing this again.  The price is just fine at around five dollars.  In case you were wondering, only a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> I just returned this to the store; did not do a good enough job of defining my twist compared to Afro Stretch (love this product that&#x27;s now available for less at Walmart than online).</li>
            <li> Totally love this product. It does well with my hair and I use it on my son&#x27;s hair as well. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perfect for twist outs!! It does not leave your hair dry &amp; crunchy at all &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> HAPPY WITH  CARDINE  L.  JORDAN</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It made my hair soft and brought out my curl.  I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling pretty oily.</li>
