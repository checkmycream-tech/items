            <li>The women would ask what am I wearing and the men want to stand beside me.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I can get it here at a cheaper price, I am happy.</li>

            <li>like it very much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Miracle for many years and will never get tired of its beautiful scent...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s romantic, dreamy, warm, classy and sophisticated; just like a bottle of bordeaux, full body.</li>
            <li>, I really like that it&#x27;s available here at Amazon because that means I don&#x27;t have to deal with any snooty salesclerks in some of the higher-end department stores.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is sold by Amazon directly or reputed sellers like Perfu</li>
            <li>This perfume is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>far as the scent, my wife has been using this almost exclusively for more than 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has such a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li>This scent is light and feminine, not harsh and musky!</li>
            <li>Little can go a long way,bottle is a perfect style to this perfumes elegance,pleasant on the eyes  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents and I have used this perfume for several years.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my all-time favorites which I purchased years ago when it was first introduced.</li>
            <li>there are so many other great perfumes out there that i always try out every now and then, but the return ratio is pretty low, this is the only perfume that i always return to.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the same product at a better price.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more subdued, because I would wear it on every date night!</li>
            <li>fresh, soft and goes well with me.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this amount!</li>
            <li>I found it much cheaper than my Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle fragrance.</li>
            <li>and i think i got it fast</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;smart\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>SO SPECIAL.THE PRICE IS REASONABLE</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>a real bargain...  </li>
            <li>Even if you order it online straight from Lancome themselves</li>
            <li>Price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>i dont know if its fake,,nothing compare to dolce and gabbana light blue..</li>
            <li>I absolutely cherish it.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>...that Amazon did not charge as much as Macy&#x27;s for this perfume.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also a symbol of a new life :) because I encountered it when I was going through heavy despair, and during this time I also met someone who made me look at life in a new light.</li>
            <li>This smells SO lovely - floral and beautiful, but I feel like it&#x27;s a little too heavy for a younger woman like myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a sweet but sensual scent.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>department store prices are high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite everyday scent to wear.</li>
            <li>When I got this product it was not what was pictured for sale,it was totally different and did not smell right.</li>
            <li>This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li>THE PRESENT I GAVE TO MY SISTER WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING IN HER PARTY,</li>
            <li>Recently I purchased Miracle by Lancome on Amazon and received my usual prompt service and the product I know and love so well.</li>
            <li>It is a little sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Update,Sept.,2010  changed to 5 from 4 stars,  truly a fine par fume,at once delicate and yet bourgeois  fragrant,</li>
            <li>So we suspect it is counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;Emails to Smart Kitchen unanswered after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I usually buy it in international airport duty free stores.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m tired, I feel more rested.     </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no difference from the department stores other than you pay just as much for half as much product at the store.</li>
            <li>As often is the case ordering on Amazon.com, I saved on the price (it&#x27;s normally $77 + tax retail) &amp; the package arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and feminine, not harsh and musky!</li>
            <li> Little can go a long way,bottle is a perfect style to this perfumes elegance,pleasant on the eyes  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents and I have used this perfume for several years.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorites which I purchased years ago when it was first introduced.</li>
            <li> there are so many other great perfumes out there that i always try out every now and then, but the return ratio is pretty low, this is the only perfume that i always return to.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the same product at a better price.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more subdued, because I would wear it on every date night!</li>
            <li> fresh, soft and goes well with me.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this amount!</li>
            <li> I found it much cheaper than my Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle fragrance.</li>
            <li> and i think i got it fast</li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;smart\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> SO SPECIAL.THE PRICE IS REASONABLE</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> a real bargain...  </li>
            <li> Even if you order it online straight from Lancome themselves</li>
            <li> Price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> i dont know if its fake,,nothing compare to dolce and gabbana light blue..</li>
            <li> I absolutely cherish it.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> ...that Amazon did not charge as much as Macy&#x27;s for this perfume.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also a symbol of a new life :) because I encountered it when I was going through heavy despair, and during this time I also met someone who made me look at life in a new light.</li>
            <li> This smells SO lovely - floral and beautiful, but I feel like it&#x27;s a little too heavy for a younger woman like myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a sweet but sensual scent.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> department store prices are high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite everyday scent to wear.</li>
            <li> When I got this product it was not what was pictured for sale,it was totally different and did not smell right.</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li> THE PRESENT I GAVE TO MY SISTER WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING IN HER PARTY,</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased Miracle by Lancome on Amazon and received my usual prompt service and the product I know and love so well.</li>
            <li> It is a little sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Update,Sept.,2010  changed to 5 from 4 stars,  truly a fine par fume,at once delicate and yet bourgeois  fragrant,</li>
            <li> So we suspect it is counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;Emails to Smart Kitchen unanswered after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I usually buy it in international airport duty free stores.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m tired, I feel more rested.     </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no difference from the department stores other than you pay just as much for half as much product at the store.</li>
            <li> As often is the case ordering on Amazon.com, I saved on the price (it&#x27;s normally $77 + tax retail) &amp; the package arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> and i felt that the duration of smell is less than the normal</li>
            <li> Immediately  after opening the bottle from Smart Kitchen , my wife complained this is not &amp;#34; Miracle&amp;#34; but much different .</li>
            <li> The scent is heavy for the first few seconds but let me tell there is never a time that I&#x27;ve worn this perfume and haven&#x27;t been complimented by girls and caught guys doing a double take or even coming up to me.</li>
            <li> You need have no concerns about buying Miracle--or any other product from Amazon--you will get the real thing, not cheap counterfeits.</li>
            <li> THIS ,WAS A TOTALLY FIASCO,THE ORIGINAL AROMA OF MIRACLE BY LANCOME,IS UNFORGGETTABLE,BUT PRODUCT THAT WAS SENT TO ME WAS JUST A FAKE I&#x27;WILL</li>
            <li> My wife has been a long time user of Miracle</li>
            <li> The perfume&#x27;s sent lasts a long time and everyone loves to smell me.</li>
            <li> i ordered lancome miracle here at amazon and the seller is AAA merchant i think,when i got it its not what i expected the smell is like alcohol</li>
            <li> I wear it to work everyday and have a different scent to wear when I go out.</li>
            <li> On a few occasions I have tried a different perfume, but I always return to Miracle.  </li>
            <li> I truly consider a Miracle the finding of this huge bottle at such a small price!!!!!</li>
            <li> and then I will sample other perfumes, but I always buy Miracle.</li>
            <li> She lost credibility by saying she didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon but from some other company online</li>
            <li> So i decide to ask for the other one too and they told me and</li>
            <li> UNBEATABLE PRICE AND SHIPPING COST WAS VERY MINIMAL.  </li>
            <li> the price is less than department store as well.</li>
            <li> and they told me that this product in not original.</li>
            <li> this too, is not original.</li>
            <li> It came in a few days</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Complaint will now be forwarded to Amazon</li>
            <li> I swear it&#x27;s like it has some invisible hands slowly pulling people to you.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, but I don&#x27;t receive the compliments like I do with the Chanel :(</li>
            <li> I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake parfume.</li>
            <li> **. Was wary of knock-offs, but the one shipped from Amazon is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How weird is that?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> , I HAD A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE, AND</li>
            <li> BUT ONE IS GARBAGE!! :(</li>
            <li> I hate that.</li>
            <li> , IT WAS A VERY BAD</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say, I got it very well packed, in perfect condition, its a gift so I haven&#x27;t used it of course but it doesn&#x27;t look like a fake parfume.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a young lady. I hope she likes it :)&lt;br /&gt;1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for many years. I always receive many compliments, from men and women. The women would ask what am I wearing and the men want to stand beside me.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I can get it here at a cheaper price, I am happy.</li>
            <li> I tried this at the mall and loved it. I found it much cheaper than my Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle fragrance. It lasts long, but I don&#x27;t receive the compliments like I do with the Chanel :(... I also think it is more if a spring/ summer scent... I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase this fragrance - I need compliments lol ;)</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUMES FROM NAVARRO ARE ONLY WATER WITH COLOR, I HAD A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE, AND THE PRESENT I GAVE TO MY SISTER WAS REALLY EMBARRASSING IN HER PARTY, NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!! AND I HOPE AMAZON DO SOMETHING BC i PAID 130 DOLLARS FOR TWO BUT ONE IS GARBAGE!! :(</li>
            <li> My wife has been a long time user of Miracle and I usually buy it in international airport duty free stores. Immediately  after opening the bottle from Smart Kitchen , my wife complained this is not &amp;#34; Miracle&amp;#34; but much different . So we suspect it is counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;Emails to Smart Kitchen unanswered after 2 weeks.  Complaint will now be forwarded to Amazon</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s absolute favorite.  Everyone always asks her, what is she wearing?  .......  That&#x27;s always reenforcing.</li>
            <li> i bought this item on september 5, 2010 and still it says waiting to be shipped. it did not say on the item that there would be any delays on the shipping and i have sent 3 emails regarding the status and no reply, none whatsoever, i think i bought an item with this merchant awhile back and i think i got it fast but i need to know whats going on with the item i bought. any reply would be helpful since i am not getting any replies with me emailing them.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for over ten years. Every now and then I will sample other perfumes, but I always buy Miracle. People are constantly commenting on it. It&#x27;s clean and not too sweet. Very \\&quot;smart\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I truly consider a Miracle the finding of this huge bottle at such a small price!!!!! It arrived in a jiffy and in perfect condition. Thank you. I&#x27;ll be pleased to do business with you again.</li>
            <li> Reviewed and then purchased for spouse,and as in reviews, a just lovely and beautiful fragrance  Little can go a long way,bottle is a perfect style to this perfumes elegance,pleasant on the eyes  May want to try at store 1st, recommended!    Update,Sept.,2010  changed to 5 from 4 stars,  truly a fine par fume,at once delicate and yet bourgeois  fragrant,</li>
            <li> Lancome Miracle is still one of the best perfumes out there.  I&#x27;ve worn Miracle for many years and will never get tired of its beautiful scent...infused w/ freesia, magnolia, &amp; amber notes.  Just gorgeous!  As often is the case ordering on Amazon.com, I saved on the price (it&#x27;s normally $77 + tax retail) &amp; the package arrived earlier than expected.  Totally Satisfied and Highly Recommend Lancome Miracle.</li>
            <li> I bought the package with the 1.7 oz perfume and body lotion and shower gel. I absolutely love it! When you walk into the bathroom after using the shower gell you can smell it in the air. The perfume&#x27;s sent lasts a long time and everyone loves to smell me. It is by far the best perfume smell I have ever used or smelt.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PERFUM. THE SMELL IS SO SPECIAL.THE PRICE IS REASONABLE AT AMAZON. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> It is Miracle and well reviewed. Nice pleasant perfume and stays long, no headaches or overpowering smell etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comment is more on the price around sixty three is atleast twenty five cheaper than Leading Dept store. Make sure it is sold by Amazon directly or reputed sellers like Perfu*****. Was wary of knock-offs, but the one shipped from Amazon is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason Amazon keeps rejecting posting this review, 3rd attempt....</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this fragrance. No matter what I am doing, I always feel elegant with this on. It lives up to it&#x27;s name \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; because peoples&#x27; reactions are just that, a miracle. I have never received so many positive responses from a perfume. It is especially great for people who have a high acid level content and can&#x27;t wear most perfumes. I&#x27;ve never given a review on anything but I have nothing but great things to say about this fragrance. I&#x27;ve worn it over 4 years and wouldn&#x27;t change it for anything.  B.Hold, Dallas, Texas</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance for many years. I feel a surge of joy everytime I use it. Really. If I&#x27;m sad, I feel better. If I&#x27;m tired, I feel more rested.     Recently I purchased Miracle by Lancome on Amazon and received my usual prompt service and the product I know and love so well. Another reviewer stated that it&#x27;s not the same product that she buys in stores.  She lost credibility by saying she didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon but from some other company online she couldn&#x27;t quite remember the name of. This is absolutely the same product at a better price. You need have no concerns about buying Miracle--or any other product from Amazon--you will get the real thing, not cheap counterfeits. Amazon&#x27;s reputation has been built on customer satisfaction through great service and quality products.    Miracle by Lancome... has become my hallmark fragrance. Exquisite!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice fragance, i bought it for my mum, and when i did smell it i wanted it for me!I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I bought two  of this, i used one and i felt that the duration of smell is less than the normal, i ask in a perfumery and they check it and they told me that this product in not original. So i decide to ask for the other one too and they told me and this too, is not original.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent while in Barbados, to purchase it there is well over $150 UDS.  I found it at the NEX (Navy Exchange, for all you civilians) for $68 USD a real bargain...  However Amazon has the BEST PRICE ANY WHERE!!! Even if you order it online straight from Lancome themselves it&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff every woman should get this for herself!!! Huge bottle!!! Worth the money too!! If you are going I say go all the way!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is WONDERFUL! It came in a few days and I just love it.</li>
            <li> This is such an exquisite fragrance! It&#x27;s very fresh and has a touch of elegance. Every time I wear it I get asked the name. I think it&#x27;s great for both daytime and evening wear. I just love it. I tend to recycle my fragrances, Miracle is the one I go back to often- and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li> $15.00 cheaper than department stores and only took 2 days to arrive with standard shipping. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Good perfume and smells like the one i purchase from the department store.  the price is less than department store as well.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this perfume! I have been wearing it for about ten years and I ADORE it! It smells better the longer you wear it. I just can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is by far my favorite. Not over powering but a perfect light scent. One of my patients was wearing it and I fell in love with the smell. Price is very affordable. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY!!! UNBEATABLE PRICE AND SHIPPING COST WAS VERY MINIMAL.  I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I love Miracle because the scent is so beautiful, yet not overpowering, plus it stays with me all day long!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful, I get so many compliments from people when they&#x27;re around me. I recommend this Lancôme fragrance to every woman,</li>
            <li> been using this perfume for years. not too sweet, not too strong, fits for every day and for more special events.</li>
            <li> I got Miracle for my wife and she is very happy wit it, just what she wanted!</li>
            <li> You can use it during all the day and at night. It&#x27;s wonderful!!! You will love it as me. Very good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. I love how it has such a clean, fresh scent. Another Amazon reviewer of this product likened the scent to clean laundry, and that&#x27;s a good description. Miracle is sweet but not overly so. It&#x27;s just a very, very good perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I really like that it&#x27;s available here at Amazon because that means I don&#x27;t have to deal with any snooty salesclerks in some of the higher-end department stores. You know the kind, who act like you don&#x27;t belong at their makeup counter and like they&#x27;re doing you a favor by taking your money. I hate that.</li>
            <li> THIS ,WAS A TOTALLY FIASCO,THE ORIGINAL AROMA OF MIRACLE BY LANCOME,IS UNFORGGETTABLE,BUT PRODUCT THAT WAS SENT TO ME WAS JUST A FAKE I&#x27;WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN ANY PERFUME ONLINE, IT WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.I THINK THE NAME OF THE  COMPANY WHERE I GOT IT FROM WAS,SOFT PINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and feminine, not harsh and musky! I love it for any occasion! I get tons of compliments and it&#x27;s never overpowering!</li>
            <li> i ordered lancome miracle here at amazon and the seller is AAA merchant i think,when i got it its not what i expected the smell is like alcohol i dont know if its fake,,nothing compare to dolce and gabbana light blue..you wont notice its smell unless you sniff it closer...&lt;...&gt; is still the best when it comes to perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a little sweet smell. It is nice though. In the mornings, people have asked me or coomplimented me for this product.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to daily perfume as it is not overpowering. I have gotten compliment after compliment on this perfume from friends, students, and even a stranger. How weird is that? It is light and airy. You can&#x27;t go wrong. Love it!</li>
            <li> The scent is heavy for the first few seconds but let me tell there is never a time that I&#x27;ve worn this perfume and haven&#x27;t been complimented by girls and caught guys doing a double take or even coming up to me. It&#x27;s such a sweet but sensual scent. I swear it&#x27;s like it has some invisible hands slowly pulling people to you. Forget the come hither stare..this is the come hither scent.</li>
            <li> When I got this product it was not what was pictured for sale,it was totally different and did not smell right.</li>
            <li> my mom is going to be so excited when she opens this for christmas,  i am happy that it came in one piece and not broken</li>
            <li> Can a perfume be cherished? For me, yes. I love perfumes and I hoard them, and Miracle by Lancome has been my favorite since it was launched in 2000. Opening with a fruity (litchi)note it turns into a beautiful concoction of magnolia, jasmin, ginger and pepper. There might be a hint of patchouli too, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s also a symbol of a new life :) because I encountered it when I was going through heavy despair, and during this time I also met someone who made me look at life in a new light. Miracle brought miracles in my life. I absolutely cherish it.</li>
            <li> I came across to this perfume 13 years ago in Switzerland when my friend gave me the left over bottle, i tried it and i use it since then. there are so many other great perfumes out there that i always try out every now and then, but the return ratio is pretty low, this is the only perfume that i always return to. it&#x27;s romantic, dreamy, warm, classy and sophisticated; just like a bottle of bordeaux, full body.</li>
            <li> This smells SO lovely - floral and beautiful, but I feel like it&#x27;s a little too heavy for a younger woman like myself. I wish it was a little more subdued, because I would wear it on every date night!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents and I have used this perfume for several years.  It is light and fresh and sweet.  department store prices are high.  Amazon offered the best price and delivery was swift.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorites which I purchased years ago when it was first introduced. I love it because it is florally and not too overpowering. I pair it with the lotion. The scent lasts me throughout the work day. I receive plenty of comments, &amp;#34;Hmm, smells nice!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you like this scent, this is as good a buy as you will find. Much more expensive at the counter in department stores.</li>
            <li> This is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume and it&#x27;s hard to find. Was glad to find it on line and surprise her on her birthday. She loved it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite everyday scent to wear. It is very mild and sweet, without being over powering. I wear it to work everyday and have a different scent to wear when I go out. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Every time I wear this perfume, someone ask what is the name of the fragrance and who makes it!  Lancôme - you will know your stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using Miracle By Lancome for may years.  On a few occasions I have tried a different perfume, but I always return to Miracle.  Why?  It has a very gentle, pleasant scent and I get many compliments wearing it. My husband adores it and my daughters love it as well.  I just hope that the Lancome company is not going to change it or take it off the shelves as it sometimes happen with product we come to love and use every day.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating, because i liket but i don love it, why? well is not the best smell, i like the product and i would recommend</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent I fell in love with it several years ago and try to use all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Very fresh, soft and goes well with me.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this amount!</li>
            <li> Muy seguro, muy buena compra!!!&lt;br /&gt;Magnifico de muy buena calidad, muy bonito, estoy muy contento con la compra muchas Gracias!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excelente!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, wonderful smell. If you like Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy, Milano by Prada, or Valentino&#x27;s Valentina - this one is equally good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum have worn it for years and always get complimented on how lovely it smells. You will too.</li>
            <li> I buy this product every year for my wife and she likes it.  There&#x27;s no difference from the department stores other than you pay just as much for half as much product at the store.</li>
            <li> I was looking this fragance but even in Lancome web site it was more expensive.  Finally I looked in Amazon and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is exactly the same, the delivery was really fast and the box came in excellent conditions.  Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I love this smell. I use it everyday. I never get tired of it. Try it u will love it too</li>
            <li> ...that Amazon did not charge as much as Macy&#x27;s for this perfume.  You&#x27;ll save about twenty bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent, my wife has been using this almost exclusively for more than 7 years.  I love it on her.  Sometimes I feel like it smells different every time she puts it on.</li>
            <li> this is subjective you like it or you dont my girlfriend loves this one. buy if you know what it smells like</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom as a present and she has been purchae it ever since.  It is very elegant scent.  I have used it as well and love it too. I recommend it.</li>
