            <li>and i think amazingly of all the brushes.</li>
            <li>Amazing design, they will stand up on their own.  </li>
            <li>They make my make up look amazing.</li>
            <li>its amazing.</li>
            <li>I own each set.</li>
            <li>When I learned that make up extraordinaire Samantha Chapman had launched her own line of brushes, I knew that I&#x27;d try them but had no idea</li>
            <li>I also liked that it came with the brush holder</li>
            <li>I know I probably wasn&#x27;t going to be needing or using the holder, but it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Cute and really good set.</li>
            <li>They keep their shape really nicely</li>
            <li>They are very versatile and Samantha Chapman does wonderful makeup tutorials, using her brushes, on youtube.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, nice brand, fare price, excelent material.</li>
            <li>domed eyeshadow brush is excellent for blending shadow out, works very well as a crease brush as well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular with my foundation or concealer</li>
            <li>Once I received them, you can really tell how great of a quality they are just by looking at them!</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a nice idea, but I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for the brushes I own.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has ever used Real Techniques brushes know that this brand is simply incredible!</li>
            <li>She was absolutely thrilled to receive them.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with these brushes</li>
            <li>I had hear sl many good things about this item...and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...</li>
            <li>but it was still a nice addition.</li>
            <li>These brushes are awesome and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Its versatilitly really does make this a perfect starter set.  </li>
            <li>Works great and blend products on a perfect way .. Easy to Clean and drys quickly ..</li>
            <li>Best brushes so soft!!</li>
            <li>True to the name, these brushes are the essentials and provide a great foundation for your makeup tool arsenal.  </li>
            <li>A good deal who wants a good price and also a good material</li>
            <li>They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t find it ideal for packing shadow onto the lid, but once the shadow is there it&#x27;s great for blending.</li>
            <li>I find them easy to use and they provide a good finish.</li>
            <li>Good quality inexpensive brushes, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite ok, good for powder + bronzer+ blusher, so I will be using that as well :)</li>
            <li>and they all wash very easily.</li>
            <li>Love, love, them!</li>
            <li>Again another great brush set by Real Techniques!!</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft on the skin and non-irritating and best of all, they didn&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li>-it is so soft and fits my eyelid perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are amazing, I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fantastically soft, don&#x27;t shed and apply my blush/mineral powder/foundation/eye shadow/concealer wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds, but these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>the foundation brush isn&#x27;t any more amazing than my Lancome foundation brush or my Sigma foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>Love love love these brushes!</li>

            <li>Overall GREAT brushes and GREAT quality...</li>
            <li>and I honestly think that the smaller brush (purple) is the best concealer brush ever....</li>
            <li>Great starting out brushes, price is great compared to a MAC brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and blend beautifully, feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look streaky in any way</li>
            <li>Again, the bristles are very smooth, and don&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li>These brushes are beautiful; soft, versatile, nice to hold and look at.</li>
            <li>They blend it in nicely and I can easily blend in the colors.</li>
            <li>very good product, exactly what I ordered, fast shipping, loved my purchase.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, but to large to be considered &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; sized.  </li>
            <li>Each brush in this set if soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a set of brushes that was good quality, easy to use and beginner friendly.</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>Also love the case, makes it so convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>l love them.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes ❤</li>
            <li>I have purchased almost all of RT brushes and I have been 100% satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>so it can push the powder into the skin and ensures it&#x27;s not sitting on top of the foundation and have my face looking powdery</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Wish the case was a bit better looking...</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 days ago and got them today, with free shipping!</li>
            <li>The multi-task brush is phenomenal and is probably my favorite brush from the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can guarantee you that&#x27;d I&#x27;d be buying more brushes from them.</li>
            <li>OK, Its a wrap for Mac brushes.</li>
            <li>You can use these 3 for eyeshadow, foundation, concealer, and powder… excellent, universal set!</li>
            <li>Though they are not my favorite brushes to use.</li>
            <li>and I was able to put more brushes on here.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s more like a foundation/powder brush instead of a blush brush.</li>
            <li>This travel case is kind of cheap</li>
            <li>It can serve many purposes which is what I need in a traveling brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about Real Techniques brushes and I was intending on buying them to test them out eventually.</li>

            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they are very easy to clean, unlike natural haired brushes.  </li>
            <li>They stay soft and mostly in their original shape, the bristles fit into every crevice of your face and their easy to clean as they don&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for really good</li>
            <li>Great quality brushes with very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quite quick.</li>
            <li>I figured this was a perfect investment for only $11 to see if I actually like it</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the other two brushes they quickly became my favorite!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love theses brushes , performs just as well of high end brushes</li>
            <li>but so far they&#x27;re a good buy, by the way watch the tutorials online so that you use the brushes properly :)</li>
            <li>They are soft, easy to handle, easy to use.</li>
            <li>i like it&lt;br /&gt;Brushes soft and beautiful does not work when you use lines or hair loss with facial advise everyone bought</li>
            <li>I own them all except for the limited edition duo fiber brush set, fine liner, and kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>not really sure on the carrying case, i would go without those since I dont use them, but the brushes alone are an excellent quality, they clean very easily, and dry pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching them, they are so soft!</li>
            <li>love these brushes...really soft!</li>
            <li>They are very smooth and help me with the final touches because they make the makeup spread out smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy about these but got them for my sister for Christmas because she told me they were great brushes.</li>
            <li>On their official website, there are even tutorials on how to achieve certain looks, and how to use each brush, very helpful to me since I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use a Stippling Brush</li>
            <li>amazing brushes especially the foundation brush-</li>
            <li>so It makes it easier) and the carrying case comes with extra room to add more of your own brushes or complete your RT collection.</li>
            <li>I was wondering since it says travel, but I use the pink one for my foundation and love it I actually use the gold for contouring (when I do lol) and the purple eyeshadow one for my illuminzing powder....</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This kit is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I found these brushes to be anything but useful.</li>
            <li>I love the bristles, it is so soft.</li>
            <li>soft love them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love my old brushes and thought I may try these out.</li>
            <li>I love Real Techniques Brushes and only wish that they would create more brushes.</li>
            <li>These are far, my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I bought three different sets of them and honestly I don&#x27;t understand why they are so hyped up.</li>
            <li>This brand of brushes are to much for words,I love the whole set</li>
            <li>Love these damn brushes...even after my two year old painted with water colors with them..</li>
            <li>the foundation brush is useful but not for foundation</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t use a foundation brush but have found some different uses for it.</li>
            <li>She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a newbie jumping back into wearing make up</li>
            <li>This set is actually quite nice for the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>love the soft brushes.</li>
            <li>the casing is useful too.</li>
            <li>WORTH every</li>
            <li>I love the brushes so soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, easy to clean and durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012.</li>
            <li>Far better than the junk you can buy at Sephora at a price of $40 per brush.</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re informative and fun to watch.</li>
            <li>This travel set has just the right selection of brushes you will need when you travel.</li>
            <li>and they were all right.</li>
            <li>The price is right for this brush set.</li>
            <li>I clean them with castile soap and they have been holding up very well with no shedding.</li>
            <li>Great travel set or small carry.</li>
            <li>I previously went through this phase where my mentality was that if I spend a lot of money then the product must be good...</li>
            <li>Another reason I love these brushes is because they were created by Pixiwoo, which if you watch make up tutorials on youtube like me, you would know that Samantha Chapman and her sister are the talented makeup artists behind it..</li>
            <li>that makes putting on makeup easy and natural.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, which is important for the application of the products and the touch on the skin.</li>
            <li>i love all of these brushes, the pink brush is great for powder or blush, and the small purple brush is good for eyeshadow and blending in concealer, they also wash really well and don&#x27;t shed, i have repurchased several sets to give to ppl</li>
            <li>Not only does this stand on its own, the left side also has more black bands that can additionally hold 2-3 more brushes!</li>
            <li>good little set.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the mutli-task brush but the eye shadow brush was a close second!</li>
            <li>and I actually find these better.</li>
            <li>I personally like the foundation brush more on this set rather than the core collection.</li>
            <li>and they are really soft, and the price is just fabulous</li>
            <li>Domed shadow brush: this brush is bigger than I like for eyeshadow, but I absolutely love it as a concealer brush.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find them for $25 Australian dollars including postage rather than $40 at Priceline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this set as opposed to getting each individual one because these were exactly the type I needed anyway.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any fall out.</li>
            <li>so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range.</li>
            <li>These are my first brushes</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Overall they&#x27;re &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; brushes, I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes! !</li>
            <li>im able to get in those areas you cant with the big brushes.</li>
            <li>so I might use them more later on</li>
            <li>actually went and bought two more of them.  </li>
            <li>I think they will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Pretty upset.</li>
            <li>I cannot describe how much I adore this brush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>I actually started wearing makeup more often after buying these.</li>
            <li>Ok so I am a big fan of Pixiwoo</li>
            <li>They are affordable compared to other high end brushes plus good quality.</li>
            <li>They clean easily and dry in shape.</li>
            <li>the multipurpose brush is good if you need to use it for powder or brush or bronzer, but is a tad too stiff for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality, super soft hair, and after 3 or more washes the shape is still the same as when I bought them , must have !!</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I&#x27;m kind of a bacteriaphobe and the pouch doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes completely, exposing them to dust, lint or whatever is in the air (or purse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have as a back up in your makeup back though.</li>
            <li>Super soft and leave your make up so pretty.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and are great from everyday application to even professional use.</li>
            <li>is my first purchase ever from Real Techniques</li>
            <li>The Real Techniques line of brushes is a real find!</li>
            <li>I use it to apply powder foundation, blush, bronzer, highlighter, contour... just a GREAT brush overall, extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Domed</li>
            <li>Love the real Techniques brushes and this is much cheaper than in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; stores.</li>
            <li>truly the best set of brushes and great value for price, have had very expensive ones that are no better than these</li>
            <li>, I use them daily, I take good care of them (washed them with Brush Shampoo before first use, and I lightly spray them with brush cleaner and wipe them down after each use), the cases are excellent quality, I can even fit my Stippling Brush in with this set, and I have not experienced any shedding after several days of daily use.  </li>
            <li>all the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is very decent</li>
            <li>Sooo super soft and</li>
            <li>, I love it and use it every single day, I haven&#x27;t touched my Sigma powder brush since I got this one, when I&#x27;m cleaning my dresser</li>
            <li>I use the purple for blending and the large for powder/ setting.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the bare mineral brushes but they continually shed their bristles.  </li>
            <li>but it works just fine if u need something for a smaller face brush.</li>
            <li>you are a first time purchaser of Real Techniques, I would highly recommend this Travel set AND the Core set</li>
            <li>All in all, you really</li>
            <li>These 3 brushes are really the essentials for makeup.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>The real Techniques Travel Essentials set arrived on time and were immediately added to my collection.</li>
            <li>I whole collection of them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and they rarely shed even after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>Since I really just wear blush.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this set along with this one Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O7AZBG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 )</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used real techniques for years and don&#x27;t plan to stop.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not scratchy at all on the face and they hold your product really well.  </li>
            <li>However the brushes don&#x27;t offer much coverage.</li>
            <li>when using Real Techniques, they notice the difference and say that these brushes feel softer than others.</li>
            <li>I got all the brushes from Real Techniques and recommend them to all my clients.</li>
            <li>Too much fall out when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often</li>
            <li>they use animal fur which you pay so much for and feels like steel wool on your face.</li>
            <li>The bristles are, of course, very plush and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes really impresses me, they work really well for makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I use it as blush brush, it works very well with mineral powder.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the makeup applicator brush.</li>
            <li>got everything I wanted with this set, the Real Techniques Core Set, and the Stippling Brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend these brushes, and this brand.  </li>
            <li>The case that&#x27;s included is also very well made, I was expecting a cheaper made case with them</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones.</li>
            <li>Would not but make-up brushes from Real Techniques again.</li>
            <li>It really blends well</li>
            <li>but it really can be used for anything.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this should be renamed to the &amp;#34;Starter Set&amp;#34; or just the &amp;#34;Essential Set&amp;#34; because this set really does contain the essentials for every day use, not just for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back FOR SURE to buy the set for eyes, and that will complete my set.</li>
            <li>, easier to clean than animal hair brushes, fantastic fibre distribution, i wont be wasting my money on expensive mac brushes any more i&#x27;m buying all of these</li>
            <li>Of course, I knew these brushes would be no different from my other beloved RT brushes.</li>
            <li>I plan to get more for all my other powders</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much before on less quality brushes, Real techniques are affordable and great quality.</li>
            <li>Finding decent, reasonably priced makeup brushes has been  a challenge.</li>
            <li>I use these on a daily basis and clean with baby wash.</li>
            <li>(I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.)</li>
            <li>Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li>As far as the eye shadow brush goes, I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but I suppose you&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it!</li>
            <li>They are soft at first.</li>
            <li>The biggest brush in this set is pretty soft</li>
            <li>also, these are full sized brushes which I like, but if you were looking for something compact and smaller, these are not it, but</li>
            <li>The newer ones do not feel as soft as the first ones I purchased.</li>
            <li>I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a decent set of brushes and aren&#x27;t looking to drop a fortune</li>
            <li>Travel Essentials contains your three main makeup application brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I like them better than my more expensive brushes( MAC and Bobbie Brown).  </li>
            <li>YOu should definitely get  the entire collection , you will love it.</li>
            <li>foundation brush in this set is bigger than the foundation brush in the Core set, making this one more likely to use.</li>
            <li>Realistic Price:  </li>
            <li>The other brushes are just fine, I wish they were softer but they apply powder very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end brushes</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li>And can stand up to any Mac, or high end brand.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The brushes are high in quality but not the brush holders.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush set is inexpensive but high quality.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re informative and fun to watch.s set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.  </li>
            <li>even if it had 3 brushes, the case can carry more on the other side no need to mention the soft &amp; high quality brushes</li>
            <li>I own several kinds... ELF, MAC and Sigma and other no-name brushes.  </li>
            <li>so that u can use the side of the brush as if it were the top of other regualr powder brushes and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>I am not a make-up artist so, I am not sure about other brushes but,these are awesome for the regular.</li>
            <li>love how it comes in the little travel kit set.</li>
            <li>Lovely little travel set.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft to the touch, highly versatile and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d end up completely replacing my MAC collection with her Real Techniques!&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the brushes are soft and apply makeup really well.</li>
            <li>I clean them with baby shampoo and air dry.</li>
            <li>For a synthetic brush, it&#x27;s obscenely soft (haha).</li>
            <li>However they may be too soft because they dont pick up much of my blush ( physicians formula brand).</li>
            <li>the brush hair is not as smooth as i expected</li>
            <li>I use all three brushes on a daily basis and have pretty much given up all my others for these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ecotools brushes (which I love as well) for a long time and these will definitely be replacing them.</li>
            <li>For the cost, they are fairly good... but not great.</li>
            <li>The other two brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li>bristles on the big, fluffy (pink) brush are nice and plush, but incredibly soft and smooth, I think the big brush in this collection is actually a better size and shape for applying blush and bronzer than the actual RT blush brush is, but that may just be a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to girls who wants to achieve flawless base makeup.</li>
            <li>Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush.</li>
            <li>My new fav brushes.</li>
            <li>like the foundation brush in this set more than the actual foundation brush that you can buy separately only because it&#x27;s a little smaller, so I feel like it gets in the areas around my nose and under my eyes a little more easily.</li>
            <li>These are fine until my kids are a little older</li>
            <li>And finally I use the yellow one for powder foundation even though you can use it with any kind of foundation (liquid, cream, compact and loose powder).</li>
            <li>They are very very soft and seem to be well made.  </li>
            <li>All the brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t lose any hairs.</li>
            <li>No bristles falling out on face, very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and dense.</li>
            <li>THe brushes are very soft andf does not harm the skin .</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li>I was able to cover my face, neck, and a portion of my chest with this guy with very little issues.</li>
            <li>These have long enough handles that make them really easy to hold and operate.</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>I like it especially for bronzer, but I also use it to set my foundation and concealer first and to put on blush.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks!</li>
            <li>Purchase these when they first came out, then re-purchased later.</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, use these everyday!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that the individually packaged Real Techniques Blush Brush was too big, and I find that this one is just right.</li>
            <li>I am washing them frequently and they look like new after every wash.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it actually works faster than my Shany foundation brush of the same style (I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match Liquid Foundation).  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the multi-task brush, it&#x27;s SOFT WOW!</li>
            <li>Too many loose bristles and no real improvement in how i look.</li>
            <li>like all other flat foundation brushes do: cakey, but that wasn&#x27;t their fault entirely because I really got this set for the other two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the domed shadow brush which I use for both eyeshadow and applying concealer.</li>
            <li>so soft.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques are the only brushes I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>The foundation brush was the one that was the least appealing to me because it still applied my foundation</li>
            <li>This replaced a 3 year old set, I think it was called Core.</li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear.</li>
            <li>They are so soft to use.</li>
            <li>I will keep trying, but so far, I am not convinced at all.</li>
            <li>They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li>like that you can see how much product is building up because the bristle tips are white.</li>
            <li>They are soft and have not had any problems with shedding.</li>
            <li>I use all the time to blend my eye shadow colors, the brush is soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Soft, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li>It has extremely soft bristles unlike MAC</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>I dont like that tipe of foundation brush, so I havent used it, but pleasently surprised with the quality of the line.</li>
            <li>so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can do a complete look from home or on the road for travel with this one kit.</li>
            <li>Brushes are sturdy, and the fibers are soft.  </li>
            <li>I recommended for all, beginners to expert, you will be surprised what you get for your money.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the blush brush had so much stuff on it</li>
            <li>They are soft and sturdier than sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I question if they are as soft as others I have owned, none-the-less</li>
            <li>the eyeshadow brush is too big and puffy and the bristles aren&#x27;t very compact for eyeshadow</li>
            <li>After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle.</li>
            <li>, they are soft.</li>
            <li>You can achieve  a  complete look (foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, blush, and powder) with just these threee brushes.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to trying my next Real Techniques brush, the Expert Face</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that that Real Techniques has a YouTube channel where they post tutorials for all of their brushes plus lots of extra content.  </li>

            <li>I use these three brushes everyday and I intend to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned them in a little vinegar water and they came clean.</li>
            <li>I Personally use the Multi task brush for mineral powder foundation, the essential for liquid foundation and the domed shadow for cream and liquid highlight but all of these brushes have many other uses!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that they seem to work better on cream products rather than powdered products (because they are synthetic haired brushes), but it seems to work out for me because you can pick up less product and then build the color up while buffing it in at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I was in the market to replace most of my makeup brushes, and in the 15 years since I bought my set of MAC brushes, their prices have seriously gone up (out of my price range).  </li>
            <li>I will not buy another high priced Mac Brush ever again, especially since their brushes shed as your applying your makeup.</li>
            <li>If you could only live on 3 brushes, these are the 3 you should get.</li>
            <li>So soft, subtle, easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>favorite brush in this pack is the Multi-use brush (the fluffy pink one).</li>
            <li>Bought these and love them, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t need or use then as badly or as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>The quality is closer to poor and the multi-task brush is not as dense and big as it appears in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;The case is nice but</li>
            <li>For the same reason, they dry off very fast.</li>
            <li>I still prefer my older brushes but this maybe because I&#x27;ve had them so long and so used to them.</li>
            <li>I like having the case to keep the brushes in so they don&#x27;t get mixed up and full of other makeup from being in my bigger makeup bag.</li>
            <li>They are definitely essentials and are so soft (as stated by everyone).</li>
            <li>far all the brushes have held up well to daily use.</li>
            <li>It is convenient ,but the brushes is not enough soft.</li>
            <li>and so far I have only used one brush</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer.</li>
            <li>It works well for applying shadow all over the lid, in the crease, and blending, which allows you to create a complete look with only one brush.  </li>
            <li>The stand-up case was kind of cheesy</li>
            <li>Out of the entire range of RT brushes, I haven&#x27;t used this one very often because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s big enough to apply foundation to my entire face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these inexpensive brushes for those who are looking for long lasting brushes that are not made of &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; material.</li>
            <li>Worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly.</li>
            <li>Arrived a little later than expected, but these are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would purchase other Real Techniques brushes in the future</li>
            <li>but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li>My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this set is the variety of brushes it contains - other sets contain 5 foundation brushes or 5 eye brushes but as a beginner I had no idea how to use them all.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with a few other real Techniques brushes since i&#x27;ve heard and read so much about them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just an average lady with a standard makeup routine (I certainly won&#x27;t be posting any YouTube makeup tutorials anytime soon), and as silly as it may sound, these brushes have helped me experiment and try new things.</li>
            <li>Would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a quality brush for less.  </li>
            <li>Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li>I use all three brushes regularly and after months of use they are still soft, holding their shape, and do not shed one single hair.</li>
            <li>I only use the large powder makeup brush and the little eye shadow one.</li>
            <li>They come on a very convenient little travel kit (I travel</li>

            <li> and i think amazingly of all the brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing design, they will stand up on their own.  </li>
            <li> They make my make up look amazing.</li>
            <li> its amazing.</li>
            <li> I own each set.</li>
            <li> When I learned that make up extraordinaire Samantha Chapman had launched her own line of brushes, I knew that I&#x27;d try them but had no idea</li>
            <li> I also liked that it came with the brush holder</li>
            <li> I know I probably wasn&#x27;t going to be needing or using the holder, but it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Cute and really good set.</li>
            <li> They keep their shape really nicely</li>
            <li> They are very versatile and Samantha Chapman does wonderful makeup tutorials, using her brushes, on youtube.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, nice brand, fare price, excelent material.</li>
            <li> domed eyeshadow brush is excellent for blending shadow out, works very well as a crease brush as well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular with my foundation or concealer</li>
            <li> Once I received them, you can really tell how great of a quality they are just by looking at them!</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s a nice idea, but I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the brushes I own.  </li>

            <li> A good deal who wants a good price and also a good material</li>
            <li> They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t find it ideal for packing shadow onto the lid, but once the shadow is there it&#x27;s great for blending.</li>
            <li> I find them easy to use and they provide a good finish.</li>
            <li> Good quality inexpensive brushes, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite ok, good for powder + bronzer+ blusher, so I will be using that as well :)</li>
            <li> and they all wash very easily.</li>
            <li> Love, love, them!</li>
            <li> Again another great brush set by Real Techniques!!</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft on the skin and non-irritating and best of all, they didn&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> -it is so soft and fits my eyelid perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are amazing, I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fantastically soft, don&#x27;t shed and apply my blush/mineral powder/foundation/eye shadow/concealer wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds, but these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> the foundation brush isn&#x27;t any more amazing than my Lancome foundation brush or my Sigma foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> love, love, love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect set to start out with and would definitely make a nice gift for a beauty lover.</li>
            <li> Overall GREAT brushes and GREAT quality...</li>
            <li> and I honestly think that the smaller brush (purple) is the best concealer brush ever....</li>
            <li> Great starting out brushes, price is great compared to a MAC brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and blend beautifully, feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look streaky in any way</li>
            <li> Again, the bristles are very smooth, and don&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful; soft, versatile, nice to hold and look at.</li>
            <li> They blend it in nicely and I can easily blend in the colors.</li>
            <li> very good product, exactly what I ordered, fast shipping, loved my purchase.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, but to large to be considered &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; sized.  </li>
            <li> Each brush in this set if soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a set of brushes that was good quality, easy to use and beginner friendly.</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>
            <li> Also love the case, makes it so convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> l love them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ❤</li>
            <li> I have purchased almost all of RT brushes and I have been 100% satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> so it can push the powder into the skin and ensures it&#x27;s not sitting on top of the foundation and have my face looking powdery</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Wish the case was a bit better looking...</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 days ago and got them today, with free shipping!</li>
            <li> The multi-task brush is phenomenal and is probably my favorite brush from the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can guarantee you that&#x27;d I&#x27;d be buying more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> OK, Its a wrap for Mac brushes.</li>
            <li> You can use these 3 for eyeshadow, foundation, concealer, and powder… excellent, universal set!</li>
            <li> Though they are not my favorite brushes to use.</li>
            <li> and I was able to put more brushes on here.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s more like a foundation/powder brush instead of a blush brush.</li>
            <li> This travel case is kind of cheap</li>
            <li> It can serve many purposes which is what I need in a traveling brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about Real Techniques brushes and I was intending on buying them to test them out eventually.</li>
            <li> yea, laziness. :)</li>

            <li> but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be needing any more cause  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of pixiwoo on youtube and have watched most of their tutorials.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the powder brush and the concealer brush</li>
            <li> I know she&#x27;ll be psyched to see them when she opens them on Christmas day:)</li>
            <li> Not in love with them at all</li>
            <li> They really give a great HD look for foundation, powder, blush, and eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can get a better brush collection for the price - or even three times the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>

            <li> Also I love the real techniques</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super affordable and every single brush is fantastic quality!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they are very easy to clean, unlike natural haired brushes.  </li>
            <li> They stay soft and mostly in their original shape, the bristles fit into every crevice of your face and their easy to clean as they don&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for really good</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes with very minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quite quick.</li>
            <li> I figured this was a perfect investment for only $11 to see if I actually like it</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the other two brushes they quickly became my favorite!</li>
            <li> Being a professional mua, I am always searching for good quality brushes that are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love how soft these brushes are and how smooth my make up looks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are soft, making it great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person, but these brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love theses brushes , performs just as well of high end brushes</li>
            <li> but so far they&#x27;re a good buy, by the way watch the tutorials online so that you use the brushes properly :)</li>
            <li> They are soft, easy to handle, easy to use.</li>
            <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;Brushes soft and beautiful does not work when you use lines or hair loss with facial advise everyone bought</li>
            <li> I own them all except for the limited edition duo fiber brush set, fine liner, and kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> not really sure on the carrying case, i would go without those since I dont use them, but the brushes alone are an excellent quality, they clean very easily, and dry pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching them, they are so soft!</li>
            <li> love these brushes...really soft!</li>
            <li> They are very smooth and help me with the final touches because they make the makeup spread out smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about these but got them for my sister for Christmas because she told me they were great brushes.</li>
            <li> On their official website, there are even tutorials on how to achieve certain looks, and how to use each brush, very helpful to me since I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use a Stippling Brush</li>
            <li> amazing brushes especially the foundation brush-</li>
            <li> so It makes it easier) and the carrying case comes with extra room to add more of your own brushes or complete your RT collection.</li>
            <li> I was wondering since it says travel, but I use the pink one for my foundation and love it I actually use the gold for contouring (when I do lol) and the purple eyeshadow one for my illuminzing powder....</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This kit is well worth the money</li>
            <li> I found these brushes to be anything but useful.</li>
            <li> I love the bristles, it is so soft.</li>
            <li> soft love them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love my old brushes and thought I may try these out.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques Brushes and only wish that they would create more brushes.</li>
            <li> These are far, my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I bought three different sets of them and honestly I don&#x27;t understand why they are so hyped up.</li>
            <li> This brand of brushes are to much for words,I love the whole set</li>
            <li> Love these damn brushes...even after my two year old painted with water colors with them..</li>
            <li> the foundation brush is useful but not for foundation</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t use a foundation brush but have found some different uses for it.</li>
            <li> She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a newbie jumping back into wearing make up</li>
            <li> This set is actually quite nice for the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> love the soft brushes.</li>
            <li> the casing is useful too.</li>
            <li> WORTH every</li>
            <li> I love the brushes so soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, easy to clean and durable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012.</li>
            <li> Far better than the junk you can buy at Sephora at a price of $40 per brush.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re informative and fun to watch.</li>
            <li> This travel set has just the right selection of brushes you will need when you travel.</li>
            <li> and they were all right.</li>
            <li> The price is right for this brush set.</li>
            <li> I clean them with castile soap and they have been holding up very well with no shedding.</li>
            <li> Great travel set or small carry.</li>
            <li> I previously went through this phase where my mentality was that if I spend a lot of money then the product must be good...</li>
            <li> Another reason I love these brushes is because they were created by Pixiwoo, which if you watch make up tutorials on youtube like me, you would know that Samantha Chapman and her sister are the talented makeup artists behind it..</li>
            <li> that makes putting on makeup easy and natural.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, which is important for the application of the products and the touch on the skin.</li>
            <li> i love all of these brushes, the pink brush is great for powder or blush, and the small purple brush is good for eyeshadow and blending in concealer, they also wash really well and don&#x27;t shed, i have repurchased several sets to give to ppl</li>
            <li> Not only does this stand on its own, the left side also has more black bands that can additionally hold 2-3 more brushes!</li>
            <li> good little set.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the mutli-task brush but the eye shadow brush was a close second!</li>
            <li> and I actually find these better.</li>
            <li> I personally like the foundation brush more on this set rather than the core collection.</li>
            <li> and they are really soft, and the price is just fabulous</li>
            <li> Domed shadow brush: this brush is bigger than I like for eyeshadow, but I absolutely love it as a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to find them for $25 Australian dollars including postage rather than $40 at Priceline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this set as opposed to getting each individual one because these were exactly the type I needed anyway.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any fall out.</li>
            <li> so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range.</li>
            <li> These are my first brushes</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Overall they&#x27;re &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; brushes, I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes! !</li>
            <li> im able to get in those areas you cant with the big brushes.</li>
            <li> so I might use them more later on</li>
            <li> actually went and bought two more of them.  </li>
            <li> I think they will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> I cannot describe how much I adore this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> I actually started wearing makeup more often after buying these.</li>
            <li> Ok so I am a big fan of Pixiwoo</li>
            <li> They are affordable compared to other high end brushes plus good quality.</li>
            <li> They clean easily and dry in shape.</li>
            <li> the multipurpose brush is good if you need to use it for powder or brush or bronzer, but is a tad too stiff for my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality, super soft hair, and after 3 or more washes the shape is still the same as when I bought them , must have !!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I&#x27;m kind of a bacteriaphobe and the pouch doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes completely, exposing them to dust, lint or whatever is in the air (or purse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have as a back up in your makeup back though.</li>
            <li> Super soft and leave your make up so pretty.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and are great from everyday application to even professional use.</li>
            <li> is my first purchase ever from Real Techniques</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques line of brushes is a real find!</li>
            <li> I use it to apply powder foundation, blush, bronzer, highlighter, contour... just a GREAT brush overall, extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Domed</li>
            <li> Love the real Techniques brushes and this is much cheaper than in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; stores.</li>
            <li> truly the best set of brushes and great value for price, have had very expensive ones that are no better than these</li>
            <li> , I use them daily, I take good care of them (washed them with Brush Shampoo before first use, and I lightly spray them with brush cleaner and wipe them down after each use), the cases are excellent quality, I can even fit my Stippling Brush in with this set, and I have not experienced any shedding after several days of daily use.  </li>
            <li> all the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is very decent</li>
            <li> Sooo super soft and</li>
            <li> , I love it and use it every single day, I haven&#x27;t touched my Sigma powder brush since I got this one, when I&#x27;m cleaning my dresser</li>
            <li> I use the purple for blending and the large for powder/ setting.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the bare mineral brushes but they continually shed their bristles.  </li>
            <li> but it works just fine if u need something for a smaller face brush.</li>
            <li> you are a first time purchaser of Real Techniques, I would highly recommend this Travel set AND the Core set</li>
            <li> All in all, you really</li>
            <li> These 3 brushes are really the essentials for makeup.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> The real Techniques Travel Essentials set arrived on time and were immediately added to my collection.</li>
            <li> I whole collection of them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and they rarely shed even after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> Since I really just wear blush.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this set along with this one Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O7AZBG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 )</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve held up very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used real techniques for years and don&#x27;t plan to stop.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not scratchy at all on the face and they hold your product really well.  </li>
            <li> However the brushes don&#x27;t offer much coverage.</li>
            <li> when using Real Techniques, they notice the difference and say that these brushes feel softer than others.</li>
            <li> I got all the brushes from Real Techniques and recommend them to all my clients.</li>
            <li> Too much fall out when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often</li>
            <li> they use animal fur which you pay so much for and feels like steel wool on your face.</li>
            <li> The bristles are, of course, very plush and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes really impresses me, they work really well for makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I use it as blush brush, it works very well with mineral powder.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the makeup applicator brush.</li>
            <li> got everything I wanted with this set, the Real Techniques Core Set, and the Stippling Brush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend these brushes, and this brand.  </li>
            <li> The case that&#x27;s included is also very well made, I was expecting a cheaper made case with them</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones.</li>
            <li> Would not but make-up brushes from Real Techniques again.</li>
            <li> It really blends well</li>
            <li> but it really can be used for anything.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this should be renamed to the &amp;#34;Starter Set&amp;#34; or just the &amp;#34;Essential Set&amp;#34; because this set really does contain the essentials for every day use, not just for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back FOR SURE to buy the set for eyes, and that will complete my set.</li>
            <li> , easier to clean than animal hair brushes, fantastic fibre distribution, i wont be wasting my money on expensive mac brushes any more i&#x27;m buying all of these</li>
            <li> Of course, I knew these brushes would be no different from my other beloved RT brushes.</li>
            <li> I plan to get more for all my other powders</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much before on less quality brushes, Real techniques are affordable and great quality.</li>
            <li> Finding decent, reasonably priced makeup brushes has been  a challenge.</li>
            <li> I use these on a daily basis and clean with baby wash.</li>
            <li> (I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.)</li>
            <li> Just make sure they dry completely or else</li>
            <li> As far as the eye shadow brush goes, I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but I suppose you&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it!</li>
            <li> They are soft at first.</li>
            <li> The biggest brush in this set is pretty soft</li>
            <li> also, these are full sized brushes which I like, but if you were looking for something compact and smaller, these are not it, but</li>
            <li> The newer ones do not feel as soft as the first ones I purchased.</li>
            <li> I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a decent set of brushes and aren&#x27;t looking to drop a fortune</li>
            <li> Travel Essentials contains your three main makeup application brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I like them better than my more expensive brushes( MAC and Bobbie Brown).  </li>
            <li> YOu should definitely get  the entire collection , you will love it.</li>
            <li> foundation brush in this set is bigger than the foundation brush in the Core set, making this one more likely to use.</li>
            <li> Realistic Price:  </li>
            <li> The other brushes are just fine, I wish they were softer but they apply powder very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end brushes</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> And can stand up to any Mac, or high end brand.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The brushes are high in quality but not the brush holders.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush set is inexpensive but high quality.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re informative and fun to watch.s set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.  </li>
            <li> even if it had 3 brushes, the case can carry more on the other side no need to mention the soft &amp; high quality brushes</li>
            <li> I own several kinds... ELF, MAC and Sigma and other no-name brushes.  </li>
            <li> so that u can use the side of the brush as if it were the top of other regualr powder brushes and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> I am not a make-up artist so, I am not sure about other brushes but,these are awesome for the regular.</li>
            <li> love how it comes in the little travel kit set.</li>
            <li> Lovely little travel set.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft to the touch, highly versatile and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d end up completely replacing my MAC collection with her Real Techniques!&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the brushes are soft and apply makeup really well.</li>
            <li> I clean them with baby shampoo and air dry.</li>
            <li> For a synthetic brush, it&#x27;s obscenely soft (haha).</li>
            <li> However they may be too soft because they dont pick up much of my blush ( physicians formula brand).</li>
            <li> the brush hair is not as smooth as i expected</li>
            <li> I use all three brushes on a daily basis and have pretty much given up all my others for these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ecotools brushes (which I love as well) for a long time and these will definitely be replacing them.</li>
            <li> For the cost, they are fairly good... but not great.</li>
            <li> The other two brushes are fine.  </li>
            <li> bristles on the big, fluffy (pink) brush are nice and plush, but incredibly soft and smooth, I think the big brush in this collection is actually a better size and shape for applying blush and bronzer than the actual RT blush brush is, but that may just be a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to girls who wants to achieve flawless base makeup.</li>
            <li> Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush.</li>
            <li> My new fav brushes.</li>
            <li> like the foundation brush in this set more than the actual foundation brush that you can buy separately only because it&#x27;s a little smaller, so I feel like it gets in the areas around my nose and under my eyes a little more easily.</li>
            <li> These are fine until my kids are a little older</li>
            <li> And finally I use the yellow one for powder foundation even though you can use it with any kind of foundation (liquid, cream, compact and loose powder).</li>
            <li> They are very very soft and seem to be well made.  </li>
            <li> All the brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t lose any hairs.</li>
            <li> No bristles falling out on face, very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and dense.</li>
            <li> THe brushes are very soft andf does not harm the skin .</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> I was able to cover my face, neck, and a portion of my chest with this guy with very little issues.</li>
            <li> These have long enough handles that make them really easy to hold and operate.</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> I like it especially for bronzer, but I also use it to set my foundation and concealer first and to put on blush.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks!</li>
            <li> Purchase these when they first came out, then re-purchased later.</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, use these everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that the individually packaged Real Techniques Blush Brush was too big, and I find that this one is just right.</li>
            <li> I am washing them frequently and they look like new after every wash.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it actually works faster than my Shany foundation brush of the same style (I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match Liquid Foundation).  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the multi-task brush, it&#x27;s SOFT WOW!</li>
            <li> Too many loose bristles and no real improvement in how i look.</li>
            <li> like all other flat foundation brushes do: cakey, but that wasn&#x27;t their fault entirely because I really got this set for the other two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the domed shadow brush which I use for both eyeshadow and applying concealer.</li>
            <li> so soft.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the only brushes I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> The foundation brush was the one that was the least appealing to me because it still applied my foundation</li>
            <li> This replaced a 3 year old set, I think it was called Core.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear.</li>
            <li> They are so soft to use.</li>
            <li> I will keep trying, but so far, I am not convinced at all.</li>
            <li> They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li> like that you can see how much product is building up because the bristle tips are white.</li>
            <li> They are soft and have not had any problems with shedding.</li>
            <li> I use all the time to blend my eye shadow colors, the brush is soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Soft, but not too soft.  </li>
            <li> It has extremely soft bristles unlike MAC</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> I dont like that tipe of foundation brush, so I havent used it, but pleasently surprised with the quality of the line.</li>
            <li> so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can do a complete look from home or on the road for travel with this one kit.</li>
            <li> Brushes are sturdy, and the fibers are soft.  </li>
            <li> I recommended for all, beginners to expert, you will be surprised what you get for your money.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the blush brush had so much stuff on it</li>
            <li> They are soft and sturdier than sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I question if they are as soft as others I have owned, none-the-less</li>
            <li> the eyeshadow brush is too big and puffy and the bristles aren&#x27;t very compact for eyeshadow</li>
            <li> After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle.</li>
            <li> , they are soft.</li>
            <li> You can achieve  a  complete look (foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, blush, and powder) with just these threee brushes.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying my next Real Techniques brush, the Expert Face</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that that Real Techniques has a YouTube channel where they post tutorials for all of their brushes plus lots of extra content.  </li>

            <li> I use these three brushes everyday and I intend to buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned them in a little vinegar water and they came clean.</li>
            <li> I Personally use the Multi task brush for mineral powder foundation, the essential for liquid foundation and the domed shadow for cream and liquid highlight but all of these brushes have many other uses!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that they seem to work better on cream products rather than powdered products (because they are synthetic haired brushes), but it seems to work out for me because you can pick up less product and then build the color up while buffing it in at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I was in the market to replace most of my makeup brushes, and in the 15 years since I bought my set of MAC brushes, their prices have seriously gone up (out of my price range).  </li>
            <li> I will not buy another high priced Mac Brush ever again, especially since their brushes shed as your applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> If you could only live on 3 brushes, these are the 3 you should get.</li>
            <li> So soft, subtle, easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> favorite brush in this pack is the Multi-use brush (the fluffy pink one).</li>
            <li> Bought these and love them, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t need or use then as badly or as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> The quality is closer to poor and the multi-task brush is not as dense and big as it appears in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;The case is nice but</li>
            <li> For the same reason, they dry off very fast.</li>
            <li> I still prefer my older brushes but this maybe because I&#x27;ve had them so long and so used to them.</li>
            <li> I like having the case to keep the brushes in so they don&#x27;t get mixed up and full of other makeup from being in my bigger makeup bag.</li>
            <li> They are definitely essentials and are so soft (as stated by everyone).</li>
            <li> far all the brushes have held up well to daily use.</li>
            <li> It is convenient ,but the brushes is not enough soft.</li>
            <li> and so far I have only used one brush</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer.</li>
            <li> It works well for applying shadow all over the lid, in the crease, and blending, which allows you to create a complete look with only one brush.  </li>
            <li> The stand-up case was kind of cheesy</li>
            <li> Out of the entire range of RT brushes, I haven&#x27;t used this one very often because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s big enough to apply foundation to my entire face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these inexpensive brushes for those who are looking for long lasting brushes that are not made of &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; material.</li>
            <li> Worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little later than expected, but these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would purchase other Real Techniques brushes in the future</li>
            <li> but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li> My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this set is the variety of brushes it contains - other sets contain 5 foundation brushes or 5 eye brushes but as a beginner I had no idea how to use them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a few other real Techniques brushes since i&#x27;ve heard and read so much about them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just an average lady with a standard makeup routine (I certainly won&#x27;t be posting any YouTube makeup tutorials anytime soon), and as silly as it may sound, these brushes have helped me experiment and try new things.</li>
            <li> Would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a quality brush for less.  </li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product.</li>
            <li> I use all three brushes regularly and after months of use they are still soft, holding their shape, and do not shed one single hair.</li>
            <li> I only use the large powder makeup brush and the little eye shadow one.</li>
            <li> They come on a very convenient little travel kit (I travel</li>
            <li> That is the main reason I switched to Real Techniques from other pro brushes(which started loosing hair and became dry after a few washes).</li>
            <li> In this set I did really like the big pink brush which I use for blush but the other two are just sitting on my Vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive the brushes in the set I bought are fake.</li>
            <li> well, it is just me, not a big fan of flat foundation brush, i use it to apply my Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion and use the buffing brush from another set as foundation brush instead.</li>
            <li> The large brush is too big to use for blush, the medium brush is too small and pointy and the smallest brush is for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Biggest warning I can give future owners of these brushes is to never subject them to extreme heat.</li>
            <li> I have bought high end and low end brushes in the past of several different types and brands and these brushes are what I would return to and buy again if needed.  </li>
            <li> i hope they last long.</li>
            <li> These brushes last a long time and keep their shape when cleaned.</li>
            <li> , it saves a ton of money in foundation because you use 1/4 the amount used with a flat foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> These clean easily, do not shed and I can even slip in another small brush if I need to for when I go on trips.</li>
            <li> For me they actually came wayyy earlier than the expected date it said.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that it was always open and that my brushes weren&#x27;t sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any loose bristles fall out or them become misshapen from regular use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn&#x27;t easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the burshes are smaller than what I expected them to be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet firm when need by.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fluffy, soft and durable.</li>
            <li> So soft and help apply my makeup in half the time!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much less expensive than some of the \\&quot;famous\\&quot; brands, but much better quality than what you can get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough room to add another brush on the other side of the case.</li>
            <li> I think I going to purchase the other brushes from this line since the travel set was just a way for me to try three basic brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for other things such as blending concealer</li>
            <li> the middle brush i like to use for my highlight and the big fluffy brush for my powder or blush.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the case, it is too bulky for me to want to travel with, but I will just use my old case.</li>
            <li> I am so excited when I received my new makeup brushes, but they disappointed me.</li>
            <li> The bigger bristle head on this brush does make applying cream or liquid foundations a little easier than the Core set Foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink one works as a blush brush and also as a powder brush.</li>
            <li> use the pink one a lot for applying powders all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel essentials set is lacking a blush brush; the largest pink brush could be used for that</li>
            <li> This kit contains three essential brushes needed for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> The big round face brush is itchy.  </li>
            <li> There was absolutely no shedding.  </li>
            <li> but I think a brush should be sturdy enough to withstand a bit of harsh weather.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only had them for a few days</li>
            <li> I use the pink brush as a blush brush.</li>
            <li> The minus one start is for the foundation brush,</li>
            <li> A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...</li>
            <li> I use the pink one for blush and it does its job to deposit the color and smoothing it out.</li>
            <li> The Domed Shadow Brush is sized between the Base Shadow Brush and the Deluxe Crease Brush from the Starter Set.  </li>
            <li> My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Real Techniques makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over any other brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over any other brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the foundation brush, it is very rough on my face...</li>
            <li> However, as you use it (less than a month), they are quite rough and scratchy on your face.</li>
            <li> My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham.</li>
            <li> In Australia Real Techniques are expensive (like everything else)</li>
            <li> The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center.</li>
            <li> has had absolutely nothing bad to say, in fact she is requesting several of their other products.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying other brushes from this company!</li>
            <li> I have since bought a few other RT brushes bc</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the black case at all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, the case they come with is a little bit uncomfortable at the beginning</li>
            <li> would recommmed this to people who are on a tight badget.</li>
            <li> Since getting them, I&#x27;ve used at least three of them every single day.</li>
            <li> Have had them a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> so i was a little nervous about using them and not looking like a clown with make up.</li>
            <li> I still cannot believe how little they cost.  </li>
            <li> The foundation brush is too small for my taste, but it&#x27;s a high-quality brush that can be used for lots of other tasks (eye shadow blending, concealer blending, contouring, etc.).</li>
            <li> Heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I used these brushes for everyday make up</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not for heavy application of any powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday with my routine.</li>
            <li> I plan on getting a few &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; brushes on a select few.</li>
            <li> which I thought would resolve when washed a few times</li>
            <li> I washed them immediately and a few times since with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo (</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a little bit on the small side for powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they are a little on the small side.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months, I have discovered the benefits of investing in quality makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> Very little fall-out, if any at all.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are harsh and my skin hurts!</li>
            <li> Being an Australian buying these brushes at priceline is just too expensive for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d qualify this as \\&quot;travel essentials\\&quot; set, but admittedly, the brushes get the job done.</li>
            <li> I usually reach for my Boots</li>
            <li> Use these everyday, durable, washable, no fall out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear mineral powder foundation</li>
            <li> : this is the one I don&#x27;t use everyday -- it&#x27;s very small for foundation, and the bristles are sparse.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used and washed them a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems.</li>
            <li> WELL, I can hardly get any product on to my actually lid because it&#x27;s just chilling in the brush.</li>
            <li> I am challenged by Fibromyalgia which makes using small sponges and brushes hard.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made.</li>
            <li> Too bad my daughter decided to clean my bathroom and now the travel pouch is missing!  :(</li>
            <li> Seriously a steal, I&#x27;m so inpressed.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> seriously feels like i am putting my make up on with a chinchilla.</li>
            <li> I seriously would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush was a little useless to me..</li>
            <li> waste of money, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the synthetic bristles are not pleasant to use and they do not work well with my products.</li>
            <li> - then you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell weird or shed.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on these brushes before I bought them and everyone was crazy about them</li>
            <li> They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, these aren&#x27;t that bad, but I would never compare them to mac or sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I cannot say I am disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best brushes I have ever used! A must buy.</li>
            <li> Bristles are harsh and my skin hurts! Essential Foundation brush: bigger than Pointed Foundation brush with same shape. Multi Task brush: smaller than blush brush but bigger and longer than Contour brush and Buffing brush</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, but to large to be considered &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; sized.  I was hoping to add these to the kit that I carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great brush set. Great quality. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> so soft. so easy to apply like on the videos of pixiwoo. i love them. i hope they last long.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for travel! They are incredibly soft on the skin and non-irritating and best of all, they didn&#x27;t shed! My favorite was the mutli-task brush but the eye shadow brush was a close second!</li>
            <li> I have been watching the Pixiwoo sisters on Youtube for years and have wanted these brushes forever!  They are very very soft and seem to be well made.  The bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they are very easy to clean, unlike natural haired brushes.  The only thing is that they seem to work better on cream products rather than powdered products (because they are synthetic haired brushes), but it seems to work out for me because you can pick up less product and then build the color up while buffing it in at the same time.  It makes for a longer lasting finish.  I use these three brushes everyday and I intend to buy more in the future.  Great bargain!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques are the only brushes I&#x27;ll use now. I&#x27;ve used a lot of high end brushes and I actually find these better.</li>
            <li> Good product，beautiful and usefull.</li>
            <li> No shedding! I personally like the foundation brush more on this set rather than the core collection.</li>
            <li> Some of the best brushes I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They stay soft and mostly in their original shape, the bristles fit into every crevice of your face and their easy to clean as they don&#x27;t shed too much. These are the closest you&#x27;re going to get to high-end quality for a low price except for maybe EcoTools. Definitely worth the money, I may even order some more today!</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended to me. The bristles are soft and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t high-end brushes, but they certainly aren&#x27;t cheap, dollar store quality either! These are economical, soft, easy to clean and apply my make up flawlessly. The case is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a decent set of brushes and aren&#x27;t looking to drop a fortune - then you can&#x27;t go wrong with these!&lt;br /&gt;The case is just a case for me. I don&#x27;t use it as a stand up holder (basically it keeps them from being thrown in a drawer).</li>
            <li> Use these brushes every day and they&#x27;ve held up beautifully. Have had them a little over a year now. Would order these again when the time comes. Also love the case, makes it so convenient for travel. Also has extra loops that I store my mascara &amp; eye liner in.</li>
            <li> Really nice set of brushes from a reliable brand!</li>
            <li> I am always on the go and I just love these brushes they easily fit in to my purse and they are easy to clean. The quality is really good they don&#x27;t shed and they are really soft, and the price is just fabulous</li>
            <li> Very good brushes! the key to having good make up is having good brushes</li>
            <li> i was looking for brush for 3 month,i was looking for good brush and great price , i review all u tube about bursh, and i found them , i get them very fast , they are very good, girls, if you looking for good brush and good price that is the one. l love them.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them so they must be good!</li>
            <li> Brushes are good for the price nice soft and get the job done I like the case possibly for when traveling but don&#x27;t see that I would use this on a daily basis at home. I would purchase other Real Techniques brushes in the future</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  Great prices!  Would recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a quality brush for less.  I have bought high end and low end brushes in the past of several different types and brands and these brushes are what I would return to and buy again if needed.  They do their job well.</li>
            <li> The brushes were great except the foundation brush. It may just be my preference but it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. I am not a make-up artist so, I am not sure about other brushes but,these are awesome for the regular. I bought another set for my sister.</li>
            <li> Best brushes so soft!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ❤️</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft. And perfect for a makeup beginner! Travel Essentials contains your three main makeup application brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve liked. ESPECIALLY the eyeshadow one -it is so soft and fits my eyelid perfectly. The only thing is that I&#x27;m kind of a bacteriaphobe and the pouch doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes completely, exposing them to dust, lint or whatever is in the air (or purse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for several months now and use 2 out of 3 of them daily. I clean them with castile soap and they have been holding up very well with no shedding. Here is my take on each of them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Multi-task brush: the size is perfect for blush, so that&#x27;s what I use this for. It&#x27;s probably a little bit on the small side for powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Domed shadow brush: this brush is bigger than I like for eyeshadow, but I absolutely love it as a concealer brush. It&#x27;s the perfect size, and easily blends the concealer out to an airbrush-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Foundation brush: this is the one I don&#x27;t use everyday -- it&#x27;s very small for foundation, and the bristles are sparse. I prefer the Expert Face Brush for liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend these brushes to everyone. No shedding, they pick up the product well. The application is smooth. Best brushes yet and I&#x27;ve used every brand possible. These are by far the best. I own each set. Buy&#x27;em and you will be hooked!!!</li>
            <li> I use these brushes daily! They are soft and great for people who have allergies to the goat/pony brushes. not really sure on the carrying case, i would go without those since I dont use them, but the brushes alone are an excellent quality, they clean very easily, and dry pretty quickly too. If you are looking for a great quality brush and are on a budget, THIS IS THE SET FOR YOU! I have purchased almost all of RT brushes and I have been 100% satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> amazing brushes especially the foundation brush- wow what a difference it makes in your face when you apply with that brush.</li>
            <li> Love Real Techniques brushes... Really love the deal on these here! They work great with no shedding... Get these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> The foundation brush(yellow) is great for application, gets right into d inner corners for an even application and also for concealer application.&lt;br /&gt;The  domed shadow brush(purple) is great for eye shadow application, blending and also to apply concealer.&lt;br /&gt;The multipurpose brush(pink) is great for powder, bronzer, blush application.&lt;br /&gt; All in all Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this became available on Amazon. It&#x27;s super affordable and every single brush is fantastic quality!!! I actually use the foundation brush for concealer on my face and the eyeshadow brush for undereye concealer and the multitask brush for powder. I love love love them all, the multitask brush is super super soft so it can push the powder into the skin and ensures it&#x27;s not sitting on top of the foundation and have my face looking powdery, I love it and use it every single day, I haven&#x27;t touched my Sigma powder brush since I got this one, when I&#x27;m cleaning my dresser I can&#x27;t stop touching them, they are so soft! These brushes are a definite must-have!</li>
            <li> Love the real Techniques brushes and this is much cheaper than in my local &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; stores. These clean easily, do not shed and I can even slip in another small brush if I need to for when I go on trips. I highly recommend these inexpensive brushes for those who are looking for long lasting brushes that are not made of &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; material.</li>
            <li> This travel set has just the right selection of brushes you will need when you travel. They come in a handy easy to clean case. These brushes are the softest and are made from Taklon synthetic. This means you can use both powder and creme makeup with these versatile brushes. Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> even if it had 3 brushes, the case can carry more on the other side no need to mention the soft &amp; high quality brushes</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes. The case makes them easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, if you start off with this brand of brushes as a starter. You&#x27;ll have built in confidence going forward of what defines a very good brush from those that just don&#x27;t. Will save you loads of money and heart ache!</li>
            <li> Great price and absolutely amazing quality! I use all three brushes on a daily basis and have pretty much given up all my others for these. The tapered brush is excellent for contouring/highlighting. I like using the crease brush to conceal my under eye area.  Powder brush does its job perfectly but can also be used as a blush brush. Also, the case is perfect for travel. All in all, you really the bang for your buck with these brushes and I assure you this purchase will not be regretted. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great brushes- no shedding at all. Recommended for anyone who needs makeup brushes! Wish the case was a bit better looking...</li>
            <li> Great, I can&#x27;t see myself ever going to a different brand ever again!  SO WORTH IT!! Seriously a steal, I&#x27;m so inpressed. I ordered 2 days ago and got them today, with free shipping!</li>
            <li> So soft! Arrived a little later than expected, but these are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Those brushes are amazing They are soft and useful with good price I like them also my sisters order the same brushes after they try mine</li>
            <li> The foundation brush was the one that was the least appealing to me because it still applied my foundation like all other flat foundation brushes do: cakey, but that wasn&#x27;t their fault entirely because I really got this set for the other two brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the domed shadow brush which I use for both eyeshadow and applying concealer. The multi-task brush is phenomenal and is probably my favorite brush from the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first purchase ever from Real Techniques and I can guarantee you that&#x27;d I&#x27;d be buying more brushes from them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, I like their quality. The pink one works as a blush brush and also as a powder brush. The purple one word great for the crease.</li>
            <li> I especially love the face brush and it&#x27;s good that I can bring this along when traveling! But if you&#x27;re only gonna get this for the face brush, then I say go get the individual face brush instead</li>
            <li> When I learned that make up extraordinaire Samantha Chapman had launched her own line of brushes, I knew that I&#x27;d try them but had no idea I&#x27;d end up completely replacing my MAC collection with her Real Techniques!&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are amazing, I absolutely love them. They&#x27;re soft to the touch, highly versatile and reasonably priced.  Try them, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For make-up tutorials check out Sam &amp; Nic (sister and business partner) at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> These are a great brush set of your in a budget or beginning in makeup. Great quality brushes and loving the multitasking pink brush!</li>
            <li> In Australia Real Techniques are expensive (like everything else) so I was pleased to find them for $25 Australian dollars including postage rather than $40 at Priceline. They are definitely essentials and are so soft (as stated by everyone). Love my purchase!</li>
            <li> these brushes are really nice!!!!</li>
            <li> OK, Its a wrap for Mac brushes. I absolutely love this brush set, soft, fluffy delivers color beautifully and best part of all DOES NOT SHED!!!!! I plan on trying other brushes from this company! I will not buy another high priced Mac Brush ever again, especially since their brushes shed as your applying your makeup.</li>
            <li> Absoutely love these brushes! These 3 brushes are really the essentials for makeup. You can use these 3 for eyeshadow, foundation, concealer, and powder… excellent, universal set!</li>
            <li> all of the brushes in there is needed and good.</li>
            <li> Though they are not my favorite brushes to use. They are great quality brushes for a great price. I was happy with them, I guess I have to practice using them more for different makeup applications.  But over all I do agree that, the quality is very good. I also liked that it came with the brush holder and I was able to put more brushes on here. Awesome</li>
            <li> I am so excited when I received my new makeup brushes, but they disappointed me. The bristles came out when I was checking the brushes!</li>
            <li> These are some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve used on my face! I previously went through this phase where my mentality was that if I spend a lot of money then the product must be good... After watching tons of Youtube videos of Tanya Burr and Zoe Sugg (aka Zoella), I decided to try the brushes they use which is mostly from the Real Techniques collection. I will never go back to spending 40 dollars on a brush! In this kit you have the Multitasker (the pink), which is great for blush bronzer or powdered foundation (or anything powder!) Then you have the Dome Shadow Brush (the purple), which is for eyeshadow, the you have a foundation brush (the orange), which can be used for foundation or even concealer. This has all you&#x27;ll ever need when traveling or even just at home. Real Techniques Brushes are the best brushes I have ever used, and they&#x27;re incredibly affordable!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean using brush cleanser or baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I use the pink one a lot for applying powders all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;070815&lt;br /&gt;Update: I bought another kit for my friend, she loves it!</li>
            <li> A few more brushes would make this the ideal set for the majority of women.  Sad to buy so many that will never be used.  After several weeks of trying I am giving up on all the brushes.  Too many loose bristles and no real improvement in how i look.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as expected from reviews but does the job. Like the case</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit about a month ago. All the brushes are soft and apply makeup really well. The only additional brush I need is a fat kabuki face brush that I also purchased on amazon. This kit is well worth the money and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to &amp;#34;grow up&amp;#34; and stop using a rink-dink set of travel brushes I bought on a whim.  My quest led me to these brushes (recommended by blogger Cara from mascara.com).  True to the name, these brushes are the essentials and provide a great foundation for your makeup tool arsenal.  The brushes are fantastically soft, don&#x27;t shed and apply my blush/mineral powder/foundation/eye shadow/concealer wonderfully.  If you are on the fence, wavering about whether to buy these, just do it.  You will not regret it.  I&#x27;m just an average lady with a standard makeup routine (I certainly won&#x27;t be posting any YouTube makeup tutorials anytime soon), and as silly as it may sound, these brushes have helped me experiment and try new things.</li>
            <li> Love this set! Heavy duty. Worth the few extra bucks. Bristles are smooth and can be cleaned easily. Extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> The quality is closer to poor and the multi-task brush is not as dense and big as it appears in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;The case is nice but the burshes are smaller than what I expected them to be.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from the UK last week and it arrived today. I havent tried them yet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommmed this to people who are on a tight badget.</li>
            <li> The large brush is too big to use for blush, the medium brush is too small and pointy and the smallest brush is for eye shadow. I found these brushes to be anything but useful.</li>
            <li> This replaced a 3 year old set, I think it was called Core. The travel essentials set is lacking a blush brush; the largest pink brush could be used for that but I think it&#x27;s more like a foundation/powder brush instead of a blush brush. There&#x27;s enough room to add another brush on the other side of the case.All the brushes are very soft and don&#x27;t lose any hairs.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes! and if you get this you should also get the stippling brush. Not only does this stand on its own, the left side also has more black bands that can additionally hold 2-3 more brushes! amazing!</li>
            <li> My deaf fiancee love it!!!! she feel comfortable smooth her skin more style makeup! she is very happy this now.</li>
            <li> Great brush set for the price! This travel case is kind of cheap so I threw it out, but the brushes are good quality.</li>
            <li> I love real Techniques brushes. The star of this set is the powder brush (the pink-handled brush). It can serve many purposes which is what I need in a traveling brush. I like it especially for bronzer, but I also use it to set my foundation and concealer first and to put on blush. The foundation brush is good to put the product (foundation, CC cream, etc.) on your face, but not to blend it in. I haven&#x27;t used the eye brush much, but it is really soft and it&#x27;s a good option to place product all over the lid as well as to lightly blend shadows into the crease.</li>
            <li> truly the best set of brushes and great value for price, have had very expensive ones that are no better than these</li>
            <li> I used these brushes for everyday make up and it blends my make up very nicely. I love the bristles, it is so soft. Definitely recommended to people who travels a lot because the powder brush can be used as a multipurpose brush for blush and contour.</li>
            <li> Great value for this top quality product. All you need when away from home. Delivery was quite quick. You can go on the website and check out the girls&#x27; video about the uses of the brushes and how to clean them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to get right to it: these brushes are awesome. I used the foundation brush to paint on body paint, and it did the job well. I was able to cover my face, neck, and a portion of my chest with this guy with very little issues. Since the big brush is used to multitask, I use it to contour and blush up my cheeks--also does the well, if I do say so myself. As far as the eye shadow brush goes, I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but I suppose you&#x27;ll just have to take my word for it! Also, the hairs never fell out and the brushes clean very easily.</li>
            <li> good little set. i use the foundation brush for my undereye concealer. the domed shadow brush is great for blending color on the lid or in the crease. the multi-task brush is especially great since it can be used for anything on the face. all the brushes are super soft. i&#x27;ve used and washed them a lot and have not experienced shedding or any other problems. recommend!!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set, I&#x27;ve used them everyday and they&#x27;ve held up excellently all this time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good pricing and as corny as it sounds a steal of a deal.</li>
            <li> Great travel set or small carry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soo happy I purchased these brushes. I know I probably wasn&#x27;t going to be needing or using the holder, but it&#x27;s a nice touch. I&#x27;m glad I got this set as opposed to getting each individual one because these were exactly the type I needed anyway. Also, I have never tried these brushes before. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Real Techniques brushes and I was intending on buying them to test them out eventually. I figured this was a perfect investment for only $11 to see if I actually like it and I loved it! The brushes are super soft and blend beautifully, feels great on my skin, doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look streaky in any way, it&#x27;s just perfect and exactly what I was expecting from these brushes. This is a perfect set to start out with and would definitely make a nice gift for a beauty lover.</li>
            <li> Cute and really good set.</li>
            <li> They are soft at first. However, as you use it (less than a month), they are quite rough and scratchy on your face. They also sheds. I definitely do not recommend these. waste of money, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! The brushes are easy to clean and soft, great for blending and are just an all around 10 out of 10! I would 100 percent recommend to anyone! Great product!</li>
            <li> The real Techniques Travel Essentials set arrived on time and were immediately added to my collection. It is a great, medium quality starter set and provides three primary brushes for a daily makeup routine. The foundation brush applies liquid foundation smoothly and evenly. I use the all purpose brush for powder blush and it blends beautifully. I ended up giving the shadow brush to my daughter since I also ordered and love the real Techniques Starter Set which includes more eye and liner brushes which I use instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far all the brushes have held up well to daily use. The bristles are soft and smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any fall out. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged for a gift</li>
            <li> I truly in love with the real technique brushes. They are affordable compared to other high end brushes plus good quality.</li>
            <li> Great products! I order this brushes for my sister, who loves make up, so she needed I whole collection of them. She love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the foundation brush, it is very rough on my face... but I LOVE the other two brushes they quickly became my favorite!</li>
            <li> perfect. soft love them</li>
            <li> I just recently started doing my make up on a daily basis. Before it was just for special occasions. This is a great starter kit. I have since bought a few other RT brushes bc they are great quality and won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Being an Australian buying these brushes at priceline is just too expensive for me so i decided to buy them off amazon as they are in a such more affordable range. For me they actually came wayyy earlier than the expected date it said.It came 5 days earlier than I thought. The quality of these brushes just blows my mind and they are just so soft i swear almost like a teddy bear. I also purchased the starter set, core collection and expert face brush and i think amazingly of all the brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, I have a ton of makeup brushes, including this brand, but for some reason, I always seem to reach for this travel set...I think the reason is laziness....yea, laziness. :)</li>
            <li> I rated these brushes 5 stars because there isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about them. The brushes are soft and they rarely shed even after a couple of washes. Another reason I love these brushes is because they were created by Pixiwoo, which if you watch make up tutorials on youtube like me, you would know that Samantha Chapman and her sister are the talented makeup artists behind it.. It also makes them easy to use because they are featured in her videos.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to anyone that wants to try affordable but good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> love, love, love these brushes!</li>
            <li> It is convenient ,but the brushes is not enough soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these 3 brushes are enough for travel but I could just be brush obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This was a gift set for my sister who loves make up sets. This kit contains three essential brushes needed for everyday makeup. The  packaging and presentation is great for home use or take on the go.</li>
            <li> this is a must have for any one who uses liquid/power foundation on a daily basis. they are fairly easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE my Real techniques brushes!! They come on a very convenient little travel kit (I travel so It makes it easier) and the carrying case comes with extra room to add more of your own brushes or complete your RT collection. Great quality and amazing prize compared to MAC and other good quality products. 5 STARS!!!!</li>
            <li> The best thing about these brushes is that i don&#x27;t have any issues of the hairs falling off the brush.  I originally purchased the bare mineral brushes but they continually shed their bristles.  The biggest brush in this set is pretty soft so it&#x27;s not for heavy application of any powder foundation.  I use the middle brush for my concealer and the smaller brush for my eye shadow.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the brushes.  I like having the case to keep the brushes in so they don&#x27;t get mixed up and full of other makeup from being in my bigger makeup bag.</li>
            <li> No bristles falling out on face, very soft.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes and I fell in love right away. I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the finished results after I apply my make-up in the morning. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to get them.</li>
            <li> love love love and if you dont have get it love love love this i cant get over how much i love it</li>
            <li> I used these brushes when applying my make up. They are so soft to use. I find the set to be a must have. I also enjoyed the case they come in, since you can use it as a travel case or stand while using the brushes. I would tell my friends and family about how wonderful the brushes are constructed and to purchase the set.</li>
            <li> Finding decent, reasonably priced makeup brushes has been  a challenge. They are often scratchy and/or shed bristles.  (bristle-face...gross!)  These are the main three brushes I use, so the travel set was a good solution for me.  These brushes feel great on my face and are good quality.  I think they deserve 5 stars!</li>
            <li> These brushes are suuuper soft and really good quality! These are my first brushes but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be needing any more cause  these do it all! :)</li>
            <li> great for travelling, i dont need to take all my brushes. this set it is just perfect i totally recomend it</li>
            <li> Best Face brushes I every had.&lt;br /&gt;I would be sure to buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t find these to be as good as others say these are......I will keep trying, but so far, I am not convinced at all. Thankfully these are inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I got these for the simple fact I didn&#x27;t need 32 brushes like some offer. I&#x27;m in love with these brushes.  They grab the product well and it goes on smooth.  They don&#x27;t smell weird or shed.  And these are the only brushes I use now.  Since I really just wear blush.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love love my new brushes, they are perfect for traveling, plus there is tons of tutorials on youtube on how to give them the best use posible. Highly recommended, the case they come with is a little bit uncomfortable at the beginning but then it starts to give in.</li>
            <li> I love how colorful these brushes are. They work well, and so far haven&#x27;t had any shedding. I also like the feel of the handles and of the bristles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous! I like them better than my more expensive brushes( MAC and Bobbie Brown).  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> The big round face brush is itchy.  I will not be using it.  The other two brushes are fine.  The have not shed after washing.</li>
            <li> I only use the large powder makeup brush and the little eye shadow one. They&#x27;re worth the price. They wash easily and have held up well.&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can see how much product is building up because the bristle tips are white.</li>
            <li> Have been using this set along with this one Real Techniques Expert Face Brush ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007O7AZBG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 ) since Christmas and love them! I am challenged by Fibromyalgia which makes using small sponges and brushes hard. These have long enough handles that make them really easy to hold and operate. The bristles are soft yet firm when need by. I clean them with baby shampoo and air dry. They clean easily and dry in shape. They&#x27;ve held up very well. I haven&#x27;t had any loose bristles fall out or them become misshapen from regular use.</li>
            <li> These brushes last a long time and keep their shape when cleaned. I&#x27;ve used real techniques for years and don&#x27;t plan to stop.</li>
            <li> I was seeking to replace my brushes I&#x27;ve had for quite some time. I love my old brushes and thought I may try these out. These are good for the price and gets the job done. I still prefer my older brushes but this maybe because I&#x27;ve had them so long and so used to them.</li>
            <li> I love Real Techniques Brushes and only wish that they would create more brushes. These brushes are fantastic for beginners and pros alike. They are perfect and affordable. I am so inspired that they were created by Youtube Gurus!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes! So soft and help apply my makeup in half the time!</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup brushes I have ever bought!  I have tried all kinds, but these are by far the best.  Bristles are not scratchy at all on the face and they hold your product really well.  Love, love, them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they work soo well for their intended purpose. They keep their shape really nicely and I like the grip too!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality and very affordable I think I going to purchase the other brushes from this line since the travel set was just a way for me to try three basic brushes.  I bought the face collection for my bestie and she is also pleased with this line of brushes</li>
            <li> Best. Brushes. Ever. Seriously. I love these brushes so much. The bristles never fall out, and they are so easy to clean! Just make sure they dry completely or else the where the bristles meet the brush might rust.</li>
            <li> i am a make up newbie and was recommended this set by maskcara. i didn&#x27;t have any brushes so i was a little nervous about using them and not looking like a clown with make up. i especially love the eye shadow brush. i&#x27;ve never had one in this shape and it works perfectly for my crease.</li>
            <li> this comapany makes very good brush at an exceptional price. Love the texture , no shedding , reall authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;I would shop at this site any time,</li>
            <li> I love all of these make up brushes I use them everyday with my routine. They are soft and have not had any problems with shedding. They are easy to clean. I also like how the handles are labeled to tell you what each brush is, however after only a week of use the label is fading and you can&#x27;t read it anymore.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about these brushes and was really excited to try them. However the brushes don&#x27;t offer much coverage. A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use it everday and not just when I travel but you can bet when I do I&#x27;ll bring it along (:</li>
            <li> Amazing...really good</li>
            <li> Very soft and dense. Foundation brush wasn&#x27;t any better than my Seohora one, but I wasn&#x27;t looking to replace it. It just happened to come in this 3 pack. So when the Sephora one wears out, I&#x27;ll use this one. Eye shadow and blush brush were awesome</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied! I&#x27;m a frugal makeup lover, &amp; LOVE these! Affordable, and great grand quality, not to mention cute! I def recommend! xo</li>
            <li> amazing quality! Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes.  I still cannot believe how little they cost.  I own several kinds... ELF, MAC and Sigma and other no-name brushes.  These are far, my favorite.  Amazing design, they will stand up on their own.  Gotta love that.  So soft, subtle, easy on the skin.  Very little fall-out, if any at all.  Anyone that loves makeup the way I do MUST have these brushes in their collection.  You will not regret purchasing them; neither will your pocketbook!</li>
            <li> I love my real technique brushes...they are well made and do a perfect applying my makeup. They are very versatile and Samantha Chapman does wonderful makeup tutorials, using her brushes, on youtube. Ive ordered more!</li>
            <li> extremely soft brushes , great quality , amazing price , apply make up perfectly ,, i love hoe they are color coded .. sam did a great job .. i recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! My makeup looks flawless when I use these. My new fav brushes. Def buying more!!! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for their value! When I got them I was amazed at the quality of them. They are a great buy?</li>
            <li> I love the brushes! They are very soft, which is important for the application of the products and the touch on the skin. I am a pro makeup artist and use brushes every day. I am washing them frequently and they look like new after every wash. That is the main reason I switched to Real Techniques from other pro brushes(which started loosing hair and became dry after a few washes). I also get great feedback from my clients when using Real Techniques, they notice the difference and say that these brushes feel softer than others. I got all the brushes from Real Techniques and recommend them to all my clients. I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much before on less quality brushes, Real techniques are affordable and great quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like these brushes. Too much fall out when applying eyeshadow. I wanted to like them but I need to buy another brand.</li>
            <li> After many, many, many nights of deliberation about whether or not I wanted to try these brushes and hearing countless people tell me how wonderful they are, I finally decided to purchase the Real Techniques brushes. I bought three different sets of them and honestly I don&#x27;t understand why they are so hyped up. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with any of the ones I received. In this set I did really like the big pink brush which I use for blush but the other two are just sitting on my Vanity. The eye-shadow brush holds the product well, TOO WELL, I can hardly get any product on to my actually lid because it&#x27;s just chilling in the brush. Overall they&#x27;re &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; brushes, I&#x27;ve had better and I&#x27;ve had worse. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay for them again.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes with very minimal shedding. I use these on a daily basis and clean with baby wash. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Great product at reasonable price</li>
            <li> Why i didn&#x27;t find this brand earlier????????? Amazing! So cheap that so good quality!!!! I bought a lot. Definitely better than sigma!</li>
            <li> I got the Travel Essentials Set because I wanted the travel case to store all my RT brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves in this kit are good:&lt;br /&gt;- the foundation brush isn&#x27;t any more amazing than my Lancome foundation brush or my Sigma foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;- the eyeshadow brush I use all the time to blend my eye shadow colors, the brush is soft and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;- the multipurpose brush is good if you need to use it for powder or brush or bronzer, but is a tad too stiff for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  Soft, but not too soft.  (Does that make sense?)  There was absolutely no shedding.  I&#x27;ve been using Ecotools brushes (which I love as well) for a long time and these will definitely be replacing them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just great!  I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often but these brushes make the job so easy when I do.  I also received the shipment very quickly.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This brand of brushes are to much for words,I love the whole set but my favorite is the contour brush. Its perfect in everyway imaginable! These brushes are fluffy, soft and durable. And can stand up to any Mac, or high end brand. I highly recommend these brushes! !</li>
            <li> Love these damn brushes...even after my two year old painted with water colors with them..I cleaned them in a little vinegar water and they came clean. They bristles have yet to loosen or break. They make my make up look amazing.</li>
            <li> love these brushes all three.. the brus on the left i like to use when i apply my concealer under my eyes im able to get in those areas you cant with the big brushes. i also sometimes use it to apply my liquid foundation. the middle brush i like to use for my highlight and the big fluffy brush for my powder or blush. love how it comes in the little travel kit set. fits perfect everywhere i go.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, nice brand, fare price, excelent material. A good deal who wants a good price and also a good material</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed by these brushes. It&#x27;s affordable it does it&#x27;s justice as brushes without emptying a hole in your wallet. It has extremely soft bristles unlike MAC they use animal fur which you pay so much for and feels like steel wool on your face. I&#x27;m in love with them I want to get every brushes they make.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Brushes are really soft and no shedding. I use the foundation brush for my concealer cause i use the stippling brush for my BB cream.</li>
            <li> Best beginnner basic set for make up base(foundation, powder and concieler)&lt;br /&gt;Quality, super soft hair, and after 3 or more washes the shape is still the same as when I bought them , must have !!</li>
            <li> I love every one of these brushes and I have almost all of them! They clean up great and are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I own almost all of the Real Techniques brushes at this point, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with almost every single one. These brushes and their companions are perfect for someone who wants something better than ELF or drugstore brushes, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on high end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the big, fluffy (pink) brush are nice and plush, but incredibly soft and smooth, I think the big brush in this collection is actually a better size and shape for applying blush and bronzer than the actual RT blush brush is, but that may just be a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The domed eyeshadow brush is excellent for blending shadow out, works very well as a crease brush as well. I personally don&#x27;t find it ideal for packing shadow onto the lid, but once the shadow is there it&#x27;s great for blending. The bristles are, of course, very plush and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the foundation brush in this set more than the actual foundation brush that you can buy separately only because it&#x27;s a little smaller, so I feel like it gets in the areas around my nose and under my eyes a little more easily. Again, the bristles are very smooth, and don&#x27;t leave streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say this is an excellent set for the price, and a great all around set to get you started toward a great face.</li>
            <li> love the brushes, great quality, no shedding or bleeding of dye. eye shadow brush is great for concealer like sam and nic say in their vids and the multiuse brush is truly that, god for liquid and powder... so handy. the foundation brush is useful but not for foundation it&#x27;s more of a highlighter brush for me. also, these are full sized brushes which I like, but if you were looking for something compact and smaller, these are not it, but still great and I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of pixiwoo on youtube and have watched most of their tutorials. I was excited to try these brushes. For the cost, they are fairly good... but not great. Biggest warning I can give future owners of these brushes is to never subject them to extreme heat. I made this mistake (I left them in my car one day in the heat of summer) and the material covering the handle melted and has been flaking off ever since. I know I shouldn&#x27;t have left them in that heat but I think a brush should be sturdy enough to withstand a bit of harsh weather. All in all, for the price, they&#x27;re good brushes.</li>
            <li> I honestly only bought this set for the blush brush. I&#x27;d read that the individually packaged Real Techniques Blush Brush was too big, and I find that this one is just right. The eyeshadow brush is good for applying eyeshadow all over the lid. The foundation brush was a little useless to me..It didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular with my foundation or concealer so I just ended up giving it away. It&#x27;s good to have as a back up in your makeup back though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the bomb. Being a professional mua, I am always searching for good quality brushes that are reasonably priced. And these brushes are it. Perfect for blending out shadows and giving that airbrush look to foundation.</li>
            <li> The brushes are high in quality but not the brush holders. I mostly use the powder brush and the concealer brush</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about these but got them for my sister for Christmas because she told me they were great brushes. Once I received them, you can really tell how great of a quality they are just by looking at them! I know she&#x27;ll be psyched to see them when she opens them on Christmas day:)</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a few other real Techniques brushes since i&#x27;ve heard and read so much about them so I thought i&#x27;d give them a try and so far I have only used one brush i&#x27;ve only had them for a few days so I might use them more later on but so far they&#x27;re a good buy, by the way watch the tutorials online so that you use the brushes properly :)</li>
            <li> Not in love with them at all</li>
            <li> I have these brushes in several collections and I am amazed at how well they work for make up application.  They really give a great HD look for foundation, powder, blush, and eyeshadow.  I don&#x27;t think you can get a better brush collection for the price - or even three times the price.</li>
            <li> Loved it. What I&#x27;ve been looking for at a great price. Thanks for a great product. Will return for more.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for great price. These 3 brushes was the only ones that i missed from my collection. My favourite from them is the crease brush. I never had a proper brush for my eyes before. Im pretty satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> My wife loves em so I love em to I guess. Good product.</li>
            <li> Again another great brush set by Real Techniques!! Set has foundation brush, domed shadow brush and the multi task brush, all are great but honestly I don&#x27;t use a foundation brush but have found some different uses for it. Overall GREAT brushes and GREAT quality...anyone whose in the market for great brushes, these brushes are a must have staple for your brush collection!!!</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this set is the variety of brushes it contains - other sets contain 5 foundation brushes or 5 eye brushes but as a beginner I had no idea how to use them all. This set is excellent as a starter kit, or something to travel with. I find them easy to use and they provide a good finish.</li>
            <li> Samantha Chapman is a makeup genus. She has made and entire brush collection that is affordable, well made, great colors, and soft bristles.  These are multi functional brushes and can be used on any facial feature and with any type of make up!  I can not get enough of these brushes.</li>
            <li> I ain&#x27;t about that life of buying a brush for over $20 so I bought these after watching the girls on YouTube swearing by them. No regrets. I love these brushes so much. My makeup looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this set.  Best one to get for starting off....and I honestly think that the smaller brush (purple) is the best concealer brush ever....actually went and bought two more of them.  Good start off kit, for someone that does not want to spend too much.  Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> The Real Techniques line of brushes is a real find! What a great deal! They&#x27;re so much less expensive than some of the \\&quot;famous\\&quot; brands, but much better quality than what you can get at the drugstore. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d qualify this as \\&quot;travel essentials\\&quot; set, but admittedly, the brushes get the job done. The foundation brush is too small for my taste, but it&#x27;s a high-quality brush that can be used for lots of other tasks (eye shadow blending, concealer blending, contouring, etc.). I love the powder brush and use it every day, and the large eye shadow brush is really nice too. The only thing I don&#x27;t use at all is the travel \\&quot;case.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a nice idea, but I don&#x27;t need it. It works as advertised though, and you can stand brushes up in it. I have bought many of the RT brushes, I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> great brushes!! Received them well and on time!</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful; soft, versatile, nice to hold and look at. The carrying case is an added bonus. Good buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and works really well! i love all the brushes of the line and it&#x27;s really cheap to. everywhone should have these brushes in their collection!</li>
            <li> I love love love the multitasker. Great for powders. And I use the eye one every day for all over color. I dont like that tipe of foundation brush, so I havent used it, but pleasently surprised with the quality of the line. The case is just ok. Overall, great value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are made to last. The only ones my picky teenage daughter will use</li>
            <li> Sam from pixiwoo brushes are great they have not shed and wash very well..  I have bought most of her collection wish some of them you could buy separately.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes already after getting them in yesterday. The shipping was great...right on time! The quality of these brushes really impresses me, they work really well for makeup. I think they will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is my fav but they are all great. Have had one maybe 3 hairs shed and I&#x27;ve had them for maybe 10 months</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Real Techniques makeup brushes! I own them all except for the limited edition duo fiber brush set, fine liner, and kabuki brush. They are soft, easy to handle, easy to use. Great starting out brushes, price is great compared to a MAC brush. I highly recommend this brand. I plan on getting a few &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; brushes on a select few.</li>
            <li> YOu should definitely get  the entire collection , you will love it. THe brushes are very soft andf does not harm the skin .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a newbie jumping back into wearing make up and these brushes have been great. They are very soft on my face and are great for applying blush, bronzer and eyeshadow. Not to mention they are a great price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a severe allergy to most makeups &amp; brushes.  We were told to try these &amp; we both are amazed at how much better her skin is.  These brushes are finer silk &amp; therefore don&#x27;t clog up with tons of makeup &amp; facial oils.  Even though she could go longer between cleanings, she chooses to clean them more often than recommended without any degradation to the brushes.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> very good product, exactly what I ordered, fast shipping, loved my purchase.</li>
            <li> i LOVE these brushes. seriously feels like i am putting my make up on with a chinchilla. so soft. its amazing.</li>
            <li> These are THE best brushes I have ever owned! Am planning on purchasing the entire line.&lt;br /&gt;And, they&#x27;re cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Love how soft these brushes are and how smooth my make up looks.</li>
            <li> However if the amount of hairs per brush were increased it would be so much better. Great as stated tools though. Good for traveling as the case comes with additional slots for extra brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the brushes I own.  Too short for my longest brush. Boooo</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality inexpensive brushes, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes, specially the one for eye shadow. Item was arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s cheap but the quality of the brush is good, although some of the bristles started to fall at first wash.</li>
            <li> For the price, these aren&#x27;t that bad, but I would never compare them to mac or sigma brushes. However, I have kids that like to get into my makeup bag and ruined my last set of brushes. These are fine until my kids are a little older and I can splurge again. I specifically do not like the purple eye shadow brush. Just does not lay color well. I use the pink brush as a blush brush.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has ever used Real Techniques brushes know that this brand is simply incredible! The quality of what you get, and the great price of the brushes makes it a staple in anyone&#x27;s makeup bag and a repeat purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have every brush in the RT collection and finally decided to get the Travel Essentials set to add to my RT collection. Of course, I knew these brushes would be no different from my other beloved RT brushes. They are all so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft, making it great for my sensitive skin. The bristles hold powder/cream/liquids like a dream! The application is smooth and the brush just seems to glide across your skin setting makeup in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite brush in this pack is the Multi-use brush (the fluffy pink one). It&#x27;s great for applying my powders all over my face to set my foundations. I can also use the same brush to apply my blushes, powders or creams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation brush in this set is bigger than the foundation brush in the Core set, making this one more likely to use. The smaller one I only use for concealer. The bigger bristle head on this brush does make applying cream or liquid foundations a little easier than the Core set Foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy that they have put an eye brush in this set too. It truly is a travel set. You get your foundation brush, your multi-tasker, and an eye brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do a complete look from home or on the road for travel with this one kit. The packaging is cute, and you still get that great brush holder to carry your brushes with you wherever you go. This ensures your brushes stay in place and don&#x27;t get messed up like they would in your cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RT has done it again and made my loyalty to their brand even greater!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a first time purchaser of Real Techniques, I would highly recommend this Travel set AND the Core set and I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Both sets are great and you&#x27;ll get a great idea of how RT brushes work. You&#x27;ll be so pleased and want to start collecting them all.idea of how RT brushes work. You&#x27;ll be so pleased and want to start collecting them all.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks! You can even buff it into the skin leaving a flawless finish and covers pores well</li>
            <li> Very happy, These Brushes work really good. nice and smooth. Blush goes on great and eye shadow also, haven use the foundation brush. Great Buy!</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is very decent, will use that, the eye one did not convince me (too dense, should be fluffier) and the multi task one it&#x27;s quite ok, good for powder + bronzer+ blusher, so I will be using that as well :)</li>
            <li> Nice and soft, easy to clean with baby shampoo!  Love the fact that they are synthetic so they don&#x27;t absorb the makeup - saves money on your precious cosmetics, and they keep stale makeup from being re-applied to your skin.  Price is great, too!</li>
            <li> These are better than all I&#x27;ve tried, which are mac, sigma, elf, ecotools and more. I have a lot of these, and they are the easiest to work with.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and seem to be well made. They come with a practical case.  I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estas brochas son muy suaves y parecen de buena calidad. Vienen con un estuche muy pr&amp;aacute;ctico. Las recomiendo.</li>
            <li> I love the multi-task brush. I use it as blush brush, it works very well with mineral powder. The minus one start is for the foundation brush, well, it is just me, not a big fan of flat foundation brush, i use it to apply my Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion and use the buffing brush from another set as foundation brush instead.</li>
            <li> This brush set is inexpensive but high quality. The stand is very handy for quick makeup application in the mornings, particularly away from home. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the makeup applicator brush. The other brushes are just fine, I wish they were softer but they apply powder very well.</li>
            <li> The travel set deserves four stars because for its price....it does a marvelous job. the Pixiwoo sisters have done it again with their travel set  that makes putting on makeup easy and natural. I seriously would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive the brushes in the set I bought are fake. I purchased a few brushes from &#x27;Paris Presents Incorporated&#x27; and they are all poorly made. The bristles are unevenly cut and the writing is off center. A few of them even had some mysterious liquid on the bristles causing them to be clumped when I received them...which I thought would resolve when washed a few times (maybe it was a protective coating?) but no, the bristles feel greasy, are hard to clean and do not go back into the shape they should be. Pretty upset.</li>
            <li> Purchase these when they first came out, then re-purchased later. The newer ones do not feel as soft as the first ones I purchased.</li>
            <li> vegan, easier to clean than animal hair brushes, fantastic fibre distribution, i wont be wasting my money on expensive mac brushes any more i&#x27;m buying all of these</li>
            <li> These were for my daughter, and the only thing she said was: Give it 4 stars because they are not as soft as I expected</li>
            <li> Lovely little travel set.  Brushes are sturdy, and the fibers are soft.  Too bad my daughter decided to clean my bathroom and now the travel pouch is missing!  :(</li>
            <li> thank you&lt;br /&gt;i got it at time and in perfict way&lt;br /&gt;i got mare of it as gift and evry body is happy by it</li>
            <li> love these brushes...really soft!</li>
            <li> LOVE REAL TECHNIQUES. Favorite brushes of all time. Outstanding quality, awesome value, they wash beautifully and give fantastic results effortlessly! I Personally use the Multi task brush for mineral powder foundation, the essential for liquid foundation and the domed shadow for cream and liquid highlight but all of these brushes have many other uses!</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift for my wife. She was absolutely thrilled to receive them.&lt;br /&gt;She has been using them every day since she received them.&lt;br /&gt;She has had absolutely nothing bad to say, in fact she is requesting several of their other products.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes, at a reasonable price, brush hairs are very soft i just wish the multi task brush was larger and fluffier lol but thats just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on these brushes before I bought them and everyone was crazy about them so I though I&#x27;d try them out and they were all right. I just used them for the first time today and LOVED them!!! Glad I purchased them!☺</li>
            <li> This set is actually quite nice for the price you pay for it.  I&#x27;m perfectly happy with it, and am also perfectly happy to not spend hundreds of dollars on make-up applicators.</li>
            <li> the brushes arrived in good conditions. love the soft brushes. the casing is useful too. highly recommend it to girls who wants to achieve flawless base makeup.</li>
            <li> If you could only live on 3 brushes, these are the 3 you should get. WORTH every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush is brilliant, was considering to get a M.A.C 190, but don&#x27;t seem necessary anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Domed shadow brush is my saviour, for I use it to blend my Bobbi Brown corrector &amp; concealer. It blends my concealer LIKE SKIN OMG I cannot describe how much I adore this brush! (and if you follow the pixiwoo sisters, they&#x27;re coming out with a travel size version, *squeaks*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the multi-task brush, it&#x27;s SOFT WOW! For a synthetic brush, it&#x27;s obscenely soft (haha). Picks up blush like a dream!</li>
            <li> very nice i like it !</li>
            <li> I was looking for a set of brushes that was good quality, easy to use and beginner friendly. I came across this set and decided it was a good price. I don&#x27;t regret it. They are very smooth and help me with the final touches because they make the makeup spread out smoothly and evenly. They pick up good amount of product and deposit it nicely on the skin. I use the pink one for blush and it does its job to deposit the color and smoothing it out. I use the purple one for eye shadow, specially if I only have time to deposit one color on my eye lid, and same thing here, it picks up a lot of product and spreads it out evenly. And finally I use the yellow one for powder foundation even though you can use it with any kind of foundation (liquid, cream, compact and loose powder). Easy to use, clean and maintain , the hairs don&#x27;t fall out when I use them or when I clean them. Very nice for the price. I recommended for all, beginners to expert, you will be surprised what you get for your money. Only thing I don&#x27;t use is the case, but if you travel this might be a plus for you, as stated in the title.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes worked great!! The only thing is that the blush brush had so much stuff on it it wouldn&#x27;t apply that much more.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality and a good variety.  Just wish the case was zippered to better protect the brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes. So soft! However they may be too soft because they dont pick up much of my blush ( physicians formula brand). And they are a little on the small side. But i will never use another brand....after i bought these i was hooked and purchased the blush brush and powder brush.</li>
            <li> I Use them for my daughters dance recital makeup and it works great. The brushes are very soft on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was in the market to replace most of my makeup brushes, and in the 15 years since I bought my set of MAC brushes, their prices have seriously gone up (out of my price range).  Therefore, I did my research on the best (affordable) makeup brushes, and Real Techniques was consistently rated number one.  Some of the important things for me were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Excellent Quality: brushes that had substance, and don&#x27;t feel flimsy or lightweight when I hold them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). No Shedding:  I can&#x27;t stand brushes that shed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Variety:  I don&#x27;t need a 35 brush set, when I use 12-15 specific brushes. I ONLY wanted great brushes that I need, and I&lt;br /&gt;  can see how easy it would be to get seduced by the huge brush sets for just $17.99....DON&#x27;T do it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4). Realistic Price:  I can&#x27;t pay $45 for one brush.  But I don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for really good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got everything I wanted with this set, the Real Techniques Core Set, and the Stippling Brush.  I&#x27;ll be back FOR SURE to buy the set for eyes, and that will complete my set. I am thrilled with these brushes, I use them daily, I take good care of them (washed them with Brush Shampoo before first use, and I lightly spray them with brush cleaner and wipe them down after each use), the cases are excellent quality, I can even fit my Stippling Brush in with this set, and I have not experienced any shedding after several days of daily use.  I absolutely recommend these brushes, and this brand.  On their official website, there are even tutorials on how to achieve certain looks, and how to use each brush, very helpful to me since I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use a Stippling Brush but I&#x27;m so glad I bought one, it saves a ton of money in foundation because you use 1/4 the amount used with a flat foundation brush.  GET THESE WHILE YOU CAN, AMAZING DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes based on another review and am happy that I did.  These are the three brushes that I use in any makeup set so I was happy to not get more than I need.  The brushes are soft and appear to be of good quality.  My only complaint is the case, it is too bulky for me to want to travel with, but I will just use my old case.</li>
            <li> Each brush in this set if soft and very good quality. The stand-up case was kind of cheesy so I threw it out. Overall this is a brilliant buy for some really nice makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Cheap but excellent quality. They last forever if taken care of!</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly so that&#x27;s always a plus. I love these brushes! Use them daily, I have cleaned them several times and they have yet to a shed. The case that&#x27;s included is also very well made, I was expecting a cheaper made case with them but it&#x27;s very well made. Will defiantly be ordering more real Techniques brushes!</li>
            <li> Face brushes have replaced by MAC and Sigma brushes. They are soft and sturdier than sigma brushes. Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy</li>
            <li> I love the brushes so soft</li>
            <li> I believe these are the &amp;#34;real Technique&amp;#34; brushes... I question if they are as soft as others I have owned, none-the-less they are good enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I love real techniques! Yes these are full size bc ik I was wondering since it says travel, but I use the pink one for my foundation and love it I actually use the gold for contouring (when I do lol) and the purple eyeshadow one for my illuminzing powder....the eyeshadow brush is too big and puffy and the bristles aren&#x27;t very compact for eyeshadow but it works just fine if u need something for a smaller face brush. Also I love the real techniques blush brush I plan to get more for all my other powders it&#x27;s just dense enough has longer bristles the are longer in the middle so that u can use the side of the brush as if it were the top of other regualr powder brushes and it&#x27;s so soft so get that one for sure too!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes at a very affordable price. Would repurchase!!</li>
            <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;Brushes soft and beautiful does not work when you use lines or hair loss with facial advise everyone bought</li>
            <li> This brushes are different from what is on the pictures. They are way bigger. Even the eyeshadow brush I cannot use because it is too big for my eye lid. I&#x27;m using it for other things such as blending concealer so that&#x27;s a good use.</li>
            <li> Wish you could buy the brushes separately, only bought for the multi task brush.  Never using another brush for foundation again.  Love the multitask brush</li>
            <li> just perfect, happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I had hear sl many good things about this item...and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out...they are all great brushs only brush I don&#x27;t like is the foundation brush leaves streaks on face</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I even like the labels on the brushes, letting you know what each brush is and what you do with it. The bristles are soft, easy to clean and durable. The price is right for this brush set.</li>
            <li> Essential Foundation Brush - Meh. Out of the entire range of RT brushes, I haven&#x27;t used this one very often because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s big enough to apply foundation to my entire face. I usually reach for my Boots no. 7 or Mary Kay foundation brush. If you like your foundation brushes on the smaller side, you might like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi Task Brush – YES. This brush is my most used out of all my RT brushes. I use it to apply powder foundation, blush, bronzer, highlighter, contour... just a GREAT brush overall, extremely versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Domed Shadow Brush – Great for blending eyeshadow. It&#x27;s on the bigger side of eyeshadow brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panoramic 2-in-1 brush case/stand – Meh, I tossed this because I found it a pain to use. I didn&#x27;t like that it was always open and that my brushes weren&#x27;t sealed off from the outside environment when the case was closed. I would prefer if they came in a case like the Sigma brushes, or if they included a cute little bag to keep them in, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t like having to put each brush back into a specific place, and I feel like this gets dirty and isn&#x27;t easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could do my entire face with these three brushes. I would say that this is my favorite set of brushes out of all the RT brush sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the full set of these brushes since they first launched in 2012. Since getting them, I&#x27;ve used at least three of them every single day. That&#x27;s two years of constant use, and they look and preform the same way they did the day I received them. Since getting the full line of these, I have not purchased a single new brush. My old mac brushes lay untouched in the back of my drawer. Not to mention that just one Mac brush costs as much as the whole set of these ones. Did I mention that you can now buy these at Walmart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are superior to animal hair brushes in every way. They are cruelty free. They are extremely easy to clean-- I timed myself, and I can wash twenty brushes in seven minutes. They do not get stained. I purposely didn&#x27;t clean red OCC Lip Tar off of my lip brush for a month, and the lip tar came off as easily as any other product. (I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Body Wash or just regular Equate hand soap to clean mine.) They  don&#x27;t hold any funky smells or bacteria after washing, since the bristles aren&#x27;t porous, unlike animal hair bristles. For the same reason, they dry off very fast. My RT face brush takes about 30 minutes to dry if I leave it damp on a washcloth, and I can dry it almost completely in a few seconds if I rub the brush against a sham. I&#x27;ve cleaned and dried my brushes right before using them to do my makeup regularly. My mac brushes take hours (sometimes days) to dry completely, even if I wipe them against a sham first. Another advantage of the non-porous bristles is that you don&#x27;t have to condition them. After washing animal hair brushes, you are supposed to condition them with an oil or conditioner so they stay soft and don&#x27;t get brittle. If you don&#x27;t, your brushes will start shedding. The RT brushes don&#x27;t need to be conditioned, and they don&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, they are soft. Softer than animal hair. They pick up product and dispense it with ease. Product doesn&#x27;t linger in the brush nearly as much it does on animal hair brushes, which lets me use less product. Truly a pleasure to use and apply makeup with. My one small gripe is that sometimes product can get stuck on the black grip part of these brushes, but that is hardly an issue since it cleans right off. They just might look a bit dirty after rolling around in your makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so durable and have held up better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever had before. As I said before, I&#x27;ve been using them for two years already and they look and feel the same way they did the day I got them. I&#x27;m sure that they will last for years to come. I would give these to a friend. I would repurchase. Affordable, durable, just a great product.These would be a great gift to anyone that wears makeup. I would recommend these over any other brush on the market. I feel that this is a truly superior product in every way.would be a great gift to anyone that wears makeup.

            <li> I read about these brushes on a blog ([...])? I&#x27;m not much of a makeup person, but these brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used! They are durable and easy to clean. I actually started wearing makeup more often after buying these. I loved the price too!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and they do the job!!!</li>
            <li> ولقد استخدمت هذه فرش كثيرا منذ حصلت عليها منهم وأنهم لم تسلط شعرة واحدة حتى الان. رؤساء فرشاة لم يكن لديك رائحة غريبة على عكس الشعر الطبيعي ي آخر فرش سيجما. وأعتقد أن هذا لديها ما تفعله مع تقنيات الحقيقي عن طريق الشعر الاصطناعية بدلا من ذلك. عموما، أود أن أوصى تماما هذه الفرش. انهم بأسعار معقولة ونوعية كبيرة! وخاصة الفرشاة ترقط والتلميع. أخطط لتوسيع مجموعتي. أيضا، إذا كنت تحصل على أي من مجموعات السفر، يمكنك استخدام حامل لتجفيف فرش الخاص بك. تأكد من أن الشعر الفرشاة نحو الانخفاض. عبقرية التصميم!</li>
            <li> i love all of these brushes, the pink brush is great for powder or blush, and the small purple brush is good for eyeshadow and blending in concealer, they also wash really well and don&#x27;t shed, i have repurchased several sets to give to ppl i know</li>
            <li> the brush hair is not as smooth as i expected</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, have been using these for months now and work very well and are great quality</li>
            <li> Sadly, the synthetic bristles are not pleasant to use and they do not work well with my products. Also, the case is cheap looking and feeling. Would not but make-up brushes from Real Techniques again.</li>
            <li> Use these everyday, durable, washable, no fall out! I also use sigma, bedellium and mac brushes- just as great. I use the purple for blending and the large for powder/ setting.</li>
            <li> Bought these and love them, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t need or use then as badly or as much as I thought I would. The small one I love for spot coverage application, and the biggest one is great for powder and/or blush, but the foundation one doesn&#x27;t work like I would have hoped, and so I stopped using it. However, they are definitely very good quality and since I use 2 of the 3 brushes, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, bought the eye brush set as well...LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This was my first Real Techniques Brush purchase... and I am so glad I made this purchase ! I LOVE THESE BRUSHES ! Sooo super soft and my make-up goes on flawlessly. I don&#x27;t use the black case at all but it was still a nice addition. Love. ♥</li>
            <li> Ok so I am a big fan of Pixiwoo so I needed to try these brushes and I cannot say I am disappointed! Beautiful application, no shedding and great price - what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love theses brushes , performs just as well of high end brushes</li>
            <li> essential set ..i just love RT brushes...</li>
            <li> good travel set, all you need when you travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling light weight .. Works great and blend products on a perfect way .. Easy to Clean and drys quickly ..</li>
            <li> My favorite of all make-up brush brands</li>
            <li> Great product that shipped pretty quickly to Australia. The brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I was assuming they&#x27;d be like, however the product works just as well as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome and reasonably priced. Far better than the junk you can buy at Sephora at a price of $40 per brush. I use all three brushes regularly and after months of use they are still soft, holding their shape, and do not shed one single hair. Stop shoping around - get these brushes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
            <li> MY SISTER IN LAW LOVES HER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, use these everyday! Get a wonderful blend from the eyeshadow brush and they all wash very easily. Good value!</li>
            <li> Over the past few months, I have discovered the benefits of investing in quality makeup brushes.  I have been gradually adding to my collection and have found Real Techniques brushes to be very good and reasonably priced.  I started with the Starter Set, followed by the Angled Foundation Brush, the Blush Brush, and now the Travel Essentials Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set would actually make the perfect starter set for somone new to makeup and/or brushes.  The foundation brush works great.  It really blends well and I feel like it actually works faster than my Shany foundation brush of the same style (I use L&#x27;Oreal True Match Liquid Foundation).  The Multitask Brush can be used to apply blush, powder, etc.  For me, I find it better suited as a blush brush but it really can be used for anything.  I don&#x27;t usually wear mineral powder foundation but I had some laying around (L&#x27;Oreal) and I tried applying it with the Multitask Brush and it looks great.  This is the best I&#x27;ve been able to get it to look, so I may use it more in the future.  The Domed Shadow Brush is sized between the Base Shadow Brush and the Deluxe Crease Brush from the Starter Set.  It works well for applying shadow all over the lid, in the crease, and blending, which allows you to create a complete look with only one brush.  I also use it to apply concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are well made.  They all have a nice weight and feel good in my hands.  The hairs are soft and easy to clean.  I washed them immediately and a few times since with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo (the Calming Lavender is amazing!) and they held up with no shedding.  I also use brush cleaner after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t find fault with this set.  Its versatilitly really does make this a perfect starter set.  I feel like this should be renamed to the &amp;#34;Starter Set&amp;#34; or just the &amp;#34;Essential Set&amp;#34; because this set really does contain the essentials for every day use, not just for traveling.  I definitely recommend this set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.  You can achieve  a  complete look (foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, blush, and powder) with just these threee brushes.  I look forward to trying my next Real Techniques brush, the Expert Face Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that that Real Techniques has a YouTube channel where they post tutorials for all of their brushes plus lots of extra content.  They&#x27;re informative and fun to watch.s set for anyone new to makeup, anyone on a budget, or anyone who just wants to keep things simple.

            <li> The brushes are super soft and are great from everyday application to even professional use. It has the basics you need for a travel kit.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I love them. I use them everyday. Super soft and leave your make up so pretty. I seen nicole on youtube use them and thought i would try them... Ever since then love them</li>
            <li> I like how these brushes apply my make up. They blend it in nicely and I can easily blend in the colors. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
