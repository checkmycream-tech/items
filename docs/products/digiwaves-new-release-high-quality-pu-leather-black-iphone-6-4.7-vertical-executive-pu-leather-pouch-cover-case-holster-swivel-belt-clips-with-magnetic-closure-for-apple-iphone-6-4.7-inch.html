            <li>Great to carry your I Phone in and fill up pants pocket !</li>
            <li>I feel the DIGIWAVES will be the best holster for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our employees have the iPhone 6 with a Speck Candyshell Grip case, and this holster works and fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this appears to be an excellent case for our needs.</li>
            <li>Very good!  </li>
            <li>Great case that fits perfectly with a slim case</li>
            <li>Great case, great customer service!</li>

            <li>Great, durable case.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>very nice holster, and still fits iPhone 6 with case.</li>
            <li>Very nice leather.</li>
            <li>Very nice case that keeps my phone in place.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, and good quality for the cost.</li>
            <li>Both cases are very nice, and as there are no defects they both deserve good marks.</li>
            <li>Accurately described, and fits perfect with a slim case as noted.  </li>
            <li>All for good price.</li>
            <li>Works good with my iphone 6.</li>
            <li>Good holster--</li>
            <li>The quality seems good.</li>
            <li>The leather is of good quality.</li>
            <li>Looks good, fits good.</li>
            <li>Fit is perfect.</li>
            <li>The fit is perfect in this case.</li>
            <li>I like both of them, and most people should be happy with either one.  </li>
            <li>Leather has nice feel and is padded.</li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>My iPhone 6 (with a Case Impact thin-fit case) fits nicely in it.  </li>
            <li>Nicely made and worked well with my iPhone6 in its Apple leather case in indoor and office settings.  </li>
            <li>The case is now a nice holder for my coat pocket or briefcase</li>
            <li>I cut my own hole so I could plug in the power cable.</li>
            <li>It fits great on the iPhone with the Apple leather case, and the closure is a nice secure magnet, and the clip is well positioned and strong.</li>
            <li>good fit and case materiels for the price but plastic clip broke on both I had ordered.  </li>
            <li>the belt clip is very secure.</li>
            <li>Nice looking with a strong clip.</li>
            <li>Good quality and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li>It was ok but just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Lets see if that holds up better...</li>
            <li>The clip and retainer are plastic which is OK.</li>
            <li>I purchased several vertical holsters cases to try to find the perfect case for my iPhone 6 which has the Apple slim leather cover on it.</li>
            <li>you \\&quot;want\\&quot; to like better.    </li>
            <li>They agreed to replace it, but even better, they replaced it with a newer model that has a METAL hinge and belt clip, but does NOT swivel.  </li>
            <li>The magnetic flap closure seems to hold well, though we&#x27;ll know more once our employees test the case.  </li>
            <li>I have been stretching it for a couple weeks and hope maybe I will eventually be able to use it.</li>
            <li>Great fit for the IPhone 6, reasonable pricing</li>
            <li>However, with the Digiwaves case, the phones slide in and out a bit more easily.    </li>
            <li>Hopefully over time the elastic bands on the side will loosen so that the phone will slide in-and-out of the holster more easily.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied, filled my expectations.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice holster, but is very large, and my phone+case flops around inside the holster.  </li>
            <li>Fits snugly but easily removed.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with the easy one - the Turin II.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Worse though is the belt rotates TOO easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This one fits my phone which has the beautiful grovemade wooden case.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  The DIGIWAVES held the iPhone 6 with Poetic case securely, and the belt clip gripped my belt more securely.  </li>
            <li>The phones fit snugly inside the holster with the Speck case on, but can still be easily withdrawn.  </li>
            <li>Although the quality was fine it was supposed to fit an Iphone 6 with slim shell, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The clip with its lip holds securely on my belt.</li>
            <li>Fit:  </li>
            <li>I case to see a photo of the fit of thatone.    </li>
            <li>Looks and feels like genuine leather.  </li>
            <li>Of all the many cases I have purchased over the years, this is the first where the clip has separated.</li>
            <li>The DigiWaves case leaves the Mute switch accessible.  </li>
            <li>My original DIGIWAVES case broke at the plastic hinge.  </li>
            <li>This becomes a matter of preference really - which are you more comfortable with.    </li>
            <li>fit well in their own way, but the fit and finish are also distinctly different.    </li>
            <li>On top of the resistance in and out, the DigiWaves case also has a tiered face design, so there is much more of the phone to grasp when the flap is open making it easier to remove the phone.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a big accessory ecosystem for the iPhone 6, but the holster turned out to be the most challenging iPhone 6 accessory purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lacks the more positive ratcheting of the first one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most holsters either fit a bare phone or one with a multilayer cases.  </li>
            <li>I really like this case, but the clip breaks too easily for me.  </li>
            <li>The belt clip broke off within the first 24 hours that I owned it!  </li>
            <li>After more and more use it became apparent that I really like this case.</li>
            <li>hope is that the holster makers will recognize that many iPhone 6 users want to use a case and a holster, and that they make holsters that are designed to fit 4 different use cases:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>The BOMEA was too large for an iPhone 6 with Poetic case and the phone fell out of the case, whereas the DIGIWAVES held the iPhone 6 nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my phone with the Apple case, and my wife&#x27;s with the full slim TPU case slide in out without much resistance.</li>
            <li>The case rotates fairly easily on the clip but has never gone too far from vertical.</li>
            <li>Fits iPhone six in a slim case tight which is good so it can&#x27;t fall out or be stolen.</li>
            <li>high quality...iPhone 6 with thin protective case fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>The first one I received broke within the first week, then I was sent a replacement, and the replacement broke sometime around a month after that.</li>
            <li>Most of a year later:  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Both appear to be well made, but the Turin I just looks and feels higher in quality.</li>
            <li>The problem is that most holsters are made for use with a naked iPhone 6.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, but did not last long.  </li>
            <li>The BOMEA was far too large, and the belt clip does not grip the belt securely and can slip off as I had happen with the Luxmo.  </li>
            <li>The leather is of good quality and it fit my iPhone 6 with a thin skin on it.  </li>
            <li>The DIGIWAVES has a spring clip which hooks over my 1 1/2 inch belt and appears to be less apt to slip off.  </li>
            <li>How about a large metal clip like they use on gun holsters?</li>
            <li>It is softer and  the full leather sides and unique design flap closure (and it&#x27;s specific area of contact on the main case), present a more professional look.</li>
            <li>I more due to its unique and professional look, but I do like the initial fit and the ease of phone removal of the DigiWaves.</li>
            <li>In both cases, based on their designs, the top two corners of the phone itself are ever so slightly exposed - meaning if the phone were dropped just right</li>
            <li>So when I went to return it it was going to cost so much</li>
            <li>And because the iPhone 6 is very slippery (rounded edges, metal housing), I wanted to put a protective case on the phone as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a very well made leather case that fits the iPhone 6 with a protective skin on it very well.</li>
            <li>(that doesn&#x27;t protect the phone much), but not a thick &amp;#34;armor&amp;#34; case,</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>I also had experience with Luxmo High Quality Leather Vertical Pouch Protective Cell Phone Case for iPhone</li>
            <li>It looks great too, plain black leather (no logos) what I wanted in a cell phone pouch.</li>
            <li>* NEW RELEASE</li>
            <li>Contacted the company and it was replaced with a new case.</li>
            <li>The Turin I has a full height front face, which it needs to protect the phone, since it&#x27;s flap is not full width, but this doesn&#x27;t provide much area (just the tips on the side) to grasp the phone to remove it.</li>
            <li>4.7 inch Screen - Crystal Clear to use with it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this after I returned the Belt Clip Holster by BOMEA from AMNA DIRECT</li>
            <li>The DIGIWAVES belt clip is made of plastic but appears to very sturdy in initial use and appears to have a stronger connection to the pouch</li>
            <li>I contacted DIGIWAVES directly with the problem.  </li>
            <li>Nothing against the DigiWaves case, but it is a bit of a more standard design case, and its closure can look a bit off-skew, and the standard elastic sides (not full length) just don&#x27;t make it stand apart from a design/aesthetics standpoint.</li>
            <li>I bought a new iPhone 6, and purchased several accessories to go along with it (screen protector, car charger, additional Lightning cables, etc).  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the iPhone 6 Case, LUVVITT® ULTRA SLIM iPhone 6 Case / 0.6mm Transparent Clear Back Cover / iPhone Air Case /</li>
            <li>The leather is starting to show some signs of wear now, but nothing unreasonable or unexpected given the amount of use it has received.  </li>
            <li>This also completely covers the Mute switch on the side of the phone, so you have to open the flap and slide the phone out a bit in order to toggle the mute button.</li>
            <li>I really like this case a third of the cost but better quality than expensive ones.</li>
            <li>But... it is also only half the price as well, so that&#x27;s worth considering.    </li>
            <li>I was really careful with second phone case after my first one broke, but its only a matter of time before you snag it on something</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not perfect, but is probably the best holster solution out there today for an iPhone 6 with a thin or medium rubber</li>
            <li>I think my next case will be of real leather rather than imitation.</li>
            <li>The Turin I is a bit of a snugger fit - not too tight though, but with the way the side expansion is made, it will just take a little time for it to loosen up a bit.</li>

            <li> The BOMEA was far too large, and the belt clip does not grip the belt securely and can slip off as I had happen with the Luxmo.  </li>
            <li> The leather is of good quality and it fit my iPhone 6 with a thin skin on it.  </li>
            <li> The DIGIWAVES has a spring clip which hooks over my 1 1/2 inch belt and appears to be less apt to slip off.  </li>
            <li> How about a large metal clip like they use on gun holsters?</li>
            <li> It is softer and  the full leather sides and unique design flap closure (and it&#x27;s specific area of contact on the main case), present a more professional look.</li>
            <li> I more due to its unique and professional look, but I do like the initial fit and the ease of phone removal of the DigiWaves.</li>
            <li> In both cases, based on their designs, the top two corners of the phone itself are ever so slightly exposed - meaning if the phone were dropped just right</li>
            <li> So when I went to return it it was going to cost so much</li>
            <li> And because the iPhone 6 is very slippery (rounded edges, metal housing), I wanted to put a protective case on the phone as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a very well made leather case that fits the iPhone 6 with a protective skin on it very well.</li>
            <li> (that doesn&#x27;t protect the phone much), but not a thick &amp;#34;armor&amp;#34; case,</li>

            <li> I contacted DIGIWAVES directly with the problem.  </li>
            <li> Nothing against the DigiWaves case, but it is a bit of a more standard design case, and its closure can look a bit off-skew, and the standard elastic sides (not full length) just don&#x27;t make it stand apart from a design/aesthetics standpoint.</li>

            <li> very nice holster, and still fits iPhone 6 with case. All for good price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy belt clip hat rotates. Leather has nice feel and is padded. I like that it is large enough to allow for hard case around iPhone 6. Price and delivery time excellent.</li>
            <li> The belt clip broke off within the first 24 hours that I owned it!  It is junk.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but it wouldn&#x27;t stay closed over my iphone 6. Not a plus iphone just the regular iphone 6. So when I went to return it it was going to cost so much I just kept it and will give to someone with a smaller phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea though</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Works great for my iPhone 6 in an Otter commuter case.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, filled my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works good with my iphone 6.</li>
            <li> Great case that fits perfectly with a slim case</li>
            <li> The quality of craftsmanship and look are what I expected but the holder is just a little short and the flap does not like to stay locked</li>
            <li> Very nice, and good quality for the cost.</li>
            <li> Good holster--BUT can not use a case on my I-Phone 6 and still get it out of the holster</li>
            <li> There is really to big for iPhone 6.</li>
            <li> It was ok but just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I really like this case, but the clip breaks too easily for me.  The first one I received broke within the first week, then I was sent a replacement, and the replacement broke sometime around a month after that.</li>
            <li> The leather is of good quality and it fit my iPhone 6 with a thin skin on it.  Unfortunately, the clip is made out of plastic and if you accidentally brush against something the clip will break.  I have bought 2 of these cases. I was really careful with second phone case after my first one broke, but its only a matter of time before you snag it on something and it breaks.  This is a really poor design.  Don&#x27;t buy this case until the company upgrades to a metal clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the &amp;#34;Turtleback Vertical iPhone 6 (4.7) Leather Holster Case Pouch with Heavy Duty Belt Clip&amp;#34;.  Lets see if that holds up better...</li>
            <li> Fits well but don&#x27;t depend on the magnets to help.  I attached a velcro strip.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this holster for 3 months now and am very happy with it. My iPhone 6 (with a Case Impact thin-fit case) fits nicely in it.  The clip with its lip holds securely on my belt. The case rotates fairly easily on the clip but has never gone too far from vertical. Given that plus the magnetic closure, I see no danger of the phone falling out.  The quality seems good. The leather is starting to show some signs of wear now, but nothing unreasonable or unexpected given the amount of use it has received.  Most of a year later:  The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; outer layer did wear through where the magnets hold the case closed and it began to look a bit ratty. I think my next case will be of real leather rather than imitation. In the end, the clip broke when I was lifting a bicycle and it caught on the case clipped to my hip.</li>
            <li> Fits iPhone six in a slim case tight which is good so it can&#x27;t fall out or be stolen. Working great.</li>
            <li> I really like this case a third of the cost but better quality than expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and worked well with my iPhone6 in its Apple leather case in indoor and office settings.  However, the clip broke after about 3 weeks while I had it on my belt while doing yard work, so I tossed it in the garbage.  Will look for a ballistic nylon case with Velcro fastener as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Most holsters either fit a bare phone or one with a multilayer cases.  This one fits my phone which has the beautiful grovemade wooden case.  Fits snugly but easily removed.  Solid quality.</li>
            <li> good fit and case materiels for the price but plastic clip broke on both I had ordered.  This is the weak link with all I have tried.</li>
            <li> Fits Iphone 6 perfectly. Nice looking with a strong clip. high quality</li>
            <li> This is one of the few vertical cases for the iphone 6. The leather is of good quality. But the clip is junk. It broke in 3 days. Luckily I was sitting down and the phone was trapped by my coat. The clip and retainer are plastic which is OK. The internal mechanism is also plastic and that just broke apart. Of all the many cases I have purchased over the years, this is the first where the clip has separated. The case is now a nice holder for my coat pocket or briefcase but I would not trust it to hold such an expensive phone. Imagine sitting on a train or taxi and finding out in just a short time that your lifeline is gone? How about a large metal clip like they use on gun holsters?</li>
            <li> Looks good, fits good. Seems to have quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we wanted. Good quality and not expensive at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased several vertical holsters cases to try to find the perfect case for my iPhone 6 which has the Apple slim leather cover on it. My wife&#x27;s iPhone 6 has a slim TPU case on it, so I tried the cases with that as well.    This review covers three cases:  1. monsoon TURIN I Vertical Leather Case Holster with Rotating Belt Clip for iPhone 6 (4.7\\&quot;) - [Fits iPhone 6 by itself]  2. monsoon TURIN II Vertical Leather Case Holster with Rotating Belt Clip for iPhone 6 (4.7\\&quot;) - [Fits iPhone 6 with a case]  3. DIGIWAVES ** NEW RELEASE ** High Quality PU Leather (Black) iPhone 6 4.7\\&quot; Vertical Executive PU Leather Pouch Cover Case Holster Swivel Belt Clips With Magnetic Closure For Apple iPhone 6 4.7\\&quot; inch    Let&#x27;s start with the easy one - the Turin II.  It&#x27;s just too big. The iPhone is a bit loose in it, but the biggest issue is tha the phone sits down so low in it, it&#x27;s difficult to have any of the phone to grasp to pull it out.  So, unless you have a larger bulkier case on your phone, this one just is too big.    That leaves us with the Turrin I and the DigiWaves case. I&#x27;ll say upfront that I&#x27;m torn between the two - both fit well in their own way, but the fit and finish are also distinctly different.    Quality:  Both appear to be well made, but the Turin I just looks and feels higher in quality. It is softer and  the full leather sides and unique design flap closure (and it&#x27;s specific area of contact on the main case), present a more professional look. It&#x27;s the case you \\&quot;want\\&quot; to like better.    Nothing against the DigiWaves case, but it is a bit of a more standard design case, and its closure can look a bit off-skew, and the standard elastic sides (not full length) just don&#x27;t make it stand apart from a design/aesthetics standpoint. But... it is also only half the price as well, so that&#x27;s worth considering.    Fit:  This is the tough part.  The Turin I is a bit of a snugger fit - not too tight though, but with the way the side expansion is made, it will just take a little time for it to loosen up a bit. Both my phone with the Apple case, and my wife&#x27;s with the full slim TPU case slide in out without much resistance. However, with the Digiwaves case, the phones slide in and out a bit more easily.    On top of the resistance in and out, the DigiWaves case also has a tiered face design, so there is much more of the phone to grasp when the flap is open making it easier to remove the phone.  The Turin I has a full height front face, which it needs to protect the phone, since it&#x27;s flap is not full width, but this doesn&#x27;t provide much area (just the tips on the side) to grasp the phone to remove it. This also completely covers the Mute switch on the side of the phone, so you have to open the flap and slide the phone out a bit in order to toggle the mute button. The DigiWaves case leaves the Mute switch accessible.  This becomes a matter of preference really - which are you more comfortable with.    In both cases, based on their designs, the top two corners of the phone itself are ever so slightly exposed - meaning if the phone were dropped just right it would be possible that the phone would contact the floor on the corner of its slim case, and not the leather holster.  The design is different on each case, but the risk to these corners is just about the same - not much of a risk, but it is there just a bit.    In the end, I&#x27;m undecided on these two cases.  I like both of them, and most people should be happy with either one.  I \\&quot;want\\&quot; to like the Turin I more due to its unique and professional look, but I do like the initial fit and the ease of phone removal of the DigiWaves. Plus the DigiWaves is half the price of the Turin I. Both cases are very nice, and as there are no defects they both deserve good marks. However I can&#x27;t give 5 stars because they both leave something on the table.    PS - I&#x27;ve attached photos here of the DigiWaves case.  Check my review (this same one) posted on the Turin I case to see a photo of the fit of thatone.    PS#2 - In the end, I returned the Monsoon cases and kept this DigiWaves case. After more and more use it became apparent that I really like this case. It fits great on the iPhone with the Apple leather case, and the closure is a nice secure magnet, and the clip is well positioned and strong. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great case, great customer service! Would recommend both the case and Digiwaves! Five stars!!!!</li>
            <li> Fits the iPhone 6 perfectly. Looks and feels like genuine leather.  the belt clip is very secure.</li>
            <li> Very nice leather. Holds close to body.  Fit is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great, durable case. Fits the iPhone 6 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great to carry your I Phone in and fill up pants pocket !</li>
            <li> Great fit for the IPhone 6, reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I returned the Belt Clip Holster by BOMEA from AMNA DIRECT so I can compare the two.iPhone 6 holsters.  I also had experience with Luxmo High Quality Leather Vertical Pouch Protective Cell Phone Case for iPhone 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size:  The BOMEA was too large for an iPhone 6 with Poetic case and the phone fell out of the case, whereas the DIGIWAVES held the iPhone 6 nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belt Clip:  The BOMEA and the Luxmo have slip type belt clips which can and have slipped off my belt and the phone fell to the floor.  The DIGIWAVES has a spring clip which hooks over my 1 1/2 inch belt and appears to be less apt to slip off.  The Luxmo (which is very similar to the BOMEA) belt clip pulled out of the case after 9 months of use.  The DIGIWAVES belt clip is made of plastic but appears to very sturdy in initial use and appears to have a stronger connection to the pouch case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swivel:  The BOMEA I received did not swivel at all so when it is forced to move the slip type belt clip tends to move up on the belt and can and did fall off.  I returned this unit.  The DIGIWAVES swivels and has click stops at approximately 30 degree angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  The DIGIWAVES held the iPhone 6 with Poetic case securely, and the belt clip gripped my belt more securely.  The BOMEA was far too large, and the belt clip does not grip the belt securely and can slip off as I had happen with the Luxmo.  The BOMEA swivel did not rotate at all.  I feel the DIGIWAVES will be the best holster for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Up:  My original DIGIWAVES case broke at the plastic hinge.  Since it was over the warranty period, I had to pay for the replacement.  It too broke at the plastic hinge.  I contacted DIGIWAVES directly with the problem.  They agreed to replace it, but even better, they replaced it with a newer model that has a METAL hinge and belt clip, but does NOT swivel.  It has the same design belt clip that hooks over the belt making it almost impossible to slip off of the belt like some inferior models.lip off of the belt like some inferior models.</li>
            <li> Very nice case that keeps my phone in place.  After only one week the plastic clip broke.. Contacted the company and it was replaced with a new case.</li>
            <li> This was ordered to replace an earlier one when it&#x27;s plastic belt clip broke. For some reason the second one was of lesser quality. There was excess material on the flap which I trimmed off.&lt;br /&gt;Worse though is the belt rotates TOO easily. It lacks the more positive ratcheting of the first one.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself constantly re-rotating it on my belt.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it does the job.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quality vertical  case for your iPhone 6, this is the one you should get.  I also purchased the iPhone 6 Case, LUVVITT® ULTRA SLIM iPhone 6 Case / 0.6mm Transparent Clear Back Cover / iPhone Air Case / 4.7 inch Screen - Crystal Clear to use with it.  The fit is perfect in this case. The Swivel Belt Clip has click setting so you can adjust the angle to your liking. I have had this product since January of this year and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I even bought a backup in June but I don&#x27;t expect to need it for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> We just received our initial order for this phone holster today.  Our employees have the iPhone 6 with a Speck Candyshell Grip case, and this holster works and fits perfectly.  The phones fit snugly inside the holster with the Speck case on, but can still be easily withdrawn.  The belt clip appears to be very sturdy, and the swivel clicks are at fairly small intervals.  The clip itself has the &amp;#34;j&amp;#34; at the bottom to ensure that it cannot be pushed off your belt unintentionally.  The magnetic flap closure seems to hold well, though we&#x27;ll know more once our employees test the case.  The only drawback is there is a slight chemical odor on the case, which is likely from the leather processing; hopefully this dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this appears to be an excellent case for our needs.</li>
            <li> high quality...iPhone 6 with thin protective case fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought a new iPhone 6, and purchased several accessories to go along with it (screen protector, car charger, additional Lightning cables, etc).  There&#x27;s a big accessory ecosystem for the iPhone 6, but the holster turned out to be the most challenging iPhone 6 accessory purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to carry my phone in a holster rather than putting it in my pocket.  And because the iPhone 6 is very slippery (rounded edges, metal housing), I wanted to put a protective case on the phone as well.  The problem is that most holsters are made for use with a naked iPhone 6.  It&#x27;s as though accessory makers don&#x27;t understand that someone would want both a case and a holster.  I purchased a medium size rubber case -- not a super thin one (that doesn&#x27;t protect the phone much), but not a thick &amp;#34;armor&amp;#34; case, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my holster, I initially purchased a Case123 Mk II TL Premium Vertical leather holster.  It&#x27;s a nice holster, but is very large, and my phone+case flops around inside the holster.  Unfortunately, this holster is obviously designed for use with an iPhone 6 with a thick armor case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I subsequently purchased this Digiwaves holster.  It&#x27;s a better option, but still not perfect.  My iPhone 6 with medium case fits a bit snugly into this Digiwaves holster, but it&#x27;s usable.  Hopefully over time the elastic bands on the side will loosen so that the phone will slide in-and-out of the holster more easily.  I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not perfect, but is probably the best holster solution out there today for an iPhone 6 with a thin or medium rubber case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that the holster makers will recognize that many iPhone 6 users want to use a case and a holster, and that they make holsters that are designed to fit 4 different use cases:&lt;br /&gt;1) Naked iPhone 6&lt;br /&gt;2) iPhone 6 with thin case&lt;br /&gt;3) iPhone 6 with medium case&lt;br /&gt;4) iPhone 6 with thick armor case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most holsters today are designed for #1 or #4.  There is agap in product offering for #2 or #3.  The Digiwaves holster comes closest to meeting that need, but it&#x27;s still a bit snug.</li>
            <li> Although the quality was fine it was supposed to fit an Iphone 6 with slim shell, it didn&#x27;t. It had to be forced in and was unusable as the phone would not come out with one hand. I have been stretching it for a couple weeks and hope maybe I will eventually be able to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made leather case that fits the iPhone 6 with a protective skin on it very well. It has a heavy duty spring loaded plastic clip on the back that swivels 360 degrees. The clip has a hook on the bottom to prevent it slipping off your belt. It would rate 5 stars if not for one glaring fault. The bottom of the case is solid. There are no openings for plugging in the power cable or earbuds. I cut my own hole so I could plug in the power cable.</li>
            <li> Very good!  Accurately described, and fits perfect with a slim case as noted.  I have it with a Diztronics matte black case.  It looks great too, plain black leather (no logos) what I wanted in a cell phone pouch.</li>
            <li> Very nice, but did not last long.  Clip broke after just a few weeks.</li>
