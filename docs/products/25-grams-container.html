    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with the results,</li>
            <li>Service for this seller is also very good - no issues.</li>
            <li>great product....</li>
            <li>Just a sprinkle and to look great.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was cheaper, but the covering properties weren&#x27;t as good and</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good as Toppik.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great coverage quickly</li>
            <li>If you comb, it clogs very easily and it doesn&#x27;t like to get wet-at all.</li>
            <li>Five stars easily!</li>
            <li>nice full hair line!</li>
            <li>I used about three times more than Topik and it did not cover at all.</li>
            <li>another issue I had is that because it is in you hair more than on the scalp it rubs off more, and if someone is to touch your hair rest assured it&#x27;s going to be coming off on their hands.</li>
            <li>This product clings to the hair fibers much better than most others that sit on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works as indicated.if you are thinning you will definitively want to get this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Plus the value is pretty much as good as it gets for a keratin fiber.</li>
            <li>It is not like the Topik and better just to buy the original Topik.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cover the area, no body to the hair.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product for the quality, color, cost effectiveness and vendor.  </li>
            <li>It gave me back my confidence and covers beautifully.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the dark brown and it blends perfectly with every shade.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with Toppik, but it works fine by itself as well.</li>
            <li>The light dust of it will fall onto whatever you&#x27;re doing it over</li>
            <li>Color didn&#x27;t match as well as original Toppiks.</li>
            <li>The quality of the the samson fibers is better than the more popular brands of keratin fibers and color is spot on, in my case Dark Brown.</li>
            <li>I have thinging hair and using this product makes my hair look full.</li>
            <li>It blends in and makes my hair look soo full.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>After using this fair priced &#x27;Hair Fiber Refill Kit&#x27; I&#x27;m certain that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it regularly.</li>
            <li>Great cheap alternative to toppix more expensive version.</li>
            <li>I will be a lifelong customer of this product unless they come out with something permanent that does just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>I received medium brown, which is obviously too light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got cotton in it instead of real keratin</li>
            <li>the real thing and the bonding to the hair wasn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 4 other brands of this type of product, looking for my favorite and</li>
            <li>It may be slightly messier but once applied, use a little hair spray you are good to go!</li>
            <li>It is equal in quality, and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this was my least favorite so far.</li>
            <li>so you may have a small mess to clean but it wipes away easily with a moist wipe or cloth.</li>
            <li>I looked really close and the issue is that the length of the fibers is really long.  </li>
            <li>Also, since I only use it on certain areas of my hair, it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not wrecking it, it works pretty well, but not as well as the other 4 brands I had tried.</li>
            <li>This product is going to be my main buy to replace/refill the much more expensive items I was using.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill about any dispenser with little to no mess or waste.</li>

            <li> Easy to fill about any dispenser with little to no mess or waste.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on thinning hair and buying in bulk like this saves nearly 50% over buying at a store front location.  </li>
            <li> Been using alternate products for a long time and finally found an affordable solution for monthly refills.</li>
            <li> The first sign of trouble was when I opened the package and the fibers were in little clumps almost little balls.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been different shades from med-dark brown, almost black</li>
            <li> In comparison to other fiber refill products this one is clumpy and sticks to the hair before it ever reaches the scalp.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cover by my (very wide )part.</li>
            <li> Definitely a minor issue just as almost any makeup/beauty product you use can get a little messy sometimes.</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown as advertised, but recieved medium brown instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but I do know that although it&#x27;s similar to the other hair cover products, it has some disadvantages.</li>
            <li> I have a weird part in the back of my hair that seperates and shows my scalp through my dark hair and all I have to do is sprinkle a little of toppik on the area and it makes the part dark and blend in with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Ive been finding this for $20 for 50 grams when 50 grams usually costs like $50.</li>
            <li> I usually do it in my bathroom and just have to wipe the counter after.</li>
            <li> Hard to pour into container.</li>
            <li> Product was clumped into very small balls.</li>
            <li> it is bad stuff</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received medium brown, which is obviously too light. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is going to be my main buy to replace/refill the much more expensive items I was using.  It is equal in quality, and came quickly.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product is a 5 out of 5. I have thinging hair and using this product makes my hair look full. It blends in and makes my hair look soo full. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Just make it short it did not work. It is not like the Topik and better just to buy the original Topik.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cover the area, no body to the hair. I used about three times more than Topik and it did not cover at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered the dark brown as advertised, but recieved medium brown instead. Decided to cut my losses and not send it back but I&#x27;d appreciate if I had recieved what I actually ordered.</li>
            <li> Meets or exceeds all expectations; equivalent to Toppik product in application and durability for daily use.  Will purchase again when this order has been used.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on thinning hair and buying in bulk like this saves nearly 50% over buying at a store front location.  Service for this seller is also very good - no issues.</li>
            <li> This is not even close to kaboki it is bad stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 other brands of this type of product, looking for my favorite and this was my least favorite so far. I don&#x27;t know the science behind it, but I do know that although it&#x27;s similar to the other hair cover products, it has some disadvantages. It&#x27;s got cotton in it instead of real keratin I guess and you can tell. If you comb, it clogs very easily and it doesn&#x27;t like to get wet-at all. I bought it because it was cheaper, but the covering properties weren&#x27;t as good and the real thing and the bonding to the hair wasn&#x27;t either. I&#x27;m not wrecking it, it works pretty well, but not as well as the other 4 brands I had tried.</li>
            <li> doesn t stickto your hair like Toppik does</li>
            <li> great product....no complaints</li>
            <li> In comparison to other fiber refill products this one is clumpy and sticks to the hair before it ever reaches the scalp.  The first sign of trouble was when I opened the package and the fibers were in little clumps almost little balls.  I looked really close and the issue is that the length of the fibers is really long.  another issue I had is that because it is in you hair more than on the scalp it rubs off more, and if someone is to touch your hair rest assured it&#x27;s going to be coming off on their hands.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Been using alternate products for a long time and finally found an affordable solution for monthly refills.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It gave me back my confidence and covers beautifully. Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;I use it after I&#x27;ve styled my hair and the go and&lt;br /&gt;Cover by my (very wide )part. Try it!</li>
            <li> Product was clumped into very small balls. Color didn&#x27;t match as well as original Toppiks. Hard to pour into container. Some spillage may occur. It served the purpose but I may buy another brand. I didn&#x27;t realize that it wasn&#x27;t actually Toppiks...</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product for the quality, color, cost effectiveness and vendor.  The quality of the the samson fibers is better than the more popular brands of keratin fibers and color is spot on, in my case Dark Brown. As suggested on the package do not pour the entire contents in the refill container as it is easier to apply on your scalp.  I do not have much male pattern baldness in the front but decided I would see what it looks like if I &amp;#34;sprinkle&amp;#34; some there- I am so impressed with the results, nice full hair line!</li>
            <li> This product clings to the hair fibers much better than most others that sit on your scalp. Plus the value is pretty much as good as it gets for a keratin fiber. I use it in conjunction with Toppik, but it works fine by itself as well.</li>
            <li> The refill kit is a solid value .. John</li>
            <li> After using this fair priced &#x27;Hair Fiber Refill Kit&#x27; I&#x27;m certain that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it regularly. Easy to fill about any dispenser with little to no mess or waste. Great coverage quickly and it will have you looking younger then you&#x27;d imagine. I use it every day and it&#x27;s virtually undetectable. Even my hair cutter was amazed. She told me she would be getting some for her customers and knows it will be a hit with everyone. Very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good as Toppik. It may be slightly messier but once applied, use a little hair spray you are good to go! And you cannot beat the price. Ive been finding this for $20 for 50 grams when 50 grams usually costs like $50. So when I see low prices I stock up on this stuff.. i never leave the house without putting this in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works as indicated.if you are thinning you will definitively want to get this. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has used toppik before should definitely try this refill kit!! Use the bottle from your toppik and fill it up with this!! It&#x27;s so similar to regular toppik but the price is way cheaper. Go ahead and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Just a sprinkle and to look great. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great cheap alternative to toppix more expensive version. I love this product. I have a weird part in the back of my hair that seperates and shows my scalp through my dark hair and all I have to do is sprinkle a little of toppik on the area and it makes the part dark and blend in with the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ve also used this to help hide my clip in extensions! Just put it around the clip and it makes where you clipped the extension in blend in so well. My hair has been different shades from med-dark brown, almost black so I ordered the dark brown and it blends perfectly with every shade. Also, since I only use it on certain areas of my hair, it seems to last forever. One thing I would recommend is after you sprinkle it on the area you want coverage is to pat over it so any access falls away. Don&#x27;t do it over anything white! The light dust of it will fall onto whatever you&#x27;re doing it over so you may have a small mess to clean but it wipes away easily with a moist wipe or cloth. I usually do it in my bathroom and just have to wipe the counter after. Definitely a minor issue just as almost any makeup/beauty product you use can get a little messy sometimes. I recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair as it gives you a fuller look from your roots. I will be a lifelong customer of this product unless they come out with something permanent that does just as good of a job. Five stars easily!</li>
