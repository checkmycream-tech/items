            <li>People can&#x27;t believe my hair is this shiny, manageable, and fabulous without putting product on it and blowing it out.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Rating is not bad.....</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently with WEN by Chaz Dean.</li>
            <li>Once the winter heat kicks back on, I will be more consistent.</li>

            <li>but if anything slow-up or stop any new hair loss.</li>
            <li>Very nourishing and great hair supplement to have during cold, winter months.</li>

            <li>I would describe my hair condition as critical, in only 1 month I lost so much hair that you could see my scalp a bit.</li>

            <li> Also, I received my order quicker than expected, packaged very professionally.</li>
            <li> I normally put it on my scalp at night before bed (as directed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not looking to grow hair overnight down my back</li>
            <li> Before this oil, I used Brahmi and Brahmi-Amla from the same supplier for 6 months in total, got new hair growth and saw some small hair loss only when oiling hair.</li>
            <li> Saw new hair growth after 1.5 months, then started experiencing heavy hair loss after another month of usage.  </li>
            <li> I think I will stick to coconut oil next time, and maybe use this an additional oil mixed in due to the price.</li>
            <li> There is, however, only a minimal amount of Bringraj in the oil.</li>
            <li> far as hair growth or thickening.... I&#x27;ll update in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;four stars because a long term evaluation cannot be done.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry from coloring &amp; bleaching, but this has restored all that was lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll add a few drops of lavender essential oil to my bottle to make this use-bearable.</li>
            <li> I have to color my hair once a month now instead of every 6-8weeks due to the rate of growth.</li>
            <li> I believe the other fillers in the bottle include almond oil.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair twice a week and use this oil every other day.  </li>
            <li> So I gave this oil a try, applied it on my scalp every other day (4-5 times a week).</li>
            <li> my new growth still comes in gray and and my hair is still thin.  </li>
            <li> I used to wrap 4x but now down to 3x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shedding a lot of hair after wash and after using this oil, it is down to no hair loss.</li>
            <li> I put bringraj on my scalp and WEN oil on the bottom half of my hair.</li>
            <li> Itch and dryness started disappearing after the 4 th application, hair loss reduced , I am still pulling some hairs when I go through with my fingers, but there are half less than it was.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that it has darkened my hair any, although, I usually wear my hair dark due to dye.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a little under 3 months (have alopecia).</li>
            <li> I massage my head for approximately 2 minutes, then put my hair up in a loose bun, cover my hair w a shower cap, and leave on overnight.</li>
            <li> I usually oil on Tues night and on Saturday if I&#x27;m home.</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;m not sure there will be regrowth&lt;</li>
            <li> the very least it may help to maintain my hair</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick and&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a very bad hair loss due to stress.</li>
            <li> Holy Crap</li>
            <li> The smell is just awful - reminds me of the lingering smell of used frying oil - (with a mixture of squash/flower scent) - you get the picture.</li>
            <li> taste/smell awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good fragrance, seeing results</li>
            <li> Whenever I wash my hair,  I have this \\&quot;halo\\&quot; of fine wispy hair poking up all over my head. They are not breakage pieces bc they are not thick, just fine like baby hair. It reminds me of hair growing back after chemotherapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ponytail has gotten thicker also. I used to wrap 4x but now down to 3x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a pipette and apply the oil 2-4x a week, every week. I massage my head for approximately 2 minutes, then put my hair up in a loose bun, cover my hair w a shower cap, and leave on overnight. Very impressed. Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone interested in thicker, healthier hair. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using on my husband&#x27;s receding hairline! His application is very inconsistent so hopefully with my results, he will be easier to catch up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8/26/12. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently with WEN by Chaz Dean. Holy Crap my hair is amazing. People can&#x27;t believe my hair is this shiny, manageable, and fabulous without putting product on it and blowing it out. Heat utensils rarely touch my hair--only on special occasions. I&#x27;ve cut back on scalp oiling since it&#x27;s been summer. I usually oil on Tues night and on Saturday if I&#x27;m home. Once the winter heat kicks back on, I will be more consistent. My hair is mid-back length now. I put bringraj on my scalp and WEN oil on the bottom half of my hair. I still do a scalp massage as I have been.  I have to color my hair once a month now instead of every 6-8weeks due to the rate of growth.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many benefits, but most people use it on the hair. Using the powder form is how you benefit the most from it. Please google &amp;#34;benefits of Bringraj&amp;#34; to see all that it can be helpful with pertaining to the human body. I use this oil as a hot oil treatment for my hair, and it has been awesome in keeping it moist. My hair was extremely dry from coloring &amp; bleaching, but this has restored all that was lost. The odor is strong so beware, but it is worth it if you are looking for maximum results. The fact that my hair started growing faster was a bonus.</li>
            <li> too strong smell for me,  It gives me headache.  I would like the ingredient herb smell.</li>
            <li> This oil smells good, and does a wonderful job of hydrating my hair. There is, however, only a minimal amount of Bringraj in the oil. I believe the other fillers in the bottle include almond oil. I have not noticed that it has darkened my hair any, although, I usually wear my hair dark due to dye. Nor has it sped up the growth of my hair. I think I will stick to coconut oil next time, and maybe use this an additional oil mixed in due to the price.</li>
            <li> Hope it help my hair come back lol, so far it&#x27;s growing out my hair I already have, but I been only using it for about 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and is prices right. The smell is fine. The oil is very thick and&lt;br /&gt;leaves my hair feeling strong and healthy with a great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least it may help to maintain my hair yet I&#x27;m not sure there will be regrowth&lt;br /&gt;as the product claims.</li>
            <li> Like the Hair Oil. Will purchase it again!!</li>
            <li> I used this oil for about 4 months 1-2 times a week overnight, wash hair with ayurvedic herbs.  Saw new hair growth after 1.5 months, then started experiencing heavy hair loss after another month of usage.  Before this oil, I used Brahmi and Brahmi-Amla from the same supplier for 6 months in total, got new hair growth and saw some small hair loss only when oiling hair. I was planning to use Amla oil from the same supplier next, but am now thinking about giving oiling a break.  If anybody has an insight, pls post your comment here.</li>
            <li> Is great for my hair. It&#x27;s makes it soft and manageable. I have been using this oil for years and will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil for hair growth.  This oil absorbs very quickly; it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or with an oily feel. I&#x27;ve not seen any buildups and plus my hair feels super soft when I use this oil.  Too soon to speak on the hair growth part of it; so far, it appears to be working. I wash my hair twice a week and use this oil every other day.  Also, I received my order quicker than expected, packaged very professionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Ayurveda a try and I&#x27;ve added this oil to my ends daily. It smells like motor oil to me but its seals my ends well without heaviness and gives good shine with no greasy feeling. The smell is strong when applied but doesn&#x27;t linger at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair growth or thickening.... I&#x27;ll update in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used  this product the last seven months. my new growth still comes in gray and and my hair is still thin.  I use it as a scalp treatment and to seal my ends.  Once I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I  won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle has the updated red lettering; not the labeling shown at this date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil has a musky smell my wife and I both like.  The Banyan oil of this type has just about no smell at all - though it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;four stars because a long term evaluation cannot be done.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that it does as product states or doesn&#x27;t. I have been using for a little under 3 months (have alopecia). I normally put it on my scalp at night before bed (as directed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not looking to grow hair overnight down my back but if anything slow-up or stop any new hair loss. Parts of my scalp is smooth and other area&#x27;s are prickly/crew or military haircut. So, if anything nourishment for existing follicles is a plus if provided by bringraj oil. I think with continued use and life style/diet changes (that also play a huge part on hair, nails, skin and vital organs)the product my play a key role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating is not bad.....more neutral/in the middle</li>
            <li> Very nourishing and great hair supplement to have during cold, winter months. No artificial fragrances and quality feels very good.</li>
            <li> This oil is by far the best hair conditioner I have ever tried. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet. Every time I use it it leaves my hair shiny and very soft making my hair look very healthy. I mix it with Brahmin-amla and Amla oil for added condition.  Leaves my hair looking very shiny and healthy looking</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time after doing extensive research on ayurvedic oils for hair growth. I have buzzed my hair off, but wanted something nutritious for my scalp that I could use for regular scalp massaging and conditioning. The smell is just awful - reminds me of the lingering smell of used frying oil - (with a mixture of squash/flower scent) - you get the picture. I cannot believe one reviewer saying it smells \\&quot;musky\\&quot; and that they love the smell as a couple. Um, nope... this is as \\&quot;musky\\&quot; as Donald Trump is loveable. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll add a few drops of lavender essential oil to my bottle to make this use-bearable. I simply cannot go to bed (or anywhere else for that matter) smelling like a tar truck. I refuse to trade in my love life for luscious locks. I guess everything healthy does look/taste/smell awful - theres always a compromise.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad hair loss due to stress. I would describe my hair condition as critical, in only 1 month I lost so much hair that you could see my scalp a bit. So I gave this oil a try, applied it on my scalp every other day (4-5 times a week). Itch and dryness started disappearing after the 4 th application, hair loss reduced , I am still pulling some hairs when I go through with my fingers, but there are half less than it was. A also take bhrinaraj  in a powder form 1/2 - 1 tsp twice a day with my smoothie. So far It&#x27;s only been a week of using this treatment and I am very glad it is working.</li>
            <li> Great hair oil!! Hair loss has completely stopped. I was shedding a lot of hair after wash and after using this oil, it is down to no hair loss. Will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil. My hair loves it, even more so than coconut oil. It keeps it shiny soft and healthy. I will always buy this.</li>
    </ol>
