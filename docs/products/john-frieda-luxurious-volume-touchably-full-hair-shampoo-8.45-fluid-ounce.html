            <li>This shampoo is OK nothing special.</li>
            <li>my hair was so smooth and easy to brush.  </li>

            <li> Great product!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair very clean and full.</li>
            <li> like the sheer blonde line better</li>
            <li> If you have colored gray hair and you are having problems keeping your color...this is awesome stuff.  My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the fullness it gave my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does a good job at adding volume to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the shampoo and conditioner. It smells so good. Then when i went to brush my hair after washing it and conditioning it...my hair was so smooth and easy to brush.  Like a warm knife in butter.  I have curly hair down to my waist. While the stands are fine, I have a &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of hair.  My hair has been knotted up for over a month...now it is manageable after one use...great product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t state in description, which would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and super convenient to have it delivered to my front door.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I have short FINE color-treated hair and this works for me.  It does give me more volume.  It&#x27;s worth giving it  try...not so expensive that you feel you just wasted more money on something else that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is OK nothing special.</li>
            <li> Love it, better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this shampoo if you have color treated hair!  I received a sample of the John Frieda volume shampoo in the mail.  My hair was recently professionally colored about 5 days prior to using the sample.  I had used my normal color safe shampoo for those five days with no issue.  When I used the shampoo, I got out of the shower and rubbed my hair to towel dry with a white towel.  Immediately the towel was covered in pink.  My hair is dyed a very deep red/brown.  I&#x27;ve professioanlly colored my hair for 15 years and I&#x27;ve used every color safe shampoo imaginable and I&#x27;ve never had this happen.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, gives good volume</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I know John Frieda products and this holds up.  I have had good results with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have broken, fine, thin, dry curly hair that I straighten - I have to be careful as products either dry my hair out more and it becomes frizzy or weigh it down and it is stuck to my head. Finally there is a product that has transformed my hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works very well with my hair although it is short. I would recommend to try if you are looking for a change.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is all right.  It has kind of a gelatinous texture, which is a little different compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  However, it wasn&#x27;t too difficult to use.  I started scrubbing my scalp and it lathered up pretty well.  (I like that it&#x27;s clear; I prefer to avoid artificial dyes as I have somewhat sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This got my hair clean (I&#x27;d just worked out so I was sweaty) and it rinsed out without leaving residue.  I used it along with the conditioner from the same product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients, since I didn&#x27;t see them in the product listing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamide mea, sodium chloride, fragrance, polyquaternium-7, benzyl alcohol, disodium edta, silicone quaternium-18, laureth-16, malic acid, polyquaternium-52, trideceth-6, peg-12 dimethicone, glycine, trideceth-12, sea salt, ppg-9, alcohol denat., amp-isostearoyl hydrolyzed wheat protein, methylchloroisothiazolinone, methylisothiazolinone, sodium hydroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the color protection claims since this contains sulfates, which are generally recommended against for color treated hair (this did not strip color from my hair, though).  However, I do feel that I got a slight boost in volume between this and the conditioner, without doing anything out of the ordinary to my hair.</li>
            <li> Softly and smell like this so good!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I have thin hair.</li>
