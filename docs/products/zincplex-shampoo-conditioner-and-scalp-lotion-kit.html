            <li> I have long hair and it says to use a face cloth.</li>
            <li> and they use the Bain DTerre shampoo or my other yummy smelling fave shampoo Paul Mitchell Blonde</li>
            <li> not so, it is now dry in spots and these sores/blisters appear</li>
            <li> but these products have given me relief beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> and i would recomend this to anyone who can;t find satisfaction with other products.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is working for less flare up, irritation amd strand loss is Clinicure Purifying Scalp Cleanse for Color Treated Hair by Joico</li>
            <li> I have dry, scaley bumps on my scalp making it hard to not be constaintly picking.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything under the sun for this weird new scalp condition I have acquired since sunburning my scalp while in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li> although, I do think it stripped / dulled it a little bit</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months and it has brought little or no relief.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this sh....</li>
            <li> Spent at least a thousand dollars trying to figure out and healing it</li>
            <li> my hair.l.it doesn&#x27;t smell yummy like my fave Bain de Terre Green Meadow</li>
            <li> Not truthful.</li>
            <li> the instructions were hard to follow.</li>
            <li> It,s hard to do.</li>
            <li> I sprayed verrry well known aerosal sunscreen on my scalp after realizing that I was getting burnt but it was too late.</li>
            <li> Zincplex keeps the itch away and has slowly improved my scalp condition.</li>
            <li> and if I scratch them to get rid of them it just makes it worse</li>
            <li> so I am always irritating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I think the cream made it worse</li>
            <li> waste money this product makes my daughter&#x27;s hair worst.</li>
            <li> , they hurt badly</li>
            <li> but I know when I used the conditioner on my scalp it made me have a bad flare up</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and will never order this product again.</li>
            <li> It peeled in sheets, it was awful but thought it was done and over with..</li>

            <li> waste money this product makes my daughter&#x27;s hair worst. dont waste your money on this sh....t it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> As yet it hasnt helped very&lt;br /&gt; much at all will use the rest of it before i order any more kind of a disapointment&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the scalpne claims but i saw no difference after three weeks. I used it as directed and as a stand alone shampoo and conditioner it seemed fine. I dont have dandruff so i cant say it helps or not with that issue. The high price is just too much for whatever you wind up using it for.</li>
            <li> This is good for psoriasis and It does help if you wash your hair 2 times a week to make sure you clean your scalp.. Use it until you feel and see a difference. That&#x27;s what I done and It helped clear up my psoriasis...</li>
            <li> Great for scalp acne.</li>
            <li> Awesome health benefits</li>
            <li> It has worked great. I had been using Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner. Zincplex keeps the itch away and has slowly improved my scalp condition. I&#x27;m not even through with the first bottles.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that these products actually do work!  I have tried many products recommended to me, but never had tried Zincplex.  I happened onto it as I was looking for another brand, ordered it, and tried it.  Of course, my issues are not totally cured...but these products have given me relief beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use this shampoo and conditioner. The Scalp lotion made my scalp even drier than it is. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I only purchased this after I read rave reviews. Maybe its just me, but this stuff isn&#x27;t what its cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> the instructions were hard to follow.I have long hair and it says to use a face cloth.It,s hard to do.Results only fair.</li>
            <li> I tried all the medicated shampoos and this was the only shampoo that worked on the condition of my scalp.</li>
            <li> A lot of money and didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li> Looks good but did nothing feel like a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> This shampoo did nothing for my hair, it does not eliminate dandruff, but made my scalp even drier than before. I am disappointed and will never order this product again.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it not everyone say it is it help me some but not that much I would recommend to someone else if I have to. I use to product for about 3weeks then I went to a dermotalogyst</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful product ,i&#x27;ve spent much money for everything that don&#x27;t work everything from A to Z . I came across this product on amazon and with ONE application could not believe it.. I had contacted a bacteria or something that gave me pimples on my scalp that hurt like hell. Went to doctors to no avail,they gave me creams and shampoos that don&#x27;t work. My scalp is clearing up very fast and i would recomend this to anyone who can;t find satisfaction with other products. Don&#x27; wait to get this.</li>
            <li> I have dry, scaley bumps on my scalp making it hard to not be constaintly picking.  My stylist and dermatologist both just gave me a srug of their shoulders. Using Zincplex gives me relief, it has not cured it, but does reduce the irritation.  I find that I have to use it at least every other day for best results.</li>
            <li> According to my dermatologist.......this is a good product, It just was not waht I needed to combat the scalp condition that I had.</li>
            <li> Well...like everyone else that has dandruff, flaking issues, etc., I was hoping that this was going to be the miracle cure! Unfortunately...it isn&#x27;t. I have used this product for a few months and it has brought little or no relief. I get better results with dilluting Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar with water and putting it in a squirt bottle. That is the only thing that restores the PH balance to my scalp and stops the itching.This product is waaaaay overpriced. I think the website misleads people as their are no negative reviews on the posts. Not truthful. Anyway...give Jason&#x27;s Dandruff Shampoo a shot. It has helped me immensely.  Happy scratching! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the talk is about this product does not work at all.  The company who sells it just puts out any kind of product to get peoples money.  They don&#x27;t even answer their phones when you call to get advise about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Amazon but maybe they need to watch who they associate with.</li>
            <li> It took away the ichy bumps and my hair looks great.  I use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic given online reviews and dissapointed that the product did not work for me. The shampoo was fine for my hair, but no improvement observed for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried everything under the sun for this weird new scalp condition I have acquired since sunburning my scalp while in the Bahamas. I sprayed verrry well known aerosal sunscreen on my scalp after realizing that I was getting burnt but it was too late. I had sprayed it over my burns and my scalp hasn&#x27;t been the same since. It peeled in sheets, it was awful but thought it was done and over with.. not so, it is now dry in spots and these sores/blisters appear and if I scratch them to get rid of them it just makes it worse, they hurt badly and then I lose hair in that area. My head does not itch one bit but knowing it&#x27;s there I have a habit of feeling what&#x27;s going on there so I am always irritating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been to 4 different doctors, 3 of which are dermatologists and they are clueless. Spent at least a thousand dollars trying to figure out and healing it but nothing works! I used this shampoo, cond, and cream for 3 straight weeks and it didn&#x27;t help me a bit. In fact, I think the cream made it worse but I know when I used the conditioner on my scalp it made me have a bad flare up day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is working for less flare up, irritation amd strand loss is Clinicure Purifying Scalp Cleanse for Color Treated Hair by Joico - I just purchased a 2nd bottle right here on Amazon (1st bottle I bought here too, I&#x27;d never heard of it until Amazon!) I love the Clinicure Weightless Thickener too but I never spray it on my scalp. I have the coordinating conditioner too but can&#x27;t use it on my scalp but feels pretty good on my hair.l.it doesn&#x27;t smell yummy like my fave Bain de Terre Green Meadow so I use the Clinicure on my scalp, leave on for a minute and then rinse and they use the Bain DTerre shampoo or my other yummy smelling fave shampoo Paul Mitchell Blonde Forever shampoo on mt hair away from my scalp. (buy both of those here on Amazon too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Zincplex shampoo was OK for my lightened hair..although, I do think it stripped / dulled it a little bit but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a lot of allergies which suddenly started about 10 years ago so I am very sensitive to nearly everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last dermatologist I went to told me to stop ising this (this was before clinicure) since it wasn&#x27;t working at all. So I returned this for a full refund,ut nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a lot of allergies which suddenly started about 10 years ago so I am very sensitive to nearly everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last dermatologist I went to told me to stop ising this (this was before clinicure) since it wasn&#x27;t working at all.
