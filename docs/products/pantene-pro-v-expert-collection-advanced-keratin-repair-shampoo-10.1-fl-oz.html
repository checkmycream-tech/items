            <li>I have tried the conditioner before and loved it, and that is why I decided to give the shampoo a try as well.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and lather.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be good to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>this shampoo smoothes it out nicely and is a great price.</li>
            <li>Had a really good scent.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a bit more hydrating, or had a bit more keratin in it to accomplish that, but for the price, it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>and I totally LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>the ends felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a replacement for the old Infusium Repairology shampoo and conditioner which were the best products hands</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to throw out the tons of bottles of shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many keratin shampoos and conditioners and none have done anything close as to repairing my hair as Pantene&#x27;s Expert Keratin Repair.</li>
            <li>I hope Pantene continues to make more products like this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ends of my hair looked and felt fantastic!</li>
            <li>The more I used it the better.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the Age Defy formula of this product is any better, but I am not inclined to sink another $16.00 into finding out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now my hair feels almost as good as my pre-motorcycle days.</li>
            <li>give you an example of the great condition my hair was in this was and still is my normal hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Then I flat ironed it and I could  not believe how smooth, shiny( after adding  motions sheen) and incredibly bouncy it was!</li>
            <li>Great stuff and leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great and leaves my hair feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It detangles even with the shampoo and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences blue moisturizing formula is way, way better, and even some of the Head and Shoulders 2-1 formulas feel great on your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels strong and sliky</li>
            <li>Turned out a beautiful brownish red.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it since I have fine hair and</li>
            <li>I just impulse bought the trial kit for this line of products and have used them twice on my mid-back length, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers well and does not leave a strong smell in your hair which is important to me since I have allergies.</li>
            <li>I was having huge issues with my hair falling out while washing.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair sooo smooth</li>
            <li>You need to use the conditioner after using the shampoo to get smooth hair</li>
            <li>Not only did it smell great</li>
            <li>my hair felt somewhat smooth after I  blowdried it.</li>
            <li>It seemed ok, when I first used it</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I love it so much i hide the bottle from my roommates!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the high hopes that its high price would translate into great performance.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t need as much to get a good lather or to get the conditioned feel throughout my whole head.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve just bought a full sized of each product.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo - rinsed out well and left lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super silky, shiny, manageable and unbroken.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, I am so glad I stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li>If you need what keratin was developed to do Keratin Repair could not be better.</li>
            <li>Both are really great, so it&#x27;s hard to make a significant distinction.</li>
            <li>My my super curly &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; hair, AgeDefy is a better product -- moisture, freshness, longer lasting.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>After the first shampoo and conditioning I put the split end fuser in and blew out my hair.</li>
            <li>This one really works!</li>
            <li>After the first use, I can already feel the difference.</li>
            <li>In fact my hair feels soft and looks pretty and reflects light as it should when I use this line.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The ends actually reflected light again!</li>
            <li>Performance of the shampoo was completely unremarkable, particularly in light of the product&#x27;s $7.99 price for 10.1 oz.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed while combing in conditioner  was no shedding.</li>
            <li>and I thought it gave my hair noticeable volume as well as making it very soft, clean, and shiny.</li>
            <li>As far as shampoo goes, I&#x27;m sticking with Organix Ever Straight Bazillion Keratin Therapy Shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>It is pricey at $16-$18 for both the shampoo and conditioner compared to other products but for me its an amazing savings.whole head.</li>
            <li>It is pricey at $16-$18 for both the shampoo and conditioner compared to other products but for me its an amazing savings.</li>
            <li>( its normally very straight) very well.</li>
            <li>There are other regular versions of Pantene that are far superior, including the Aqua Light formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Texas has hot, dry, sunny summer weather which isn&#x27;t good on the hair anyway, factor in my pony tail being whipped around by hot, dry winds at 70+ MPH . . .</li>
            <li>before using this product my hair was a complete mess, totally dry, now, after one week of using it, my hair looks healthier, bright and smooth!</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo - cleans nicely yet doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out.  </li>
            <li>Fairly gentle, too.</li>
            <li>, I do not have situation where no matter how much I rinse</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I had looked and felt sooooo much</li>
            <li>I used the pantene keratin products on my light blonde hair and now my hair is a carmel color.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY UPSET.</li>
            <li>Love it it makes my hair so soft and bouncy and it actually is thickening my hair and my Daughter</li>
            <li>saw the new Pantene Expert Collection products displayed on an end-cap at Walmart and chose the Keratin formula after reviewing the labels for both it and the age defy and decided that the Keratin formula might meet my haircare needs better and may actually be similar to the old Infusium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like it claims), and getting it out of the bottle was a pain - if I tried to squeeze any out, it would go out the sides of the cap and down the bottle instead of out the top of the cap like one would expect.</li>
            <li>Much better shampoos out there for half the cost of this.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth even after I blow dry and not fried or frizzy.</li>
            <li>I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away.</li>
            <li>I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away.</li>
            <li>We both used it for the first time today and can&#x27;t believe how much darker our blonde hair is.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and</li>
            <li>I put waves in by braiding when slightly damp, normally they brush out quickly but these stay in even after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>it strips the natural minerals and oils from your hair...</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t need Keratin repair, this product makes your hair so soft, shiny and touchable.  </li>
            <li>knew I had to take action.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and bouncy and its never been that bouncy before.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft silky and shiny again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The white bottles are for damaged hair, which for some reason didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft silky and shiny again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The white bottles are for damaged hair, which for some reason didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get dirty as fast as with other products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just the first wash my hair felt much softer and the split ends less visible.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny and I also spend a lot less time drying it, which reduces damage.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m down to just enough strokes to get the tangles and smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new products, especially for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful, because my hair is rather dry and frizzy, especially in the winter, but the shampoo itself did not help my hair (certainly not &amp;#34;heal two years&#x27; worth of damage in two minutes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The only thing that I can say about this product is WOW!</li>
            <li>This works well on my hair that is thick but fine ...</li>
            <li>I am on medication that completely drys out my hair to the point where it feels like straw, and this shampoo is the only product that makes any improvement on it at all.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; experience but was left completely underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe not a single strand came out.</li>
            <li>I can blow dry my hair completely dry and it is still nice and soft, no more straw and no more</li>
            <li>The reason, I have serious scalp issues, dry, itchy, flaky, fine hair that is super thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 34 years old but for some reason my has has become completely dry and liveless in the last 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I am blond with thin-medium thick hair, kind of wavy, often hard to manage.  </li>

            <li> I really like this shampoo - cleans nicely yet doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out.  </li>
            <li> Fairly gentle, too.</li>
            <li> , I do not have situation where no matter how much I rinse</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I had looked and felt sooooo much</li>
            <li> I used the pantene keratin products on my light blonde hair and now my hair is a carmel color.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY UPSET.</li>
            <li> Love it it makes my hair so soft and bouncy and it actually is thickening my hair and my Daughter</li>
            <li> saw the new Pantene Expert Collection products displayed on an end-cap at Walmart and chose the Keratin formula after reviewing the labels for both it and the age defy and decided that the Keratin formula might meet my haircare needs better and may actually be similar to the old Infusium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like it claims), and getting it out of the bottle was a pain - if I tried to squeeze any out, it would go out the sides of the cap and down the bottle instead of out the top of the cap like one would expect.</li>
            <li> Much better shampoos out there for half the cost of this.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth even after I blow dry and not fried or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away.</li>
            <li> I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away.</li>
            <li> We both used it for the first time today and can&#x27;t believe how much darker our blonde hair is.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and</li>
            <li> I put waves in by braiding when slightly damp, normally they brush out quickly but these stay in even after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> it strips the natural minerals and oils from your hair...</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t need Keratin repair, this product makes your hair so soft, shiny and touchable.  </li>
            <li> knew I had to take action.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and bouncy and its never been that bouncy before.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft silky and shiny again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The white bottles are for damaged hair, which for some reason didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is soft silky and shiny again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The white bottles are for damaged hair, which for some reason didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get dirty as fast as with other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just the first wash my hair felt much softer and the split ends less visible.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and shiny and I also spend a lot less time drying it, which reduces damage.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down to just enough strokes to get the tangles and smooth out my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new products, especially for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful, because my hair is rather dry and frizzy, especially in the winter, but the shampoo itself did not help my hair (certainly not &amp;#34;heal two years&#x27; worth of damage in two minutes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say about this product is WOW!</li>
            <li> This works well on my hair that is thick but fine ...</li>
            <li> I am on medication that completely drys out my hair to the point where it feels like straw, and this shampoo is the only product that makes any improvement on it at all.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; experience but was left completely underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe not a single strand came out.</li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair completely dry and it is still nice and soft, no more straw and no more</li>
            <li> The reason, I have serious scalp issues, dry, itchy, flaky, fine hair that is super thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 34 years old but for some reason my has has become completely dry and liveless in the last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I am blond with thin-medium thick hair, kind of wavy, often hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is an odd caramel color and is gelatinous and does not dispense particularly easily out of the hard bottle.  </li>
            <li> It dried faster than normal and was brighter and shinier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously,  I was using Pantene&#x27;s Anti-Breakage shampoo but it wasn&#x27;t doing enough for my hair because it had become too course and dry and was still breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not feel luxurious during use, and it left my hair dry feeling.</li>
            <li> It did not feel luxurious during use and left my hair feeling dry and unconditioned.</li>
            <li> After using this entire bottle I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, I think it actually made it drier.</li>
            <li> The conditioner comes in the familiar Pantene tube and dispenses easily through a small opening, but again I was left completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried much more expensive shampoos and conditioners and the only other one that helped somewhat was Aphogee in the pink bottles Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Another thing I noticed, I usually shed a lot of hair, enough that I was brushing my hair 2-400 strokes a day just to get the loose hair completely out.</li>
            <li> but my hair still seemed to be dry, tangled, and shedding.</li>
            <li> No need for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually completely dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> Once or twice a year I may blow dry and use styling aids.</li>
            <li> scalp n hair is dry</li>
            <li> Diffuser seemed to dry out hair.</li>
            <li> I also use ordinary shampoo and conditioner on my thick, full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it also made my hair so soft and usually my hair gets knotty.</li>
            <li> So it has a slight wave to it now just from regular styling, I don&#x27;t have to use any extra products save for a little hair spray now and then.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comb or brush it while wet because it is too damaging, so</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if anyone else likes this product.ng all of its products (including soaps, detergents, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am curious to see if anyone else likes this product.</li>
            <li> They are horrible, I never use a dryer even in winter because my hair always ends up straw like, I don&#x27;t use much in the way of conditioners unless necessary and only ultra light ones because they always weigh my hair down and leave it limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a little bit of it goes a long way for both shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> As I was using it in the shower it felt like all other shampoos that make my hair tangled when I wash it but after using the conditioner and split end fuser</li>
            <li> At the same time, my past experiences with Pantene were mediocre.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long thick black hair that I attempted to color blonde.</li>
            <li> I am african american and have very thick hair so not all products work on my hair.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have dry flaky scalp anymore, I don&#x27;t have the heavy feeling on my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product over other keratin shampoos because this one also has the amino acid l-histidine which thickens aging hair which leads to less breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel oily and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> weigh down lifeless</li>
            <li> Every day, I notice less and less hair coming out</li>
            <li> I have less split ends</li>
            <li> I like the smell, the texture and the fact that I use 75% less of this product.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very dry and frizzy!!!  </li>
            <li> I came across pantene expert with keratin repair a few weeks ago up in college.</li>
            <li> The bottom 6 inches of my hair has looked like a dried out hay stack for over a year.</li>
            <li> Or because my hair has natural wave sometimes ill just finger comb and go.</li>
            <li> Wash hair at least every other evening, sop all the water out that I can get out of it.</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from pantene because I&#x27;ve been told by my hair dresser</li>
            <li> I tried a few other keratin shampoos but was not impressed with any of them.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair</li>
            <li> product has a bland, forgettable fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was so frustrated this morning with this product that I actually squeezed the rest of the bottle and tube (about half) down the drain in anger</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be that I noticed such a difference because my hair was so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be that I noticed such a difference because my hair was so bad</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending the time and money for Keratin treatments and also felt like it was ruining my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve learned that usually when a company isn&#x27;t afraid to spend millions on a promotion, then there&#x27;s a reason to it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why all the retailers stopped carrying it. :(</li>
            <li> but some its efforts fail.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately for me, I had to find out in a bad way, that this product isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> I was so mad.</li>
            <li> sorry charlie!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> And since I have allergies it is getting very difficult to find hair products without flowers and herbs (which are not in this product).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, because it may work for some people just not for me.</li>
            <li> So I also added the conditioner, and I must say I am absolutely shocked how well</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great Shampoo at the price!</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my hair sooo smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to compare Keratin Repair to AgeDefy.  Both are really great, so it&#x27;s hard to make a significant distinction. Keratin seems intended to straighten hair while moisturizing.  My my super curly &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; hair, AgeDefy is a better product -- moisture, freshness, longer lasting.  If you need what keratin was developed to do Keratin Repair could not be better.</li>
            <li> You need to use the conditioner after using the shampoo to get smooth hair</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. I am not sure why all the retailers stopped carrying it. :(</li>
            <li> This shampoo is terrible.  It made my hair feel oily and weighed down.  Much better shampoos out there for half the cost of this.</li>
            <li> I have been using nexus pro mend for three years and have always loved it but my hair still seemed to be dry, tangled, and shedding. I came across pantene expert with keratin repair a few weeks ago up in college. I usually stay away from pantene because I&#x27;ve been told by my hair dresser it strips the natural minerals and oils from your hair... I was amazed!! After the first shampoo and conditioning I put the split end fuser in and blew out my hair. It dried faster than normal and was brighter and shinier. Not only did it smell great but it also made my hair so soft and usually my hair gets knotty. I cant stop putting my hands thru it, best shampoo and conditioning combo ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and didn&#x27;t expect a lot from it since I have fine hair and almost everything I tried didn&#x27;t add volume to my hair. But!!! This one really works! After the first use, I can already feel the difference. I use the hair serum along with the shampoo and conditioner. Love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s best product is their Pro-V Expert Collection Keratin Repair.  Even if you don&#x27;t need Keratin repair, this product makes your hair so soft, shiny and touchable.  I prefer the 16.9 oz pump bottle, but it appears that Pantene has decided to discontinue that product.  It is so much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I just impulse bought the trial kit for this line of products and have used them twice on my mid-back length, fine hair. Every time I turn around someone is telling me how great my hair looks. I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of it because it feels so great. Highly recommend, I am so glad I stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 2 days ago and I totally LOVE IT! Both shampoo and conditioner are AMAZING! It actually does what it says : 2 years of damage in 2 min!!! Once again PANTENE!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult, wavy hair.  I was tired of spending the time and money for Keratin treatments and also felt like it was ruining my hair.  I tried a few other keratin shampoos but was not impressed with any of them.  Once I tried this Pantene one, I was hooked.  My hair is super soft and shiny and I also spend a lot less time drying it, which reduces damage.  This product is amazing!  I use all 3, shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over other keratin shampoos because this one also has the amino acid l-histidine which thickens aging hair which leads to less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Previously,  I was using Pantene&#x27;s Anti-Breakage shampoo but it wasn&#x27;t doing enough for my hair because it had become too course and dry and was still breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I had to take action. This shampoo lathers well and does not leave a strong smell in your hair which is important to me since I have allergies. And since I have allergies it is getting very difficult to find hair products without flowers and herbs (which are not in this product).&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad, I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome!  I am on medication that completely drys out my hair to the point where it feels like straw, and this shampoo is the only product that makes any improvement on it at all.  In fact my hair feels soft and looks pretty and reflects light as it should when I use this line.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I had to find out in a bad way, that this product isn&#x27;t for me.  It seemed ok, when I first used it but my hair has been shedding and thinning out.  I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, because it may work for some people just not for me.</li>
            <li> I seen an ad for the pantene keratin in a magazine and I like pantene so I thought I would give it a try. I am african american and have very thick hair so not all products work on my hair. I bought the trial size which comes with the shampoo, conditioner, and split end remedy. As I was using it in the shower it felt like all other shampoos that make my hair tangled when I wash it but after using the conditioner and split end fuser my hair felt somewhat smooth after I  blowdried it. My hair was soft and bouncy and its never been that bouncy before. Then I flat ironed it and I could  not believe how smooth, shiny( after adding  motions sheen) and incredibly bouncy it was! I was so amazed by how bouncy it was because my hair has.never been that bouncy after! I will definitely be purchasing a larger size this time. I definitley recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this is ANY stores anymore and I thought it gave my hair noticeable volume as well as making it very soft, clean, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair, and it smells nice. I wish it were a bit more hydrating, or had a bit more keratin in it to accomplish that, but for the price, it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> From all the Pantene cleansing hair products , this is the only one that really have helped restoring the health of my dried hair. And a little bit of it goes a long way for both shampoo and conditioner. I hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go along with the matching Conditioner.  Big mistake.  It made my hair very dry and frizzy!!!  So, I returned it.  STILL LOVE the Keratin Conditioner.  As far as shampoo goes, I&#x27;m sticking with Organix Ever Straight Bazillion Keratin Therapy Shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I was having huge issues with my hair falling out while washing. I used this product for the first time today.Absolutely no shedding and my hair has been soft all day. It has never been easier to use my straightener and see result. I will definitely continue to use this product. A bit on the pricey side. Best to use coupons if you want to give it a try.... I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it it makes my hair so soft and bouncy and it actually is thickening my hair and my Daughter Loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo, and my hair doesn&#x27;t get dirty as fast as with other products. Fairly gentle, too. I recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new products, especially for my hair. The reason, I have serious scalp issues, dry, itchy, flaky, fine hair that is super thick. I&#x27;ve been, on doctor&#x27;s orders, rotating dandraff shampoos for years. They are horrible, I never use a dryer even in winter because my hair always ends up straw like, I don&#x27;t use much in the way of conditioners unless necessary and only ultra light ones because they always weigh my hair down and leave it limp and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subscribe to a ton of subscription beauty boxes and I received a sample size of this shampoo and the conditioner in last seasons box from beauty tube. I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It is AMAZING!!. I can use the shampoo and the conditioner, I don&#x27;t have dry flaky scalp anymore, I don&#x27;t have the heavy feeling on my hair, I do not have situation where no matter how much I rinse I still end up scraping up stuff off my scalp because the stuff just wouldn&#x27;t come out of my hair best of all I can blow dry my hair completely dry and it is still nice and soft, no more straw and no more weigh down lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed, I usually shed a lot of hair, enough that I was brushing my hair 2-400 strokes a day just to get the loose hair completely out. My ends were also split. Not anymore. Every day, I notice less and less hair coming out and I&#x27;m down to just enough strokes to get the tangles and smooth out my hair. I have less split ends and my hair takes curls ( its normally very straight) very well. I put waves in by braiding when slightly damp, normally they brush out quickly but these stay in even after I wash my hair. So it has a slight wave to it now just from regular styling, I don&#x27;t have to use any extra products save for a little hair spray now and then. So I&#x27;ve just bought a full sized of each product. I like the smell, the texture and the fact that I use 75% less of this product. I just don&#x27;t need as much to get a good lather or to get the conditioned feel throughout my whole head. I&#x27;m looking forward to being able to throw out the tons of bottles of shampoo and conditioner I have ( I used to spend $50-60 even on things like Suave to have enough variety to switch out) and replacing it with this product. It is pricey at $16-$18 for both the shampoo and conditioner compared to other products but for me its an amazing savings.whole head.

            <li> The only thing that I can say about this product is WOW! I&#x27;ve tried many keratin shampoos and conditioners and none have done anything close as to repairing my hair as Pantene&#x27;s Expert Keratin Repair. I wish this came in a liter. My hair is super silky, shiny, manageable and unbroken.It detangles even with the shampoo and easy to comb through. My hair is smooth even after I blow dry and not fried or frizzy. I can go 3 days without washing and it still looks great! No need for dry shampoo. I have told all my coworkers about this line and will be giving as gifts. I hope Pantene continues to make more products like this. How great it would be if they made a children&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> before using this product my hair was a complete mess, totally dry, now, after one week of using it, my hair looks healthier, bright and smooth! totally love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Works really well. My hair feels cleaner after using this shampoo. I have tried the conditioner before and loved it, and that is why I decided to give the shampoo a try as well.</li>
            <li> After using this entire bottle I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, I think it actually made it drier. I would not buy this product again, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I live in Texas and a couple of years ago I decided I wanted to ride a motorcycle. So after I got my license away I went . . . My strawberry blonde, waist length hair suffered greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas has hot, dry, sunny summer weather which isn&#x27;t good on the hair anyway, factor in my pony tail being whipped around by hot, dry winds at 70+ MPH . . . Can you imagine the condition of my hair? Can hair be wind burned? The bottom 6 inches of my hair has looked like a dried out hay stack for over a year. I have tried deep conditioners, products made for ethnic hair and even products recommended to me at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  Nothing worked to restore my hair to my pre-motorcycle days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an example of the great condition my hair was in this was and still is my normal hair care routine. Wash hair at least every other evening, sop all the water out that I can get out of it. I don&#x27;t comb or brush it while wet because it is too damaging, so I go to bed with damp hair. It&#x27;s usually completely dry in the morning. I use a vent brush, start with ends and work my way up. Or because my hair has natural wave sometimes ill just finger comb and go. Once or twice a year I may blow dry and use styling aids. Because I baby my hair I never had to use deep conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on a trip, realized I forgot my current shampoo/conditioner. I dashed int Wally World saw it hadn&#x27;t used it so I grabbed it and went on my merry way. I used the shampoo and conditioner that evening. When I started brushing out my hair the ends felt amazing. I found my &amp;#34;readers&amp;#34; stuck them on my nose and looked at the ends closely. I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends of my hair looked and felt fantastic! The ends actually reflected light again! The straw feeling was also about 80 % gone! The split ends I had looked and felt sooooo much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date I have used the shampoo/conditioner 4 times. Right now my hair feels almost as good as my pre-motorcycle days. My hair is soft silky and shiny again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that I noticed such a difference because my hair was so bad but I don&#x27;t think so. I have tried much more expensive shampoos and conditioners and the only other one that helped somewhat was Aphogee in the pink bottles Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. The white bottles are for damaged hair, which for some reason didn&#x27;t make much difference in my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this is a great product!s.

            <li> I&#x27;m only 34 years old but for some reason my has has become completely dry and liveless in the last 6 months.  I got the shampoo just because I saw a big ad in a magazine and I&#x27;ve learned that usually when a company isn&#x27;t afraid to spend millions on a promotion, then there&#x27;s a reason to it. At the same time, my past experiences with Pantene were mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;After just the first wash my hair felt much softer and the split ends less visible. The more I used it the better.  So I also added the conditioner, and I must say I am absolutely shocked how well this combo works.&lt;br /&gt;fyi, I don&#x27;t have thick hair.  I am blond with thin-medium thick hair, kind of wavy, often hard to manage.  I love this line for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  Has improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo - cleans nicely yet doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dried out.  My hair feels strong and sliky</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great price if you pair with discount and subscription!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the high hopes that its high price would translate into great performance.  I have been looking for a replacement for the old Infusium Repairology shampoo and conditioner which were the best products hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the new Pantene Expert Collection products displayed on an end-cap at Walmart and chose the Keratin formula after reviewing the labels for both it and the age defy and decided that the Keratin formula might meet my haircare needs better and may actually be similar to the old Infusium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy with coarse hair that is cut short. I also use ordinary shampoo and conditioner on my thick, full beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a bland, forgettable fragrance.  The shampoo is an odd caramel color and is gelatinous and does not dispense particularly easily out of the hard bottle.  Performance of the shampoo was completely unremarkable, particularly in light of the product&#x27;s $7.99 price for 10.1 oz.  It does not feel luxurious during use, and it left my hair dry feeling. I was expecting a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; experience but was left completely underwhelmed.  The conditioner comes in the familiar Pantene tube and dispenses easily through a small opening, but again I was left completely disappointed. It did not feel luxurious during use and left my hair feeling dry and unconditioned. There are other regular versions of Pantene that are far superior, including the Aqua Light formula. The Herbal Essences blue moisturizing formula is way, way better, and even some of the Head and Shoulders 2-1 formulas feel great on your hair. I was so frustrated this morning with this product that I actually squeezed the rest of the bottle and tube (about half) down the drain in anger I was so mad. I did not want to have to face that product in the shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the Age Defy formula of this product is any better, but I am not inclined to sink another $16.00 into finding out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;G is constantly reformulating all of its products (including soaps, detergents, etc.) but some its efforts fail. I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away. I am curious to see if anyone else likes this product.ng all of its products (including soaps, detergents, etc.) but some its efforts fail.

            <li> Great stuff and leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I love it so much i hide the bottle from my roommates! sorry charlie!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and lather.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after coloring my hair. I have long thick black hair that I attempted to color blonde. Turned out a beautiful brownish red. Anyways my scalp n hair is dry n I didn&#x27;t want hair to fall out. A close friend told me to deep condition. So I came across this in Walgreens. Thought it would be good to prevent damage.I washed and conditioned under the dryer for 15 min. First thing I noticed while combing in conditioner  was no shedding. I could not believe not a single strand came out. I always shed. No shedding after rinse out. Ends look beautiful.  Also tried split end diffuser. Diffuser seemed to dry out hair. Shampoo n conditioned r great.</li>
            <li> I may have just gotten a defective bottle, but this product did not work for me. I was very hopeful, because my hair is rather dry and frizzy, especially in the winter, but the shampoo itself did not help my hair (certainly not &amp;#34;heal two years&#x27; worth of damage in two minutes&amp;#34; like it claims), and getting it out of the bottle was a pain - if I tried to squeeze any out, it would go out the sides of the cap and down the bottle instead of out the top of the cap like one would expect.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I like the smell, as I always do with Pantene products.</li>
            <li> Pantene hit gold with this product. I have thick frizzy hair this shampoo smoothes it out nicely and is a great price.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo - rinsed out well and left lots of shine.  Had a really good scent.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This works well on my hair that is thick but fine ...no build up ...I pair it with Pro-V Expert Collection AgeDefy Conditioner</li>
            <li> I used the pantene keratin products on my light blonde hair and now my hair is a carmel color. The same thing happened to my sister&#x27;s hair. We both used it for the first time today and can&#x27;t believe how much darker our blonde hair is. I AM VERY UPSET.</li>
