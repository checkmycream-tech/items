            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to clip into your hair as advertised!</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how I have to hunt to make sure my things aren&#x27;t being shipped from China.</li>

            <li>CHEAP!</li>
            <li>but it was more of a hassle to do so...</li>
            <li>i love the hair type &amp; everything</li>
            <li>that it is one weft, easy to use</li>
            <li>Being synthetic makes it easy to use and it keeps its wave.</li>
            <li>So they came fast, which was super nice!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>so it did just fine.</li>
            <li>cheaply made and clips didn&#x27;t work plus no refund</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d look more real than what it did.</li>
            <li>but it got here to me  SUPER FAST.</li>
            <li>I get compliments constantly. :)</li>
            <li>It looks like doll hair, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>, you can straighten them &amp; i am going to try &amp; bleach them since you can straighten them , besides the fact that i got a different color as in the picture , i do love them.</li>
            <li>So pretty looked real.&lt;br /&gt;Helped</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed that this did not work for me...</li>
            <li>only thing is to keep in mind that it can frizz a bit and when you comb it you may pull some hair free.</li>
            <li>it looks toooo much like doll hair.</li>
            <li>This product is more of a cosplay item than something that could actually be worn out daily.</li>
            <li>but instead i was sent a golden blonde</li>
            <li>They were super long</li>
            <li>The actual color is lighter than the picture shown and is more a white blonde color.</li>
            <li>an soft like hair should be!</li>
            <li>color is exactly as shown ( blonde) buy it!!</li>
            <li>They are very thick and add nice volume and length to my hair.</li>
            <li>i could give this a rating of 10 not only looks real  </li>
            <li>I do have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>They arrived early.</li>

            <li> One Fashionable 16&amp;#34; Long By 8&amp;#34; Wide Golden Blonde Curly Wavey Synthetic...</li>
            <li> Looks incredibly fake and tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as lite as it looked in the picture.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all day long, some of my friends</li>
            <li> I curled them with pink sponge rollers and boiling water.</li>
            <li> They do have a little extra shine from the synthetic fibers (like any fake wig) but its barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> the hair is very thin and does&lt;br /&gt;Not cover very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely a less expensive alternate to going to the beauty shop to have it done.</li>
            <li> You will get a thick, quality piece that you can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked when the color is almost white</li>
            <li> Received item and immediately the hair started falling out :(</li>

            <li> The color name is misleading.  The actual color is lighter than the picture shown and is more a white blonde color. Didn&#x27;t do it for me. Wish I had returned it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome they look very real!🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😄😘😃😃 I love this!!! Ghgggggg gggggggg fffgggg ffffjjjjjhh hunks the h h glad I d</li>
            <li> Not nearly as lite as it looked in the picture. Didn&#x27;t even come close to matching my hair. I just threw it away rather than trying to deal with the return policy. I don&#x27;t like how I have to hunt to make sure my things aren&#x27;t being shipped from China. Not everyone has a month to wait for their stuff to come in. Just saying.</li>
            <li> i could give this a rating of 10 not only looks real  an soft like hair should be! color is exactly as shown ( blonde) buy it!!</li>
            <li> cheaply made and clips didn&#x27;t work plus no refund</li>
            <li> I love that it stays curly I was a little shocked when the color is almost white but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> The price is good. It&#x27;s not as easy to clip into your hair as advertised!</li>
            <li> great hair for being synthetic, lasted long.like that it is one weft, easy to use</li>
            <li> Clips in perfectly and gives me the additional length to create the ombre effect. I do have naturally curly hair but people don&#x27;t even realize that they&#x27;re extensions. I get compliments constantly. :)</li>
            <li> i ordered these extensions so i can have longer hair for my boyfriend&#x27;s mom&#x27;s wedding. as soon as i took them out and put them in my hair the curls started to die and wear out, not even worn twice and the curls became unnoticeable. CHEAP! never will i buy these ever again!</li>
            <li> Received item and immediately the hair started falling out :( the hair is very thin and does&lt;br /&gt;Not cover very well.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed that this did not work for me...The color in the picture was nothing like the actual piece I recieved..Would have sent it back but it was more of a hassle to do so...</li>
            <li> This product is more of a cosplay item than something that could actually be worn out daily. It looks like doll hair, so be aware of that. I figured the quality wouldn&#x27;t be great for the cheap price but I only needed it for a photo shoot with my daughter so it did just fine.</li>
            <li> Looks incredibly fake and tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> So they came fast, which was super nice! They were super long so I actually cut them to the length that I would like and they look perfect.</li>
            <li> One Fashionable 16&amp;#34; Long By 8&amp;#34; Wide Golden Blonde Curly Wavey Synthetic... Definitely a less expensive alternate to going to the beauty shop to have it done. Being synthetic makes it easy to use and it keeps its wave. Doing great.</li>
            <li> This is the best and easiest way to enhance your look. You will get a thick, quality piece that you can wear everyday. I get compliments all day long, some of my friends did&#x27;nt even realize I had it in they thought I had colored my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is to keep in mind that it can frizz a bit and when you comb it you may pull some hair free.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and the extensions look just like the picture. They are very thick and add nice volume and length to my hair. They do have a little extra shine from the synthetic fibers (like any fake wig) but its barely noticeable. A really great product for the price :)</li>
            <li> i love the hair type &amp; everything but i was expecting the color of the picture to get here but instead i was sent a golden blonde like it says but i went for the picture , you can straighten them &amp; i am going to try &amp; bleach them since you can straighten them , besides the fact that i got a different color as in the picture , i do love them.</li>
            <li> They arrived early. I curled them with pink sponge rollers and boiling water. They are great. So pretty looked real.&lt;br /&gt;Helped my win prettiest hair at my pageant. Thanks!!! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> it looks toooo much like doll hair. I thought it&#x27;d look more real than what it did. .. but it got here to me  SUPER FAST.</li>
