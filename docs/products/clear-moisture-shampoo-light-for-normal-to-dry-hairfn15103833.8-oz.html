            <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used-</li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo....</li>
            <li>shampoo is so great.  </li>
            <li>with redken..is that good folks give it a try.</li>
            <li>Also, it has an amazing but not overpowering</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo hoping it would help combat some of the frizz and dryness, having used it before (albeit, 6-7 years ago) with nice results.</li>
            <li>The whole line is good, but this particular shampoo works best for me.</li>
            <li>I regret not buying more.  </li>
            <li>I had a coworker at Starbucks whose hair always looked so healthy</li>
            <li>I love the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s lower than any store in my area.</li>
            <li>My hair felt even more straw-like and had an almost crunchy texture to it.</li>
            <li>love redken product..</li>
            <li>This is my SO&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>This shampoo prevents it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner too.</li>
            <li>I am hooked and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>but instead it&#x27;s very light and clean feeling</li>
            <li>I easily get itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t realize it at the time of purchase since i really just liked the smell of that shampoo</li>
            <li>I have used the Redken line almost extensively (those times when i run out and need to find it again quick) for about 5 years with great success.</li>
            <li>specially this one.</li>
            <li>aww man its just stuff fabulous or what.</li>
            <li>and I knew my hair was super clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and the ends are dry from being processed too many times.</li>
            <li>but this one will now be in my regular line up for sure!</li>
            <li>First impression of the shampoo was that it lathers really nice, then i realized that it was actually squeaking in the shower after I rinsed</li>
            <li>its not even funny redken is the number one salon quality hair product maker in the world.</li>
            <li>I used a $90 hair kit from Korea, Nexus, Aveeno, and some other kind of Redken product, but none have helped with the tangles and literal ripping of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can brush it out wet easily and my hair is so soft and smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>he has some dandruff issues and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li>i could feel a change from the first shampoo and by the third day of using the shampoo my hair felt and looked amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so i realized it was that particular type of shampoo and not the brand since prior tot hat purchase i was using the Redken for color treated  hair as well as the Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>A shampoo like Herbal Essences smells like heaven and makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>Hair has become manageable and soft</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like as much as the same prodect bought at the salon, but did the job.</li>
            <li>I have always used the Redken All Soft and realized that my hair was greasy after one day because of the oils.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new standard.</li>
            <li>Crazy cheap for such a huge bottle of Redken.  </li>
            <li>While I have stopped coloring my hair, the damage has yet to finish growing out enough to cut it out completely.</li>
            <li>This one is enough, making hair soft.</li>
            <li>the water here is pretty harsh on my hair, to the point that it gets so brittle that it breaks and falls out.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, fine, blonde and long.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I bought the giant bottles at Ulta when they were on sale for $15 each.  Crazy cheap for such a huge bottle of Redken.  I regret not buying more.  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been difficult for me to find an American hair product that gave me shine, bounce, and softness.  A shampoo like Herbal Essences smells like heaven and makes my hair soft but my hair is dull.  I had a coworker at Starbucks whose hair always looked so healthy so one day I decided to be weird and asked her which shampoo she uses and this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible digital perm in October which left my hair fried and crispy.

            <li> aww man its just stuff fabulous or what. What redken has done for me is what it will do for you. my hair is so moisturized its not even funny redken is the number one salon quality hair product maker in the world. I would have to say number two would be pureology that perhaps Nexxus. nobody&#x27;s f......with redken..is that good folks give it a try.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. The big bottle is a bargain if you&#x27;ve been buying the smaller one. I saved old small bottle, refilled it. Big one is too big for the shower. Arrived on time, packaged well.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used- it&#x27;s my new standard. It keeps my waves in and frizz out. I love the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s lower than any store in my area.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and the ends are dry from being processed too many times. While I have stopped coloring my hair, the damage has yet to finish growing out enough to cut it out completely. I bought this shampoo hoping it would help combat some of the frizz and dryness, having used it before (albeit, 6-7 years ago) with nice results. This time around I was very disappointed. My hair felt even more straw-like and had an almost crunchy texture to it. I actually bought it on a big sale at Ulta, and decided to exchange it for another shampoo. I was very disappointed as I used to love Redken products, but this is the second time&lt;br /&gt;I was sorely disappointed (the first being an All Soft combo I brought overseas two summers ago that left my hair dry and fly-away as well).</li>
            <li> love redken product.. specially this one.</li>
            <li> I have saved a lot of money buying these bottles vs multiple smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> Hair has become manageable and soft</li>
            <li> This is my SO&#x27;s favorite shampoo-- he has some dandruff issues and this really takes care of it. Also, it has an amazing but not overpowering apricot  scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was less expensive-- but it works so well that we keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I was using the Redken in the green bottle which i think is a clarifying shampoo but i didn&#x27;t realize it at the time of purchase since i really just liked the smell of that shampoo but boy was i in trouble. the other shampoo REALLY dried my air out and my hair was so badly damaged it started coming out so i realized it was that particular type of shampoo and not the brand since prior tot hat purchase i was using the Redken for color treated  hair as well as the Smooth Down shampoo and conditioner. Because my hair was so badly damaged i decided to order this one instead of one of the other old reliables and WOW, what a difference! i could feel a change from the first shampoo and by the third day of using the shampoo my hair felt and looked amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I still have the green bottle of shampoo and conditioner which i will use sparingly since i cannot return it but this one will now be in my regular line up for sure!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like as much as the same prodect bought at the salon, but did the job. You get what you pay for with redken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years. I easily get itchy scalp. This shampoo prevents it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. One of these giant bottles lasts me a very long time.</li>
            <li> the water here is pretty harsh on my hair, to the point that it gets so brittle that it breaks and falls out. this is the only shampoo i have found which moisturizes my hair enough to fight the pollutant and hard water build up. Don&#x27;t be fooled when people say all shampoos are the same. I have used the Redken line almost extensively (those times when i run out and need to find it again quick) for about 5 years with great success. The whole line is good, but this particular shampoo works best for me. I don&#x27;t condition since that makes my hair to heavy. This one is enough, making hair soft.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo....</li>
            <li> I have always used the Redken All Soft and realized that my hair was greasy after one day because of the oils. I dreaded switching because you just never know how your hair will react to a different shampoo. My hair is thick, fine, blonde and long. First impression of the shampoo was that it lathers really nice, then i realized that it was actually squeaking in the shower after I rinsed and I knew my hair was super clean. I love the conditioner too. I can brush it out wet easily and my hair is so soft and smooth and shiny. I am hooked and glad I tried it.</li>
