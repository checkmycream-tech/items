            <li>Good purchase , looking for more!!!</li>
            <li>I did find that it works best to rub the stick with your finger to warm up the product and then apply it with your finger to the skin</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to know that it works best with a liquid concealer over it.</li>
            <li>This stick looks bright orange but applies lighter which I think is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The result is that my eye area looks good when I am done</li>
            <li>idk it work good if u can blend good.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but it is not the best product for me.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it work good on my face and under eye</li>
            <li>Nice product .</li>
            <li>Worked great , reasonable price , quick shipping , awesome communications</li>
            <li>Cream ones kind of blend and leave the orange more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the orange concealer I bought a while ago</li>
            <li>If I do find the magic combo, I will update but for now, I am going with 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a lip gloss than a concealer which makes it greasy and not matte.</li>
            <li>Love this product for directions</li>
            <li>This works perfectly for me and brings more warmth into my face where I used to look a little gray-ish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use though because it&#x27;s in a stick form.</li>
            <li>best for dark circles!!</li>
            <li>Not the best product for me at least..</li>
            <li>Enough coverage and does a good job of correcting</li>
            <li>Great for concealing dark spots and circles apply under foundation</li>
            <li>Its good for covering dark undertones</li>
            <li>Made me breakout - typically I have good skin, but this triggered a breakout.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast .</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and experiment to see if I can find a way that this stick and one of my many concealers will work and LAST.</li>
            <li>but sometimes i feel ites still looks pretty orange after adding foundation over it...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, doesn&#x27;t make things worse and I look fine right after applying.</li>
            <li>I put too much on but it worked well.</li>
            <li>I do like the stick type concealers and was hoping to like this but not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda chalky and doesn&#x27;t really correctly much.</li>
            <li>After that I am pretty much out of ideas and will just go on down the line to try and find another, more amenable corrector.</li>
            <li>much better than red lipstick if you are trying that red concealer trend.</li>
            <li>If your just looking to spot conceal dont buy this.im sticking to high end concealers .</li>
            <li>Works okay but not thick enough for coverage (especially for asian brown skin which really has dark color for blemishes) needs to be applied a lot over area for better results.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but it was quite hard to blend into the under eye skin especially if you try to apply it straight from the stick.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to last for more than a few hours before I am back to being a zombie again.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all from yellow to red to blue to extra strength tattoo covering concealers and really nothing lasts so</li>
            <li>I saw a YouTube video about how amazing this orange concealer was and, because I have hereditary dark circles that have gotten worse with age, I HAD to try it.</li>

            <li> this concealer does not last long at all</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say that this concealer helped in the long run.</li>
            <li> I tried to apply it to the back of my hand hoping my body heat would help melt it down and make it easier to apply and blend</li>
            <li> The lipstick dispenser is very convenient but the product itself is very thick and you need to blend it for a while for it to be movable.</li>
            <li> The product is not as expected and does not stay all day.</li>
            <li> BUT my circles creep back after a few hours as always.</li>
            <li> Oranger than expected doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> but not really if u do it right</li>
            <li> I am a medium toned tan color and it did well to cover my dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I use it under my skin-toned concealer to truly get rid of any dark circles since it&#x27;s opposing purple on the color wheel.</li>
            <li> Works well for my dark areas on my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t hide my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but doesn&#x27;t proved 100% coverage of dark spots or sun damage.</li>
            <li> It crease and no easy to blend with other concealers.</li>
            <li> it makes it a little bit easier to blend in.</li>
            <li> A little oily, I have oily skin it doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would have like.</li>
            <li> I just saw a picture of myself and they were plain as day</li>
            <li> I apply it and then apply foundation and my usual concealer over that.</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed because the normal la girl concealers are everything!</li>
            <li> The one I received was very hard and stiff and when I tried to apply it directly under my eye from the tube the pull on my skin was extremely bad and that is one thing I do not need</li>
            <li> Its really greasey , hate it will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this one is that much worse than the others.</li>
            <li> The consistency was all wrong.</li>
            <li> and when i did i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst .</li>

            <li> It covered well.. i have a lot of acne scars</li>
            <li> best for dark circles!!</li>
            <li> The product is not as expected and does not stay all day. It crease and no easy to blend with other concealers.</li>
            <li> Love it work good on my face and under eye</li>

            <li> I think this does the job well. I am a medium toned tan color and it did well to cover my dark undereye circles. I think it&#x27;s important to know that it works best with a liquid concealer over it. Cream ones kind of blend and leave the orange more noticeable.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for me and brings more warmth into my face where I used to look a little gray-ish. It&#x27;s better than the orange concealer I bought a while ago and it goes on where i need it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst . Its really greasey , hate it will never buy this again. If your just looking to spot conceal dont buy this.im sticking to high end concealers .</li>
            <li> Made me breakout - typically I have good skin, but this triggered a breakout.</li>
            <li> this concealer does not last long at all it will be off by mid day</li>
            <li> Worked great , reasonable price , quick shipping , awesome communications</li>
            <li> Too orange and it is not creamy enough. It feels like a crayon. I wish it was different. Not bad, but it is not the best product for me. I have sand skin stone.. Not the best product for me at least..</li>
            <li> Works okay but not thick enough for coverage (especially for asian brown skin which really has dark color for blemishes) needs to be applied a lot over area for better results. It&#x27;s easy to use though because it&#x27;s in a stick form.</li>

This stick looks bright orange but applies lighter which I think is a good thing. I apply it and then apply foundation and my usual concealer over that.

            <li> Took weeks for me to get this and when i did i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I like this concealer. I use it under my skin-toned concealer to truly get rid of any dark circles since it&#x27;s opposing purple on the color wheel.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but it was quite hard to blend into the under eye skin especially if you try to apply it straight from the stick.  I did find that it works best to rub the stick with your finger to warm up the product and then apply it with your finger to the skin it makes it a little bit easier to blend in.</li>
            <li> much better than red lipstick if you are trying that red concealer trend. you can also mix it in with a concealer to make a peachy corrector</li>
            <li> Nice product . Enough coverage and does a good job of correcting</li>
            <li> Good purchase , looking for more!!!</li>
            <li> Works well for my dark areas on my face. I put too much on but it worked well. You must buff or blend this poduct in.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an orange corrector this is orange and not peachy or pinkish, but my problem with this is it&#x27;s blendability, meaning it has none. The one I received was very hard and stiff and when I tried to apply it directly under my eye from the tube the pull on my skin was extremely bad and that is one thing I do not need (I am 50) . I was hoping it would have the consistency of a lipstick but it does not. I do like the stick type concealers and was hoping to like this but not so much. I tried to apply it to the back of my hand hoping my body heat would help melt it down and make it easier to apply and blend but that didn&#x27;t work either. Next I am going to try and mix it with some creme illuminator to see how that works to blend it out. After that I am pretty much out of ideas and will just go on down the line to try and find another, more amenable corrector.</li>
            <li> Love it! I bought this because the nyx Orange concealer was sold out everywhere but now I found this ! Cheaper too . Shipped very fast . Great for concealing dark spots and circles apply under foundation</li>
            <li> Oranger than expected doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t hide my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This was not what I was expecting. The consistency was all wrong. It&#x27;s more like a lip gloss than a concealer which makes it greasy and not matte. I gave it 3 stars because it works but not how I would like.</li>
            <li> Its good for covering dark undertones but sometimes i feel ites still looks pretty orange after adding foundation over it... but not really if u do it right.. idk it work good if u can blend good. I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda chalky and doesn&#x27;t really correctly much. Was really disappointed because the normal la girl concealers are everything!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Love this product for directions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but doesn&#x27;t proved 100% coverage of dark spots or sun damage.</li>
            <li> A little oily, I have oily skin it doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would have like.</li>
