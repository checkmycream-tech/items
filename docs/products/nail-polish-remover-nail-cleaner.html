            <li>They dont stay on to good.</li>
            <li>They are good quality for the price, they just didn&#x27;t work well on my gel.</li>

            <li>Very worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare them to as these were my first time buy, but they work good and do the job.</li>
            <li>and I could easily wrap them myself.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and helpful</li>
            <li>; however, they all stay on and they all work fine.</li>
            <li>This is very worth it.</li>
            <li>It definitely made my life better!</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Other than it, product works good.</li>
            <li>that the ones I had first bought.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Item arrived exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>If you are doing your own manicure at home this is well worth the few cents it costs per hand.</li>
            <li>I just really dislike having to put these on myself</li>
            <li>These are much nicer quality</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than trying to wrangle with a cotton ball and cut foil.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than wrapping a cotton ball in foil.</li>
            <li>They are nice heavy foil</li>
            <li>Nice, thick pads.</li>
            <li>Because the foil is thicker and longer than most, they make a very tight seal.  </li>
            <li>, it gets really hard when you get down to the thumbs, lol.</li>
            <li>Since I only soak off one hand at a time, I add a little more remover and reuse the foils on my other hand.  </li>

            <li> These do not have any remover and are dry--</li>
            <li> Put a little acetone on the pad and wrap around nail/finger, wait a few minutes and the gel polish come right off, with little to no scraping.</li>
            <li> I can never get the thumb tight enough-</li>
            <li> I have no problems soaking off my nail polish in less than 15 minutes, every single time.</li>
            <li> These guys work really well, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Made my acrylic nail removing sessions down from 15 minutes to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> i thought they had dried out..easier just to go to salon</li>
            <li> I usually keep them on for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The foil is thick, too.</li>
            <li> Cutting foil and messing with cotton balls to soak off your gel?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> These are great for removing gel polish...great price too!</li>
            <li> Nice, thick pads. The foil is thick, too. I just really dislike having to put these on myself, it gets really hard when you get down to the thumbs, lol. These are much nicer quality that the ones I had first bought. You do get a lot for the price. The pads hold a lot of solution. I have no problems soaking off my nail polish in less than 15 minutes, every single time. So, that&#x27;s nice. I think I&#x27;ll buy again, unless I find a different way to remove my gels. I like to do both hands at once, but, man some of my wraps look mangled when I&#x27;m done; however, they all stay on and they all work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wrapping my nails in foil, using a glove, using Band Aids. These work! Love it. I surfed the internet while using them and when I took them off all the polish was gone.</li>
            <li> The best way to take off gel polish. They are nice heavy foil and I could easily wrap them myself. Much better value than the brand that comes with the nail polish kits.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use. Put a little acetone on the pad and wrap around nail/finger, wait a few minutes and the gel polish come right off, with little to no scraping. I usually keep them on for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy and helpful</li>
            <li> Super quick shipping and great value! Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These are my fav soak offs.  Because the foil is thicker and longer than most, they make a very tight seal.  Since I only soak off one hand at a time, I add a little more remover and reuse the foils on my other hand.  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Works just as well as the CND brand</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare them with because I haven&#x27;t use any others, so for me, these are great.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to.  Only thing I would change is the size of the foil.  Other than it, product works good.</li>
            <li> Great price and do the job.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Nice idea but I prefer cotton balls and foil. there is just not enough cotton on the pad.</li>
            <li> Still the best I have tried thus far...</li>
            <li> Just okay. They dont stay on to good. Found myself wanting to just use regular foil and cotton balls!</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare them to as these were my first time buy, but they work good and do the job. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These work great! Cutting foil and messing with cotton balls to soak off your gel? You won&#x27;t any longer with these! Makes soaking easier than peeling them off and ruining your nails! I can never get the thumb tight enough- but that&#x27;s on me. These do not have any remover and are dry-- just a heads up as I thought they were pre-moistened.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at a good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a different brand of these at the local store which worked well. I did not have very good luck with these. I use them for removing gel nail polish, and regardless of the amount of time soaking the polish with these, I still couldn&#x27;t get the polish off. They are good quality for the price, they just didn&#x27;t work well on my gel.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than trying to wrangle with a cotton ball and cut foil.  Do the math.  If you are doing your own manicure at home this is well worth the few cents it costs per hand.</li>
            <li> Item arrived exactly as described.  These were easily the best deal for nail wraps that I could find.  I use them with Gelish remover (purchased separately) for my Gelish nails, and they work great!</li>
            <li> From all descriptions ...such as soak off ...etc ...i thought these were pre moistened but now i guess i have to buy remover...instructions are not in english so i am clueless...i thought they had dried out..easier just to go to salon</li>
            <li> These guys work really well, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. So much easier than wrapping a cotton ball in foil.</li>
            <li> This is very worth it. It definitely made my life better! Made my acrylic nail removing sessions down from 15 minutes to 3 minutes. Very worth the money!</li>
