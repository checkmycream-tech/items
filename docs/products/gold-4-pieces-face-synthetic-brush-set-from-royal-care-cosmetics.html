            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the gold ferrule.  </li>
            <li>I use them to apply my eye shadow and concealer and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a lot of hype that synthetic brushes are better for they are antibacterial and</li>
            <li>They are Great quality, super soft, and an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Best choice of brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought including there sister brushes, which are exactly like this one but bigger.</li>
            <li>Yet we all know that one you have been using the best all along, something of less usefulness and blendability will never satisfy</li>
            <li>These are great brushes especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are well packed and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic for blending out concealers.....</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much that I will probably be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist and former MAC artist, I can honestly tell you these brushes are better than most comparable MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes better than the bigger size ones.</li>
            <li>Dense, soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So soft &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The price was good compared to other synthetic makeup brushes and I suppose if someone had never know the blending ability of natural hair brushes, it would work for them just fine.  </li>
            <li>Actually, these brushes are BETTER since MAC doesn&#x27;t have any brushes comparable in shape/size.</li>
            <li>I finally have the opportunity to use these brushes and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I love the flat one for my under eye concealer</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT AND STURDY!</li>
            <li>they are super soft and don&#x27;t shed on your face AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Also very well designed (ergonomically speaking) to be used for the face or the eyes and under eye area.</li>
            <li>I heard that these brushes were very close to Sigma dupes.</li>
            <li>Grips powder, absolute no shedding or hardness of bristles, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very soft and dont shed.</li>
            <li>Its exactly dupe for sigma precision brushes and almost same quality but cheaper</li>
            <li>When I first received these I was worried that the smell would not go away but after cleaning them and even using Elf&#x27;s daily brush spray it helped take the smell away.</li>
            <li>They work bette than these synthetic ones and are more supple and not so hard and not as blendable as natural hair brushes for makeup.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my natural hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>However, the brushes I do have for makeup I have had for over 20 years and as far as antibacterial being advertisin for synthetics, well you can wash your natural hair brushes in soap and dip them or spray them with an antibacterial spray.</li>
            <li>and so far no fall outs.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels soft on your face too.</li>
            <li>I believe that these brushes would be ideal for painting using acrylic paints for they are tough and stiff for use with acrylics but wouldn&#x27;t be recommended for oil</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with the brushes used by professional makeup artists in the future.  </li>
            <li>this ballyhoo advertising for selling a less expensive product with good packaging is just hype.  </li>

            <li> These are GREAT brushes. Dense, soft and easy to clean. Also very well designed (ergonomically speaking) to be used for the face or the eyes and under eye area. I will be buying more of these and giving them as gifts. So glad I took the chance and bought these! Great job Royal Care!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes better than the bigger size ones. The pointed one does hurt though. I love the flat one for my under eye concealer and I used it when I had to conceal a blemish I had. I love it and I would repurchase and buy them as gifts for other people.</li>
            <li> i got this with the kabuki set together and all I can say is, Im a royal care cosmetics fan from now on!</li>

            <li> My sister-In-Law is sometimes made by my brother to service his friends and colleagues.  These brushes do a dynamite job pf prettying her up after he&#x27;s had her chained in the kitchen all day.  Wonderful for applying makeup in a way that makes a woman look more &amp;#34;useful&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> Its exactly dupe for sigma precision brushes and almost same quality but cheaper i got both to compare and i felt that they are the same&lt;br /&gt;I removed 1 star because of the size i thought it will be smaller</li>

            <li> I love these brushes so much that I will probably be purchasing them again. I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on brushes, but I have learned through the years that quality brushes don&#x27;t have to take a chunk out of your pocket.</li>
            <li> It works well and so far no fall outs. I like how it feels soft on your face too. Nice brushes</li>
