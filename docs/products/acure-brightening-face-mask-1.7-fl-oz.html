            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and radiant.</li>
            <li>Please read my full review at beautyapocalypse.</li>
            <li>I Love this Mask and I highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li>As with other Acure products, it came nicely packaged with the appearance of the bottle being appropriate for the product.</li>
            <li>I use this right before going to a big event, a date, or when I simply just want to look my best on a night out with my girls.</li>
            <li>The texture was smooth, unlike a traditional clay mask and it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>My face feels fresh, smoother, and brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of masks and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Ordered this mask after having success with all of Acure&#x27;s other products - and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this mask for a few reasons, like most of Acure&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very gentle yet delivers noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>My skin gets red/rosacea-y with some products and this is most definitely one of those.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried from this brand was the lemon shampoo</li>
            <li>The texture and pigmentation of my skin seems to have benefitted from using this product as I have seen the slight redness in my skin tone diminish and the texture of my skin has become more smooth.</li>
            <li>Only used once thus far, but I really liked the way my skin felt after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>but you just don&#x27;t get that much for the price.  </li>
            <li>It smells like spearment, very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skins really well without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin always looks so much clearer and calmer immediately after I use it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural facial mask product and this product stepped to the plate.  </li>
            <li>Also after using your skin feels clean, smooth, and firm.</li>
            <li>My skin looked great after I first rinsed it off, but for the next few days my sensitive skin was red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>and I like how clean my skin felt without the dry pulling</li>
            <li>Could have been a little bigger, but still nice</li>
            <li>very small quantity, is only good for 3-4 applications</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell as some products do, a little goes a long way, and it turns into a nice foamy lather as you since it off.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it done professionally.</li>
            <li>, I used the mask last night and this morning I see a very noticeable improvement in the look of my skin this morning.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li>This mask washes off much like a facial cleanser- it lathers up</li>
            <li>I feel like it really draws out impurities from my skin without stripping my skin of it&#x27;s essential oils to keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li>There was a mild tightening effect as it dried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and am so glad that their are companies out there that make safe personal hygienic products free of dirty crap that should never come in contact with human skin.</li>
            <li>I love this mask, but I can&#x27;t give such a thin formula 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With only applying a thin layer, I was able to get about 5 masks.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; dry on the cheeks, but oily on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>It is rated 1 by the EWG, but the sensitivities &amp; allergies were a little higher than I like.</li>
            <li>You will look exactly like a green sea monster when you apply this product.</li>
            <li>Once I put it on, I look exactly like the green sea monster like the bottle says.</li>
            <li>It does go a long way - a dime sized amount will cover your whole face and neck, and it lathers like a face wash when wet to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, smells a little like seaweed, is green in color, and foams a little when you wash it off (which I love).</li>

            <li> I have had a lot of dry skin issues and this is helping immensely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely plant based and the ingredients don&#x27;t make you feel like they will give you skin cancer in a few years.</li>
            <li> My skin is broken out right now</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I even use it as a cleanser when I have limited time.  </li>
            <li> I leave this product on for roughly 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> You will probably only get a few masks out of it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have felt with other product.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would try this with other Acure products.  </li>
            <li> recommend this along with other acure products.</li>
            <li> I have now read this on other review sites as well but wish I had before purchasing.</li>
            <li> In that 15 minutes, as the product dries, my face begins to feel tight like it does with other face masks.</li>
            <li> This mask has a nice smell and feel, but about five minutes after applying it my face was burning very badly.  </li>
            <li> You feel your skin tightening, and when you wash off the mask, the tight feeling stays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re bothered by the thinness from this mask like I was, try mixing it with bentonite clay and a little vinegar.</li>
            <li> The directions say to “Apply evenly over the face until you look like a green sea-monster,” and that about covers it.</li>
            <li> I obviously reacted poorly to one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I use this every few days to tighten my pores.</li>
            <li> I put approximately a quarter size amount and apply it to my entire face</li>
            <li> This product comes out very thick with a green pigment to it.</li>
            <li> Also note that the tube is very small.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not terribly impressed.</li>
            <li> I discovered them casually, searching for organic products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural facial mask product and this product stepped to the plate.  Very happy with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I really love the product but you just don&#x27;t get that much for the price.  I wish it was more cost effective but I guess it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it done professionally.</li>
            <li> The mask smells wonderful—very minty and herbally (the mask contains sage and spearmint essential oil).  The directions say to “Apply evenly over the face until you look like a green sea-monster,” and that about covers it. The texture was smooth, unlike a traditional clay mask and it was very easy to apply.  There was a mild tightening effect as it dried. After leaving the mask on for about 10 minutes I rinsed it off and my skin felt like silk!  It also felt very clean without feeling stripped. Please read my full review at beautyapocalypse. com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and I like how clean my skin felt without the dry pulling I have felt with other product.  Also, didn&#x27;t feel the need to put on moisturizer immediately afterwards.  Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Feels very natural, great product. My face is soft and flawless</li>
            <li> Love this mask! It&#x27;s pricey but you can get 5-6 masks per tube. After I use it my skin is brighter and fresher looking. My husband even noticed!</li>
            <li> very small quantity, is only good for 3-4 applications</li>
            <li> Ordered this mask after having success with all of Acure&#x27;s other products - and I loved the results. My skin is broken out right now, I used the mask last night and this morning I see a very noticeable improvement in the look of my skin this morning. I see myself using this item 2-3 times per week!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face. Makes your face feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; dry on the cheeks, but oily on my forehead.  I thought I would try this with other Acure products.  This mask has a nice smell and feel, but about five minutes after applying it my face was burning very badly.  I obviously reacted poorly to one of the ingredients.  It does go a long way - a dime sized amount will cover your whole face and neck, and it lathers like a face wash when wet to rinse off.  I wish I could use it.</li>
            <li> excellent product will purchase and also recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> I use this every few days to tighten my pores. It&#x27;s really awesome! It smells pretty nice and I like how it foams up like a facial cleanser when you go to rinse it off, but when you do rinse it off, you gotta work it a bit. A little goes a long way. I leave it on about 20 minutes. Tonight I left it on for over an hour and had no problems.. I lost track of time, OOPS!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this along with other acure products. They have amazing products and customer service.</li>
            <li> You will look exactly like a green sea monster when you apply this product. As with other Acure products, it came nicely packaged with the appearance of the bottle being appropriate for the product. This product comes out very thick with a green pigment to it. I put approximately a quarter size amount and apply it to my entire face Once I put it on, I look exactly like the green sea monster like the bottle says. I leave this product on for roughly 15 minutes. In that 15 minutes, as the product dries, my face begins to feel tight like it does with other face masks. This mask washes off much like a facial cleanser- it lathers up so you can even use it as a cleanser if you wanted. After I use this product, my skin feels the cleanest it ever has. I feel like it really draws out impurities from my skin without stripping my skin of it&#x27;s essential oils to keep it hydrated. The texture and pigmentation of my skin seems to have benefitted from using this product as I have seen the slight redness in my skin tone diminish and the texture of my skin has become more smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this Mask!  I even use it as a cleanser when I have limited time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely plant based and the ingredients don&#x27;t make you feel like they will give you skin cancer in a few years. I love this stuff and am so glad that their are companies out there that make safe personal hygienic products free of dirty crap that should never come in contact with human skin. This is definitely a staple in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it every week.  I have dry skin and it works for me.  Great moisture for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mask for a few reasons, like most of Acure&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;2. Just take a look at the ingredient list. There is not one controversial item.&lt;br /&gt;3. It smells like spearment, very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;4. It hardens on your face like you&#x27;d expect, no burn.&lt;br /&gt;5. You feel your skin tightening, and when you wash off the mask, the tight feeling stays.&lt;br /&gt;6. It lathers when you rinse it off, so it&#x27;s like an extra cleanse of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my face feels tighter, lighter, cleaner, and fresher than ever.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> I Love this Mask and I highly recommend it for all skin types. It is very gentle yet delivers noticeable difference. I use this right before going to a big event, a date, or when I simply just want to look my best on a night out with my girls. It&#x27;s just a perfect addition for prepping my skin before I apply my makeup. I leave it on for 15-30min then I rinse and lather my face with it. It works like a face cleanser. My face feels fresh, smoother, and brighter.</li>
            <li> I never have time to write many reviews, but I LOVE this mask! I have had a lot of dry skin issues and this is helping immensely. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this works great with mine. I have seen overnight improvements/healing on acne and scaling dryness. (I do use Yonka skin cream after). My mom gave me this and I told her I loved it, even though it kinda smells like ashes? Who knows and who cares if it works (imo)! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS MASK!!!!</li>
            <li> Only used once thus far, but I really liked the way my skin felt after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of masks and this one is by far my favorite. It leaves my skin feeling clean and radiant. Will definitely be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week, I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell as some products do, a little goes a long way, and it turns into a nice foamy lather as you since it off. Also after using your skin feels clean, smooth, and firm.</li>
            <li> This smells nice but I&#x27;m not terribly impressed. My skin gets red/rosacea-y with some products and this is most definitely one of those. I have now read this on other review sites as well but wish I had before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I AM IN LOVE with Acure. I discovered them casually, searching for organic products. I don&#x27;t want to give chemicals to my body anymore.  The first one I tried from this brand was the lemon shampoo and i got amazing results with it, that i decided to try something else from Acure. Each product I try, the more fan I became! Fascinating results, amazing scents, good packages and right prices. Don&#x27;t think it more this mask gives you what it promises.</li>
            <li> nice consistency, great delivery.</li>
            <li> Great scent! I will say that this mask is a bit runnier than I like my masks to be.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re bothered by the thinness from this mask like I was, try mixing it with bentonite clay and a little vinegar. That&#x27;s what I did and I must say my face feels absolutely fabulous and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always impressed when I find face products that don&#x27;t irritate it. I love this mask, but I can&#x27;t give such a thin formula 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t account for its effects on acne or wrinkles, but I can say it left my relatively normal-combination skin feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> I love Acure products and that they don&#x27;t have chemicals and are mostly orgnanic. I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using this mask. It dries within 10-15 minutes without feeling shriveled up like cracked mud. It is soft, smells a little like seaweed, is green in color, and foams a little when you wash it off (which I love). My skin does feel refreshed and tighter after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, and why I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star, is the amount for the price. With only applying a thin layer, I was able to get about 5 masks. I will probably continue to use, just not as often as I would like to.</li>
            <li> All Acure products are amazing. I am in love with this face mask. My face feels great after each use and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Could have been a little bigger, but still nice</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It cleans my skins really well without causing breakouts. My skin always looks so much clearer and calmer immediately after I use it.</li>
            <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
            <li> I liked this product at first.  My skin looked great after I first rinsed it off, but for the next few days my sensitive skin was red and irritated.  I did leave it on longer than I was supposed to, however.  Also note that the tube is very small.  You will probably only get a few masks out of it.  This is not something that I will use again.  It is rated 1 by the EWG, but the sensitivities &amp; allergies were a little higher than I like.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skins appearance since I started using the Acure skincare line.  It is amazing</li>
