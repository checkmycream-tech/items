            <li>I keep the towlettes handy for wiping my hands after filling-up my car&#x27;s gas tank, after workouts, and if I do not have a place to wash my hands before eating a meal.  </li>
            <li>hopefully preventing catching anything on the plane.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nicely moist to do the washup</li>
            <li>They are so handy in the car, boat, and at home.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is grapefruit, it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they use organic grapefruit (lavender, or peppermint) oil for the fragrance as opposed to just &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; which when undefined, may not always be safe or good for you.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the non-natural kind.</li>
            <li>They are great to keep in the fridge in the summer to rub on your neck if you feel hot and grubby.  </li>
            <li>They have been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Lovely smell, not too scented for a man to use if needed.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes and have used them for years.</li>
            <li>They are refreshing and have a lovely aromatherapy smell, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li>Love these hand cleaners.</li>
            <li>Although these wipes are USDA certified organic, they contain Benzalkonium chloride, an antimicrobial found in many hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>I will use up this bag because the scents are nice and the wipes weren&#x27;t cheap, but I won&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li>Love these towelettes, very convenient and refreshing!</li>
            <li>the peppermint is too strong for faces.  </li>
            <li>They smell divine so my children will use them, they&#x27;re not to strong and use benzalkonium chloride to sanitize.</li>
            <li>Light pleasant scents, not harsh.</li>
            <li>Great fragrances, especially the Grapefruit.</li>
            <li>very nice scents, not overpowering - cloth is durable enough to not shred apart, recommend this product&lt;</li>
            <li>I also bring them on the airplane and use it to clean the table tray, and my hands.</li>
            <li>Peppermint is refreshing though may be to strong for children as it has a slight cooling/tingling sensation, though it&#x27;s also good for increasing aleartness</li>
            <li>These are a nice alternative to the medicinal smelling ones we&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;Be ready to pay a higher price for the alternative.</li>
            <li>These are VERY refreshing in fragrance--using them as part of a packaged &amp;#34;party favor&amp;#34; for an Italian dinner I&#x27;m having.</li>
            <li>Very pretty silvery</li>
            <li>The essentail oils do not dry out my skin and the aroma&#x27;s are light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The material is soft and interestingly strtchy</li>
            <li>Great for hot days when you just want to feel a little refreshed, too.</li>
            <li>Great fragrances--a little strong for young kids, and</li>
            <li>Many restaurants are pretty casual about how they clean their tables, and I just use one of these to make sure I feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>Love this towelettes, especially when I am travelling.  </li>
            <li>kids love the scents, which are, I think, essential oils, not fragrance oils.  </li>
            <li>I don;t understand why, but there is no permanent residue, just an immediate takiness when you first use the towelette.</li>
            <li>However, they are large and sturdy--don&#x27;t fall apart or dry out--and really nice to have in my car or purse.</li>
            <li>No strong scent, easy on even the most sensitive skin, dries quickly &amp; kid approved!</li>
            <li>I first purchased these @ Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scents are very strong so if you are super sensitive to smell you may not enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>These are priced better than some of the other brands</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I have used one to wipe a human&#x27;s hands or face, I use it to wipe my dashboard a little, so the car always smells good.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are soft and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>They are thick and soft for cleaning hands or whatever else and very refreshing scents.</li>
            <li>and I love these and cannot find them locally so we order them through Amazon and share with each other.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like peppermint but in this set the peppermint is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, small &amp; light enough to fit in your handbag or even a back pocket!</li>
            <li>I was hoping these wipes had all natural ingredients without antimicrobial/antibacterial ingredients.</li>
            <li>Put some in the fridge during summer to cool down.</li>
            <li>I have purchased these at Whole Foods in the past at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough to wipe your hands, arms, legs &amp; aren&#x27;t soaking wet or drying.</li>
            <li>They do not dry out your hands.</li>

            <li> My grown daughter and I love these and cannot find them locally so we order them through Amazon and share with each other. The scents are wonderful and using one feels like a special treat. They do not dry out your hands. My husband likes them too. They are a must for me when traveling.</li>
            <li> Love these hand wipes - great for travel!</li>
            <li> The towelettes are soft and gentle on the skin. They have been a favorite of mine for many years.</li>
            <li> Love this towelettes, especially when I am travelling.  Great fragrances, especially the Grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Easy to carry and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  Lovely smell, not too scented for a man to use if needed.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  Great fragrances--a little strong for young kids, and the peppermint is too strong for faces.  However, they are large and sturdy--don&#x27;t fall apart or dry out--and really nice to have in my car or purse.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling!!</li>
            <li> Great gift! Recipient loves them.</li>
            <li> I keep the towlettes handy for wiping my hands after filling-up my car&#x27;s gas tank, after workouts, and if I do not have a place to wash my hands before eating a meal.  The essentail oils do not dry out my skin and the aroma&#x27;s are light and refreshing.  I&#x27;ve given the towelettes as hostess gifts as well ~  People like receiving gifts that they can use.</li>
            <li> These wipes smell soooooo good and they don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your skin.  I keep them in my desk at work and in my purse--they&#x27;re too great to be caught somewhere without them.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful have used these towelettes before and will continue to buy them, great fragrances and anti-bacterial too</li>
            <li> All the scents smell so nice! I don&#x27;t usually like peppermint but in this set the peppermint is my favorite. I always have a few in my purse or in the car. I also bring them on the airplane and use it to clean the table tray, and my hands. I use the foil pack it came in and take a few wiffs of it throughout the flight. The essential oils help kill bacteria in the sinuses too... hopefully preventing catching anything on the plane.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue behind but don&#x27;t touch your eyes after using, it will burn.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the non-natural kind. They smell great and have become a necessity in my purse. They even make a great gift!</li>
            <li> So, I Originally found these at TJMaxx, tried them out &amp; LOVED them immediately! They are large enough to wipe your hands, arms, legs &amp; aren&#x27;t soaking wet or drying. Refresh, Renew &amp; Sanitize?! That&#x27;s what I call a win-win! Also, small &amp; light enough to fit in your handbag or even a back pocket! They even come in a durable, resealable bag, great for putting them in your car for trips or just to wipe your hands after pumping gas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. No strong scent, easy on even the most sensitive skin, dries quickly &amp; kid approved! I do not recommend using on ages under 2.5yrs., only b/c I haven&#x27;t used it on that age.</li>
            <li> Love these great smelling wipes. I keep them in my purse and take with me everywhere.  Especailly when traveling on a plane.</li>
            <li> These are VERY refreshing in fragrance--using them as part of a packaged &amp;#34;party favor&amp;#34; for an Italian dinner I&#x27;m having. Very pretty silvery packaging-- and the &amp;#34;Giovanni&amp;#34; brand is sort of fun/.goes with the Italian dinner theme. A little pricey I worth it when you want something a little &amp;#34;nicer than the usual&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use this type of towelettes any time we go out to eat. Many restaurants are pretty casual about how they clean their tables, and I just use one of these to make sure I feel comfortable. I keep them in the car and use them for me, my husband, and kids as we need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids love the scents, which are, I think, essential oils, not fragrance oils.  The smell is very pleasant, even the grapefruit ones. The material is soft and interestingly strtchy so they never tear or shred. They&#x27;re nicely moist to do the washup very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I have used one to wipe a human&#x27;s hands or face, I use it to wipe my dashboard a little, so the car always smells good. Great for hot days when you just want to feel a little refreshed, too. These are priced better than some of the other brands and I like them just as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that they feel quite sticky when you use them. Once the liquid dries on your skin, the sticky feeling goes away—I don;t understand why, but there is no permanent residue, just an immediate takiness when you first use the towelette. I can get by that becasue I like the product otherwise.</li>
            <li> These are a nice alternative to the medicinal smelling ones we&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;Be ready to pay a higher price for the alternative.</li>
            <li> these are so refreshing and are great for travel</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes and have used them for years. I keep some in the car and some in my purse. They are refreshing and have a lovely aromatherapy smell, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li> Light pleasant scents, not harsh. I keep them in my car and use after recycling center.</li>
            <li> very nice scents, not overpowering - cloth is durable enough to not shred apart, recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;like the mixed products to get choices</li>
            <li> They are so handy in the car, boat, and at home. Put some in the fridge during summer to cool down.</li>
            <li> Love these hand cleaners. Carry them in my purse and we always have a stack in our vehicles.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Travel for work and they are amazing instead of carrying oils with you all the time thru security lines!</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes, very convenient and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I first purchased these @ Whole Foods. They cost less here. They smell divine so my children will use them, they&#x27;re not to strong and use benzalkonium chloride to sanitize. I love the fact that they use organic grapefruit (lavender, or peppermint) oil for the fragrance as opposed to just &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; which when undefined, may not always be safe or good for you. They also contain vitamin E &amp; Aloe Vera leaf juice. My favorite scent is grapefruit, it&#x27;s very refreshing. Peppermint is refreshing though may be to strong for children as it has a slight cooling/tingling sensation, though it&#x27;s also good for increasing aleartness plus they&#x27;re great pick me ups for long stressful days. Lavender is known to be calming &amp; soothing, so I tend to use these with the children at night.</li>
            <li> I was thrown off by the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; label, but I guess I just didn&#x27;t do my research well enough before purchasing. Although these wipes are USDA certified organic, they contain Benzalkonium chloride, an antimicrobial found in many hand sanitizers. I was hoping these wipes had all natural ingredients without antimicrobial/antibacterial ingredients. I will use up this bag because the scents are nice and the wipes weren&#x27;t cheap, but I won&#x27;t purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these at Whole Foods in the past at a much higher price.  They are great to keep in the fridge in the summer to rub on your neck if you feel hot and grubby.  They work well for flip flop feet.  Ladies, you know what I mean.  lol  I always keep them in my purse.  The scents are very strong so if you are super sensitive to smell you may not enjoy them.  They are thick and soft for cleaning hands or whatever else and very refreshing scents.</li>
