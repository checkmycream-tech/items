            <li>best pit stick I have used.  </li>
            <li>But it works great for me!</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They were happy I found this online.</li>
            <li>We never used the Sports one before, but it has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells good.  </li>
            <li>(I guess it depends on who you listen to, kind of like republicans and democrats).  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say</li>
            <li>Totally effective and pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>Right Guard deodorant is very effective, lasts all day, has a good cologne smell, and does not sting.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant has a great sent that resembles a mild cologne sent that is not at all overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works perfectly for odor control (as good as or better than any antiperspirant I have used) while at the same time letting my body sweat like it was designed to do.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s one of the most cheap and good deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>Product is in great shape and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>It smells nice in the container, applies easily and with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Works well, smells great, but stains certain fabric.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many anti perspirant deodorant none of them worked.</li>
            <li>AND at a better price.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant holds up to all of that sweating just fine.</li>
            <li>My old Speedstick deodorant sounds really good right about now.</li>
            <li>take some Icy Hot, rub it really good in your pits, and BOOM!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular Right Guard Sport deodorants and they are good, probably 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>But I do think the body sweats for a reason, that lots of this sweat happens in your armpits, and that chemically blocking these pores may not in the long term be good for the machinery.  </li>
            <li>the right guard  deodorant is the best on the market not the gel but the regular one with the stripe in the middle</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, it&#x27;s really smell (everybody likes) and it is very durable</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s your AC unit right there.</li>
            <li>Way too much menthol in this product!</li>
            <li>Good scent and better staying power than any other plain deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>Now if you are one of those people who sweats profusely and can drench through an undershirt, shirt, sweater and jacket within 5 minutes, a straight deodorant may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>My Dad and brother really like it.</li>
            <li>Compare the UPC and label wording carefully to make sure you&#x27;re using the product you think you are.</li>
            <li>I realized it stained all my new dress shirts!</li>
            <li>that the packaging and name are very similar to many other Right Guard products that are both deodorants and anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the right deodorant.</li>
            <li>I do not like antiperspirant deodorants, have tried many, and they (a) are not very effective and/or</li>
            <li>Like I posted before, this review is for the clear stick, so I can&#x27;t speak for the solid, but coming from a guy who uses menthol products like Gold Bond and menthol based shower gels to keep me cool in the summer months, this one is just over the top ridiculous and unwearable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and last a full day of activities, such as running or playing playing basketball.</li>
            <li>This defense 5 is 3oz instead of its predecessor 2.8oz and its less in price, so its a better deal than the last time we bought.</li>
            <li>... I have tried many deodorants, and this is the one that keeps me the least stinky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to buy my third 6 pack of the Right Guard Total Defense 5 Power Deodorant for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I thought I was purchasing the solid white type deodorant, but this is the kinda opaque blue solid stick...which works just fine.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer here complained that the menthol smell is too strong, but I disagree.  </li>
            <li>, I mean, you really don&#x27;t need that much menthol to get a cooling effect, instead, Dial gave this clear stick user an \\&quot;oven effect\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Odor, at least in this case, is caused by bacteria that plain soap and water do not seem to take care of and the anti-bacterial in this works great and keeps the odor down all day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Some of the bad reviews for this product are likely for other products -- this is not a clear stick, does not in my experience stain clothes, does not burn on application or contain menthol.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why the Dial co. went so overboard with the concentration of this product</li>
            <li> I find this deodorant has one big issue, which is that it&#x27;s difficult to wash off in the shower even with vigorous soap scrubbing.</li>
            <li> No more antiperspirants for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used to buy these at our local Wal-Mart, but it has become increasingly difficult to find it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are making it anymore.</li>

            <li> Problem is that it fails after about 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> I never took it seriously until I started getting painful swelling in my armpits.  </li>
            <li> the lady at the counter thought I was crazy.</li>
            <li> But I have always heard about how bad anti-perspirants are for you, because they contain aluminum.  </li>
            <li> I have no clue whether the aluminum in antiperspirant is goes or bad</li>

            <li> best pit stick I have used.  My only gripe is that I thought I was purchasing the solid white type deodorant, but this is the kinda opaque blue solid stick...which works just fine.</li>
            <li> Bought the clear stick at Wally World the other day and HATED it! One word...burns! Way too much menthol in this product! I&#x27;m not blowing smoke either, I have no beef with the Dial company other than this product sucking royalty. If you wanna know about the \\&quot;air conditioning effect\\&quot; let me tell you...take some Icy Hot, rub it really good in your pits, and BOOM! There&#x27;s your AC unit right there. Like I posted before, this review is for the clear stick, so I can&#x27;t speak for the solid, but coming from a guy who uses menthol products like Gold Bond and menthol based shower gels to keep me cool in the summer months, this one is just over the top ridiculous and unwearable in my opinion. I just don&#x27;t understand why the Dial co. went so overboard with the concentration of this product, I mean, you really don&#x27;t need that much menthol to get a cooling effect, instead, Dial gave this clear stick user an \\&quot;oven effect\\&quot;. My old Speedstick deodorant sounds really good right about now. Save your money folks, this one&#x27;s not worth it. I gave my stick away to one of the pin heads who works in my dept. Boy, I feel sorry for his pits tommarow morning, lol.....sucker.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a great sent that resembles a mild cologne sent that is not at all overpowering.  It goes on clear and last a full day of activities, such as running or playing playing basketball.</li>
            <li> I find this deodorant has one big issue, which is that it&#x27;s difficult to wash off in the shower even with vigorous soap scrubbing. A tacky film is left on the skin that odorous bacteria seems to reside in, meaning that after a few hours this deodorant completely loses effectiveness. Definitely have to try something else.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat an anti-perspirant when it comes to avoiding stink.  But I have always heard about how bad anti-perspirants are for you, because they contain aluminum.  I never took it seriously until I started getting painful swelling in my armpits.  As soon as I switched to regular deodorant (not an antiperspirant), the swelling went away.  I tried going back to antiperspirants, because deodorants don&#x27;t work as well, but the swelling came back.  No more antiperspirants for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I have tried many deodorants, and this is the one that keeps me the least stinky.  I highly recommend it.  It smells good.  Another reviewer here complained that the menthol smell is too strong, but I disagree.  I like it.  I am active and excercise quite a bit.  This deodorant holds up to all of that sweating just fine.</li>
            <li> Am not a big fan of antiperspirant.  I have no clue whether the aluminum in antiperspirant is goes or bad (I guess it depends on who you listen to, kind of like republicans and democrats).  But I do think the body sweats for a reason, that lots of this sweat happens in your armpits, and that chemically blocking these pores may not in the long term be good for the machinery.  This deodorant works perfectly for odor control (as good as or better than any antiperspirant I have used) while at the same time letting my body sweat like it was designed to do.  Now if you are one of those people who sweats profusely and can drench through an undershirt, shirt, sweater and jacket within 5 minutes, a straight deodorant may not be for you.  But it works great for me!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I use Right Guard products exclusively and this gel is useless for me.  It smells nice in the container, applies easily and with no skin irritation.  Problem is that it fails after about 5 hours.  I work at a desk, indoors in an air conditioned office.  By mid-afternoon I am wondering if I forgot to apply deodorant.</li>
            <li> I litterally went to a drug store bought every deodorant on the shelves including women deodorant  I have some pics to prove some of the purchases. the lady at the counter thought I was crazy. I&#x27;ve tried many many anti perspirant deodorant none of them worked. I&#x27;ve tried sprays and even  the so call prescription strength ones they are a waste of time and money  I can honestly say the right guard  deodorant is the best on the market not the gel but the regular one with the stripe in the middle probably worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I use to use it until they switch the packagingand  confused  the heck out of me.  After 2 years of ruining expensive shirts and being lazy I finally found the right deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, it&#x27;s really smell (everybody likes) and it is very durable, it&#x27;s one of the most cheap and good deodorant on the market. I recomend for who doesn&#x27;t know it.</li>
            <li> Totally effective and pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Solid 24 hour protection.</li>
            <li> Stay away from it!!!!!! This thing must be loaded with alcohol. It stings when you apply and when laundry time arrived I realized it stained all my new dress shirts!</li>
            <li> We used to buy these at our local Wal-Mart, but it has become increasingly difficult to find it.  For some reason, every time I go to buy some, they are always out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try Amazon, which always seems to have everything I can&#x27;t find elsewhere AND at a better price.  I bought a multi-pack of these, so they should last a while.</li>
            <li> If by \\&quot;air conditioning\\&quot; you mean chemcial burning sensation then this product is for you. What were these people thinking?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product in local stores. My Dad and brother really like it. They were happy I found this online.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Good scent and better staying power than any other plain deodorant on the market. I can no longer find it in local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the packaging and name are very similar to many other Right Guard products that are both deodorants and anti-perspirants. Some of the bad reviews for this product are likely for other products -- this is not a clear stick, does not in my experience stain clothes, does not burn on application or contain menthol. Compare the UPC and label wording carefully to make sure you&#x27;re using the product you think you are.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant without antiperspirant in it, which i hate and do not need,  that i can find that smells good to me and on me.  I am upset because i can not find it in the stores anymore! It is not too overpowering and my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy my third 6 pack of the Right Guard Total Defense 5 Power Deodorant for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Anti-perspirant causes my armpits to get irritated which can get painful&lt;br /&gt;2) Odor, at least in this case, is caused by bacteria that plain soap and water do not seem to take care of and the anti-bacterial in this works great and keeps the odor down all day.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in my area. I&#x27;m not sure if they are making it anymore. Product is in great shape and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells great, but stains certain fabric. My teen wore a royal blue cotton t-shirt to school and after a couple hours, his pits were bleached!  Kinda embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I do not like antiperspirant deodorants, have tried many, and they (a) are not very effective and/or (b) they leave a bunch of white residue.  Also, I&#x27;ve found other brands to sting or simply not be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Right Guard deodorant is very effective, lasts all day, has a good cologne smell, and does not sting.  I&#x27;ve used the regular Right Guard Sport deodorants and they are good, probably 4 stars.  Then they had the \\&quot;power stripe\\&quot; version, probably 4.5 stars.  This &#x27;newer&#x27; one of theirs is definitely 5 stars.  I recently bought another 6 pack of them.  (I keep 1 in the office, 1 in gym bag, 1 in swim bag, 1 in travel bag, and at least 1 at home of course.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs deodorant.  I definitely recommend giving this one a try.</li>
            <li> We never used the Sports one before, but it has a pleasant fragrance. This defense 5 is 3oz instead of its predecessor 2.8oz and its less in price, so its a better deal than the last time we bought.</li>
