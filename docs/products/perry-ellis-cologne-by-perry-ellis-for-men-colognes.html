            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of this cologne for years and was really happy to find out that not only was it available on amazon, but at a really good price.  </li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>sometimes the smell is so fresh and not too strong</li>
            <li>Its my special moment cologne when i want to be remembered.  </li>
            <li>This is his favorite, and he is very picky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a senior in high school and the ladies love it...</li>
            <li>Newer is Better, this is the new reformulated Perry Ellis Cologne.    </li>
            <li>Did not smell exactly as i remembered the original to smell on my husband.</li>
            <li>Aww</li>
            <li>I want this cologne to sell because it is really worth it.</li>
            <li>I also get headaches from many, many other colognes, even now Polo which I wore in my youth, but now gives me headaches.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>This cologne is very good smell last a long time and everyone askes me what I am whereing</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he tried it on his arm ,he had to washed it right away .</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>Smelled this one day in a magazine tester and it hit the right note, so I bought some.</li>
            <li>Not really musty more sweet!</li>
            <li>, my girlfriend liked the smell it leaves me in the body.&lt;br /&gt;the scent lasts for a long time</li>
            <li>A safe bet for anyone because although the smell is not super unique, but it is unique in that a manufacturer makes something that can be worn to work AND in the evening.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I must also say that I am a big fan of most Perry Ellis Colognes.</li>
            <li>When the last of my bottle ran out, I went to many stores to be told that it must be discontinued.</li>
            <li>It also helps if you&#x27;re a respectful gentleman, that still practice holding doors open for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne a few years ago and the ladies loved it.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why: most Perry colognes smell great, are affordable, they sell have fragrances for all occasions &amp; climates, last are long time, they are not as well known as other designer brands.    </li>
            <li>it last all day and it settles on your clothes even after washing it has an apple/ wood smell its hard to describe because its soo unique and its a great deal</li>
            <li>Women love this stuff, I wore a little of It on my body before going to work, and the women were suddenly very interested in me.</li>
            <li>This is the classic scent!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long, but for the price is clean spirited.  </li>
            <li>Soon I will order my light blue, amazon!</li>
            <li>It was priced very well vs Macy&#x27;s, and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>Very Neutral on odor.  </li>
            <li>I first must say that I am primarily concerned with how a cologne smells and how long it lasts, as opposed to how the bottle looks or what the brand name is.</li>
            <li>If u go to a wedding, a date or any other event where u woild need to hug or jave a very close contact with people, it will leave a memorable impression.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells unique.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting, has a very masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power the senses and yet anyone who gets close enough knows you smell great.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and does not smell like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the Perry Ellis colognes I mentioned.    </li>
            <li>I take the precaution of keeping the bottle inside the original box, so direct sunlight won&#x27;t weaken, or speed up the cologne&#x27;s degradation If that&#x27;s even possible.</li>
            <li>It is dominant, but intimate and sensitive, too.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something new to wear and found this.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new scent and don&#x27;t like anything overbearing</li>
            <li>I like to try a new scent sometimes.  </li>
            <li>,I wear it mixed with light blue from dulce gabana ,</li>
            <li>I never saw the product but was told it had a nice subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>This product was considered a bargain to me for the price I paid, It does not take a lot, and It smells very masculine.</li>
            <li>it is a little on the strong side</li>
            <li>not easy to find an then not easy to find for a great price as this.  </li>
            <li>Those who love this classic fragrance get it now before it is too late.</li>
            <li>I usually buy my cologne at the local mall specialty store--the one that sells only fragrances by the counter help who manages to make good recommendations.  </li>
            <li>I own Perry 360 Black &amp; 360 White, (both for evening or colder weather) along with 360 Red &amp; Perry Ellis Reserve (for daytime/casual and warmer weather).</li>
            <li>Keeping the 5 stars for the old scent, otherwise would drop to 1 star for deceptive advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has a natural scent that flatters your body..</li>
            <li>This is that cologne that say it all from being professional at work to sharing a moment of passion when u with you girl</li>
            <li>They were acting very flirtatious, and making eyes at me during my work day.</li>
            <li>If you want the old scent, buy the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>would buy again from this seller because the product came quicker than I expected, and was very affordable.</li>
            <li>It is a clean scent with notes that are alluring but not trying too hard to be a lady killer</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first that it might be a knockoff that lasts a few minutes, but was pleasantly surprised that it was the real deal and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> like the way it lingers and lasts a longer time than expected....</li>
            <li> but it works well with his natural body smell (I hope you know what I mean by that).</li>
            <li> It is subtly present, and gently complex.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this Perry Ellis for casual, social engagements with similar others.</li>
            <li> This is not authentic Perry Ellis perfumes.</li>
            <li> The smell stays with you for not more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what some others say on this post about it being fake, to me it smells, looks and lasts as long as it always has.</li>
            <li> I put on a small amount in the morning, covering my wrists, and a little bit on my neck behind my ears.</li>
            <li> He said it was the worst cologne he had ever smelled, and in my opinion he was right.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy</li>

Here&#x27;s why: most Perry colognes smell great, are affordable, they sell have fragrances for all occasions &amp; climates, last are long time, they are not as well known as other designer brands.    I own Perry 360 Black &amp; 360 White, (both for evening or colder weather) along with 360 Red &amp; Perry Ellis Reserve (for daytime/casual and warmer weather). I also just bought this \\&quot;New\\&quot; Perry Ellis. I think this one is smack dab in the middle. It is perfect for anytime because it has citrus and fresh scents with underlying warm inviting notes. It&#x27;s versatility is amazing and if I had to pick one cologne as a staple this would be it. Wear this one anytime and anywhere. Trust me, buy it. I want this cologne to sell because it is really worth it. A safe bet for anyone because although the smell is not super unique, but it is unique in that a manufacturer makes something that can be worn to work AND in the evening. It evolves like a cologne should. It is a clean scent with notes that are alluring but not trying too hard to be a lady killer (but I bet it is). Will appeal to the masses and is a scent that you will love, along with the ladies.    I highly recommend all the Perry Ellis colognes I mentioned.    cologne, EDT, 3.4oz, Perry Ellis 360 Degrees, fragrance, Ounces, for men, man,eau de toilette</li>
            <li> 6/6/17 Update...I bought the 5oz and it is not the &amp;#34;relaunch&amp;#34;. It smells different and gave me a headache. If you want the old scent, buy the smaller bottle. Keeping the 5 stars for the old scent, otherwise would drop to 1 star for deceptive advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon! I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and to my surprise it is not sold in stores any more. When the last of my bottle ran out, I went to many stores to be told that it must be discontinued. Not sure what some others say on this post about it being fake, to me it smells, looks and lasts as long as it always has. Again, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for over 10 years, so I should know. If you are looking for a new scent and don&#x27;t like anything overbearing then I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try. I also get headaches from many, many other colognes, even now Polo which I wore in my youth, but now gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very good smell last a long time and everyone askes me what I am whereing , that is what you want them women to do !!</li>
            <li> not easy to find an then not easy to find for a great price as this.  Those who love this classic fragrance get it now before it is too late.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he tried it on his arm ,he had to washed it right away . He said it was the worst cologne he had ever smelled, and in my opinion he was right. Had to throw it away .</li>
            <li> You smell good....is what they say...... I&#x27;m a girl,I wear it mixed with light blue from dulce gabana , oh my, it&#x27;s an awesome smell. I love it. Soon I will order my light blue, amazon!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful he loves it even I wear it sometimes the smell is so fresh and not too strong it&#x27;s just right #sexy</li>
            <li> be sure to try this- it has a natural scent that flatters your body..&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it lingers and lasts a longer time than expected....</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for years. I still love it, ladies do to.</li>
            <li> This is that cologne that say it all from being professional at work to sharing a moment of passion when u with you girl I think this gets anyone women in the mood, when u cuddle with her.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Smells great, came quickly</li>
            <li> Very good product for Perry Ellis, my girlfriend liked the smell it leaves me in the body.&lt;br /&gt;the scent lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells fantastic and not overpowering; simply pleasant. Can be worn anytime, day or night. You WILL receive compliments!</li>
            <li> Great smell and perfect price!!!!  Women love the smell on me and would recommend for any man.  Also, was easy transcation and arrived within 7days</li>
            <li> This product was considered a bargain to me for the price I paid, It does not take a lot, and It smells very masculine. I put on a small amount in the morning, covering my wrists, and a little bit on my neck behind my ears. It lasts all day long and does not smell like cheap cologne. Women love this stuff, I wore a little of It on my body before going to work, and the women were suddenly very interested in me. They were acting very flirtatious, and making eyes at me during my work day. It also helps if you&#x27;re a respectful gentleman, that still practice holding doors open for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again from this seller because the product came quicker than I expected, and was very affordable. They also sent a coupon in the mailing package, that gives customers a 10% discount on their next purchase. I love the beautiful bottle, and the box. I take the precaution of keeping the bottle inside the original box, so direct sunlight won&#x27;t weaken, or speed up the cologne&#x27;s degradation If that&#x27;s even possible.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> have a great scent for daily use and always used perry ellis and this smell is great</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Signature ,but close....</li>
            <li> Smelled this one day in a magazine tester and it hit the right note, so I bought some. I&#x27;ve used it for over 6 months now and am still happy with the purchase. It definitely smells unique. Clean, not too overpowering, enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Authentic product. Great deal. Wife loves the scent too.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne a few years ago and the ladies loved it. Since then I&#x27;ve gone through 3 bottles. It is long lasting, has a very masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power the senses and yet anyone who gets close enough knows you smell great.</li>
            <li> This is the classic scent! I ordered this for my grandson and it was a big hit for Christmas. This is his favorite, and he is very picky.</li>
            <li> great price and my wife loves this one.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my cologne at the local mall specialty store--the one that sells only fragrances by the counter help who manages to make good recommendations.  I like to try a new scent sometimes.  However, this time I already knew what I wanted from stopping at a department store shelf while making my way into the mall.  While this cologne isn&#x27;t business masculinity, it is indeed male.  It is dominant, but intimate and sensitive, too.  The depth, color, and sweetness could be perfume.  It is subtly present, and gently complex.  I recommend this Perry Ellis for casual, social engagements with similar others.</li>
            <li> This is not authentic Perry Ellis perfumes.Smells like very cheap perfumes. Don&#x27;t recommend. Odor is not the same as I had on my tester from the magazine.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to get this.  Its my special moment cologne when i want to be remembered.  If u go to a wedding, a date or any other event where u woild need to hug or jave a very close contact with people, it will leave a memorable impression.</li>
            <li> love this scent, wonder why Perry Ellis didn&#x27;t advertise the product alot more. I seem to only find it online.</li>
            <li> The one i had before had longevity. This one is like spraying water to your body. The smell stays with you for not more than 5 minutes. I believe i received a counterfeit product. Please do not buy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it smells great and I get compliments from ladies everytime I wear it.. It&#x27;s the panty dropper</li>
            <li> Was looking for the fragrance from the &#x27;80s. This was not it, but found it was nice smelling and not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> It was priced very well vs Macy&#x27;s, and arrived on time.  I never saw the product but was told it had a nice subtle scent.  Not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very Neutral on odor.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, but for the price is clean spirited.  Very nice container?  Not really musty more sweet!</li>
            <li> Did not smell exactly as i remembered the original to smell on my husband.Probably would not purchase again altho is up to husband who seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I winged this purchase because I hadn&#x27;t smelled it, and I must tell you I love love love it. Call me crazy but I sprayed it on myself to test for my husband and I can&#x27;t wait till he showers and put it on YES!!!</li>
            <li> the material of the lotion is excellent, 100% finished, it is best to be at a good price, I recommend these lotion are great and do not weigh anything, are super comfortable.</li>
            <li> Wow this scent has to be one of the best smelling ever..it last all day and it settles on your clothes even after washing it has an apple/ wood smell its hard to describe because its soo unique and its a great deal i bought this cologne off a catalog and it was 75 dollars.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this product. my boyfriend loved it. it was affordable. it smelled great. and it has lasted forever. it is a little on the strong side but it works well with his natural body smell (I hope you know what I mean by that).</li>
