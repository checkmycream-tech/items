            <li>Color matches perfectly!!!!</li>
            <li>Great tool to cover those roots in between salon visits!</li>
            <li>That you amazon your the best .</li>
            <li>I need to dampen product for best results.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>very good.</li>
            <li>I was incredibly dissapointed in the product.  </li>
            <li>great product for used between hair colorings.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would be &#x27;great&#x27;</li>
            <li>Great solution until you can get to the salon.</li>
            <li>Good color match, work very nice</li>
            <li>This product looked like it worked SO good</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of honey color with blond highlights.</li>
            <li>Handy to have this gem.  </li>
            <li>What a great product - it covers my gray and no one is the wiser - it saved me so much time and money on touch up at the salon !!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better if you are attempting to darken your roots or cover gray, but I would not recommend it if your goal is to add a lighter tone to your hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Blonde color blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was &#x27;ok&#x27; - in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>I am able to go longer without bleaching my hair.</li>
            <li>Purchased for a friend, arrive in good time and as far as I know she was very pleased</li>
            <li>This week the experiment will be to dampen the great brush to see if I can delay my root touch up since I live in fear that I will become allergic to all hair color products.</li>
            <li>The combo works great and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>My colorist suggested light brown Color</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t cover as well as light brown</li>
            <li>Great in between and only takes a minute to apply.</li>
            <li>Just wish there was a lighter brown because I bought the light brown</li>
            <li>WOW is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It was worth nothing.</li>
            <li>I had to buy two colors to make the right match for my hair.</li>
            <li>this is a fabulous product because it is so simple to use and easy to apply with enclosed brush.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper!</li>
            <li>Since I have highlights, she also recommended I add streaks of the Color WOW blond after applying the light brown.</li>
            <li>yep, it does exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
            <li>Really look forward to longer intervals between colors!</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and is a great improvent over the dark or gray roots.</li>
            <li>It really works and you cannot tell the you have put it on.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really cover the gray roots.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li>but I am not convinced (based on my test run) that it is going to conceal the roots very well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing, absolutely nothing adhered to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really like this root cover up.  </li>
            <li>This gave my grown out dark roots a better appearance than without.  </li>
            <li>I still have plenty of hair, but my white roots are super shiny.</li>
            <li>Decent coverage for roots.</li>
            <li>I think it was a decent buy.</li>
            <li>Did not give good coverage and the very minimal cover I did get had flecks of glitter in it making it obvious that the cover up was present.</li>
            <li>It was not a complete cover-up but helpful and worth it to extend my time between highlights.</li>
            <li>I would like to have Wow in Auburn.</li>
            <li>I have been using it in between colorings and it does take the edge off of the contracts between my natural hair color and my highlights.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy BUT pull the hair sections tight against your scalp, load, load, load the smaller brush and stiple the product onto your roots.  </li>
            <li>I will be traveling for a couple of months and am going to be dealing with &#x27;some major roots&#x27; within a month.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so much platinum blonde (which has a tint of yellow), as it is white.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde but on the darker side.</li>
            <li>Color looks natural and lasts until next shampoo.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my gray :o</li>
            <li>Makes them blend in a bit better than without, but sadly not as beautifully as demonstrated.</li>
            <li>WOW Root Coverup to use as grey starts showing.</li>
            <li>The light brown is just a little too dark.</li>

            <li> WOW Root Coverup to use as grey starts showing.</li>
            <li> The light brown is just a little too dark.</li>
            <li> Works well to cover grey but powder eye shadow can do as good a job &amp; is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I went blonde to delay the inevitable grey streak.  </li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m 80 % grey and my natural hair color is a dark brown.  </li>
            <li> This products buys me time and keeps me from that embarrassing grey streak.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not cover grey.</li>
            <li> And, it helps to cover my grey!</li>
            <li> I tried it dry.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a darker shade of blonde and this product was not effective in lightening my roots.  </li>
            <li> Takes To long for dark roots blonde hair to make a difference</li>
            <li> Ordered the Blonde and it is still a bit too dark to match the hightlights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply this product - you should not be afraid to get quite a bit on the brush.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend for any one with dirty blonde, light brown,  medium brown, or dark brown hair to use on their highlights/dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other coverups and Color</li>
            <li> Maybe a darker color would work better -- disappointed</li>
            <li> ...however, matching your hair color exactly is still difficult.</li>
            <li> and I have at least 3/4 left.</li>
            <li> Do not panic when you see so little of the product.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> However, it STILL SUCKS to have have to dye my hair every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like thick eye shadow, and I&#x27;ve learned the trick is to get a lot on the brush.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Sadly - it does come off when you shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> Totally worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff! My highlights tend to fade before my next salon appt. I use this to bring the color out again! And, it helps to cover my grey! I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> great product for used between hair colorings. It is simple to use and is a great improvent over the dark or gray roots.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipper! Thanx!</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with this product I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I had to buy two colors to make the right match for my hair.</li>
            <li> This root cover up did not work as well as the youtube videos show.  I was incredibly dissapointed in the product.  Also, the color has no warmth too it.  It isn&#x27;t so much platinum blonde (which has a tint of yellow), as it is white.  I would not reccomend for any one with dirty blonde, light brown,  medium brown, or dark brown hair to use on their highlights/dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope it would assist with covering my roots between highlights.  Unfortunately, I am disappointed with the results.  My natural hair color is a darker shade of blonde and this product was not effective in lightening my roots.  Perhaps it works better if you are attempting to darken your roots or cover gray, but I would not recommend it if your goal is to add a lighter tone to your hair.</li>
            <li> It really works and you cannot tell the you have put it on. It stays in until you wash your hair. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well to cover grey but powder eye shadow can do as good a job &amp; is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.  Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but on the darker side. I get regular highlights biyearly. In between touch ups, I get regrowth that is darker then my highlights; this product didn&#x27;t work for my regrowth and baby powder is still my best friend.</li>
            <li> great coverage and waterproof! Color matches perfectly!!!!</li>
            <li> Takes To long for dark roots blonde hair to make a difference</li>
            <li> Did not give good coverage and the very minimal cover I did get had flecks of glitter in it making it obvious that the cover up was present. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of honey color with blond highlights. My colorist suggested light brown Color WOW Root Coverup to use as grey starts showing. Since I have highlights, she also recommended I add streaks of the Color WOW blond after applying the light brown. It&#x27;s easy to apply this product - you should not be afraid to get quite a bit on the brush. The combo works great and looks very natural. I&#x27;ve tried other coverups and Color WOW is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Ulta for 29.99.  I buy Aveda 8n and 7n color from Amazon. This blond powder covers my 7n roots well with no allergic reactions to date.  I am experimenting with just a bit of it as a final step to fill in my dreaded thinning eyebrows. I still have plenty of hair, but my white roots are super shiny. This week the experiment will be to dampen the great brush to see if I can delay my root touch up since I live in fear that I will become allergic to all hair color products. I can no longer tolerate drugstore brands. The case is slim enough that it travels everywhere I take my essential make up items. I will soon buy the platinum to see if it will help avoid yearly highlight salon touch ups also. Do not panic when you see so little of the product. I have used mine for over , weekly ,a year and I have at least 3/4 left.</li>
            <li> yep, it does exactly what it says on the tin. covers up the roots and for blond too. very good.</li>
            <li> This product looked like it worked SO good but I can&#x27;t even get it to adhere to my hair.  I will have to send it back . . .</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous product because it is so simple to use and easy to apply with enclosed brush. Livesup to its advertisement in every way! Color looks natural and lasts until next shampoo. Covered my gray in that last week before next salon appointment</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really cover the gray roots.  Maybe a darker color would work better -- disappointed</li>
            <li> This takes a LOT of patience. It&#x27;s not easy to apply. I am constantly going over the same spot. It doesn&#x27;t want to stick to my hair. I am still trying but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> ...however, matching your hair color exactly is still difficult. Ordered the Blonde and it is still a bit too dark to match the hightlights. Makes them blend in a bit better than without, but sadly not as beautifully as demonstrated.</li>
            <li> Really like it. I would like to have Wow in Auburn. Have not found yet</li>
            <li> Great tool to cover those roots in between salon visits! Blonde color blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  Difficult to apply and it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li> Handy to have this gem.  Really look forward to longer intervals between colors!</li>
            <li> Decent coverage for roots. Wish it was brighter. I may just need a lighter color. Goes on like thick eye shadow, and I&#x27;ve learned the trick is to get a lot on the brush. I think it was a decent buy.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was &#x27;ok&#x27; - in a pinch.  I will be traveling for a couple of months and am going to be dealing with &#x27;some major roots&#x27; within a month.  I was hoping this product would be &#x27;great&#x27; but I am not convinced (based on my test run) that it is going to conceal the roots very well.  I watched the video, which was helpful, and plan another &#x27;test run&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend, arrive in good time and as far as I know she was very pleased</li>
            <li> Good color match, work very nice</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my gray :o(</li>
            <li> What a great product - it covers my gray and no one is the wiser - it saved me so much time and money on touch up at the salon !! That you amazon your the best .</li>
            <li> I was under the impression it made the hair strands appear thicker...it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my roots.  I used the product and just looked like I had sprinkled yellow baby powder on my brown roots.  Not recommended</li>
            <li> This gave my grown out dark roots a better appearance than without.  It was not a complete cover-up but helpful and worth it to extend my time between highlights.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I&amp;#34;m 80 % grey and my natural hair color is a dark brown.  I went blonde to delay the inevitable grey streak.  However, it STILL SUCKS to have have to dye my hair every two weeks.  This products buys me time and keeps me from that embarrassing grey streak.  YOU HAVE TO KNOW how to use it.  It&#x27;s easy BUT pull the hair sections tight against your scalp, load, load, load the smaller brush and stiple the product onto your roots.  I&#x27;ve been swimming and walked a sweaty 5K and it hasn&#x27;t come off, sweated off.  Sadly - it does come off when you shampoo your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it dry.  I tried it wet.  I tried it with copious amounts of product.  Nothing, absolutely nothing adhered to my hair.  Totally worthless.</li>
            <li> Ladies, Run out and get this for those mornings where you wake up and those grays are in....Great solution until you can get to the salon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t cover as well as light brown</li>
            <li> Really like this root cover up.  I have been using it in between colorings and it does take the edge off of the contracts between my natural hair color and my highlights.  Great in between and only takes a minute to apply.</li>
            <li> I am able to go longer without bleaching my hair. I need to dampen product for best results.</li>
            <li> Garbage. I gave it one star bc I had to otherwise it would be no stars. It does not do what it claims. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this purchase it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was worth nothing. I couldn&#x27;t even tell that it was sticking to my hair. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Did not cover grey. Difficult to use</li>
            <li> Great product! Works so well! Goodbye Toppix! Just wish there was a lighter brown because I bought the light brown&lt;br /&gt;and the blonde and mix myself. The light brown is just a little too dark.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all for me.  It wouldn&#x27;t even stick to my hair!</li>
