    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has been and still is a wonderful allergy medication.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and this seller is very good as well.</li>
            <li>This product works great..  </li>
            <li>If you, like me, have allergies, this is a great product for that.</li>
            <li>Great bang for your buck on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great quantity at a great price.</li>
            <li>Excellent allergy medicine, works quickly &amp; effectively.</li>
            <li>Benadryl is a fine product, but I do believe that the vendor who&#x27;s peddling this at $99.99 a bottle can&#x27;t be selling very many of them!!  </li>
            <li>Been using Benadryl for years, for everything from a bee sting ,alergy,and even a good nights sleep</li>
            <li>This is a good deal and fair price</li>
            <li>so glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>This handy bottle allows me to keep the tablet by my bedside to take when needed without the struggle of opening the foil sealed ones.</li>
            <li>An old-time remedy, no prescription needed,  and still one of the most effective, without being habit-forming.</li>
            <li>The purchase was easy, arrived fast and the price very good.</li>
            <li>Are these allergy pills magical?</li>
            <li>I would have saved even more.</li>
            <li>I love the product, however I wish the price was better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ones I found, which are the ones shown above are absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a bottle of loose tablets at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Extra tablets was a great bonus.  </li>
            <li>I had to have help from a stronger person, who also had a great deal of difficulty getting the bottle open.</li>
            <li>I simply think that these are the best available, and I vouch for them as being the Real Deal.</li>
            <li>I also found the Brand version of Allegra here, also far from the expiration date and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>THANKS :)</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li>and I really depended on original Benadryl Tablets.</li>
            <li>They really are genuine and somewhat reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>the picture shows its a bottle of pills, and since I have a hard time using the ones that get peeled off a card, I thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad it came in a bottle instead of the individual packets.</li>
            <li>I received the product exactly as described on the product page.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally it dawned on me one day to look online for them, so I checked here on Amazon first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am rather pleased that I have these back.</li>
            <li>I had just bought some blush from a dealer in New Mexico for 10 dollars and felt lucky</li>
            <li>And it often is difficult to find dramamine in loose caplet form, so it is wonderful to be able to get them through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these not so much for allergy&#x27;s but as a sleep aid and it works perfectly, don&#x27;t take them every night, only when I find it hard to sleep.</li>
            <li>I buy a large bottle &amp; use as needed.  </li>
            <li>According to several doctors I&#x27;ve discussed it with, benadryl won&#x27;t hurt me, and if it works to help me sleep, that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Bottle much preferred for ease of use.  </li>
            <li>The ones here are the real ones we used to get everywhere.</li>
            <li>They help more than the other allergy tablets that  I have tried.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and I also like the quantity, as that means less running around to buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a month, and have been able to cut my sedative use down by 50%.  </li>
            <li>I had been getting more and more frustrated as the Real Benadryl Tablets just started to disappear from pharmacy shelves everywhere</li>
            <li>I went, only to be replaced by those so called Generic Substitutes that maybe half the price but were actually just 1/3 as good as the Originals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Benadryl is hard to find in stores, but I have been able to find them at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Some mornings still feel a little drowsy for a while, and some wake up fresh..-</li>
            <li>I have to cut them with a scissor, and frequently the pills fall into the sink or elsewhere because they are so tiny.  </li>
            <li>I have to cut them with a scissor, and frequently the pills fall into the sink or elsewhere because they are so tiny.</li>
            <li>to using these which work as I said above I have found that they do make my blood pressure rise quiet high and have now curtailed using them as much as possible.</li>

            <li> If you need draminine, and you have carpal tunnel, arthritis or other hand issues, you really appreciate simplicity in packaging and not having to punch single pills through layers of foil!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not old, the date on my second to last one was 3/14.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wake up with odd and vivid dreams in the morning, but since they&#x27;re not nightmares, and they fade away once I&#x27;m up, I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> , I just can&#x27;t get to sleep or sleep well for long.  </li>
            <li> Also you will tend to have dry mouth, but not severe.</li>
            <li> Great for stabbing &amp; getting stuff out of your teeth!!</li>
            <li> I have torn ligaments in my hand so the individual packets are hard to open sometimes.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This size is hard to find in the stores and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Clearly they&#x27;ve raised the price ridiculously and changed the packaging.  </li>
            <li> its probably due to the time of the night that I take the tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further</li>
            <li> Benadryl helps to keep my sneezes and other allergy problems under control.  </li>
            <li> The package is not as pictured---I wanted tablets in a bottle and got boxes instead that were hard to open.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I got a bottle, and it cost less than $12, including shipping.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted blister packs I could have got it at Costco and paid less.</li>
            <li> The cap on the bottle is so tight that I cannot get it off.</li>
            <li> Sharp!!</li>
            <li> I specifically wanted the bottle with 148 capsules, as shown, not three packages with 48, each pill encapsulated in hard to release blister packs.  </li>
            <li> I specifically wanted the bottle with 148 capsules, as shown, not a bottle with 100 tablets and a package with 48, each pill encapsulated in hard to release blister packs.</li>
            <li> I do believe this vendor has priced this item in heavy duty error!!  </li>
            <li> I have a dexterity and strength problem with my hands, and the blister packs are very difficult for me to open.  </li>
            <li> I have a dexterity and strength problem with my hands, and the blister packs are very difficult for me to open.</li>
            <li> I was tired of going to the store every month.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were supposed to be a bottle, but they were the impossible to open push tabs, instead, so I get to spend an hour with scissors cutting them all out of the child-proof packaging.</li>
            <li> I have terrible allergy problems where I live.  </li>
            <li> so you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Searched everywhere to find Benadryl in a bottle - hate all the packaging in the stores - no more peeling off for just one pill!</li>
            <li> I feel like myself again, and no more horrible allergy symptoms for me.</li>
            <li> Disappointment in this order!</li>
            <li> Disappointment in this order!</li>
            <li> Totally wrongly advertised!!</li>
            <li> I hate when products purchased are not as pictured.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very bad allergies</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased these not so much for allergy&#x27;s but as a sleep aid and it works perfectly, don&#x27;t take them every night, only when I find it hard to sleep. take 2 and they work within about 20 minutes and then I sleep through to the morning without waking up.  Some mornings still feel a little drowsy for a while, and some wake up fresh..- its probably due to the time of the night that I take the tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further to using these which work as I said above I have found that they do make my blood pressure rise quiet high and have now curtailed using them as much as possible. but not entirely and then only use 1 tab not 2.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I buy the 148 tab BOTTLE sothat I do not have to struggle with blister packs, I received 3 packs of blister packs this time, my arthritiic hands will be screaming after I open these packs.  So not what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Did not come in this packaging but rather several blister packs .i ordered it to have the bottle. I hate when products purchased are not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Benadryl is a fine product, but I do believe that the vendor who&#x27;s peddling this at $99.99 a bottle can&#x27;t be selling very many of them!!  Granted, at Sam&#x27;s Club, you can get this same quantity for $13.48, even though they are not in a bottle but individually separated.  I do believe this vendor has priced this item in heavy duty error!!  I purchased this same product on Amazon on 3/6/13 for just $21.50!!</li>
            <li> Why does 148 tablets cost $99.99+ $4.99 s&amp;h? Are these allergy pills magical? I&#x27;ll take my chances at my local Walmart who has the same medication priced at $4 for 100 pills...</li>
            <li> Sharp!! Great for stabbing &amp; getting stuff out of your teeth!!</li>
            <li> The package is not as pictured---I wanted tablets in a bottle and got boxes instead that were hard to open.  Item misrepresented by seller.</li>
            <li> I had just bought some blush from a dealer in New Mexico for 10 dollars and felt lucky but then, I saw what I could get it for online. I saved two dollars but how I wish that I had bought both online. I would have saved even more.</li>
            <li> Benadryl works for my husband. Does not want generic. Bottle much preferred for ease of use.  Extra tablets was a great bonus.  He swallows one every night.  Will purchase again when necessary.</li>
            <li> This product works great..  I am so glad it came in a bottle instead of the individual packets. I have torn ligaments in my hand so the individual packets are hard to open sometimes. I have been looking for the bottle in stores everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find it so glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> Been using Benadryl for years, for everything from a bee sting ,alergy,and even a good nights sleep and it works.The purchase was easy, arrived fast and the price very good. THANKS :)</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> If you need draminine, and you have carpal tunnel, arthritis or other hand issues, you really appreciate simplicity in packaging and not having to punch single pills through layers of foil!  And it often is difficult to find dramamine in loose caplet form, so it is wonderful to be able to get them through Amazon.  If you are a prime member, you will get them within two days, making life even simpler!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sleeping pill. I buy a large bottle &amp; use as needed.  Arrived quickly &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li> Searched everywhere to find Benadryl in a bottle - hate all the packaging in the stores - no more peeling off for just one pill!</li>
            <li> What can you say about Benadryl. It has been and still is a wonderful allergy medication. This one works well for me.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I got a bottle, and it cost less than $12, including shipping.  Clearly they&#x27;ve raised the price ridiculously and changed the packaging.  Don&#x27;t do it!  Here&#x27;s my&lt;br /&gt;original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have allergies, I just can&#x27;t get to sleep or sleep well for long.  According to several doctors I&#x27;ve discussed it with, benadryl won&#x27;t hurt me, and if it works to help me sleep, that&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a month, and have been able to cut my sedative use down by 50%.  Sometimes I wake up with odd and vivid dreams in the morning, but since they&#x27;re not nightmares, and they fade away once I&#x27;m up, I don&#x27;t mind.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my nose or mucus membranes.  So if you have chronic sleeping problems, you could give this a try.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I ordered these online was because I could not find the bottle of Benadryl in stores- only blister packs.  I do NOT like the blister packs.  Imagine my surprise when this order arrived in 3 packages of blister packs!!! Totally wrongly advertised!!</li>
            <li> If you, like me, have allergies, this is a great product for that. I prefer this packaging to the ones in the foil seals. For me the foil sealed packaging requires a knife to open. This handy bottle allows me to keep the tablet by my bedside to take when needed without the struggle of opening the foil sealed ones.</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck on Amazon.  I received the product exactly as described on the product page.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were supposed to be a bottle, but they were the impossible to open push tabs, instead, so I get to spend an hour with scissors cutting them all out of the child-proof packaging.</li>
            <li> the picture shows its a bottle of pills, and since I have a hard time using the ones that get peeled off a card, I thought this would be great.  Lo and behold they arrive and it&#x27;s not what the picture show, it&#x27;s the pills on the cards.&lt;br /&gt;Live and learn!</li>
            <li> I specifically wanted the bottle with 148 capsules, as shown, not three packages with 48, each pill encapsulated in hard to release blister packs.  I have a dexterity and strength problem with my hands, and the blister packs are very difficult for me to open.  I have to cut them with a scissor, and frequently the pills fall into the sink or elsewhere because they are so tiny.  Disappointment in this order!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I love the product, however I wish the price was better.&lt;br /&gt;The tablets are easier to get to then the traditional packaging.</li>
            <li> Benadryl is unavailable in my area except in those aggravating blister packs. This is a bottle of loose tablets at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I had been getting more and more frustrated as the Real Benadryl Tablets just started to disappear from pharmacy shelves everywhere I went, only to be replaced by those so called Generic Substitutes that maybe half the price but were actually just 1/3 as good as the Originals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally it dawned on me one day to look online for them, so I checked here on Amazon first. The ones I found, which are the ones shown above are absolutely perfect. I suffer from very bad allergies and I really depended on original Benadryl Tablets. The ones here are the real ones we used to get everywhere. I have ordered three of them by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not old, the date on my second to last one was 3/14. On these the expiration date is 12/13. They really are genuine and somewhat reasonably priced. I really like this product, and I also like the quantity, as that means less running around to buy more. I simply think that these are the best available, and I vouch for them as being the Real Deal. You don&#x27;t have to worry about buying expired tablets. That is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am rather pleased that I have these back. I feel like myself again, and no more horrible allergy symptoms for me. I also found the Brand version of Allegra here, also far from the expiration date and fairly priced. Excellent product and this seller is very good as well.</li>
            <li> Benadryl is Benadryl...what else to say?  We use it in volume to quell allergic response in our horses.  Only (nitpick) issue is that this is not 148 tablets, it&#x27;s 3 packs of 48 tablets each, or 144.  Someone at the vendor was absent the day they taught math...</li>
            <li> I do wish that these came in an easy-to-open bottle.  But, I do like Benadryl.  They help more than the other allergy tablets that  I have tried.</li>
            <li> Compared to a grocery store, they are a lot cheaper online.  Same stuff, just cheaper so you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I specifically wanted the bottle with 148 capsules, as shown, not a bottle with 100 tablets and a package with 48, each pill encapsulated in hard to release blister packs.

I have to cut them with a scissor, and frequently the pills fall into the sink or elsewhere because they are so tiny. Disappointment in this order!</li>
            <li> I have terrible allergy problems where I live.  Benadryl helps to keep my sneezes and other allergy problems under control.  Benadryl is hard to find in stores, but I have been able to find them at Amazon.</li>
            <li> An old-time remedy, no prescription needed,  and still one of the most effective, without being habit-forming.Can cause some drowsiness, but not severe.</li>
            <li> The cap on the bottle is so tight that I cannot get it off. I had to have help from a stronger person, who also had a great deal of difficulty getting the bottle open. This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Great quantity at a great price. I take Benadryl once a day for control of non-allergic issues. I was tired of going to the store every month.</li>
            <li> Excellent allergy medicine, works quickly &amp; effectively. One thing you must remember is that this medicine is a sedative as well, act or drive accordingly. Obey strictly the advised dosage. Also you will tend to have dry mouth, but not severe.</li>
            <li> This size is hard to find in the stores and last a long time. This is a good deal and fair price</li>
            <li> I bought this because the photo indicated it was a bottle with 148 tablets.  Instead, I got 3 packages of blister packs.  If I wanted blister packs I could have got it at Costco and paid less.</li>
