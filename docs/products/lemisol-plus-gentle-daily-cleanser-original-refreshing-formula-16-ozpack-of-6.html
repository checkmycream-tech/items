            <li>wow i ordered this April 24 and received it in two days great service thanks guys</li>
            <li>best part is it came with a little gift i had no idea i would receive,for those who love makeup you will enjoy it,i received 3 all in one eyeshadow,lipstick n blush colors of platinum silver,chocolate and midnight blue..</li>
            <li>Though I believe the product I got directly from the DR was more effective- this one is still decent.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve chose the 5 stars rating because this product really works,it leaves you clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other better femenine wash in the market than this one .</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Though not the same, still better.</li>
            <li>After my first use, there are now three households that use this wash.</li>
            <li>Make you feel fresh all day long. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 10 years old after i had a mild infection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable and it has a minty feel to it.</li>
            <li>was very upset</li>
            <li>I have try other products and I most say that they have giving skin  irritation and discomfort.</li>
            <li>This is clean feeling and guaranteed health for the private area in a bottle.</li>

            <li>Hope to keep getting it online, beats the stores and small shops who charge you a lot more.</li>
            <li>I like purchasing the case of six from Amazon because New York is quite a distance where these can be purchased in person only and individually very costly.</li>
            <li>My whole family back NY use lemisol as well.  </li>
            <li>However, for those who are not as sensitive, I would recommend this.</li>

            <li> But due to the fact that it has a small amount of alcohol (not of the drinking variety) you should not over wash because that cause the removal of essential bacteria from the vagina.</li>
            <li> Alas, after a few weeks of use, I will spare you the details, but it became apparent that it did not agree with me</li>
            <li> When it was delivered the boxes where broken the bottle</li>
            <li> Since i left the Islands it has been impossible to find it in stores!!</li>
            <li> I feel bad for chicks not showering with this puppy!!</li>

            <li> This has been a staple in my family&#x27;s female/care arsenal!! I moved to California some years back and had the hardest time getting a hold of it. I had to wait till a family member went on holiday to the Dominican Republic to get my fix. Though I believe the product I got directly from the DR was more effective- this one is still decent. It isn&#x27;t comparable to anything in the US- it&#x27;s Better! Though not the same, still better. I recommend it ladies!!</li>
