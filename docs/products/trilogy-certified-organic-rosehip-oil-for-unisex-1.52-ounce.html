            <li>This Trilogy rose</li>
            <li>hip oil is a nice, product, however.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thrilled about that.</li>
            <li>It helps give you a nice glow and works well either under a moisturizer or as a moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Wonderful product, it makes my skin feel and look soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I use this as my face serum and love it</li>
            <li>The benefits of the rosehip seed oil are claimed to be many.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s one of the oils I keep around most of the time and</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a year and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Excellent on a recent surgery scar to help now that it is healed up.</li>
            <li>I now have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product after only a couple of days</li>
            <li>With winter coming, I&#x27;m sure I will love it even more.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love being told I look 18.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this oil!</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>Mu skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>That is awesome because I really wanted to buy the cream cleanser however, wanted to see how well the oil worked first.  </li>
            <li>find the perfect way to apply this rosehip oil that is: put a few up at the tip of your fingers then rub both hands together to warm up and start patting all around face to let it absorb.</li>
            <li>Rose hip oil is nothing short of amazing in my book!</li>
            <li>The first rose</li>
            <li>but for people who have fair, normal skin.</li>
            <li>Id have to say this is hands down one of the best things I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are reduced as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
            <li>Fantastic hydrator for face , it is now a must with my morning and night routine.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Light and very moistizing!!!</li>
            <li>It is not \\&quot;oily\\&quot; and soaks into skin super quick!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this product that I immediately tried it when it came in</li>
            <li>Two days later, my skin is noticeably soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li>When I got it, it was a bright yellow liquid.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my face red or anything which is good.</li>
            <li>It feels as if my face has been mildly chemically burnt.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, smells great as long as i keep it in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, I highly recommend this product to everyone and anyone who wants beautiful skin in simple step.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product and has worked wonders even though I&#x27;m only 2 weeks in!</li>
            <li>Anyways it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of topical creams and medication of my acne but none of them showed results as the trilogy rose hip oil did.</li>
            <li>do I mix it with organic jojoba oil and a little neroli or frankincense and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li>This product works nicely, however, I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I do know that there is at least one oil that works better.</li>
            <li>I definitely highly recommend this product to not just people suffering with any kind of skin problem such as wrinkles, scarring, dryness or stretch marks</li>
            <li>and it was pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for my skin after a day in the Florida heat and sunshine!</li>
            <li>I know about Triology rosehip oil from seeing a post that say a famous model only use this oil at night and her skin wakes up glowing.</li>
            <li>This facial oil makes me face smooth!</li>
            <li>This oil absorbed into my skin really well and didn&#x27;t feel greasy or give me acne.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and use it daily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>My best new beauty secret.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about using rose hip oil as a facial moisturizer a couple of months ago and have never looked back.</li>
            <li>rose hip oil is high in vitamin c &amp; other antioxidants</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any major changes in my skin except to say it feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really make your skin softer than before.</li>
            <li>but if I do, I&#x27;d definitely get the smallest container available.</li>
            <li>very absorbent and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well to reduce the visibility of a scar on my sons face</li>
            <li>We both didnt have to use as much makeup as we have been using.</li>
            <li>Good product &amp; smells like the real deal, but seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price, too expensive for me.</li>
            <li>My new beauty go-to!</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil from Trilogy has been so good to my skin - especially during this harsh New England winter!</li>
            <li>what I like about this particular product is that it comes with a convenient dropper, hence getting out just one drop of the oil couldn&#x27;t be easier - and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff better than ALL the expensive creams ...</li>
            <li>It reduced the redness of my scarring which was my main concern about my face.</li>
            <li>skin feels soft and calm after applying it with my daily moisturizer cream, unlike many other oils, this one absorbs into the skin really well</li>
            <li>Antioxidants are highly oxidative</li>
            <li>using it twice a day, but if I skip one or two days, my  skin still smooth only dry again.</li>
            <li>I use several drops before bed each night and sometimes mix a drop or two within my daily moisturizer and my skin feels protected and super soft.</li>
            <li>and now my skin feels incredibly soft, supple and my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase the whole Trilogy line.</li>
            <li>As a young adult suffering from acne</li>
            <li>I mix with my Zinc Oixide sunscreen every day in my palm and apply before my Young Blood foundation.</li>
            <li>The oil I was sent smells exactly like salmon oil, and as stated, basically destroyed my sucked my skin dry, resulting in a sort of sandpaper texture after just over a week of using it as directed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why, but the consistency, smell, and effects of the Evan Healy oil were definitely different and worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li>In past I purchased 5x the amount of oil for the same price at my other online vendor (mountain rose herbs).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 with barely a wrinkle</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, I battle psoriasis and eczema and have never had trouble with any reactions.</li>
            <li>My daughter brought Trilogy back to me from a trip to New Zealand and even before the bottle was empty</li>

            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, I battle psoriasis and eczema and have never had trouble with any reactions.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought Trilogy back to me from a trip to New Zealand and even before the bottle was empty</li>
            <li> In fact is seems to be working really well to reduce redness on my face from past acne.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this dry and coarse in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely upset, I&#x27;ve NEVER purchased from a seller who refused to give me money back especially when I&#x27;m allergic and it&#x27;s NOT my fault!</li>
            <li> My skin was so leathery and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> The product left me with extremely rough, dry, tight, and visibly damaged skin after ten days of twice daily use!</li>
            <li> My friend told me about Rosehip Oil for dry skin, she suggested Trilogy, so..</li>
            <li> Dry skin is one of mu biggest problem in dry air and this product solved my problem.</li>
            <li> I was worried about where I could purchase this product when my supply ran dry.</li>
            <li> No smell when I got it, but about 2 months later, it had a slightly fishy odor.</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few pimples here and there which is just my skin adjusting to the new product, but nothing majoir and the benefits outweigh the few pimples I got (which went away).</li>
            <li> Only a few drops for my face and my skin is hydrated and no worries about breaking out.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Trilogy ;)</li>
            <li> My other vendor was out of stock when I needed this oil.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this oil to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and started to notice my skin-tone became uneven (probably sun-damage).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> start out with a few drops depend on the type of skin) and wakes up glowing.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of this with my moisturizer in the winter time and it keeps me from being a flaky mess!</li>
            <li> The smell is not very good, may be is the rosehip smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> (I noticed a difference after 2 days, when I woke up to my skin looking hydrated and subtle.)</li>
            <li> Smell may not good,</li>
            <li> I started using this after I heard Miranda Kerr, (Victoria&#x27;s Secret model) say it was her beauty</li>

            <li> Smell may not good, but it&#x27;s really make your skin softer than before. Anyways it&#x27;s useful.</li>
            <li> Use it nightly on my face and recently after neck surgery on the area that was stitched. No scars...yea!</li>
            <li> Miracle oil, so nourishing for my skin!</li>
            <li> Love Trilogy!! I use this as my face serum and love it</li>
            <li> very light!  great for skin!</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and started to notice my skin-tone became uneven (probably sun-damage). I burt my cleavage/chest area by sitting in the sun without a drop of sunscreen. My skin was so leathery and not soft at all. I started using this after I heard Miranda Kerr, (Victoria&#x27;s Secret model) say it was her beauty secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put 3-4 drops into my daily moisturizer for my chest and 2-3 drops for my face mixed with moisturizer, 2 times a day. Two days later, my skin is noticeably soft and beautiful! I use it on my face, mixed in with my facial cream and haven&#x27;t felt the need to wear foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few pimples here and there which is just my skin adjusting to the new product, but nothing majoir and the benefits outweigh the few pimples I got (which went away). It is not \\&quot;oily\\&quot; and soaks into skin super quick! My new beauty go-to! It is an amazing product and has worked wonders even though I&#x27;m only 2 weeks in! (I noticed a difference after 2 days, when I woke up to my skin looking hydrated and subtle.)</li>
            <li> The benefits of the rosehip seed oil are claimed to be many. For me it&#x27;s one of the oils I keep around most of the time and what I like about this particular product is that it comes with a convenient dropper, hence getting out just one drop of the oil couldn&#x27;t be easier - and that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed to apply to my lips and underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of Rosehip oil.  I have been using it for a year and love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> This product came in a timely manner.  I am so excited about this product that I immediately tried it when it came in and now my skin feels incredibly soft, supple and my skin is glowing. Beautorium also sent some Trilogy samples which included the cream cleanser and the night cream. That is awesome because I really wanted to buy the cream cleanser however, wanted to see how well the oil worked first.  Nonetheless I got to try it and I love it! I will definitely purchase the whole Trilogy line.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil from Trilogy has been so good to my skin - especially during this harsh New England winter! I use several drops before bed each night and sometimes mix a drop or two within my daily moisturizer and my skin feels protected and super soft. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered my Triology Rosehip Oil from seller Passion for Perfume. The product left me with extremely rough, dry, tight, and visibly damaged skin after ten days of twice daily use! It feels as if my face has been mildly chemically burnt. I don&#x27;t know if there is something wrong with the product Passions for Perfume sent, if the batch was spoiled or something, but I do know that this is not supposed to happen. The oil I was sent smells exactly like salmon oil, and as stated, basically destroyed my sucked my skin dry, resulting in a sort of sandpaper texture after just over a week of using it as directed. Now, I have to figure out how to reverse the damage. My skin has never felt this dry and coarse in my life.</li>
            <li> I first heard about using rose hip oil as a facial moisturizer a couple of months ago and have never looked back. Rose hip oil is nothing short of amazing in my book! This product works nicely, however, I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I do know that there is at least one oil that works better. The first rose hip oil that I tried was Evan Healy brand and it was pretty pricey. I thought I&#x27;d try a cheaper option the second time around and went with this product. I&#x27;m not sure why, but the consistency, smell, and effects of the Evan Healy oil were definitely different and worked better for my skin. This Trilogy rose hip oil is a nice, product, however. I would buy it again. Unless you&#x27;ve got extra cash you blow, in which case I&#x27;d say go for Evan Healy! Sorry, Trilogy ;)</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; smells like the real deal, but seriously overpriced. In past I purchased 5x the amount of oil for the same price at my other online vendor (mountain rose herbs). My other vendor was out of stock when I needed this oil. Which is how I ended up ordering this horribly expensive one at Amazon. Side note: rose hip oil is high in vitamin c &amp; other antioxidants &amp; I do question the integrity of this oil having probably been on a warehouse shelf for months. Antioxidants are highly oxidative</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve gotten the smaller bottle and put it in the fridge instead of leaving it in the bathroom. When I got it, it was a bright yellow liquid. It was awesome when I put it on my face. It would absorb in about 5 minutes and it&#x27;s not oily at all. No smell when I got it, but about 2 months later, it had a slightly fishy odor. I still use it, but I really hate the smell. I&#x27;d buy it again but if I do, I&#x27;d definitely get the smallest container available.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very good, may be is the rosehip smell. does not absorb well but soften skin. Good hydrating product</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible product. Told to use the ros&amp;eacute; hip oil when I was in France last winter. Fantastic hydrator for face , it is now a must with my morning and night routine. So simple..who knew!</li>
            <li> very absorbent and moisturizing. Excellent on a recent surgery scar to help now that it is healed up.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin.  I now have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I was allergic to the product, my skin started itching terribly. I asked for my money back and I was told I couldn&#x27;t get my money back! I&#x27;m extremely upset, I&#x27;ve NEVER purchased from a seller who refused to give me money back especially when I&#x27;m allergic and it&#x27;s NOT my fault!</li>
            <li> Definitely good for your skin!</li>
            <li> hmmmm.......smells like olive oil.....feels like olive oil.....tastes like olive oil....NO results.....very disappointed....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff better than ALL the expensive creams ... Just don&#x27;t get on ur sheets or clothes. Use at night</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it nightly.  Very hydrating for my skin after a day in the Florida heat and sunshine!</li>
            <li> I know about Triology rosehip oil from seeing a post that say a famous model only use this oil at night and her skin wakes up glowing. And yes, it does the same for me as well: I put it on at night (start out with a few drops depend on the type of skin) and wakes up glowing. This oil is not greasy, ever. And guess what, even on oily skin like my fiance the oil helps improve his skin a lot as well.&lt;br /&gt;I find the perfect way to apply this rosehip oil that is: put a few up at the tip of your fingers then rub both hands together to warm up and start patting all around face to let it absorb. Do not rub because it will absorb into your hands instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order this Triology Certified Organic Rosehip OIl again and again and is planning to buy the Triology Certified Organic Rosehip OIl + Antioxidant for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I highly recommend this product to everyone and anyone who wants beautiful skin in simple step.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product after only a couple of days my pores are smaller, and facial redness is reduced. I&#x27;ve been alternating it with almond oil.I use the Beauty Aura almond oil in the morning and this at night. Fine lines are reduced as well.</li>
            <li> This facial oil makes me face smooth!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any major changes in my skin except to say it feels great on my face.  With winter coming, I&#x27;m sure I will love it even more. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbed into my skin really well and didn&#x27;t feel greasy or give me acne. In fact is seems to be working really well to reduce redness on my face from past acne. This is why I bought it so I&#x27;m thrilled about that. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells great as long as i keep it in the fridge.  Sometimes I forget to put it on because I leave it in the fridge. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference but when it is on, my skin is in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It broke me out. I was wondering for a while what as breaking me out, and I figured it out because I would only use this alone as a moisturizer. If It wasn&#x27;t for the acne part, this product is great. I use Jojoba oil now, and that is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> As a young adult suffering from acne Id have to say this is hands down one of the best things I have ever bought. Although I&#x27;ve been using for only a week, I already see the change it took upon my acne. It reduced the redness of my scarring which was my main concern about my face. I definitely highly recommend this product to not just people suffering with any kind of skin problem such as wrinkles, scarring, dryness or stretch marks but for people who have fair, normal skin. It helps give you a nice glow and works well either under a moisturizer or as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used tons of topical creams and medication of my acne but none of them showed results as the trilogy rose hip oil did. Buy this and regret won&#x27;t come along with it !</li>
            <li> Superb quality Rosehip oil.  Worked very well to reduce the visibility of a scar on my sons face</li>
            <li> broke out my severly acne prone skin after a week. I really wanted to love this product. I think its just me because of my acne.</li>
            <li> I wear this oil day and night. I mix with my Zinc Oixide sunscreen every day in my palm and apply before my Young Blood foundation. I let it set and it dries by the time I&#x27;ve finished brushing my teeth. Love this stuff. I&#x27;m 26 with barely a wrinkle &amp; I love being told I look 18. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Trilogy.</li>
            <li> treat scars! also treat skin problems!</li>
            <li> After moving from the deep south up north my skin experienced quite the shock. I mix a few drops of this with my moisturizer in the winter time and it keeps me from being a flaky mess! I have pretty sensitive skin, I battle psoriasis and eczema and have never had trouble with any reactions. I really enjoy this oil!</li>
            <li> A product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> skin feels soft and calm after applying it with my daily moisturizer cream, unlike many other oils, this one absorbs into the skin really well, you won&#x27;t feel a oily residue left on your face after applying</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price, too expensive for me. I prefer argon or Marula oil.</li>
            <li> It takes very little of this oil to go a long way.  Excellent absorption and non-greasy feeling.  I notice smoother skin and a nice &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this oil it&#x27;s the best product I ever used!</li>
            <li> My friend told me about Rosehip Oil for dry skin, she suggested Trilogy, so..I bought this from Amazon ! Really glad ! Dry skin is one of mu biggest problem in dry air and this product solved my problem. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it twice a day, but if I skip one or two days, my  skin still smooth only dry again.</li>
            <li> Looking for something that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and this is perfect!!! Light and very moistizing!!! Love it!!! Will order this again for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> My best new beauty secret.  I mix with jojoba oil and wash my face, neck and chest with the mixture every night.  Mu skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product work over night like this one did. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s &amp; this product gave me a glow that I was lacking. I let my mother who&#x27;s in her 50&#x27;s try it... her face glowed as well as it gave her moisture. We both didnt have to use as much makeup as we have been using. It helped with acne scaring as well as wrinkles. I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product!</li>
            <li> Smells a lil funky but it&#x27;s a good product I have rosacea and it doesn&#x27;t make my face red or anything which is good.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I replaced my facial moisturizer with this oil and I&#x27;ve used it on scars. Only a few drops for my face and my skin is hydrated and no worries about breaking out.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and use it daily on my face and neck. It can be a bit drying by itself do I mix it with organic jojoba oil and a little neroli or frankincense and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> My daughter brought Trilogy back to me from a trip to New Zealand and even before the bottle was empty I was worried about where I could purchase this product when my supply ran dry. Wonderful product, it makes my skin feel and look soft and supple. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
