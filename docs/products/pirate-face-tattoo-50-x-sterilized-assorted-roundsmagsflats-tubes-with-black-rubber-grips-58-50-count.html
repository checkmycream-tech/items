            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to break out all the old school stuff.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re old school like me you are used to the big fat metal grips.</li>

            <li> Not even worth it!! Really disappointed</li>
            <li> Love these!  they are lightweight and the grips are very comfortable almost like writing with a pen. I recommend these to everyone and they arrived very quickly in mail!</li>
            <li> Great stuff its a good buy i wish i can show you my work and i got everything literally off amazon my started kit you just have to pick and choose but i think all the 5-9 dt is not needed more 9L and its great</li>
            <li> Works great except I didn&#x27;t need the DT</li>
            <li> great quality haven&#x27;t had a single problem with any of them and the size is just right for my hand</li>
            <li> Super cheap and work good.</li>
            <li> Have not used these yet so only 4 stars. Came on time, as described, no damaged or opened packaging, open seals etc. good combo and mix of tubes.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> got what I ordered good variety of sizes and on time thanks</li>
            <li> Well packaged, got a good assortment I have done 2 tattoos so far using these tubes and no complains. I wish I would have gone with thicker grips but that was my fault though.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Works well!</li>
            <li> Excellent everything I was expecting!!!</li>
            <li> Looks good and was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My son is loving it. I will be purchasing more products from your company at a later date.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with shipping and item.</li>
            <li> These came fast, nicely packaged, rubber banded in different sizes. For me I&#x27;d rather keep with disposable rather than have to sterilize everything. The customers see how they get unwrapped right in front of them, and get thrown away almost immediately after they are done. The customer feels safe, you feel better that they feel better and they will return if you give them a good price and do a great job.</li>
            <li> Great on time will order more</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Everyone of the items are individually packaged and sealed tightly.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Quick Shipment</li>
            <li> Got it quickly. Great product.</li>
            <li> Order was complete, will order again</li>
            <li> very good u hear from me again</li>
            <li> perfect although late sue to inclimate weather</li>
            <li> Cool product, definitely a lot of assortment. I didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;random mix&amp;#34; problem, but what I did have a problem was with packagaing. Each grip was sealed individually, and about 5 grips per strip. the problem was, no matter how carefully you opened one grip...most of the time another would open.....basically every time. Seems like a menial problem.. but each grip might cost you 2 or 5 grips each use</li>
            <li> These tubes are pretty cool. Only thing I can really complain about them is the thinness of the grip. If you&#x27;re old school like me you are used to the big fat metal grips. But you&#x27;re going to have that problem with any disposable tube you get. My shipment was delayed due to inclement weather but luckily, they arrived as I was about to start a large back piece so I didn&#x27;t have to break out all the old school stuff. They came in a box, all mixed matched and tossed in there which would be my only other complaint.</li>
            <li> Everything came great I was satisfied and will be purchasing more items soon.</li>
            <li> Will never buy these cheap needles again...over half of these needles are not even usable due to burrs on the tips of needles.....will never buy again</li>
