            <li>Good bargain.</li>
            <li>for the price of this item the quality is good if you are looking for somrthing that dries faster</li>
            <li>One good bump or drop and this one&#x27;s done.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol after applying and curing the top coat to remove the tacky layer, and they are perfect!</li>

            <li>nice product(it works good)  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The typcial cure time with this lamp is 1-2 minutes at top!</li>
            <li>Great nails, great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I purchased it to do my own Gel Nails.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I choose this one- though it does take a bit longer for the polish to cure under this lamp, I followed the suggestion of another poster and doubled the time recommended on bottle (I did 2 minutes for the first coat, then 5-6 for the color and top coats) and my nails came out salon perfect.</li>
            <li>The best thing I have owned so far.</li>
            <li>Great for first time home gel polish results.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>Works great for the money - not a heavy duty piece of equipment, but effective.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting something that works in a minute then go ahead and pay more</li>
            <li>I should have done more research before buying it.</li>
            <li>I doubled the time for each step just to be sure</li>
            <li>and my nails were still more than tacky.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it just needed to be pushed in a bit more.</li>
            <li>I cure the top coat for 6 min (salon 2 min).</li>
            <li>and then again after the top coat).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting more than you pay</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>This lamp works better than the $194.00 OPI lamp that I paid for.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I purchased this lamp.</li>
            <li>You get more out of this lamp than for the cost.</li>
            <li>This is no match for high quality salon UV lamps, but for doing gel manicures at home occasionally it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I purchased it when I realized I can do my own gel nails at home for a fraction of the price of a &#x27;professional&#x27; doing them - and they look just as good.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy being able to do my nails at home with this lamp.  </li>
            <li>It is large and deep, perfect for curing one hand/foot at at time comfortably (your thumb will fit too!).</li>
            <li>The product itself is actually fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine for home use.</li>
            <li>This is my fist UV light.  </li>
            <li>my nails look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>so you could fit both feet or hands at once, but it does its job anyways.</li>
            <li>Easy enough for anyone who does their own nails!  </li>
            <li>Make sure to protect your eyes when using this, as much more UV light escapes this box than the high quality lamps used in a salon and UV lights are super damaging to your eyes.</li>
            <li>actually using it right with harmony gel nail polish and its great.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to cure my nail polish (not gels) when I do my own nails in-between my professional manicures.  </li>
            <li>This little light works great for the money.  </li>
            <li>Mine are beautiful and last about 1 1/2 weeks - very professional and feel like a plastic coat that protects from breakage.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Packs back away nicely for storing.</li>
            <li>It payed it self off long time ago since I do my own manicure and pedicure.</li>
            <li>I have used this lamp for my gel nails, I do add more time to cure since it is only 9W and gels cure at 36W for the recommended curing</li>
            <li>although there was stronger one(36watt) with only 10 buck more, i chose this becuz of reviews.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in gel nails before, but im intending to buy some gel nail tools</li>
            <li>I recommend watching a couple videos first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this lamp is not the most industrial, it definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Needs a gentle home!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because my nails stayed tacky after each step, but after doing the top coat I wiped my nails with rubbing alcohol and all the tackiness came off!   </li>
            <li>the price, this is an absolute STEAL and it does exactly what you need it to do!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lamp is a little flimsy in that the top and sides are not well connected, BUT it works!</li>
            <li>Enough of the polish stayed on so my nails did come out looking fine.</li>
            <li>I let the nail polish cure an extra minute or two longer than the polish says, since it is the time is geared towards a stronger UV light.  </li>
            <li>Very portable and works like a pro.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and it only fits the tip of your toes or fingers in, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>For Gelish, it would be 4 minutes for Foundation, 4-8 minutes for color (depending on how dark it is), and 8 minutes for the Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Is delicate and you must let it heat up before use for a few minutes for best results.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast(free shipping), decent price,</li>
            <li>That said, if you just want something to SET your normal nail style, it should probably work.</li>
            <li>, i can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s short but better than hair dryer i had used to dry polishes.</li>
            <li>I had it between this one (which was cheap) and a more expensive 30w UV lamp for about $60.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers had suggested, I added more time (I do 2 minutes per coat) given it is only a 9W bulb...</li>
            <li>It feels a little cheap and flimsy but for the price...</li>
            <li>They are hard and lovely.</li>
            <li>I am using my lamp to do my nails just as a professional would.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I took the advice of other users and made sure to \\&quot;cure\\</li>
            <li>I wish I had just bought it in the first place and saved myself the money I spent on this purchase.</li>
            <li>BUT i am able to do my nails and have them cure correctly, I also do my mom&#x27;s nails with no issue, I highly recommend this little lamp even though it&#x27;s a little .. flimsy?</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that it does not dry the coats completely.</li>
            <li>I was afraid at first because the light didn&#x27;t come on</li>

            <li> I was afraid at first because the light didn&#x27;t come on</li>
            <li> Since I will only do my nails 1-2 times per month, the long cure time is not a downside for me.</li>
            <li> I just ended up ordering a different/more expensive light.</li>
            <li> :) I say go for this cheaper lamp rather than an expensive one!</li>
            <li> I have been tryingto dry my nails for an hour</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really the way it should be though, and it took a long time.</li>
            <li> After an hour and a half, I finally just used acetone to remove the remaining stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> I had read the other reviews, and thought, oh, it&#x27;ll just take a few extra minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it even could, being around 1/3 the strength of other nail dryers.</li>
            <li> Noticed other reviewers had issues with hardening.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than other UV lamps I had priced and the quality is probably less than the more expensive ones, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have it for a year and a half</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a little flimsy I do allow my nails to cure for a minute longer than recommended</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I usually throw a towel over my hand and the front of the lamp while the lights are on.</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get. :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep it, but only because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> It is half the wattage of the very expensive OPI lamp</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> I cure 2min with base coat (expensive salon machines are 30sec).</li>
            <li> You must wipe off the tacky, sticky residue (I do so after the base coat</li>
            <li> This lamp is a piece of crap!!!</li>
            <li> horribly buy.</li>

            <li> I have used this lamp for my gel nails, I do add more time to cure since it is only 9W and gels cure at 36W for the recommended curing BUT i am able to do my nails and have them cure correctly, I also do my mom&#x27;s nails with no issue, I highly recommend this little lamp even though it&#x27;s a little .. flimsy? yeah it is, all plastic, but the lamps with aluminum trays cost 150+ so for the price? well worth it</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with Gelish nail polish.  I have only had it for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t say how well it lasts, but it works well now.  I let the nail polish cure an extra minute or two longer than the polish says, since it is the time is geared towards a stronger UV light.  Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Not the seller&#x27;s fault, but just so people know: this lamp definitely does NOT work on Shellac, which is what I bought it for. I haven&#x27;t tried it on gel products yet, but will see how that works.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to cure my nail polish (not gels) when I do my own nails in-between my professional manicures.  Works great for the money - not a heavy duty piece of equipment, but effective.</li>
            <li> My fiancé bought this for me recently and I love it. Very portable and works like a pro. Can give myself a great manicure in between trips to a salom.</li>
            <li> I bought this lamp on Amazon to use with the OPI gel nail system. It is half the wattage of the very expensive OPI lamp so I just double the minutes of exposure and it works very well. I am delighted that I saved a lot of money on a lamp that still does the job.</li>
            <li> I just received this product. actually using it right with harmony gel nail polish and its great. takes almost 6 minutes to cure nails however, you get what you pay for. If you are wanting something that works in a minute then go ahead and pay more but if you have time this is perfect</li>
            <li> A very effective product for the price. Is delicate and you must let it heat up before use for a few minutes for best results. Great for first time home gel polish results.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast(free shipping), decent price, nice product(it works good)  putting nail polishes by myself is one of my hobbies and i prefer to do it cuz it lasts longer than that i get in nail salons. the only one problem was drying. although there was stronger one(36watt) with only 10 buck more, i chose this becuz of reviews. I got the package yesterday. i put my hand for 3 minutes every coat, i can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s short but better than hair dryer i had used to dry polishes. I wasn&#x27;t interested in gel nails before, but im intending to buy some gel nail tools</li>
            <li> The unit itself is alittle flimsy, the plastic exterior feels like it could break.  But the bulb was enough to set the gel polish, with the use of rubbing alcohol as indicated.  I would recomend this unit as an inexpensive alternative to salon gel nail application</li>
            <li> This is no match for high quality salon UV lamps, but for doing gel manicures at home occasionally it&#x27;s great. It feels cheap and it only fits the tip of your toes or fingers in, but it does the job.  Make sure to protect your eyes when using this, as much more UV light escapes this box than the high quality lamps used in a salon and UV lights are super damaging to your eyes. I usually throw a towel over my hand and the front of the lamp while the lights are on.</li>
            <li> Someone else said it about this product--you get what you pay for. The product itself is actually fine. It arrived quickly and in good shape. I tried to use it to do a Shellac manicure. In short, it doesn&#x27;t work. For gel manicures, you&#x27;re supposed to use a 38 watt bulb. This lamp has a 9 watt bulb. I had read the other reviews, and thought, oh, it&#x27;ll just take a few extra minutes. I cured and cured, my nails just wouldn&#x27;t harden. After an hour and a half, I finally just used acetone to remove the remaining stickiness. Enough of the polish stayed on so my nails did come out looking fine. It&#x27;s not really the way it should be though, and it took a long time. I just ended up ordering a different/more expensive light. I wish I had just bought it in the first place and saved myself the money I spent on this purchase. I should have done more research before buying it.</li>
            <li> This is my fist UV light.  I purchased it to do my own Gel Nails.  Awesome!  Easy enough for anyone who does their own nails!  I recommend watching a couple videos first.</li>
            <li> This little light works great for the money.  I purchased it when I realized I can do my own gel nails at home for a fraction of the price of a &#x27;professional&#x27; doing them - and they look just as good.  Since it&#x27;s a little flimsy I do allow my nails to cure for a minute longer than recommended (ie 3 minutes as opposed to just 2) and my nails look fabulous.  Good bargain.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the price! I got this to do Harmony Gelish- I doubled the time for each step just to be sure and it works great! I was a little worried at first because my nails stayed tacky after each step, but after doing the top coat I wiped my nails with rubbing alcohol and all the tackiness came off!   Great nails, great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy delivery. I am using my lamp to do my nails just as a professional would. The lamp is perfect! You&#x27;re the best!</li>
            <li> This lamp is a piece of crap!!! I have been tryingto dry my nails for an hour and it is still tacky and i cant even do my hair now. horribly buy.</li>
            <li> You will get what you paid for. for the price of this item the quality is good if you are looking for somrthing that dries faster then youll spend more money but this item work great if you  have the time</li>
            <li> I used this for around an HOUR and my nails were still more than tacky. Maybe I am not letting it \\&quot;heat up\\&quot; enough before, but this does not work for my gel nails. I don&#x27;t understand how it even could, being around 1/3 the strength of other nail dryers. That said, if you just want something to SET your normal nail style, it should probably work. Also, when I got it I thought it was broke and my husband had to play with it for a while to get it to work. You pay for what you get. :/</li>
            <li> The best thing I have owned so far. It does great job for the price. It payed it self off long time ago since I do my own manicure and pedicure. I have it for a year and a half and it still works perfectly and I use it at home once or twice a week. I only wish it was bigger so you could fit both feet or hands at once, but it does its job anyways. Love it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this to use with Gelish polishes, and it works like a charm! It is large and deep, perfect for curing one hand/foot at at time comfortably (your thumb will fit too!). Since it is a 9W bulb instead of a 35W, I just quadruple the time it takes to cure. For Gelish, it would be 4 minutes for Foundation, 4-8 minutes for color (depending on how dark it is), and 8 minutes for the Top Coat. Since I will only do my nails 1-2 times per month, the long cure time is not a downside for me. Make sure you finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol after applying and curing the top coat to remove the tacky layer, and they are perfect! Great product for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry nails. And then broke within one week of owning. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not impressed</li>
            <li> It feels a little cheap and flimsy but for the price...it works. I was afraid at first because the light didn&#x27;t come on but it just needed to be pushed in a bit more. I use it to cure UV gel nails at home and it&#x27;s fine for home use.</li>
            <li> A 9 watt bulb is not enough to cure gel manicures. I left my hands in the lamp for 20 minutes and the polish still was not cured. I&#x27;m going to keep it, but only because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use with Shellac. Noticed other reviewers had issues with hardening. I cure 2min with base coat (expensive salon machines are 30sec). I cure the top coat for 6 min (salon 2 min). Is sticky to the touch but they will harden once you wipe them with 99% alcohol with a paper towel. Follow up with a drop of nail oil then wash hands. They are hard and lovely. Mine are beautiful and last about 1 1/2 weeks - very professional and feel like a plastic coat that protects from breakage.</li>
            <li> This lamp is a little flimsy in that the top and sides are not well connected, BUT it works! It is less expensive than other UV lamps I had priced and the quality is probably less than the more expensive ones, but it gets the job done. It cures my gelish and shellac nail products so that I can do them at home. As other reviewers had suggested, I added more time (I do 2 minutes per coat) given it is only a 9W bulb...so I recommend doing that. Also, keep in mind that it does not dry the coats completely. You must wipe off the tacky, sticky residue (I do so after the base coat and then again after the top coat). If your nails are tacky and sticky, it is probably because you are not following the proper steps of removing the residue, not because the lamp does not work! :) I say go for this cheaper lamp rather than an expensive one!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased  this UV lamp.  I had it between this one (which was cheap) and a more expensive 30w UV lamp for about $60. I am glad I choose this one- though it does take a bit longer for the polish to cure under this lamp, I followed the suggestion of another poster and doubled the time recommended on bottle (I did 2 minutes for the first coat, then 5-6 for the color and top coats) and my nails came out salon perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting more than you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this lamp is not the most industrial, it definitely gets the job done.  After reading other reviews, I took the advice of other users and made sure to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my fingernails for 4-5 minutes per coat as opposed to 1-2 minutes as the instructions state.  The end result was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an absolute STEAL and it does exactly what you need it to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for home use, though and not in a salon.  One good bump or drop and this one&#x27;s done.  Needs a gentle home!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lamp to do Gel nails and I am glad that I did. This lamp works better than the $194.00 OPI lamp that I paid for. This lamp cures gel nails instantly and your clients don&#x27;t have to wait 2-3 minutes. The typcial cure time with this lamp is 1-2 minutes at top! I am glad that I purchased this lamp. You get more out of this lamp than for the cost. Very good purchase and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This does what it&#x27;s meant to.... I got thru spurts of &amp;#34;doing my nails&amp;#34; so didn&#x27;t want to invest alot, and I must say, it worked as advertised.  Packs back away nicely for storing.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to do my nails at home with this lamp.  I like that this lamp allows me to do both hands at the same time but sometimes I feel like the polish isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; all the way.  Other than that.... It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
