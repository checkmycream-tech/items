            <li> This smells delicious and leaves my husband&#x27;s skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Regular Walmart prize but can&#x27;t beat not having to make a run just for soap.</li>
            <li> They smell nothing like gardenia.</li>
            <li> Love the service!!  Got exactly what I wanted!!  It smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Great smelling and gentle. I actually use this soap on my 3 1/2 YO, as I transition him from baby wash to a gentle, sensitive skin soap and this one fits the bill! Sorry a previous customer received a knockoff soap, but the authenic soap is great!</li>
            <li> Overall, for our family, this soap was just ok.  I think one our biggest issues is that the scent of this soap does not have even a hint of gardenia scent (to us).  The description of the gardenia scent is what motivated me to buy this product.  It does have a clean scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s very average.  If you happen to buy it when it&#x27;s on sale, then it might be a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless this soap goes on sale at a deep discount, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past from retail stores and absolutely loved the scent. Unfortunately, what I received is not the Emerald Rush scent, although it was packaged as such. It smells like a generic bar of soap and is definitely not the Emerald Rush scent. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great soap I have bought for years, smells incredible and makes the daily shower more enjoyable. Skin is very soft and does not feel filmy, just very clean and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t stand the strong fragrance so can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Very good actually cheaper than in the store!</li>
            <li> Caress soap is wonderful  This Emerald Rush has a nice fresh scent and leaves your skin soft. My only gripe is it is a soft soap and the bar&lt;br /&gt;does not last long !</li>
            <li> Smells good and its not drying like most soaps</li>
            <li> It really caresses you and the scent excellent will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Caress and have used it for years. For some reason this soap is the messiest I have ever used. Once wet it never seems to dry out. I am forever cleaning up blue soap gunk. Going back to regular Caress</li>
            <li> very fast delivery. found them at my door in one day only. the scent is fabulous. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used Caress Beauty Bar for years however, the Emerald label is new for me nevertheless, I enjoy it just as much as the original Caress Beauty Bar. My skin is soft and it never breaks me out I love this soap every woman should at least try it because it works.</li>
            <li> I could not detect gardenia at all in the strong, and I do mean strong perfume odor of these bars.  Not to my liking at all.  And there is a lot of blue/green dye that comes off the bar onto the washcloth.  Not something I wanted to put on my skin.</li>
