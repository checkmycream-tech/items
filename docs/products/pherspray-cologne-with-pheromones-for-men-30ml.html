    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I tried a lot of pheromones products and this&#x27;s without a doubt the best.</li>
            <li>Smells real good and will get some heads turning when you walk by.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Use it by itself for best results.</li>
            <li>Women want to be close to you and guys want to be your best friend.</li>
            <li>Its incredible!</li>
            <li>Perfect freaking timing because I wanted that moment locked into her memory.</li>

            <li>A really great product, works as described and has a very pleasant smell.</li>

            <li>Good stuff.</li>

            <li>and I got good results with her...</li>
            <li>PherSpray seems to be a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I just what i&#x27;m looking for, o haven&#x27;t proved but seems like a good product, o hope will be helpfull</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This guy works just as good as the oil...</li>
            <li>Smells good, havent had a chance to test its effects though.</li>
            <li>She said hi then said I smelled really good.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that you have to be fairly close to the women</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Effective with a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all three of them.</li>
            <li>This product is very satisfying.</li>
            <li>WIN :-)  .  </li>
            <li>Pher Spray has the best smell of any pheromone product I&#x27;ve ever used, and maybe this contributes to its success.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this is pretty good, not the best though.</li>
            <li>I have been commended on the good smell of this perfume as well, which is honestly probably the pheromones working.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice, It smells really really nice,  and I already noticed that women are wanting to be closer to me and a bit more touchy feely at work.  </li>
            <li>Believe me women love the aroma of them all and respond to it also !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>I have gotten amazing results from women while wearing this product.</li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s something that probably helps you attract the woman to talk to you, but you&#x27;re still on your own in continuing the conversation.</li>
            <li>All it is is a spray that smells nice.</li>
            <li>Then you have to do the rest; be nice and funny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even without factoring in the pheromones, it&#x27;s still a nice smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my good looks or this product, but seems to work, it can&#x27;t hurt, women want to talk more</li>
            <li>I think this product is effective.</li>
            <li>So yea im not buying this product again just because its not so effective and it doesnt affects people like it</li>
            <li>Well honestly I must say its supereffective again.</li>
            <li>They offered to send me their PherSpray Pheromones Cologne at no charge in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li>A nerdy barista at Starbucks seemed to be kind of giggly flirty, dropping money etc.</li>
            <li>kind of how I&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li>I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert.</li>
            <li>I wanted to test some women to see how they liked just the smell.  </li>
            <li>All the women I asked really liked the smell and one I thought was going to rip my arm off because she really liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t just buy it to smell nice but to get attention of chicks.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or cloying, and dries nicely on contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this with doubts as to how effective it was</li>
            <li>I will say its nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was my witty charm and great personality, but the spray didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Original I purchased the oil and thought it smelt great and wanted to try out the cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells excellent by itself or paired with  your normal cologne/aftershave.</li>
            <li>im not the most charming guy in the world, this product subconciously trigger woman to be attracted sexually.</li>
            <li>The pher spray cologne is not as effective as the oil although it has a nice scent and is easier to apply, the oil I think works better.</li>
            <li>I would say yes just out of pure faith after experiencing very pleasant and interesting conversations from wearing PherX Spray &amp; PherX Oil.</li>
            <li>Ok, the smell is nice</li>
            <li>Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women</li>
            <li>so far so good!!</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;ll really be super effective!  </li>
            <li>Women love the scent and get so talkative and panting and nervous around you, makes for a very easy icebreaker.</li>
            <li>I got this product a week ago and it came across as more potent as the original but still had a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and becomes unnoticeable fairly quickly but the pheromones keep working their magic.</li>
            <li>Very attentive.  </li>
            <li>recommend it to anyone who appreciates a noticeably appealing fragrance that&#x27;s effective while not being overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments from a number of fine looking woman on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>when the good guys win you owe it to yourself if your a good guy and want a little edge to get those 9&#x27;s to give you their number.</li>
            <li>OK, here&#x27;s my report: I&#x27;ve been using PherSpray for about 3 weeks now...</li>
            <li>Another benefit is that I feel more confident with people when I&#x27;m using the cologne.</li>
            <li>more possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product free to give an honest review  </li>
            <li>More time might tell.</li>
            <li>and I like it :)</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>This is more of a placebo effect than anything else.</li>
            <li>Pheromones aren&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li>What it does do, however, is give you better odds.</li>
            <li>vvery highly satisfied</li>
            <li>Males have been friendlier and more prone to accept my suggestions.</li>
            <li>I have not been reimbursed for this review in any way and my descriptions are honest and accurate.</li>
            <li>and I noticed more smiles from women and more looks my way.</li>
            <li>If anyone plans on buying this product please don&#x27;t, instead by Axe body spray it will work better.</li>
            <li>I noted women that it effected became more close and touchy as well as showing abstract behavior (Friends that hadn&#x27;t smelled it and were around to also note the behavior often commented about how this wasn&#x27;t like them)</li>
            <li>She said she didn&#x27;t like the smell, and that was ok with me because she still got fired up</li>
            <li>Love the smell, I use it with my regular cologne...its superb!  </li>
            <li>Kept touching me.  </li>
            <li>Will write more as I use more.</li>
            <li>Women of all ages seem to be responding better.</li>
            <li>Who knows for sure.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li>While using the cologne, I noticed that most of the ladies get closer to me while dancing and sometimes kept holding my hand during the instruction part of the class.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m handsome</li>
            <li>It seems to ease people&#x27;s apprehensions around you and make them more relaxed and engaged.</li>
            <li>Also when out on the town, women tend to be more flirty .</li>
            <li>Maybe it just gives a greater boost of self-confidence.  </li>
            <li>smelling healthy for reproduction.</li>
            <li>Most important, it does affect behavior of women!  </li>
            <li>Both products are scams be better off with brut than this crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a better variety of scents to choose from, instead of one &#x27;cologne&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>I do not think anyone should think that this will magically mask any unwelcoming attitude or presentation.</li>
            <li>Get it, and enjoy!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, clean, and pleasant -- not overpowering.</li>
            <li>order more.</li>
            <li>Cant tell you how many smiles and interest I got at resturants and the mall</li>
            <li>glad I bought two bottles at a time .</li>
            <li>they were like you go boy :-).</li>
            <li>I have heard you may get better results using both</li>
            <li>This is more like the Prestige product from this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>right as we were saying our good byes</li>
            <li>Ive been using PherSpray for about 4 days and although it has a nice clean smell, I have noticed NO change in the behavior of females.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but not too strong and really not even like a cologne which is great for me as I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne.</li>
            <li>Seems to work and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>This, allows you to easily cover yourself in sexy pheromones for her delight.</li>
            <li>Even was asked what that great scent was that I was wearing--and I&#x27;ve worn several others but never got this kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Pherx oil is good for establishing trust in different settings but this spray cologne is Superior.  </li>
            <li>is not that accurate as appear for some people , maybe acts as a factor but it wont be magic</li>
            <li>Had a great soft scent.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, and after a shower, it feels great and has a grewat masculine scnet.</li>
            <li>Im convinced its the most important quality women look for in men...</li>
            <li>They seem to be more attentive, responsibe, and smiley.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is really work is really good smell</li>
            <li>or maybe I&#x27;m just extremely good looking, either or haha.</li>
            <li>so here it is, the product is good only for the reson that it makes you feel more confident, and it does work but don&#x27;t expect magic.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and I am satisfied This stuff works!</li>
            <li>I notice a lot more women are really friendly to me when I have it on.  </li>
            <li>I also seem to have more friendly communications with all people I encounter, but that is just an opening.</li>
            <li>It indeed has 2 more milligrams than the original</li>
            <li>but I made sure I was neat and clean as always</li>
            <li>Once you noticed signs of engaging, be ready to keep the momentum with a good conversation and compliments.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li>If I was full of energy, I may have landed some pretty good conversations.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant fragrance to it and also very easy to use when compared to the dab-on oil of the same strength.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, feel more confident, too early to tell maximum effect.</li>
            <li>First off, this is an honest review.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty thrilled I decided to buy this</li>
            <li>The oil seems to be more effective though, and the price per bottle is a bit too high.</li>
            <li>so it works best with less clothing, t-shirts and shorts, you know, so</li>
            <li>The smell  is very pleasant and it pairs well with other colognes.</li>
            <li>I got this product via a free offer (which I love)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The real test was going to be on my gf who responded amazingly to it.</li>
            <li>Women are complimentary, more chatty and downright &amp;#34;huggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Females seem talkative and comfortable around me and it becomes easier to chat with females.</li>
            <li>I recieved this as a free sample to try.</li>
            <li>Eye contact is important.</li>
            <li>They also stare to my eyes more often and they cannot stop to smile to me.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I got this bottle free in order to test and review it.  </li>
            <li>Our sex life is great, but this just gave it and extra omph that I wanted from her.</li>
            <li>In one night 4 numbers and confirmed dates in three hours</li>
            <li>I suggest using an unscented deodorant to allow the pheromones to mix with some of your natural scent, as this is more effective.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell, soft yet noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I tried both this and the pherx spray, being the first colognes I&#x27;ve tried they smell pretty good</li>
            <li>It really works, I love the scent, the ladies love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m completely in awe on how good this works.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for any ones that wants to feel attractive to women&#x27;s, they likes it , I used with my girlfriend and it really works...</li>
            <li>This product actually smells good unlike others and I get more stares from girls</li>
            <li>The wait-staff seemed extra attentive as well as very courteous.</li>
            <li>it was shipped very quickly and they were cool.</li>
            <li>Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend seems to enjoy it quite a bit more so then higher end fragrances..</li>
            <li>Very interesting reaction from 38-40 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>From my experience with the product, it helped with making a woman that I have been dating more interested in my company.</li>
            <li>PherSpray is a uniquely scented cologne for men infused with pheromones meant to attract women.</li>
            <li>me test if my new cologne still smelled nice.  </li>
            <li>but they will be willing to talk to you, to find you nice and funny.</li>
            <li>Scent is clean and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>There is a reason they are so many positive review</li>
            <li>Firstly, Zyloo sent me this free of charge to test and review, secondly, I&#x27;m not an overly attractive man.</li>
            <li>and she put her nose right to my wrist and breathed deep lol.  </li>
            <li>the smell is very nice just started using it not sure if it&#x27;s working yet but does really smell good</li>
            <li>it gives you a special feeling.</li>
            <li>Very good cologne and would recomend to any guy having trouble scoring a date.</li>
            <li>: After being intimate, I put it on and her response was much more emotionally intimate, loving and genuinely desirable than before I started using this product before, during and after being intimate.)</li>
            <li>This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read</li>
            <li>and she literally will come up to me and take a deep sniff telling me I smell good for some reason</li>
            <li>Play it cool.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to spark their sexual chemistry.</li>
            <li>but maybe there really is some magic in this spray that works.</li>
            <li>Now I have to decide if the cologne attracted her to me or if it was just my own natural sex appeal oozing out of my pores.  </li>
            <li>It only smells good.</li>
            <li>but much easier to apply, and able to spray/walk thru it for maximum area coverage.</li>
            <li>Once you noticed signs of engaging, be ready to keep the momentum with a good conversation and compliments.my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for being in a classroom or in a setting where you&#x27;ll be in proximity of women for more then a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it will attract the ladies in the same manner, its like magic..  </li>
            <li>But I enjoyed the product and will most likely repurchase again.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of quick sprays is all you need.</li>
            <li>Women were more open and hung on to me for most of the night.</li>
            <li>Be smooth, confident, masculine, complimenting.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>It was really that quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Well I went to one of the premier nightclubs in town and got 4 numbers and four dates for the week, no other pheromone product I have tried ever got me that kind of success rate</li>
            <li>to when used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;The most important things to remember are that you shouldn&#x27;t over-spray (1-2 spritzes is plenty), don&#x27;t use strong colognes or body sprays with it (these will render it ineffective), and that follow-through is entirely on you (if you suck at talking to women, fix that first).</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the best way to do it and take a shower before you wear it at last long for 3 to 4 hour</li>
            <li>Rest of the day, I had some fairly extended conversations with plenty of people that normally are too busy to affordthat time.  </li>
            <li>and I feel it really works!!</li>
            <li>Pure Instinct, which I also started using (not concurrently) at around the same period, seems to work better and its scent is more of my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Do not mix this with any other kind of pheromone as it will be too strong.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great smells like a quality cologne and not a cheap body spray.</li>
            <li>So I calmly said &amp;</li>
            <li>I really like the light smell it has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun experience.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s simply a matter of choice, pre-planning and is as honest as buying a card, flowers or lighting a candle to set the &#x27;mood&#x27;.</li>
            <li>yeah, just a spray seems to turn a head, or get a smile, the rest is up to you.</li>
            <li>be sure to wear early in the morning</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have had much success while using this.</li>
            <li>Also androtics is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This product has more of a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>#34;Mmm, that was nice, let me try&amp;#34; and I did the same thing to her.</li>
            <li>Experiment with the ladies and have fun.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been ok</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>im not trying to be a kiss-ass, i just want people to know what they are buying and if it is worth&#x27;d.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, but the bottle purchased was only half full.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping product has an awesome scent when passing by some women they all looked up and said hello that usually does not happen!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would buy it again if for no other reason than it genuinely smells good and is reasonably-priced.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the item, but for best results spray ten to fifteen minutes before getting to the destination that you want to be so as to let it evaporate enough but not dissipate!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good smelling cologne, if it has any other benefits that&#x27;s gravy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in!!&lt;br /&gt;Received the PherSpray and put it to work right away.</li>
            <li>and she was right up on my neck sniffing away.</li>
            <li>She was finding reasons to get close to me, making up excuses that I needed to &amp;#34;feel right here for me&amp;#34; and putting her hands on me &amp;#34;oh, do you work out, it feels like you do.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>pure fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but sweet smelling fragrance....</li>
            <li>I like arouse rx and pherx better then this because arouse gets me major dihl and ioi and pherx gets me celeb treatment from people.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received the bottle and it was full to the rim with cologne!</li>
            <li>This is certainly doing something!</li>
            <li>and I hope she will be familiarized to anticipate feeling calm, relaxed, open, receptive to me and that will make the transition into a more harmonious relationship</li>
            <li>I politely said thank you very much</li>
            <li>The scent is light and clean and doesn&#x27;t clash with similar colognes.</li>
            <li>I cannot provide fewer or more stars since I only tested it on my wife.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a pheromone product.</li>
            <li>Love its spray application but can&#x27;t say the same for the scent - which is way too woody / oak-y for my taste.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to all who are interested.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and I am  satisfied enough to order again and recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li>did the first time around.</li>
            <li>This really seemed to make a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>I see a lot of women, so I have been able to have a much larger sample audience in a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I went to the posted reviews before placing my order and had clear expectations in the light of my understanding of the biological basis in play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other girl&lt;br /&gt;there was just sort of friendly, but sometimes is more chatty, the really pretty one hides from me no matter what, ha,ha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first at thought it was just a joke , but once I started using the product</li>
            <li>Definitely, getting some enjoyed attention.</li>
            <li>Ive tried everything and this has been the on only product that worked with me in my more sociall intimal life</li>
            <li>its instinctual for hot chicks to look for men with a scent of dominance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a simple, unassuming smell, like aftershave but better.  </li>
            <li>This really seemed to make a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>I am giving it a one star higher review.  </li>
            <li>I have used several pheromones in the past, but this one has been most successful.</li>
            <li>Then put your regular cologne on, and I swear these work magic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to get more when I start running low.</li>
            <li>But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting.</li>
            <li>At first I read about pheromones and found out they exist.  </li>
            <li>After the first won I bought</li>
            <li>I do notice a difference while wearing PherX products whether it be more confidence or getting more attention than usual.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I went to a mall, and had some good conversations with a few saleswomen.</li>
            <li>A beautiful woman sat down right next to me and was visibly flushed.</li>
            <li>Since using this I have had married women tipping me for no reason at all and single women coming back to the store \\&quot;just looking\\&quot;, in an auto parts store lol.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the product I saw some major ioi and hits from women and even some men(not gay btw).</li>
            <li>Many ppl think that good reviews are fake...</li>
            <li>have tried it, and I notice some mildly positive effects.</li>
            <li>Also, what surprises me is that men seem to treat me much better, more open and friendly  -- not the usual macho face-off.</li>
            <li>This cologne with pheromones smells amazing, the scent in not too strong nor too weak.</li>
            <li>After trying a few different products I noticed positive results with the Zyloo formula.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered more Zyloo PherSpray Cologne to replace my more expensive colognes since it smells great too!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before moving into further detail I will state that I am a biologist with strong background in Animal Behavior.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct.</li>
            <li>Instant on sure would have been nice; I had to work for it as usual</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, and if she gets close enough</li>
            <li>Did not affect everyone and seemed to have less of an effect of my girlfriend, but in general a great way to help break the ice if you are struggling in that area or just want to meet new friends.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product in the future, thanks Zylo Labs for this free sample ^^.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more subtle scent, therefore easily blends with any cover scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging: Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap)&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
            <li>Much more..inviting.</li>
            <li>and it really does work, though not always how you think it will.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really attract women</li>
            <li>but man this stuff really works .......</li>
            <li>It does work however and if all you need is for women to be more open and calm around you then this will definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li>Thanks for allowing me to do a review.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to explain this stuff.</li>
            <li>Undeniably very manly.</li>
            <li>and they kept talking during the whole dance.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d better be careful, because you&#x27;re entering the Danger Zone.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say it works, will try it again.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>She was even still very touchy afterwards.</li>
            <li>Be ready to handle the changes.</li>
            <li>Shipping is incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li>Seems to work so far initially after 1 time use - so far so good (made love) - a definite &#x27;openness&#x27; as a result emotionally on her part.&lt;br /&gt;Product: NOT 100% organic derived substances for those staying away from toxic additives/suspensions...</li>
            <li>if this product &#x27;induces&#x27; this biochemically, and we both want to feel &#x27;love&#x27; towards each other it makes sense to use this &#x27;aid&#x27;</li>
            <li>Great smell , last long time and totally the pheromones work.</li>
            <li>As a precaution, I keep my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li>Twice in the last week two women even started a conversation with me out of nowhere and one of them I gave my email address to, she was so friendly and warmed up to me.  </li>
            <li>Two very important factors in this fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and it is long lasting, Keep in mind that after you put it on your body, you will become desensitized to the odor, but it is still there and more importantly, the pheromones are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it smells decent and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>All of them had decent and some better than other results.</li>
            <li>They generally seem more friendly around me and try to get a little closer than normal.</li>
            <li>my other half had more of a sexual chemistry with men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear Colognes on the whole</li>
            <li>Just as effective if not more so.</li>
            <li>and we let our guards down seemingly like magic</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is from my experiences that if PherSpray is worn, and with confidence, then women will at the very least, become more attentive towards you.</li>
            <li>Im already a decent looking guy</li>
            <li>So, with that said I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this stuff.</li>
            <li>My wife just said that she is wondering what is happening at the dance school that suddenly everyone, including the female teachers are so friendly with me!</li>
            <li>I am no pretty boy and last night I was cashing in better than all my pretty boy friends</li>
            <li>: The product has a gentle smell that when applied gave me and my wife both a very calm feeling towards each other</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly strong though, so it&#x27;s not as well suited as the oils for combining with other scents.</li>
            <li>Immediately got a smile and big &amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34; from a cutie, just my type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The order was delivered before the expected day, well protected and without big labels on the envelope, which is a good thing, especially if someone else besides you gets the mail for you.</li>
            <li>the product actually works and this product is worth your every dollar.</li>
            <li>Now, that may seem completely normal</li>
            <li>but it smells a little more classy.</li>
            <li>like I may have put something new up there for her.</li>
            <li>I told her to go ahead, but she had to tell me what she thought of my new cologne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some magical product that will turn you into the Pied Piper of sex, but if you are a little confident and funny, at the very least women will hold a conversation with you.</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight, clear spray with a subtle, unusually pleasing scent - I like the smell of it, and so do most of the women I&#x27;m around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems very natural.</li>
            <li>She was much more relaxed and touchy-feely than usual.</li>
            <li>Used around the office building and with my significant other</li>
            <li>and I seem to be getting more attention from the ladies than usual.</li>
            <li>Significant other didn&#x27;t seem to notice the scent but that&#x27;s after I showered.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;m highly sensitive to whatever is in this stuff and don&#x27;t want to feel like this again!</li>
            <li>so I plan to keep my eyes open if this works well, and plan on updating this post in the near future as seems fit.</li>
            <li>I went out on a first date last week</li>
            <li>But it did seem to get me more attention than usual when I went downtown with it.</li>
            <li>Pherspray is not bad at all, i bought the pherx 18mg its basically just the same, smells the same.</li>
            <li>But now, since using Pher Spray, I noticed right away how decent looking women are now deliberately coming over to sit next or as close to me as possible.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work to some extent, and I have confirmed it does not work on every single female, it depends.</li>
            <li>These pheromones work better for me because the women have actually approached me, whereas with others, I&#x27;ve had to do a little work.</li>
            <li>I was low on energy from the day of work, but I noticed women around me look my way a little more often.</li>
            <li>that I had never met, the effects were clear.</li>
            <li>I have tried it at work and so far the women have been initiating conversations with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decided to give some of these pheremone colognes a try and so far, not seeing any difference in how women react to me.</li>
            <li>I used it and its actually works, thanks for zyloo laboratory</li>
            <li>This seems to be working better than PherX. At least for me it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hitting it in and I was surprised with the increased amount of attention I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I am a very self-aware man, not prone to mistake placebo confidence for actual attention.</li>
            <li>others don&#x27;t, iv used pher spray 3 times so far</li>
            <li>the package arrived on time and was packaged professionally.</li>
            <li>If the product is applied properly, women become much friendlier, and may find you irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bald early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t DO anything different, I used it a few more times</li>
            <li>I had my doubts when I purchased and read the advertisements for Pheromone products; honestly, I believe these products profit and prey on us guys who are naive enough to think</li>
            <li>Ever since using this for a few days, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from my female co-workers.</li>
            <li>The ladies are more open to chat and seem to desire some heavy flirting.</li>
            <li>Works best if you put on a lightly-scented EDT as a base layer and this over it (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li>Additionally, the time of the estrous cycle influence the response as well as other specific environmental factors such as temperature, distance and exposure time.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quantity, I got my best results by using just 1 spray but spread with the fingers to the pulse areas on the neck and behind the earlobes.&lt;br</li>

            <li>if you know what I mean :-).</li>
            <li>If there weren&#x27;t other people in the house trying to sleep, we&#x27;d have had it out right there.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t recently bought any brand new clothing</li>
            <li>Subtle, but powerful!!</li>
            <li>I have used this half dozen times and women seem to stand closer to me and smile a lot.</li>
            <li>but it is not due to the product not working.</li>
            <li>but it is not due to the product not working.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, and I just chuckle on how I have this secret weapon on my arsenal!</li>
            <li>I guess I will wear it as a light cologne when at work; if I receive undeserved attention from anyone else, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it from myself whenever I spray it, so I tend to spray a lot around my pulse areas.</li>
            <li>Used it only once so far.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much friendlier, but not as flirty as I expected.</li>
            <li>She started speaking to me completely out of the blue and ended up giving me her number.</li>
            <li>One pump does give a large spray but other than that no compaints.  </li>
            <li>There must have been a dozen or so chairs, but she decided to sit down right next to me.  </li>
            <li>This time im getting neglible results, that or im not use to the product as its been a little minute when I first got this as a freebie.</li>
            <li>This product does not work for me, the smell is not strong and it goes away very fast, i needed to ask my friend if she smell something</li>
            <li>The first day I got it I sprayed a little on and went to a local coffee shop.</li>
            <li>method: Too much spray per pump (typical of these styled pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones:</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away and the bottle is small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>Not a huge  effect but certainly a noticeable one.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that it dispenses a bit too much with a single pump.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given my bottle at no cost after purchasing another of this company&#x27;s products.</li>

            <li> You have to get the balls and do part of the work and keep a good interaction.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> However, it has been fairly noticeable how women interact with me.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Product smells good and my wife likes it too.  </li>
            <li> coz its working really good, and</li>
            <li> Has a really good smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I got good results with her...</li>
            <li> PherSpray seems to be a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li> I just what i&#x27;m looking for, o haven&#x27;t proved but seems like a good product, o hope will be helpfull</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This guy works just as good as the oil...</li>
            <li> Smells good, havent had a chance to test its effects though.</li>
            <li> She said hi then said I smelled really good.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that you have to be fairly close to the women</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Effective with a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all three of them.</li>
            <li> This product is very satisfying.</li>
            <li> WIN :-)  .  </li>
            <li> Pher Spray has the best smell of any pheromone product I&#x27;ve ever used, and maybe this contributes to its success.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this is pretty good, not the best though.</li>
            <li> I have been commended on the good smell of this perfume as well, which is honestly probably the pheromones working.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, It smells really really nice,  and I already noticed that women are wanting to be closer to me and a bit more touchy feely at work.  </li>
            <li> Believe me women love the aroma of them all and respond to it also !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> I have gotten amazing results from women while wearing this product.</li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> Either way it&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s something that probably helps you attract the woman to talk to you, but you&#x27;re still on your own in continuing the conversation.</li>
            <li> All it is is a spray that smells nice.</li>
            <li> Then you have to do the rest; be nice and funny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even without factoring in the pheromones, it&#x27;s still a nice smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my good looks or this product, but seems to work, it can&#x27;t hurt, women want to talk more</li>
            <li> I think this product is effective.</li>
            <li> So yea im not buying this product again just because its not so effective and it doesnt affects people like it</li>
            <li> Well honestly I must say its supereffective again.</li>
            <li> They offered to send me their PherSpray Pheromones Cologne at no charge in return for an honest review.</li>
            <li> A nerdy barista at Starbucks seemed to be kind of giggly flirty, dropping money etc.</li>
            <li> kind of how I&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li> I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert.</li>
            <li> I wanted to test some women to see how they liked just the smell.  </li>
            <li> All the women I asked really liked the smell and one I thought was going to rip my arm off because she really liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t just buy it to smell nice but to get attention of chicks.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or cloying, and dries nicely on contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this with doubts as to how effective it was</li>
            <li> I will say its nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was my witty charm and great personality, but the spray didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Original I purchased the oil and thought it smelt great and wanted to try out the cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells excellent by itself or paired with  your normal cologne/aftershave.</li>
            <li> im not the most charming guy in the world, this product subconciously trigger woman to be attracted sexually.</li>
            <li> The pher spray cologne is not as effective as the oil although it has a nice scent and is easier to apply, the oil I think works better.</li>
            <li> I would say yes just out of pure faith after experiencing very pleasant and interesting conversations from wearing PherX Spray &amp; PherX Oil.</li>
            <li> Ok, the smell is nice</li>
            <li> Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women</li>
            <li> so far so good!!</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;ll really be super effective!  </li>
            <li> Women love the scent and get so talkative and panting and nervous around you, makes for a very easy icebreaker.</li>
            <li> I got this product a week ago and it came across as more potent as the original but still had a pleasant sent.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and becomes unnoticeable fairly quickly but the pheromones keep working their magic.</li>
            <li> Very attentive.  </li>
            <li> recommend it to anyone who appreciates a noticeably appealing fragrance that&#x27;s effective while not being overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments from a number of fine looking woman on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> when the good guys win you owe it to yourself if your a good guy and want a little edge to get those 9&#x27;s to give you their number.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s my report: I&#x27;ve been using PherSpray for about 3 weeks now...</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that I feel more confident with people when I&#x27;m using the cologne.</li>
            <li> more possible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product free to give an honest review  </li>
            <li> More time might tell.</li>
            <li> and I like it :)</li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> This is more of a placebo effect than anything else.</li>
            <li> Pheromones aren&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li> What it does do, however, is give you better odds.</li>
            <li> vvery highly satisfied</li>
            <li> Males have been friendlier and more prone to accept my suggestions.</li>
            <li> I have not been reimbursed for this review in any way and my descriptions are honest and accurate.</li>
            <li> and I noticed more smiles from women and more looks my way.</li>
            <li> If anyone plans on buying this product please don&#x27;t, instead by Axe body spray it will work better.</li>
            <li> I noted women that it effected became more close and touchy as well as showing abstract behavior (Friends that hadn&#x27;t smelled it and were around to also note the behavior often commented about how this wasn&#x27;t like them)</li>
            <li> She said she didn&#x27;t like the smell, and that was ok with me because she still got fired up</li>
            <li> Love the smell, I use it with my regular cologne...its superb!  </li>
            <li> Kept touching me.  </li>
            <li> Will write more as I use more.</li>
            <li> Women of all ages seem to be responding better.</li>
            <li> Who knows for sure.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok though.</li>
            <li> While using the cologne, I noticed that most of the ladies get closer to me while dancing and sometimes kept holding my hand during the instruction part of the class.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m handsome</li>
            <li> It seems to ease people&#x27;s apprehensions around you and make them more relaxed and engaged.</li>
            <li> Also when out on the town, women tend to be more flirty .</li>
            <li> Maybe it just gives a greater boost of self-confidence.  </li>
            <li> smelling healthy for reproduction.</li>
            <li> Most important, it does affect behavior of women!  </li>
            <li> Both products are scams be better off with brut than this crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish there was a better variety of scents to choose from, instead of one &#x27;cologne&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> I do not think anyone should think that this will magically mask any unwelcoming attitude or presentation.</li>
            <li> Get it, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, clean, and pleasant -- not overpowering.</li>
            <li> order more.</li>
            <li> Cant tell you how many smiles and interest I got at resturants and the mall</li>
            <li> glad I bought two bottles at a time .</li>
            <li> they were like you go boy :-).</li>
            <li> I have heard you may get better results using both</li>
            <li> This is more like the Prestige product from this manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> right as we were saying our good byes</li>
            <li> Ive been using PherSpray for about 4 days and although it has a nice clean smell, I have noticed NO change in the behavior of females.  </li>
            <li> Smells great but not too strong and really not even like a cologne which is great for me as I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne.</li>
            <li> Seems to work and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This, allows you to easily cover yourself in sexy pheromones for her delight.</li>
            <li> Even was asked what that great scent was that I was wearing--and I&#x27;ve worn several others but never got this kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Pherx oil is good for establishing trust in different settings but this spray cologne is Superior.  </li>
            <li> is not that accurate as appear for some people , maybe acts as a factor but it wont be magic</li>
            <li> Had a great soft scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and after a shower, it feels great and has a grewat masculine scnet.</li>
            <li> Im convinced its the most important quality women look for in men...</li>
            <li> They seem to be more attentive, responsibe, and smiley.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is really work is really good smell</li>
            <li> or maybe I&#x27;m just extremely good looking, either or haha.</li>
            <li> so here it is, the product is good only for the reson that it makes you feel more confident, and it does work but don&#x27;t expect magic.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and I am satisfied This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I notice a lot more women are really friendly to me when I have it on.  </li>
            <li> I also seem to have more friendly communications with all people I encounter, but that is just an opening.</li>
            <li> It indeed has 2 more milligrams than the original</li>
            <li> but I made sure I was neat and clean as always</li>
            <li> Once you noticed signs of engaging, be ready to keep the momentum with a good conversation and compliments.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li> If I was full of energy, I may have landed some pretty good conversations.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant fragrance to it and also very easy to use when compared to the dab-on oil of the same strength.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, feel more confident, too early to tell maximum effect.</li>
            <li> First off, this is an honest review.</li>
            <li> The scent itself is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty thrilled I decided to buy this</li>
            <li> The oil seems to be more effective though, and the price per bottle is a bit too high.</li>
            <li> so it works best with less clothing, t-shirts and shorts, you know, so</li>
            <li> The smell  is very pleasant and it pairs well with other colognes.</li>
            <li> I got this product via a free offer (which I love)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The real test was going to be on my gf who responded amazingly to it.</li>
            <li> Women are complimentary, more chatty and downright &amp;#34;huggy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Females seem talkative and comfortable around me and it becomes easier to chat with females.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a free sample to try.</li>
            <li> Eye contact is important.</li>
            <li> They also stare to my eyes more often and they cannot stop to smile to me.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I got this bottle free in order to test and review it.  </li>
            <li> Our sex life is great, but this just gave it and extra omph that I wanted from her.</li>
            <li> In one night 4 numbers and confirmed dates in three hours</li>
            <li> I suggest using an unscented deodorant to allow the pheromones to mix with some of your natural scent, as this is more effective.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell, soft yet noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I tried both this and the pherx spray, being the first colognes I&#x27;ve tried they smell pretty good</li>
            <li> It really works, I love the scent, the ladies love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m completely in awe on how good this works.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for any ones that wants to feel attractive to women&#x27;s, they likes it , I used with my girlfriend and it really works...</li>
            <li> This product actually smells good unlike others and I get more stares from girls</li>
            <li> The wait-staff seemed extra attentive as well as very courteous.</li>
            <li> it was shipped very quickly and they were cool.</li>
            <li> Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend seems to enjoy it quite a bit more so then higher end fragrances..</li>
            <li> Very interesting reaction from 38-40 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> From my experience with the product, it helped with making a woman that I have been dating more interested in my company.</li>
            <li> PherSpray is a uniquely scented cologne for men infused with pheromones meant to attract women.</li>
            <li> me test if my new cologne still smelled nice.  </li>
            <li> but they will be willing to talk to you, to find you nice and funny.</li>
            <li> Scent is clean and not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> There is a reason they are so many positive review</li>
            <li> Firstly, Zyloo sent me this free of charge to test and review, secondly, I&#x27;m not an overly attractive man.</li>
            <li> and she put her nose right to my wrist and breathed deep lol.  </li>
            <li> the smell is very nice just started using it not sure if it&#x27;s working yet but does really smell good</li>
            <li> it gives you a special feeling.</li>
            <li> Very good cologne and would recomend to any guy having trouble scoring a date.</li>
            <li> : After being intimate, I put it on and her response was much more emotionally intimate, loving and genuinely desirable than before I started using this product before, during and after being intimate.)</li>
            <li> This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read</li>
            <li> and she literally will come up to me and take a deep sniff telling me I smell good for some reason</li>
            <li> Play it cool.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to spark their sexual chemistry.</li>
            <li> but maybe there really is some magic in this spray that works.</li>
            <li> Now I have to decide if the cologne attracted her to me or if it was just my own natural sex appeal oozing out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> It only smells good.</li>
            <li> but much easier to apply, and able to spray/walk thru it for maximum area coverage.</li>
            <li> Once you noticed signs of engaging, be ready to keep the momentum with a good conversation and compliments.my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for being in a classroom or in a setting where you&#x27;ll be in proximity of women for more then a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it will attract the ladies in the same manner, its like magic..  </li>
            <li> But I enjoyed the product and will most likely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of quick sprays is all you need.</li>
            <li> Women were more open and hung on to me for most of the night.</li>
            <li> Be smooth, confident, masculine, complimenting.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> It was really that quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Well I went to one of the premier nightclubs in town and got 4 numbers and four dates for the week, no other pheromone product I have tried ever got me that kind of success rate</li>
            <li> to when used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;The most important things to remember are that you shouldn&#x27;t over-spray (1-2 spritzes is plenty), don&#x27;t use strong colognes or body sprays with it (these will render it ineffective), and that follow-through is entirely on you (if you suck at talking to women, fix that first).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the best way to do it and take a shower before you wear it at last long for 3 to 4 hour</li>
            <li> Rest of the day, I had some fairly extended conversations with plenty of people that normally are too busy to affordthat time.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it really works!!</li>
            <li> Pure Instinct, which I also started using (not concurrently) at around the same period, seems to work better and its scent is more of my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Do not mix this with any other kind of pheromone as it will be too strong.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great smells like a quality cologne and not a cheap body spray.</li>
            <li> So I calmly said &amp;</li>
            <li> I really like the light smell it has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun experience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s simply a matter of choice, pre-planning and is as honest as buying a card, flowers or lighting a candle to set the &#x27;mood&#x27;.</li>
            <li> yeah, just a spray seems to turn a head, or get a smile, the rest is up to you.</li>
            <li> be sure to wear early in the morning</li>
            <li> it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have had much success while using this.</li>
            <li> Also androtics is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This product has more of a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> #34;Mmm, that was nice, let me try&amp;#34; and I did the same thing to her.</li>
            <li> Experiment with the ladies and have fun.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s been ok</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> im not trying to be a kiss-ass, i just want people to know what they are buying and if it is worth&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, but the bottle purchased was only half full.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product has an awesome scent when passing by some women they all looked up and said hello that usually does not happen!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would buy it again if for no other reason than it genuinely smells good and is reasonably-priced.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the item, but for best results spray ten to fifteen minutes before getting to the destination that you want to be so as to let it evaporate enough but not dissipate!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good smelling cologne, if it has any other benefits that&#x27;s gravy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in!!&lt;br /&gt;Received the PherSpray and put it to work right away.</li>
            <li> and she was right up on my neck sniffing away.</li>
            <li> She was finding reasons to get close to me, making up excuses that I needed to &amp;#34;feel right here for me&amp;#34; and putting her hands on me &amp;#34;oh, do you work out, it feels like you do.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> pure fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but sweet smelling fragrance....</li>
            <li> I like arouse rx and pherx better then this because arouse gets me major dihl and ioi and pherx gets me celeb treatment from people.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the bottle and it was full to the rim with cologne!</li>
            <li> This is certainly doing something!</li>
            <li> and I hope she will be familiarized to anticipate feeling calm, relaxed, open, receptive to me and that will make the transition into a more harmonious relationship</li>
            <li> I politely said thank you very much</li>
            <li> The scent is light and clean and doesn&#x27;t clash with similar colognes.</li>
            <li> I cannot provide fewer or more stars since I only tested it on my wife.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a pheromone product.</li>
            <li> Love its spray application but can&#x27;t say the same for the scent - which is way too woody / oak-y for my taste.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to all who are interested.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and I am  satisfied enough to order again and recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li> did the first time around.</li>
            <li> This really seemed to make a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of women, so I have been able to have a much larger sample audience in a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I went to the posted reviews before placing my order and had clear expectations in the light of my understanding of the biological basis in play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other girl&lt;br /&gt;there was just sort of friendly, but sometimes is more chatty, the really pretty one hides from me no matter what, ha,ha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first at thought it was just a joke , but once I started using the product</li>
            <li> Definitely, getting some enjoyed attention.</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything and this has been the on only product that worked with me in my more sociall intimal life</li>
            <li> its instinctual for hot chicks to look for men with a scent of dominance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It has a simple, unassuming smell, like aftershave but better.  </li>
            <li> This really seemed to make a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I am giving it a one star higher review.  </li>
            <li> I have used several pheromones in the past, but this one has been most successful.</li>
            <li> Then put your regular cologne on, and I swear these work magic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to get more when I start running low.</li>
            <li> But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting.</li>
            <li> At first I read about pheromones and found out they exist.  </li>
            <li> After the first won I bought</li>
            <li> I do notice a difference while wearing PherX products whether it be more confidence or getting more attention than usual.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I went to a mall, and had some good conversations with a few saleswomen.</li>
            <li> A beautiful woman sat down right next to me and was visibly flushed.</li>
            <li> Since using this I have had married women tipping me for no reason at all and single women coming back to the store \\&quot;just looking\\&quot;, in an auto parts store lol.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the product I saw some major ioi and hits from women and even some men(not gay btw).</li>
            <li> Many ppl think that good reviews are fake...</li>
            <li> have tried it, and I notice some mildly positive effects.</li>
            <li> Also, what surprises me is that men seem to treat me much better, more open and friendly  -- not the usual macho face-off.</li>
            <li> This cologne with pheromones smells amazing, the scent in not too strong nor too weak.</li>
            <li> After trying a few different products I noticed positive results with the Zyloo formula.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered more Zyloo PherSpray Cologne to replace my more expensive colognes since it smells great too!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before moving into further detail I will state that I am a biologist with strong background in Animal Behavior.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct.</li>
            <li> Instant on sure would have been nice; I had to work for it as usual</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, and if she gets close enough</li>
            <li> Did not affect everyone and seemed to have less of an effect of my girlfriend, but in general a great way to help break the ice if you are struggling in that area or just want to meet new friends.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product in the future, thanks Zylo Labs for this free sample ^^.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more subtle scent, therefore easily blends with any cover scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap)&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
            <li> Much more..inviting.</li>
            <li> and it really does work, though not always how you think it will.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really attract women</li>
            <li> but man this stuff really works .......</li>
            <li> It does work however and if all you need is for women to be more open and calm around you then this will definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> Thanks for allowing me to do a review.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to explain this stuff.</li>
            <li> Undeniably very manly.</li>
            <li> and they kept talking during the whole dance.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d better be careful, because you&#x27;re entering the Danger Zone.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say it works, will try it again.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> She was even still very touchy afterwards.</li>
            <li> Be ready to handle the changes.</li>
            <li> Shipping is incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Seems to work so far initially after 1 time use - so far so good (made love) - a definite &#x27;openness&#x27; as a result emotionally on her part.&lt;br /&gt;Product: NOT 100% organic derived substances for those staying away from toxic additives/suspensions...</li>
            <li> if this product &#x27;induces&#x27; this biochemically, and we both want to feel &#x27;love&#x27; towards each other it makes sense to use this &#x27;aid&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great smell , last long time and totally the pheromones work.</li>
            <li> As a precaution, I keep my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li> Twice in the last week two women even started a conversation with me out of nowhere and one of them I gave my email address to, she was so friendly and warmed up to me.  </li>
            <li> Two very important factors in this fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and it is long lasting, Keep in mind that after you put it on your body, you will become desensitized to the odor, but it is still there and more importantly, the pheromones are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it smells decent and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> All of them had decent and some better than other results.</li>
            <li> They generally seem more friendly around me and try to get a little closer than normal.</li>
            <li> my other half had more of a sexual chemistry with men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear Colognes on the whole</li>
            <li> Just as effective if not more so.</li>
            <li> and we let our guards down seemingly like magic</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is from my experiences that if PherSpray is worn, and with confidence, then women will at the very least, become more attentive towards you.</li>
            <li> Im already a decent looking guy</li>
            <li> So, with that said I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife just said that she is wondering what is happening at the dance school that suddenly everyone, including the female teachers are so friendly with me!</li>
            <li> I am no pretty boy and last night I was cashing in better than all my pretty boy friends</li>
            <li> : The product has a gentle smell that when applied gave me and my wife both a very calm feeling towards each other</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly strong though, so it&#x27;s not as well suited as the oils for combining with other scents.</li>
            <li> Immediately got a smile and big &amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34; from a cutie, just my type.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The order was delivered before the expected day, well protected and without big labels on the envelope, which is a good thing, especially if someone else besides you gets the mail for you.</li>
            <li> the product actually works and this product is worth your every dollar.</li>
            <li> Now, that may seem completely normal</li>
            <li> but it smells a little more classy.</li>
            <li> like I may have put something new up there for her.</li>
            <li> I told her to go ahead, but she had to tell me what she thought of my new cologne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some magical product that will turn you into the Pied Piper of sex, but if you are a little confident and funny, at the very least women will hold a conversation with you.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight, clear spray with a subtle, unusually pleasing scent - I like the smell of it, and so do most of the women I&#x27;m around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems very natural.</li>
            <li> She was much more relaxed and touchy-feely than usual.</li>
            <li> Used around the office building and with my significant other</li>
            <li> and I seem to be getting more attention from the ladies than usual.</li>
            <li> Significant other didn&#x27;t seem to notice the scent but that&#x27;s after I showered.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;m highly sensitive to whatever is in this stuff and don&#x27;t want to feel like this again!</li>
            <li> so I plan to keep my eyes open if this works well, and plan on updating this post in the near future as seems fit.</li>
            <li> I went out on a first date last week</li>
            <li> But it did seem to get me more attention than usual when I went downtown with it.</li>
            <li> Pherspray is not bad at all, i bought the pherx 18mg its basically just the same, smells the same.</li>
            <li> But now, since using Pher Spray, I noticed right away how decent looking women are now deliberately coming over to sit next or as close to me as possible.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work to some extent, and I have confirmed it does not work on every single female, it depends.</li>
            <li> These pheromones work better for me because the women have actually approached me, whereas with others, I&#x27;ve had to do a little work.</li>
            <li> I was low on energy from the day of work, but I noticed women around me look my way a little more often.</li>
            <li> that I had never met, the effects were clear.</li>
            <li> I have tried it at work and so far the women have been initiating conversations with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decided to give some of these pheremone colognes a try and so far, not seeing any difference in how women react to me.</li>
            <li> I used it and its actually works, thanks for zyloo laboratory</li>
            <li> This seems to be working better than PherX. At least for me it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hitting it in and I was surprised with the increased amount of attention I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I am a very self-aware man, not prone to mistake placebo confidence for actual attention.</li>
            <li> others don&#x27;t, iv used pher spray 3 times so far</li>
            <li> the package arrived on time and was packaged professionally.</li>
            <li> If the product is applied properly, women become much friendlier, and may find you irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bald early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t DO anything different, I used it a few more times</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I purchased and read the advertisements for Pheromone products; honestly, I believe these products profit and prey on us guys who are naive enough to think</li>
            <li> Ever since using this for a few days, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from my female co-workers.</li>
            <li> The ladies are more open to chat and seem to desire some heavy flirting.</li>
            <li> Works best if you put on a lightly-scented EDT as a base layer and this over it (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li> Additionally, the time of the estrous cycle influence the response as well as other specific environmental factors such as temperature, distance and exposure time.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quantity, I got my best results by using just 1 spray but spread with the fingers to the pulse areas on the neck and behind the earlobes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> if you know what I mean :-).</li>
            <li> If there weren&#x27;t other people in the house trying to sleep, we&#x27;d have had it out right there.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t recently bought any brand new clothing</li>
            <li> Subtle, but powerful!!</li>
            <li> I have used this half dozen times and women seem to stand closer to me and smile a lot.</li>
            <li> but it is not due to the product not working.</li>
            <li> but it is not due to the product not working.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, and I just chuckle on how I have this secret weapon on my arsenal!</li>
            <li> I guess I will wear it as a light cologne when at work; if I receive undeserved attention from anyone else, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it from myself whenever I spray it, so I tend to spray a lot around my pulse areas.</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much friendlier, but not as flirty as I expected.</li>
            <li> She started speaking to me completely out of the blue and ended up giving me her number.</li>
            <li> One pump does give a large spray but other than that no compaints.  </li>
            <li> There must have been a dozen or so chairs, but she decided to sit down right next to me.  </li>
            <li> This time im getting neglible results, that or im not use to the product as its been a little minute when I first got this as a freebie.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me, the smell is not strong and it goes away very fast, i needed to ask my friend if she smell something</li>
            <li> The first day I got it I sprayed a little on and went to a local coffee shop.</li>
            <li> method: Too much spray per pump (typical of these styled pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones:</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away and the bottle is small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> Not a huge  effect but certainly a noticeable one.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that it dispenses a bit too much with a single pump.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given my bottle at no cost after purchasing another of this company&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> complete waste of time and money there was no other lower rating than a one star</li>
            <li> I work in a sales-related profession and there was a slight but perceivable uptick in my interactions with both male and female clients, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> this scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this was due to her being on BC that killed her libido (which is why I tried this in the first place), or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I found that women were significantly more likely to stop and chat, actively strike up conversation with me, and casually flirt than without the use of the spray.</li>
            <li> It has been documented in research projects, found searching at databases, that there are variations in the response to human pheromones due to genetic diversity in the expression of receptors in the female.</li>
            <li> It has been documented in research projects, found searching at databases, that there are variations in the response to human pheromones due to genetic diversity in the expression of receptors in the female.</li>
            <li> The next day we saw each other and she was still the same to me.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but very inviting for the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Now we mess around with each other at work like two high school kids.</li>
            <li> As expected for a pheromone, not all women are responsive at the same time</li>
            <li> As expected for a pheromone, not all women are responsive at the same time</li>
            <li> This is a slightly stronger smell than the regular one the same company sells, the oily variant.</li>
            <li> i am a very social person and always gets girls attentions just by talking this time i toned down a lot just sat quitely and noticed that it wasnt doing anything there were girls all around me</li>
            <li> This, like any other pheromone spray, isn&#x27;t going to suddenly make you a chick magnet.</li>
            <li> The science on this stuff is limited--no peer reviewed experiments have proven that our pheromone sensing organ in our nose is anything other than an evolutionary left over that serves no purpose.  </li>
            <li> Now obviously we are already attracted to each other but it just made her wilder.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long not worth the money to me,</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless and a waste of good, hard earned money.</li>
            <li> After about an hour the lady sitting next to me almost raped her husband, and she usually kinda quiet.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the volume in which it sprays, it needs less volume per pump.</li>
            <li> Half a star, actually.</li>
            <li> gave this product a try in as controlled an experiment as I could over the past two weeks, changing no other part of my habits or routines.</li>
            <li> I need to use less to get the same potency as their other one.</li>
            <li> I tried this after using the non scented oil base formula which in itself is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought the whole thing was a scam because it smelled weird and girls were the same around me.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple Pheromone sprays and this one had absolutely no effect on my wife or the ladies around me at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days</li>
            <li> Not as expected or advertised.</li>
            <li> It is only a few dollars, you owe it to yourself to try it out.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t say if those work or not but the science behind it seems valid and the product mix in the bottle seems like it should work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10, 230 pounds with long black hair and an a-hole personality.</li>
            <li> Was in store the other day and girls kept saying hello.  </li>
            <li> This is not magic that will make a girl instantly sleep with you, but it will make her calmer and feel closer to you, and even give her an attraction towards you.</li>
            <li> i recomended for other people to buy it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> On the other hand, there is a TON of anecdotal evidence that pheromone cologne/perfume works.  </li>
            <li> Will try other products also</li>
            <li> If this can happen on a commuter bus, I can&#x27;t wait to put on Pher Spray and try it at other places.  </li>
            <li> I got this the other day</li>
            <li> Some of the other pheromone products I have tried make you  smell like a brothel on payday.</li>
            <li> We never saw each other in person before.  </li>
            <li> Well I naturally bought this skeptically and didn&#x27;t have any expectations initially.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I noticed that during the practice parties, ladies actively seek for me to dance with them</li>
            <li> the secret is to spray under your arms, then your deodorant, a spray on the body, then lightly on your wrist, behind the ear and one on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I had one negative comment from a female.</li>
            <li> for  at least several minutes in order for the pheromone to be detected, responded and associated to you as the source.</li>
            <li> for  at least several minutes in order for the pheromone to be detected, responded and associated to you as the source.</li>
            <li> Had no success at all with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a average guy 179cm tall athletic build, and</li>
            <li> Has a smell that you either love or hate.</li>
            <li> Use your better judgment, all it&#x27;ll cost you is either a &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; or a date, but either one isn&#x27;t as much of a waste as this crap.</li>
            <li> I was selected to test this for free and I wasnt disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I used as instructed and I did spray a little on my shirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed, for whatever reason, that these products seem to have little to no effect on some of the ladies.</li>
            <li> I spritz it directly on my skin, the classic pulse points, wrists, neck, jawline, behind ears and even spray it on my neck at the base of my skull and on my exposed scalp since I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this as an everyday type of wear.</li>
            <li> and I ended up sitting alone for a few minutes when a an overweight lady in her 30&#x27;s came in.  </li>
            <li> Three sprays on different pulse points and the game will change in your favor.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money...</li>
            <li> It seems to take years of the accumulated negativity from our past relationship road bumps and dispels them?</li>
            <li> Ill post back and let you know how it works</li>
            <li> Immediately found the women in my life getting even closer to me then usual.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t attest to its pheromone effect claim as no &#x27;magic&#x27; has happened yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> so not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Not sure how i feel about this one yet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic, you do have to engage them but</li>
            <li> Having luck with the ladies this past week so the verdict is: it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure on the pheromone effects, I will have to keep trying</li>
            <li> Scent is close to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Before the date is did the usual clean-up and used a couple of sprays of the PherSpay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to put this product to a test, I took advantage that I registered for a ballroom dancing program and started to wear the spray in specific days after the second week on the dancing Program, just to have a base line to compare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to give a review because I just started using it.</li>
            <li> but idk, its hard to tell.</li>
            <li> See women want what they cant have and thats also leads me to tell you guys to not become overly dependent with this, you gotta have a little game</li>
            <li> Although I also didn&#x27;t notice a decline in popularity among ladies so no harm done at least.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the fact that since its scented you can&#x27;t go crazy pouring it on like the oil because then you would smell like a guido going to the jersey shore.</li>
            <li> but I figure at the least</li>
            <li> It was a slow day</li>
            <li> But seriously, this stuff appears to do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Subtle, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> the changes are subtle and not everybody will be effected.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know, but either way the smell as cologne is not good.</li>
            <li> Tough call.</li>
            <li> Use it if you need an edge in the dating game.</li>
            <li> You must have game btw, like going up to a girl and shaking her hand while introducing yourself to her.</li>
            <li> The effect of this cologne is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mood may never comes and it takes a &#x27;reset&#x27; buttonlike</li>
            <li> If you know her and wear this it&#x27;s almost unfair</li>
            <li> That would just be unrealistic.</li>
            <li> My nostrils felt irritated, and my throat, sinuses, neck glands and tongue felt weird.</li>
            <li> While wearing this cologne women will approach me and start random conversations.</li>
            <li> Someone correct me if im wrong</li>
            <li> Do not be scammed as I was with this useless product.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about the claims from companies who sell pheramones, but i sprayed it on and went out for the night.  </li>
            <li> Unpleasant scent as a spray, and there seems to be a lot of spray per pump.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I haven&#x27;t had anybody try and avoid me or anything.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that is has not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be arrogant, a moron, a perv.</li>
            <li> For the price, not to bad!</li>
            <li> The worst product ever.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the scent of this. The smell is fairly strong though, so it&#x27;s not as well suited as the oils for combining with other scents.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s my report: I&#x27;ve been using PherSpray for about 3 weeks now... and it works! When I&#x27;m wearing the cologne women -- all types and ages -- approach me and and talk to me. It seems very natural. So when you start using this cologne you probably should get used to chatting with women if you aren&#x27;t already. It&#x27;s a fun experience. Also, what surprises me is that men seem to treat me much better, more open and friendly  -- not the usual macho face-off. Another benefit is that I feel more confident with people when I&#x27;m using the cologne. I recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> This is a sincere and straight forward review, I recommend you read it&#x27;s entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Cheap presentation (Label/Plastic bottle and initial protective wrap)&lt;br /&gt;Delivery method: Too much spray per pump (typical of these styled pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones: Seems to work so far initially after 1 time use - so far so good (made love) - a definite &#x27;openness&#x27; as a result emotionally on her part.&lt;br /&gt;Product: NOT 100% organic derived substances for those staying away from toxic additives/suspensions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Assessment: The product has a gentle smell that when applied gave me and my wife both a very calm feeling towards each other and we let our guards down seemingly like magic and I didn&#x27;t DO anything different, I used it a few more times and she literally will come up to me and take a deep sniff telling me I smell good for some reason - (she even sat on my lap!) It seems to take years of the accumulated negativity from our past relationship road bumps and dispels them? I am going to wear it constantly when she and I are together and tell her its just the smell of deodorant and I hope she will be familiarized to anticipate feeling calm, relaxed, open, receptive to me and that will make the transition into a more harmonious relationship more possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update: After being intimate, I put it on and her response was much more emotionally intimate, loving and genuinely desirable than before I started using this product before, during and after being intimate.) The KEY to any relationship is being relaxed... if this product &#x27;induces&#x27; this biochemically, and we both want to feel &#x27;love&#x27; towards each other it makes sense to use this &#x27;aid&#x27; just as any couple would if they simply dotted on cologne or perfume in an attempt to gain a similar affect... it&#x27;s simply a matter of choice, pre-planning and is as honest as buying a card, flowers or lighting a candle to set the &#x27;mood&#x27;. Unfortunately the mood may never comes and it takes a &#x27;reset&#x27; buttonlike this one which it seems to inspire.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, comments?</li>
            <li> Beats me ... but it works ??</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering this product. So, with that said I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this stuff. However, I decided to take it with me for a getaway in Vegas. I have not had so many random conversations with women in my entire life. From strangers standing next to me in line to women by the pool. I may have to plan my next trip without the girlfriend. Just kidding. But seriously, this stuff appears to do what it claims. However, even if it did not deliver as promised, it is a great smelling scent that could be worn as an alternative to any cologne.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and is a lot easier to use than the oil. The oil seems to be more effective though, and the price per bottle is a bit too high.</li>
            <li> I need to use less to get the same potency as their other one. This works great for me. I didn&#x27;t need to introduce myself. It&#x27;s good for being in a classroom or in a setting where you&#x27;ll be in proximity of women for more then a few minutes. It&#x27;s not an instantaneous thing.</li>
            <li> Has a smell that you either love or hate. After the company sent me this product I have seen a  change in the way women act around me. Much more..inviting.</li>
            <li> This is the third Pheromone product that I have received from this company. I am very pleased with all three of them. Believe me women love the aroma of them all and respond to it also !</li>
            <li> I got this product free to give an honest review  so here it is, the product is good only for the reson that it makes you feel more confident, and it does work but don&#x27;t expect magic. You have to get the balls and do part of the work and keep a good interaction. I will be buying this product in the future, thanks Zylo Labs for this free sample ^^.</li>
            <li> What a shame, I was hoping this would turn my wife on so I would not have to; it had no effect. Instant on sure would have been nice; I had to work for it as usual (ha ha).  I had my doubts when I purchased and read the advertisements for Pheromone products; honestly, I believe these products profit and prey on us guys who are naive enough to think/hope they may actually work.  I cannot provide fewer or more stars since I only tested it on my wife.  I guess I will wear it as a light cologne when at work; if I receive undeserved attention from anyone else, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and it really does work, though not always how you think it will. Was at a bar with some friends. After about an hour the lady sitting next to me almost raped her husband, and she usually kinda quiet. It doesn&#x27;t really attract women but it turns them on!!  If you can attract her get her one on one and have this on you&#x27;ll get laid. If you know her and wear this it&#x27;s almost unfair you probably won&#x27;t finish the date before heading to bed</li>
            <li> First off, this is an honest review. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a pheromone product. It isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;magnet&amp;#34; but I like the sent and I think it may have an affect.. May be a plecebo.. More time might tell. The one woman I&#x27;m in closer contact with on a regular basis has seemed nicer to me when wearing it. Not a &amp;#34;huge&amp;#34; difference but seems noticeable.. Either way it&#x27;s a nice product and I like it :)</li>
            <li> I just got it and it does have a great smell. Ill post back and let you know how it works</li>
            <li> I got this product via a free offer (which I love)&lt;br /&gt;And it seems to work as others have stated</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, It smells really really nice,  and I already noticed that women are wanting to be closer to me and a bit more touchy feely at work.  I have not gone out clubbing yet but I am sure it will attract the ladies in the same manner, its like magic..  One pump does give a large spray but other than that no compaints.  I like it and recommend it to any guy looking for pheromones.</li>
            <li> It is a great cologne. I tried a lot of pheromones products and this&#x27;s without a doubt the best. Great smell , last long time and totally the pheromones work. The girls always talking to me and looking at me it gives you a special feeling.</li>
            <li> Well I naturally bought this skeptically and didn&#x27;t have any expectations initially. I wore it at the office a couple days and noticed increased attention from women almost immediately. The real test was going to be on my gf who responded amazingly to it. She was much more relaxed and touchy-feely than usual.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Was in store the other day and girls kept saying hello.  Try it and you will see what can happen</li>
            <li> Had a great soft scent. Immediately found the women in my life getting even closer to me then usual. Also noticed increased confidence when out in public I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s legitimate or a placebo but either way it works.</li>
            <li> Smells real good and will get some heads turning when you walk by.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The effect of this cologne is very subtle. I can barely smell it from myself whenever I spray it, so I tend to spray a lot around my pulse areas. However, it has been fairly noticeable how women interact with me. I have tried it at work and so far the women have been initiating conversations with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s something that probably helps you attract the woman to talk to you, but you&#x27;re still on your own in continuing the conversation.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of a difference. Use it if you need an edge in the dating game. Use it by itself for best results.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant scent as a spray, and there seems to be a lot of spray per pump. But I enjoyed the product and will most likely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Love its spray application but can&#x27;t say the same for the scent - which is way too woody / oak-y for my taste. Glad that (albeit sadly) this scent doesn&#x27;t last that long. Can&#x27;t attest to its pheromone effect claim as no &#x27;magic&#x27; has happened yet. Although I also didn&#x27;t notice a decline in popularity among ladies so no harm done at least. Pure Instinct, which I also started using (not concurrently) at around the same period, seems to work better and its scent is more of my cup of tea. Moreover, that scent lasts noticeably longer than this...</li>
            <li> complete waste of time and money there was no other lower rating than a one star so just DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> Smells ok. But didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that works as advertised and has a very nice aroma to boot. I have received many compliments from a number of fine looking woman on how nice I smell. Just a couple of quick sprays is all you need.</li>
            <li> This is more of a placebo effect than anything else. All it is is a spray that smells nice. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. Use your better judgment, all it&#x27;ll cost you is either a &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; or a date, but either one isn&#x27;t as much of a waste as this crap.</li>
            <li> Pheromones aren&#x27;t magic. This, like any other pheromone spray, isn&#x27;t going to suddenly make you a chick magnet. What it does do, however, is give you better odds. Read up on how pheromones work before buying or reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a try in as controlled an experiment as I could over the past two weeks, changing no other part of my habits or routines. I found that women were significantly more likely to stop and chat, actively strike up conversation with me, and casually flirt than without the use of the spray. It definitely does what it&#x27;s meant to when used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;The most important things to remember are that you shouldn&#x27;t over-spray (1-2 spritzes is plenty), don&#x27;t use strong colognes or body sprays with it (these will render it ineffective), and that follow-through is entirely on you (if you suck at talking to women, fix that first). I suggest using an unscented deodorant to allow the pheromones to mix with some of your natural scent, as this is more effective.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Women aren&#x27;t ripping their panties off for you, but, yeah, just a spray seems to turn a head, or get a smile, the rest is up to you. It works.</li>
            <li> Well, don&#x27;t get too exited. It won&#x27;t hypnotist them. but they will be willing to talk to you, to find you nice and funny. Then you have to do the rest; be nice and funny.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike similar products, the spray is easier to apply and faster to use.</li>
            <li> Product smells good and my wife likes it too.  Don&#x27;t know how well it attracts women, no interest of mine, but smells god.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really work is really good smell and I get a lot of attention from girls when I wear this colonge it seems like everytime I wear that and I go out in people&#x27;s girlfriends trying to get close to me as possible and would not want to let me go is something about that ssmell of this cologne that keeps girls close to me be sure to wear early in the morning that&#x27;s the best way to do it and take a shower before you wear it at last long for 3 to 4 hour but man this stuff really works .......vvery highly satisfied</li>
            <li> The scent is light and clean and doesn&#x27;t clash with similar colognes. I work in a sales-related profession and there was a slight but perceivable uptick in my interactions with both male and female clients, which was unexpected. Males have been friendlier and more prone to accept my suggestions. Women are complimentary, more chatty and downright &amp;#34;huggy&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not lightning in a bottle, but over a two-week period, my wallet says *something* was happening.  Subtle, but noticeable. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it in a dating-scenario yet, but I&#x27;ll update when I do. Overall, I would buy it again if for no other reason than it genuinely smells good and is reasonably-priced. Pheromone-assistance is a bonus. I agree with other reviewers that it dispenses a bit too much with a single pump.&lt;br /&gt;*I was given my bottle at no cost after purchasing another of this company&#x27;s products. I have not been reimbursed for this review in any way and my descriptions are honest and accurate.*</li>
            <li> This is a slightly stronger smell than the regular one the same company sells, the oily variant. It seems to work to some extent, and I have confirmed it does not work on every single female, it depends.</li>
            <li> Decided to give some of these pheremone colognes a try and so far, not seeing any difference in how women react to me. I&#x27;ll keep trying. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I haven&#x27;t had anybody try and avoid me or anything. All in all it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Since using this I have had married women tipping me for no reason at all and single women coming back to the store \\&quot;just looking\\&quot;, in an auto parts store lol. The scent is pleasant and becomes unnoticeable fairly quickly but the pheromones keep working their magic. I have had the same lady coming in three days in a row to look at the air fresheners by my counter like I may have put something new up there for her.</li>
            <li> This is certainly doing something! Ever since using this for a few days, I&#x27;ve gotten more attention from my female co-workers. They generally seem more friendly around me and try to get a little closer than normal. The scent itself is pretty nice too. Even without factoring in the pheromones, it&#x27;s still a nice smelling cologne. Overall I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used around the office building and with my significant other and I noticed more smiles from women and more looks my way. Did not affect everyone and seemed to have less of an effect of my girlfriend, but in general a great way to help break the ice if you are struggling in that area or just want to meet new friends. I have been commended on the good smell of this perfume as well, which is honestly probably the pheromones working. Would highly recommend the item, but for best results spray ten to fifteen minutes before getting to the destination that you want to be so as to let it evaporate enough but not dissipate!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to give a review because I just started using it.</li>
            <li> After trying a few different products I noticed positive results with the Zyloo formula.&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered more Zyloo PherSpray Cologne to replace my more expensive colognes since it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless and a waste of good, hard earned money. I cant believe I fell for this BS. Please DO NOT buy it!!!!!</li>
            <li> is not that accurate as appear for some people , maybe acts as a factor but it wont be magic</li>
            <li> The presentation of the bottle is lacking, but the smell is great and the effects I got were noticeable. Women were more open and hung on to me for most of the night. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever. It was not what was described in descriptions. If anyone plans on buying this product please don&#x27;t, instead by Axe body spray it will work better. What a waste of money.  Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pheromones and do what pheromones do. This is not magic that will make a girl instantly sleep with you, but it will make her calmer and feel closer to you, and even give her an attraction towards you. The smell is fine, and if she gets close enough she&#x27;ll get the pheromone effect. Works as expected</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my good looks or this product, but seems to work, it can&#x27;t hurt, women want to talk more</li>
            <li> I used it and its actually works, thanks for zyloo laboratory i recomended for other people to buy it coz its working really good, and they are helping you like a friend</li>
            <li> Ive been using PherSpray for about 4 days and although it has a nice clean smell, I have noticed NO change in the behavior of females.  Im already a decent looking guy and I was expecting PherSpray to enchance things, but I am disappointed that is has not.</li>
            <li> Has a really good smell to it. Not over powering at all and I seem to be getting more attention from the ladies than usual.</li>
            <li> A really great product, works as described and has a very pleasant smell. I noticed results right away and the bottle is small enough to carry with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> This was tested on people I already knew to verify change. I noted women that it effected became more close and touchy as well as showing abstract behavior (Friends that hadn&#x27;t smelled it and were around to also note the behavior often commented about how this wasn&#x27;t like them) This however is not miracle juice the changes are subtle and not everybody will be effected. It does work however and if all you need is for women to be more open and calm around you then this will definitely do the trick.</li>
            <li> my friend wore some out &amp; said he wanted to buy mine!...if that tells you anything.  I&#x27;m not really sure if it works yet, I know it gives you a motive and confidence to get closer to women.  it was shipped very quickly and they were cool.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long not worth the money to me,</li>
            <li> This product is very satisfying. I have had much success while using this. I would recommend this to all who are interested.</li>
            <li> Seems to travel on the wind. I walked into the bar area of a restaurant. It has a fan in the entry way. Immediately got a smile and big &amp;#34;Hello&amp;#34; from a cutie, just my type.</li>
            <li> My wife did not like this product. She started opening all the windows and asked me if I got some chemicals on me. She avoided me the rest of the night. Perhaps this was due to her being on BC that killed her libido (which is why I tried this in the first place), or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work. I won&#x27;t know, but either way the smell as cologne is not good. Maybe try their oil that has no scent.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and I am  satisfied enough to order again and recommend the product to friends. I got some compliments on the smell from women. I used as instructed and I did spray a little on my shirt. I had one negative comment from a female. She said she didn&#x27;t like the smell, and that was ok with me because she still got fired up and I got good results with her...if you know what I mean :-). I think this product is effective. Thanks for allowing me to do a review.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the bottle and it was full to the rim with cologne! The smell is great smells like a quality cologne and not a cheap body spray. The effectiveness of the product is mixed,  it seems to work well with some females and not at all with others. Females seem talkative and comfortable around me and it becomes easier to chat with females. However, it lost one star since it spilled about 1/4 of the bottle in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Women want to be close to you and guys want to be your best friend. Got it and worn it around college and boy the women there didnt know what hit them, some resisted but you know what you can do to fix that? Ignore them. When they come back around or if you see the same women often, ignore them and I bet they&#x27;ll try to get your attention. See women want what they cant have and thats also leads me to tell you guys to not become overly dependent with this, you gotta have a little game and then it&#x27;ll really be super effective!  Update 7/21/15 So I bought this again and Ive notice that it doesnt work aswell as before. The first time I bought the product I saw some major ioi and hits from women and even some men(not gay btw). This time im getting neglible results, that or im not use to the product as its been a little minute when I first got this as a freebie. So im lowering this product to three stars. This stuff supposedly has 10 different pheromones in it but idk, its hard to tell. I like arouse rx and pherx better then this because arouse gets me major dihl and ioi and pherx gets me celeb treatment from people. Also androtics is pretty cool. So yea im not buying this product again just because its not so effective and it doesnt affects people like it did the first time around. Might even get a refund.  8/23/15 Well honestly I must say its supereffective again. Except this time you have to use it several different times in several different days. You must have game btw, like going up to a girl and shaking her hand while introducing yourself to her.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, I use it with my regular cologne...its superb!  I have used this product before, and after a shower, it feels great and has a grewat masculine scnet.</li>
            <li> PherSpray seems to be a good value for the price.  I like it, an I will probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The review is for the PherSpray Cologne with Pheromones for Men (Attract Women) Pheromone - Extra Strength - 30ml product.&lt;br /&gt; I used it during the day. This really seemed to make a noticeable difference! I am a first time user and I am satisfied This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far.  Very interesting reaction from 38-40 year old woman.  Very attentive.  Kept touching me.  Will write more as I use more.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It just needs to come in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a free sample to try. I used it for party. i am a very social person and always gets girls attentions just by talking this time i toned down a lot just sat quitely and noticed that it wasnt doing anything there were girls all around me and it was like i suddenly became invisible to them. so not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I was with a friend girl lastnight and I had put some of this spray on me before I got to her house and she could NOT  keep her hands off of me and she hug me over and over and over again. She just will not stop smiling at me. This spray I must bookmark. Its incredible! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple Pheromone sprays and this one had absolutely no effect on my wife or the ladies around me at all. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to explain this stuff. Women of all ages seem to be responding better. I bartend so I see a lot of women, so I have been able to have a much larger sample audience in a shorter amount of time. All I am saying is that at this price, you can&#x27;t afford not to buy this stuff. Just try it</li>
            <li> pure fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing but sweet smelling fragrance....don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money...</li>
            <li> So the company sent me an email shortly after buying their PherX product. They offered to send me their PherSpray Pheromones Cologne at no charge in return for an honest review. I said go for it! I&#x27;m in!!&lt;br /&gt;Received the PherSpray and put it to work right away. This seems to be working better than PherX. At least for me it is.This product has more of a masculine scent. Undeniably very manly. So here&#x27;s what happened. On a Friday at work, one of the ladies tells me that I smell and look great. I haven&#x27;t recently bought any brand new clothing but I made sure I was neat and clean as always and I was using the PherSpray. I politely said thank you very much and she asked what cologne I was using. I gave her some line that I didn&#x27;t remember which one I used that morning. Suddenly she moved closer and said &amp;#34;I bet I can figure it out&amp;#34; and she was right up on my neck sniffing away. Her nose touched my skin, both her hands on my waist and she freakin&#x27; kissed my neck!! Blew my mind!! So I calmly said &amp;#34;Mmm, that was nice, let me try&amp;#34; and I did the same thing to her. My hands on her waist but drew her in closer to my body and kissed her neck a lot slower and then walked away because some higher-ups were coming in our direction. Perfect freaking timing because I wanted that moment locked into her memory. Now we mess around with each other at work like two high school kids. So funny.&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely seems stronger. The ladies are more open to chat and seem to desire some heavy flirting. I have no problem with that. As I said before. Play it cool. Don&#x27;t be arrogant, a moron, a perv. Be smooth, confident, masculine, complimenting. Eye contact is important. Look into her sexy eyes!!  Then see where it takes you.&lt;br /&gt;Will this work on all the ladies? Absolutely not. I&#x27;ve noticed, for whatever reason, that these products seem to have little to no effect on some of the ladies. Maybe they don&#x27;t like the scent? Who knows for sure. That&#x27;s ok though. You shouldn&#x27;t expect it to work on everyone. That would just be unrealistic. Experiment with the ladies and have fun.</li>
            <li> This review is for the PherSpray Cologne with Pheromones for Men (Attract Women) Pheromone - Extra Strength - 30ml product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before moving into further detail I will state that I am a biologist with strong background in Animal Behavior.  With that being said, I went to the posted reviews before placing my order and had clear expectations in the light of my understanding of the biological basis in play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was delivered before the expected day, well protected and without big labels on the envelope, which is a good thing, especially if someone else besides you gets the mail for you. The fragrance smells very good and well balanced. It is rather toward the citrous side than musky side. Two very important factors in this fragrance is that it is not overwhelming and it is long lasting, Keep in mind that after you put it on your body, you will become desensitized to the odor, but it is still there and more importantly, the pheromones are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to put this product to a test, I took advantage that I registered for a ballroom dancing program and started to wear the spray in specific days after the second week on the dancing Program, just to have a base line to compare.  While using the cologne, I noticed that most of the ladies get closer to me while dancing and sometimes kept holding my hand during the instruction part of the class. They also stare to my eyes more often and they cannot stop to smile to me. Furthermore, I noticed that during the practice parties, ladies actively seek for me to dance with them and they kept talking during the whole dance.  During the four week (the second wearing the cologne), one of the hottest instructor told me that she want to dance with me in an upcoming competition and started giving me practice classes. My wife just said that she is wondering what is happening at the dance school that suddenly everyone, including the female teachers are so friendly with me! As a precaution, I keep my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder. As expected for a pheromone, not all women are responsive at the same time but it is not due to the product not working. It has been documented in research projects, found searching at databases, that there are variations in the response to human pheromones due to genetic diversity in the expression of receptors in the female. Additionally, the time of the estrous cycle influence the response as well as other specific environmental factors such as temperature, distance and exposure time.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quantity, I got my best results by using just 1 spray but spread with the fingers to the pulse areas on the neck and behind the earlobes.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to use this product in situations in which you would be relatively close to your target (like dancing, sharing a table, public transportation, etc.) for  at least several minutes in order for the pheromone to be detected, responded and associated to you as the source. Once you noticed signs of engaging, be ready to keep the momentum with a good conversation and compliments.my bottle in a safe place and partially removed the label.&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I am giving these product full stars and definitely will reorder.

            <li> I just what i&#x27;m looking for, o haven&#x27;t proved but seems like a good product, o hope will be helpfull</li>
            <li> My nostrils felt irritated, and my throat, sinuses, neck glands and tongue felt weird. It has a sweet/sour musky scent which I didn&#x27;t mind, but I think I had an allergic reaction to it. I don&#x27;t normally wear Colognes on the whole so I don&#x27;t know what ingredient may have caused this. I sprayed some on my wrists. A nerdy barista at Starbucks seemed to be kind of giggly flirty, dropping money etc. the other girl&lt;br /&gt;there was just sort of friendly, but sometimes is more chatty, the really pretty one hides from me no matter what, ha,ha.&lt;br /&gt;I felt spaced out also. I took a shower since I didn&#x27;t like the effect it was having on me. Significant other didn&#x27;t seem to notice the scent but that&#x27;s after I showered. I would give it another try but I think I&#x27;m highly sensitive to whatever is in this stuff and don&#x27;t want to feel like this again! Anyone else have this reaction?</li>
            <li> This cologne with pheromones smells amazing, the scent in not too strong nor too weak. I have gotten amazing results from women while wearing this product. While wearing this cologne women will approach me and start random conversations. Recently I had a woman start a conversation with me and right as we were saying our good byes, she asked me to lunch. I would recommend this product to a friend and/or family member.</li>
            <li> Received the PherSpray Cologne in the mail. Sprayed some on and went shopping. Noticed several women smiling at me and a couple started conversations. Seems to work and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, feel more confident, too early to tell maximum effect. Will update later. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I utilized it only once and definitely noticed a difference in the women that I spoke with that evening.  I will be using it again.</li>
            <li> Allow me to preface this with two things. Firstly, Zyloo sent me this free of charge to test and review, secondly, I&#x27;m not an overly attractive man. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10, 230 pounds with long black hair and an a-hole personality. I can&#x27;t help it, it&#x27;s just kind of how I&#x27;ve always been. I&#x27;m handsome I suppose, but not someone who stands out in the looks department, and kind of an introvert. Keep that mind when reading this review. This is a solid product. The smell  is very pleasant and it pairs well with other colognes. I like to use this as an everyday type of wear. I spritz it directly on my skin, the classic pulse points, wrists, neck, jawline, behind ears and even spray it on my neck at the base of my skull and on my exposed scalp since I have long hair. It has a great effect on friendliness,  both on yourself and those around you. It seems to ease people&#x27;s apprehensions around you and make them more relaxed and engaged. It&#x27;s not some magical product that will turn you into the Pied Piper of sex, but if you are a little confident and funny, at the very least women will hold a conversation with you. Where it goes from there  is on you. This is lighter than the oils so it works best with less clothing, t-shirts and shorts, you know, so the pheromones can make it into the atmosphere. I use it nearly daily and have noticed that on the days without it things just aren&#x27;t quite the same, not just with those around me but with me as well. In the end it&#x27;s worth every penny and will at least get your foot in the door with the ladies, which in my experience,  is the hardest part. The rest though, is up to you.</li>
            <li> Women love the scent and get so talkative and panting and nervous around you, makes for a very easy icebreaker. Someone correct me if im wrong but ck one smells a lot like this which does smell very good, just FYI. Is it stronger than the PherX Spray? I would say yes just out of pure faith after experiencing very pleasant and interesting conversations from wearing PherX Spray &amp; PherX Oil. Defo Recommendo.</li>
            <li> I got this bottle free in order to test and review it.  So, I took it to work with me, because I work with 80% women.  One girl asked me for one of my reeses cups.  I told her to go ahead, but she had to tell me what she thought of my new cologne.  I applied the cologne to my wrist, let it sit for a minute and she put her nose right to my wrist and breathed deep lol.  It had the effect of feeding a stray cat.  She came back 6 times just to &amp;#34;help me test if my new cologne still smelled nice.  She was finding reasons to get close to me, making up excuses that I needed to &amp;#34;feel right here for me&amp;#34; and putting her hands on me &amp;#34;oh, do you work out, it feels like you do.&amp;#34;  She&#x27;s caught in the web.  I also used this on a girl friend while we nerded out to some sci-fi...  WIN :-)  .  Combine this with the pherx oil and you&#x27;d better be careful, because you&#x27;re entering the Danger Zone.  I did and I got attacked by a friend.  I was trying to leave after hanging out and she attacked me with her mouth. If there weren&#x27;t other people in the house trying to sleep, we&#x27;d have had it out right there.</li>
            <li> Not sure how i feel about this one yet.</li>
            <li> Works relay well.  Noticed women sitting closer to me in meetings.  Also when out on the town, women tend to be more flirty .</li>
            <li> I regularly purchase this item.  This item does help open the opportunity to interact with women you meet. It does what it claims to do. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and so far it&#x27;s been ok</li>
            <li> At first at thought it was just a joke , but once I started using the product my other half had more of a sexual chemistry with men. So I would recommend this product for anyone who wants to spark their sexual chemistry.</li>
            <li> Definitely, getting some enjoyed attention. At my job, I noticed swarms of women just standing around me. They&#x27;re much friendlier, but not as flirty as I expected. My guess is this will improve depending on the scenario.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hitting it in and I was surprised with the increased amount of attention I&#x27;ve got. I was skeptical at first but maybe there really is some magic in this spray that works.</li>
            <li> The effect of this is similar to PherX (lots of smiles and \\&quot;oh, HI!\\&quot; from all sorts of women) but it smells a little more classy.</li>
            <li> It does attract  women and they don&#x27;t no why</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything and this has been the on only product that worked with me in my more sociall intimal life</li>
            <li> I tried this after using the non scented oil base formula which in itself is truly amazing. This stuff definitely seems to be working as I wear it around my college campus where girls are now making an extra effort to talk to me as I walk by. The only complaint I have is the fact that since its scented you can&#x27;t go crazy pouring it on like the oil because then you would smell like a guido going to the jersey shore. Lol.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight, clear spray with a subtle, unusually pleasing scent - I like the smell of it, and so do most of the women I&#x27;m around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a noticeably appealing fragrance that&#x27;s effective while not being overwhelmingly strong.</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me, the smell is not strong and it goes away very fast, i needed to ask my friend if she smell something but she didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this works but it smells decent and is reasonably priced.  The science on this stuff is limited--no peer reviewed experiments have proven that our pheromone sensing organ in our nose is anything other than an evolutionary left over that serves no purpose.  On the other hand, there is a TON of anecdotal evidence that pheromone cologne/perfume works.  Maybe it just gives a greater boost of self-confidence.  At any rate, I bought the stuff and then reordered so I believe it works enough to buy it again.</li>
            <li> so far so good. I just received yesterday so I plan to keep my eyes open if this works well, and plan on updating this post in the near future as seems fit.</li>
            <li> Smells good and I have definatly noticed the extra female attention.</li>
            <li> Original I purchased the oil and thought it smelt great and wanted to try out the cologne. They both smell great the cologne seems to stay around longer, the oil will last longer(amount in the bottle).  Overall I really like this stuff I think it does something.  I notice a lot more women are really friendly to me when I have it on.  I wanted to test some women to see how they liked just the smell.  All the women I asked really liked the smell and one I thought was going to rip my arm off because she really liked the smell.  I would by this product again.</li>
            <li> I had a female put her arms around me today. Im convinced its the most important quality women look for in men...smelling healthy for reproduction. its instinctual for hot chicks to look for men with a scent of dominance. what does your body odor say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a few days but it seems to put women at ease. It&#x27;s not magic, you do have to engage them but the I&#x27;ve noticed results. My only gripe is the volume in which it sprays, it needs less volume per pump. At this point, I think I&#x27;ll reorder when I&#x27;m out. I&#x27;m going to pick up some oil from Zyloo labs and try it in conjunction. W&#x27;ell see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Not as expected or advertised. Will try other products also</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail just before I took off to the chiro&#x27;s office.  I was almost there and decided to spray some on.  It was a slow day and I ended up sitting alone for a few minutes when a an overweight lady in her 30&#x27;s came in.  There must have been a dozen or so chairs, but she decided to sit down right next to me.  Hmmmm. I&#x27;m 64.  Now I have to decide if the cologne attracted her to me or if it was just my own natural sex appeal oozing out of my pores.  Tough call.</li>
            <li> Pher Spray has the best smell of any pheromone product I&#x27;ve ever used, and maybe this contributes to its success.  And successful it is, I do believe.  I take the bus a lot and often sit alone unless the bus gets crowded.  But now, since using Pher Spray, I noticed right away how decent looking women are now deliberately coming over to sit next or as close to me as possible.  This can&#x27;t be a coincidence.  Twice in the last week two women even started a conversation with me out of nowhere and one of them I gave my email address to, she was so friendly and warmed up to me.  If this can happen on a commuter bus, I can&#x27;t wait to put on Pher Spray and try it at other places.  I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> Been using PherX for a year or two now, spray, and then oil, and now got the chance to use the PherSpray.  It&#x27;s nice: powdery smell, which allows for a change-up from the PherX.  Having luck with the ladies this past week so the verdict is: it works.</li>
            <li> Half a star, actually. It only smells good.</li>
            <li> placebo  ?  tried several times in several environments and couldn&#x27;t see any thing different.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say it works, will try it again.  only used it 3 times and all the ladies there I already knew.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, but the bottle purchased was only half full.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne.  It has a simple, unassuming smell, like aftershave but better.  I am reluctant to wear cologne, but I make an exception with this one.  My wife loves it.  Maybe the pheromones do the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It has a good smell, soft yet noticeable.  Most important, it does affect behavior of women!  They seem to be more attentive, responsibe, and smiley.  It does what it claims to do, what you do with the extra attention is up to you.  This is my second time to buy this product.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> the smell is very nice just started using it not sure if it&#x27;s working yet but does really smell good</li>
            <li> Do not be scammed as I was with this useless product. Ok, the smell is nice but I didn&#x27;t just buy it to smell nice but to get attention of chicks. Had no success at all with this product. The reviews of 5 stars are by affiliates of the Company. The same company Zyloo Research also markets Pherx (another scam product) as for the 5 star reviews do not be duped, if you click on &#x27;see all reviews by this person&#x27; you will also see they have rated Pherx wait for it......... 5 stars! Both products are scams be better off with brut than this crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Would have rated this with no stars if Amazon would allow it)</li>
            <li> Received product Wednesday. It smells great, lasts about 200 sprays (so 2-3 months) You cant go wrong with it. I havent \\&quot;tested\\&quot; it on women yet, but Im getting close. Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started talking to  women, both those that I work with on a daily basis and females in public that I had never met, the effects were clear. I am a very self-aware man, not prone to mistake placebo confidence for actual attention. This really seemed to make a noticeable difference! I just wish there was a better variety of scents to choose from, instead of one &#x27;cologne&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> From my experience with the product, it helped with making a woman that I have been dating more interested in my company. I also seem to have more friendly communications with all people I encounter, but that is just an opening. I do not think anyone should think that this will magically mask any unwelcoming attitude or presentation.</li>
            <li> I use pheromones, some work for me others don&#x27;t, iv used pher spray 3 times so far and it hasn&#x27;t impressive me yet. Hopefuly it will soon.</li>
            <li> I tried both this and the pherx spray, being the first colognes I&#x27;ve tried they smell pretty good but I actually prefer the smell of this one, so I am giving it a one star higher review.  I&#x27;m not sure on the pheromone effects, I will have to keep trying but I figure at the least it&#x27;s a good smelling cologne, if it has any other benefits that&#x27;s gravy.</li>
            <li> It really works, I love the scent, the ladies love the scent.  It makes a great conversation starter.  It is only a few dollars, you owe it to yourself to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m completely in awe on how good this works. I have used several pheromones in the past, but this one has been most successful. These pheromones work better for me because the women have actually approached me, whereas with others, I&#x27;ve had to do a little work. This is an amazing product, and I just chuckle on how I have this secret weapon on my arsenal! Many ppl think that good reviews are fake...I assure you, I&#x27;m not a company employee or paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add..the secret is to spray under your arms, then your deodorant, a spray on the body, then lightly on your wrist, behind the ear and one on your clothes. Then put your regular cologne on, and I swear these work magic.</li>
            <li> Scent is close to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past. Just as effective if not more so. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> i got mine two days ago and i dont regret a thing. the package arrived on time and was packaged professionally. overall i like this product. the product actually works and this product is worth your every dollar. im not trying to be a kiss-ass, i just want people to know what they are buying and if it is worth&#x27;d. Pherspray is not bad at all, i bought the pherx 18mg its basically just the same, smells the same. Buy this one and go out to meet some women, you will feel the difference. im not the most charming guy in the world, this product subconciously trigger woman to be attracted sexually. the best method of attraction after money.</li>
            <li> This guy works just as good as the oil... but much easier to apply, and able to spray/walk thru it for maximum area coverage. This, allows you to easily cover yourself in sexy pheromones for her delight. Get it, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more subtle scent, therefore easily blends with any cover scent.  Not sticky or cloying, and dries nicely on contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning, I tried some on my temples and neck, then over goes some Creed.  Rest of the day, I had some fairly extended conversations with plenty of people that normally are too busy to affordthat time.  Extended eye contact, smiles and touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!  Will keep trying it out, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for any ones that wants to feel attractive to women&#x27;s, they likes it , I used with my girlfriend and it really works...she gets exited when I use it....</li>
            <li> Smells great but not too strong and really not even like a cologne which is great for me as I don&#x27;t want to smell like I wear cologne. It does seem to have a &amp;#34;happy inducing&amp;#34; effect on myself and others (women and men). Not a huge  effect but certainly a noticeable one. All in all I&#x27;m pretty thrilled I decided to buy this and I&#x27;m going to get more when I start running low.</li>
            <li> For the price, not to bad! Very good cologne and would recomend to any guy having trouble scoring a date.</li>
            <li> Subtle, but powerful!! The Best in my opinion!! A must have attractant!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> PherSpray is a uniquely scented cologne for men infused with pheromones meant to attract women. If the product is applied properly, women become much friendlier, and may find you irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it, and I notice some mildly positive effects. I tried it on after I was done working for the day and went to my local bar. I was low on energy from the day of work, but I noticed women around me look my way a little more often. If I was full of energy, I may have landed some pretty good conversations.&lt;br /&gt;In another instance, I tried on two sprays to the neck, and one to the wrists. I went to a mall, and had some good conversations with a few saleswomen. One of them was rather touchy-feely, and she gave me her number.&lt;br /&gt;It is from my experiences that if PherSpray is worn, and with confidence, then women will at the very least, become more attentive towards you. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the light smell it has. It can be used by itself or combined with a cologne. I&#x27;m only on my second use say but I do my girlfriend seems to enjoy it quite a bit more so then higher end fragrances.. Definitely worth a shot to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this with doubts as to how effective it was but I soon realized that this product was NO JOKE! The first day I got it I sprayed a little on and went to a local coffee shop. A beautiful woman sat down right next to me and was visibly flushed. I could tell that there was something going on. She started speaking to me completely out of the blue and ended up giving me her number. Now, that may seem completely normal but I haven&#x27;t had a woman act like that around me in years! I am always struggling to introduce myself and here I am after only 20 minutes and I already have a date. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I got this the other day and I tried it immediatly and women were just slot nicer to me. It&#x27;s as if I kinda stood out to them. When I saw my girlfriend that night she was alot closer to me throughout the night. We had a bit to drink and it&#x27;s as if she went animalistic. We went at it all night. She was even still very touchy afterwards. The next day we saw each other and she was still the same to me. Now obviously we are already attracted to each other but it just made her wilder. Our sex life is great, but this just gave it and extra omph that I wanted from her. I will be buying more as soon as I run out. Try it out it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, havent had a chance to test its effects though.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping product has an awesome scent when passing by some women they all looked up and said hello that usually does not happen!</li>
            <li> delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Sprayed some on just before going out one night. The scent is light, clean, and pleasant -- not overpowering. Met up with several people and everyone around  me was as talkative and relaxed as you could want. The wait-staff seemed extra attentive as well as very courteous. Even was asked what that great scent was that I was wearing--and I&#x27;ve worn several others but never got this kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Will order more.</li>
            <li> I was sent the product for a review.  I like the scent.  The pheromone effect I don&#x27;t know about.  I&#x27;m not an expert in the field so I really can&#x27;t say if those work or not but the science behind it seems valid and the product mix in the bottle seems like it should work.</li>
            <li> Smells excellent by itself or paired with  your normal cologne/aftershave. Scent is clean and not obnoxious. Some of the other pheromone products I have tried make you  smell like a brothel on payday.</li>
            <li> Well I went to one of the premier nightclubs in town and got 4 numbers and four dates for the week, no other pheromone product I have tried ever got me that kind of success rate and I have used the $100 ones. Cant tell you how many smiles and interest I got at resturants and the mall the morning I put it one glad I bought two bottles at a time . I used it during the day with Armani Essenza and at night with Gucci Eros . I am a average guy 179cm tall athletic build, and bald early 40&#x27;s I am no pretty boy and last night I was cashing in better than all my pretty boy friends it was a terrific feeling they were like you go boy :-). It comes with a money back guarentee if it doesnt work send it back. There is a reason they are so many positive review it works simply as that . In one night 4 numbers and confirmed dates in three hours I didnt now what to do with myself great feeling . Thats all I will say its nice when the good guys win you owe it to yourself if your a good guy and want a little edge to get those 9&#x27;s to give you their number. All I can say is I am personally pleased with this product !!!!</li>
            <li> From my experience the oil seems to last much longer than spray pheromones. The smell is subtle but very inviting for the opposite sex. I&#x27;ve tried nexus pheromones, pherlure, ice breaker, and pure instinct. All of them had decent and some better than other results. But this product gives me consistent results in a close proximity setting. Everyone is so warm, inviting, and striking up convos with people you desire to do it with is as easy as turning a key. Mind you, you still got to be a gentleman and have good hygiene, stay fit, and not act like a douche towards women and you&#x27;ll come out a winner easy.</li>
            <li> I went out on a first date last week (me met online). We never saw each other in person before.  Before the date is did the usual clean-up and used a couple of sprays of the PherSpay.  Within an hour we were holding hands, and kissing between dinner courses.  When we left we were in total embrace kissing like we&#x27;d been together for years.  I&#x27;m sure it was my witty charm and great personality, but the spray didn&#x27;t hurt.  Buy some and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> At first I read about pheromones and found out they exist.  Then I found out they come in spray form.  After the first won I bought I thought the whole thing was a scam because it smelled weird and girls were the same around me.  This product actually smells good unlike others and I get more stares from girls or maybe I&#x27;m just extremely good looking, either or haha.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is pretty good, not the best though. But it did seem to get me more attention than usual when I went downtown with it.</li>
            <li> Effective with a pleasant scent.  It also combines well with EDT and/or cologne.  Works best if you put on a lightly-scented EDT as a base layer and this over it (around the neck and wrists).</li>
            <li> I works you get attention</li>
            <li> After 1 week trial...so far so good!!</li>
            <li> The pher spray cologne is not as effective as the oil although it has a nice scent and is easier to apply, the oil I think works better. I have heard you may get better results using both so I will be trying that.</li>
            <li> Take into account the &#x27;Extra Strength&#x27; part.  This is more like the Prestige product from this manufacturer.  Pherx oil is good for establishing trust in different settings but this spray cologne is Superior.  Do not mix this with any other kind of pheromone as it will be too strong.  Three sprays on different pulse points and the game will change in your favor.  Be ready to handle the changes.</li>
            <li> I was selected to test this for free and I wasnt disappointed.  I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about the claims from companies who sell pheramones, but i sprayed it on and went out for the night.  I was at the bar ordering a drink and said hi to the girl next to me.  She said hi then said I smelled really good.  Next thing you know, she was grabbing me.  It was really that quick and easy.  I did notice that you have to be fairly close to the women inorder for them to notice though.</li>
            <li> I got this product a week ago and it came across as more potent as the original but still had a pleasant sent. It indeed has 2 more milligrams than the original and i feel that gives me a boost. It has a great smell after its settled and I feel it really works!! Gotten lots of attraction from the opposite sex!</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant fragrance to it and also very easy to use when compared to the dab-on oil of the same strength. My comments are directed solely to the fragrance of this product and not to it&#x27;s scientific claims.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it smells so good! Shipping is incredibly fast. I do notice a difference while wearing PherX products whether it be more confidence or getting more attention than usual. Definitely going to be buying more of this. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this half dozen times and women seem to stand closer to me and smile a lot. One women walked over to mee and started a conversation. I really think this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;Jim Barnett</li>
