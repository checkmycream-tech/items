            <li>Great value.</li>

            <li>A lot cheaper than most tea tree shampoos and conditioners, but just as good.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are nice and tall so you get a lot of the stuff.</li>
            <li>The consistency is watery and I end up using more of the product to get a good lather.  </li>

            <li>I was looking for both a dandruff and highlight safe shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner I have recommended it to all of my friends.</li>

            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt tell you if the shampoo cleans my hair better then others or if the conditioner is better then others...</li>
            <li>I love that feeling.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Oh, I just love these two products.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>

            <li>I love the smell, the tingle, my scalp doesn&#x27;t have buildup anymore</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair and love the smell of peppermint, I think you will like this product.  </li>
            <li>Someone recommended tea tree shampoo and conditioner to me and I am Soo glad they did.</li>
            <li>For the price on Amazon, you&#x27;re better off with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for natural hair, cleans hair very well and gives excellent shine and moisture.</li>
            <li>If you like mint you would probably love this.</li>
            <li>I REALLY love them.  </li>
            <li>I also notice if I don&#x27;t wash every day,  my hair does not have that greasy look,  that I get most of the time.  </li>
            <li>These products give a great mint smell and they feel very cleansing.</li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy it again, but I still hope to find something better</li>
            <li>I do love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>the gas expense alone more than makes up the price difference.</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s gone, i&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner although I&#x27;m finding it a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair and scalp feel.</li>
            <li>This one is better because it makes my hair look healthy</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Glad to see this is offered on Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;You pay more on Amazon</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t itch nearly as much and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>But the price is way too HIGH!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very unique with the tingling sensation to me.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>The tingle it has feels super relaxing and even after I get out of the shower I can still feel it, I love it!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is especially effective on my very long, very fine, easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have criticized the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite my hair being colored for 12 years, it&#x27;s in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the results and the tingle on my scalp long after I&#x27;d completed shampooing and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to find this product on amazon!</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for with this, worth the money!!</li>
            <li>These are great for those with sensitive scalps!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy other brands in search of the perfect tea tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>great product I am going natural</li>
            <li>but so far not so great.</li>
            <li>Both my hair and hubby&#x27;s hair was soft, shiny and smelled great.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free</li>
            <li>If you have colored hair, seek a better sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast, happy w my purchase.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell, not mediciny like other products.</li>
            <li>Beware\\&quot;  In this  case it is oh so true!  </li>
            <li>I love it; my scalp feels so clean.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I mostly use natural products on my hair but monthly, I give my scalp a good cleaning and this shampoo is one that I use, and the conditioner works well to soften my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not smell as strongly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Going on it smelled and felt like my high end rosemary mint brand, and the results were just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling great with very soft and full body.</li>
            <li>The organic ingredients are a nice plus, but be aware that not all of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li>This seems to lather fine</li>
            <li>The scent is VERY pleasant compared to other tea tree shampoos which smell like medicine.</li>
            <li>I have celiac and must use gluten free</li>
            <li>The conditioner is light and the smell is not offensive nor overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It DOES feel fresh against against the skin and smell lovely.</li>
            <li>This duo is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Choosing CRUELTY FREE cosmetics and cleaning products is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shampoo washes out of my hair easily and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This is suppose to be a no poo/curly girl product as it is sulfate free, but I&#x27;ve never had frizzy hair like this before.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but is this product good for natural African-American hair?</li>
            <li>I just know I love the tingle on my head when I use them and my hair feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge which makes it an awesome deal for the price and very little is needed to create a pile of lather on your head.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter and it keeps her naturally sleek hair shiny, clean, well-conditioned and very healthy.</li>
            <li>Excellent for natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried others and I don&#x27;t feel they clean my hair</li>
            <li>and I know lather has nothing to do with clean</li>
            <li>and it does rinse clean.  </li>
            <li>Smoothing (fewer frizzies) and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Hubby&#x27;s hair looks and smells clean and feels moisturized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is good for oily hair but only to use once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I loved the tingly feeling because it tells me that the shampoo is actually reaching and working on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the results, no itching and nice soft hair.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t get a full bottle.</li>
            <li>When my hair is styled, it is very manageable, and when i pat the top of my head, my hair is SPRINGY.  </li>
            <li>and your scalp feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>I know this product makes no claims to do this, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, and my hair still looks good.  </li>
            <li>The last time I had my hair cut my hair dresser said that my hair was in good condition.</li>
            <li>It is SO GOOD that we have stockpiled several bottles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I will be bringing back some for friends who have requested it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I LOVE the product,  they just need to figure out how to ship better.</li>
            <li>Strong yet gentle on all hair types and even color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this recently at a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t close to a trader joes, it is worth the price..</li>
            <li>also love the natural ingredients :</li>
            <li>I had been using another tea tree shampoo and conditioner and had some relief, so I thought this would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Love how the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price -</li>
            <li>nothing soothes my psoriasis and itchy scalp safely and naturally like Trader joes Tea Tree Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the requested price.</li>
            <li>the price that Amazon charges for this is well worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love all the essential oils and the light tingling sensation</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smell tea tree, minty FRESH and our hairdresser noted how it does not build up on our daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it makes my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to deva curl shampoo and conditioner even though it costs a significant amount of more money.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain if I have a sensitivity to detergents, but the tea tree, eucalyptus, and mint oils are exceptionally soothing and cooling.  </li>
            <li>I like a little more tingle than this offers, but It works good for the price</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo and my hair felt so clean,  NOT STRIPPED of natural oils, just clean.  </li>
            <li>Almost as good as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special for a small fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Smell good left my hair really soft and tingly..</li>
            <li>While I liked the scent (minty tea tree oil), and it was fine for my hair, this product made my scalp even drier than usual.</li>
            <li>If you are able to purchase the item directly from the store, I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>first time trying them.</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The overall experience of both of these products is top notch.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s actually another brand of shampoo that has tea tree and peppermint that is more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; and leaves my hair shinier.</li>
            <li>And glad to pay the extra price to avoid driving to Trader Joes 43 miles away!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s within 4 hours of me, and similiar products here sell for double the price or more.</li>
            <li>But, it does leave my hair feeling and looking healthy, and that is ultimately what I am looking for in a hair care product.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that has been able to ease my itching.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I use.</li>
            <li>My hair is constantly tangled, brittle, and there are waaaay more split ends now.</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon was my first experience with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is mostly organic and made from essential oils without sulfates.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>and it real shines!</li>
            <li>My hair is long, color treated, and very fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only heard good things about the Trader Joe line of hair care products, particularly in the natural hair community.  </li>
            <li>Container shape looks good on a shelf, not that easy to handle in the shower and conditioner wants to stay in the container with the pyramid shape (not as pictured here) can&#x27;t be stored upside down without external support.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair clean with a tingly feel to her scalp without over stripping her hair, while the conditioner leaves her hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos that say they will take care of itchy scalp, but none of them have worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is made of very quality ingredients and works very well!</li>
            <li>A dime size amount would be too mild and would only lather or clean your hair unless you used way too much.</li>
            <li>If this were priced as normal, this would be a deal to snag right way.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up really well and tingles ever-so-slightly.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit much considering it is way cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and it&#x27;s gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much about these products since I just started using them</li>
            <li>I recently got the Keratin treatment done again and needed sulfate free combo.</li>
            <li>and it really makes your scalp tingle</li>
            <li>Very healing and tried all kinds of knock-offs</li>
            <li>I highly recommend folks!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much at all per wash.</li>
            <li>Of course the added bonus is that they are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>: I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>I was very please, arrived on tim.</li>
            <li>I will be much cheaper and you can stock up.</li>
            <li>Using too much leaves scalp flakier and hair drier than before.</li>
            <li>They really do tingle.</li>
            <li>After I remove the product my hair and scalp feel very refreshed and vigorating, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have medium length/wavy hair and it made my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>However, it is much cheaper in the store.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know anything about the product because I haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li>Helped clear up my dandruf after one use!!!</li>
            <li>and I live in the desert and many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; components actually dry out your hair here.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, and leaves it feeling cool and smelling minty!</li>
            <li>My hair was squeaky clean and no itchy scalp days later.</li>
            <li>Left my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have fine dry hair,  </li>
            <li>Not terrible, but not worth the price, IME.</li>
            <li>Love the light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t weigh down long hair.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal EverPure is my hands down favorite shampoo but this is cheaper so, why not,</li>
            <li>Once it dried it was, shiny,  clean,  and bouncy,  full of life.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful of getting it in your eyes because the peppermint oil will leave a cool sting!</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing considering how stripped my hair feels from the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Only a mild tingle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It does cost a little more here on AMAZON</li>
            <li>Is nit bad jyst not the best fir</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft after using it and it was very manageable</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>We have a lot of long haired gals in our family and this shampoo and conditioner makes our hair feel so soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I checked my hair after I towel dried it - no dandruff, no dryness - super clean and soft hair.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I began bathing my dog with it and it seems to be better suited for him.</li>
            <li>I like the smell - I think this shampoo will work well for anyone with normal scalp -</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind paying extra for the service, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not terrible for me, just did not fit the bill for my needs.</li>
            <li>This winter I have still had a few problems with static electricity</li>
            <li>It made my dry and coarse hair soooo smooth!</li>
            <li>Finally a natural and affordable product that actually WORK on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased and will definitely make this go to shampoo and conditioner..at lease as long as I have flaky and oily scalp</li>
            <li>then conditioner is VERY concentrated, use about a third as much as you normally would when applying it.</li>
            <li>I formerly used a rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner from a very good but expensive company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with shampoos and just did not like the way this made my hair feel; kind of dry, limp and with no pizzazz</li>
            <li>After doing further research, I am left to conclude that this product is NOT definitively gluten free and it is not labeled as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not buy this shampoo because you will notice that your hair falls out a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with this shampoo and conditioner yesterday and I am VERY pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>If the price goes down I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>On my first use,  i didn&#x27;t really feel much of a tingle and the shampoo dried out my hair ALOT</li>
            <li>Large quantities, should last several&lt;br /&gt;months.</li>
            <li>If your not familiar with sulfate free products, shampoos do not lather that well.</li>
            <li>I feel only a little tingle,but wasn&#x27;t expecting to feel more.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner that works with my natural hair no matter how much my hair texture changes.  </li>
            <li>I was totally how surprised much</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my face goes from oily to flaky and the Tea Tree Tingle does not irritate it.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and manageable  </li>
            <li>This was recommended on a natural hair care site I visited</li>
            <li>Having to be completely GF</li>
            <li>This product is cheaper if you buy it directly from Trader Joes...</li>
            <li>and wow was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>However, as several people have already pointed out, this item is MUCH cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s ($3.99 each).</li>
            <li>Since there is no TJ&#x27;s anywhere near me (closest is over 3 hours drive away)</li>
            <li>a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you to buy.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is the mint smell.</li>
            <li>and she was really surprised.</li>
            <li>Works stops my hair from itchiness and you can feel all the natural ingredients in this..healthy for your hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying this if you want healthier hair with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>fool!&lt;br /&gt;You know the old saying \\&quot;Buyer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about trader joe&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners and I finally tried for myself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this will be my go to product yet because my scalp tingled as promised, but my hair was not extremly soft, however, I will use it again.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff but expensive</li>
            <li>My dry, itchy scalp now feels normal and my dandruff is very reduced.</li>
            <li>but I do not believe it is worth buying the other brand.  </li>
            <li>Not as minty as I would like but having some texture to my hair is nice because it&#x27;s difficult to work with when it&#x27;s newly washed and really soft.</li>
            <li>this combo leaves my oily hair clean and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>Try this product every day for two weeks, then go back to your normal routine.</li>
            <li>Will be a new regular in my shower.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have been dealing with very itchy and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>but recently I started to look for natural alternative..</li>
            <li>Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve developed dandruff so I am hoping the tea tree infused in this product will help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again, but next time probably directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s since it is a lot cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li>My scalp is so sensitive to certain chemicals found in some shampoos (a good amount of hair will fall out if I use something like Suave and will dry out badly)</li>
            <li>Both products give tremendous coverage with only a little product.</li>
            <li>but shampoo is very  stripping it left my hair really dry.</li>
            <li>Then I used the conditioner and it soaked right up into my hair, yet it still did not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and can say it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I do have clean, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I will probably have to order the shampoo once or twice before that rich and thick conditioner runs out....</li>
            <li>this is an average shampoo, nothing special, not much &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the tinging, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much better - lathers well and takes care of the dryness left behind by the shampoo</li>
            <li>I am not able to use most conditioners because the residue weights my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product it left my hair feeling very dry even when I just only used conditioner, but it really comes to you in what type of hair you have and what issues you want to resolve with your hair care regimen</li>
            <li>The price beats any shampoo you would find at Whole Foods or other organic stores!</li>
            <li>I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo and Conditioner on my natural hair that is 4C kinky and dry, and it cleans and softens it up.  </li>
            <li>My curls didn&#x27;t look dry, instead they were soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>We do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s but tried this shampoo &amp; conditioner when we found it on vacation.  </li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle cooling feeling also.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, the tingle, my scalp doesn&#x27;t have buildup anymore</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have oily hair and love the smell of peppermint, I think you will like this product.  </li>
            <li> Someone recommended tea tree shampoo and conditioner to me and I am Soo glad they did.</li>
            <li> For the price on Amazon, you&#x27;re better off with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for natural hair, cleans hair very well and gives excellent shine and moisture.</li>
            <li> If you like mint you would probably love this.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love them.  </li>
            <li> I also notice if I don&#x27;t wash every day,  my hair does not have that greasy look,  that I get most of the time.  </li>
            <li> These products give a great mint smell and they feel very cleansing.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy it again, but I still hope to find something better</li>
            <li> I do love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> the gas expense alone more than makes up the price difference.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s gone, i&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner although I&#x27;m finding it a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair and scalp feel.</li>
            <li> This one is better because it makes my hair look healthy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Glad to see this is offered on Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;You pay more on Amazon</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t itch nearly as much and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> But the price is way too HIGH!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Very unique with the tingling sensation to me.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> The tingle it has feels super relaxing and even after I get out of the shower I can still feel it, I love it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is especially effective on my very long, very fine, easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have criticized the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite my hair being colored for 12 years, it&#x27;s in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the results and the tingle on my scalp long after I&#x27;d completed shampooing and conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to find this product on amazon!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this, worth the money!!</li>
            <li> These are great for those with sensitive scalps!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy other brands in search of the perfect tea tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> great product I am going natural</li>
            <li> but so far not so great.</li>
            <li> Both my hair and hubby&#x27;s hair was soft, shiny and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is cruelty free</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair, seek a better sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, happy w my purchase.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell, not mediciny like other products.</li>
            <li> Beware\\&quot;  In this  case it is oh so true!  </li>
            <li> I love it; my scalp feels so clean.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I mostly use natural products on my hair but monthly, I give my scalp a good cleaning and this shampoo is one that I use, and the conditioner works well to soften my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not smell as strongly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Going on it smelled and felt like my high end rosemary mint brand, and the results were just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling great with very soft and full body.</li>
            <li> The organic ingredients are a nice plus, but be aware that not all of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> This seems to lather fine</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY pleasant compared to other tea tree shampoos which smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> I have celiac and must use gluten free</li>
            <li> The conditioner is light and the smell is not offensive nor overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It DOES feel fresh against against the skin and smell lovely.</li>
            <li> This duo is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Choosing CRUELTY FREE cosmetics and cleaning products is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shampoo washes out of my hair easily and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li> This is suppose to be a no poo/curly girl product as it is sulfate free, but I&#x27;ve never had frizzy hair like this before.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but is this product good for natural African-American hair?</li>
            <li> I just know I love the tingle on my head when I use them and my hair feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge which makes it an awesome deal for the price and very little is needed to create a pile of lather on your head.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter and it keeps her naturally sleek hair shiny, clean, well-conditioned and very healthy.</li>
            <li> Excellent for natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried others and I don&#x27;t feel they clean my hair</li>
            <li> and I know lather has nothing to do with clean</li>
            <li> and it does rinse clean.  </li>
            <li> Smoothing (fewer frizzies) and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s hair looks and smells clean and feels moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is good for oily hair but only to use once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I loved the tingly feeling because it tells me that the shampoo is actually reaching and working on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the results, no itching and nice soft hair.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t get a full bottle.</li>
            <li> When my hair is styled, it is very manageable, and when i pat the top of my head, my hair is SPRINGY.  </li>
            <li> and your scalp feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> I know this product makes no claims to do this, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, and my hair still looks good.  </li>
            <li> The last time I had my hair cut my hair dresser said that my hair was in good condition.</li>
            <li> It is SO GOOD that we have stockpiled several bottles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that I will be bringing back some for friends who have requested it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I LOVE the product,  they just need to figure out how to ship better.</li>
            <li> Strong yet gentle on all hair types and even color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this recently at a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t close to a trader joes, it is worth the price..</li>
            <li> also love the natural ingredients :</li>
            <li> I had been using another tea tree shampoo and conditioner and had some relief, so I thought this would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Love how the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price -</li>
            <li> nothing soothes my psoriasis and itchy scalp safely and naturally like Trader joes Tea Tree Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the requested price.</li>
            <li> the price that Amazon charges for this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love all the essential oils and the light tingling sensation</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smell tea tree, minty FRESH and our hairdresser noted how it does not build up on our daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it makes my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to deva curl shampoo and conditioner even though it costs a significant amount of more money.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if I have a sensitivity to detergents, but the tea tree, eucalyptus, and mint oils are exceptionally soothing and cooling.  </li>
            <li> I like a little more tingle than this offers, but It works good for the price</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and my hair felt so clean,  NOT STRIPPED of natural oils, just clean.  </li>
            <li> Almost as good as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special for a small fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Smell good left my hair really soft and tingly..</li>
            <li> While I liked the scent (minty tea tree oil), and it was fine for my hair, this product made my scalp even drier than usual.</li>
            <li> If you are able to purchase the item directly from the store, I highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> first time trying them.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The overall experience of both of these products is top notch.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s actually another brand of shampoo that has tea tree and peppermint that is more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; and leaves my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> And glad to pay the extra price to avoid driving to Trader Joes 43 miles away!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s within 4 hours of me, and similiar products here sell for double the price or more.</li>
            <li> But, it does leave my hair feeling and looking healthy, and that is ultimately what I am looking for in a hair care product.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that has been able to ease my itching.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I use.</li>
            <li> My hair is constantly tangled, brittle, and there are waaaay more split ends now.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon was my first experience with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is mostly organic and made from essential oils without sulfates.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> and it real shines!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, color treated, and very fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only heard good things about the Trader Joe line of hair care products, particularly in the natural hair community.  </li>
            <li> Container shape looks good on a shelf, not that easy to handle in the shower and conditioner wants to stay in the container with the pyramid shape (not as pictured here) can&#x27;t be stored upside down without external support.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair clean with a tingly feel to her scalp without over stripping her hair, while the conditioner leaves her hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos that say they will take care of itchy scalp, but none of them have worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is made of very quality ingredients and works very well!</li>
            <li> A dime size amount would be too mild and would only lather or clean your hair unless you used way too much.</li>
            <li> If this were priced as normal, this would be a deal to snag right way.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up really well and tingles ever-so-slightly.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit much considering it is way cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and it&#x27;s gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much about these products since I just started using them</li>
            <li> I recently got the Keratin treatment done again and needed sulfate free combo.</li>
            <li> and it really makes your scalp tingle</li>
            <li> Very healing and tried all kinds of knock-offs</li>
            <li> I highly recommend folks!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much at all per wash.</li>
            <li> Of course the added bonus is that they are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> : I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I was very please, arrived on tim.</li>
            <li> I will be much cheaper and you can stock up.</li>
            <li> Using too much leaves scalp flakier and hair drier than before.</li>
            <li> They really do tingle.</li>
            <li> After I remove the product my hair and scalp feel very refreshed and vigorating, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have medium length/wavy hair and it made my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> However, it is much cheaper in the store.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know anything about the product because I haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my dandruf after one use!!!</li>
            <li> and I live in the desert and many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; components actually dry out your hair here.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, and leaves it feeling cool and smelling minty!</li>
            <li> My hair was squeaky clean and no itchy scalp days later.</li>
            <li> Left my hair clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have fine dry hair,  </li>
            <li> Not terrible, but not worth the price, IME.</li>
            <li> Love the light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t weigh down long hair.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverPure is my hands down favorite shampoo but this is cheaper so, why not,</li>
            <li> Once it dried it was, shiny,  clean,  and bouncy,  full of life.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful of getting it in your eyes because the peppermint oil will leave a cool sting!</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing considering how stripped my hair feels from the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Only a mild tingle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It does cost a little more here on AMAZON</li>
            <li> Is nit bad jyst not the best fir</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft after using it and it was very manageable</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> We have a lot of long haired gals in our family and this shampoo and conditioner makes our hair feel so soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I checked my hair after I towel dried it - no dandruff, no dryness - super clean and soft hair.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I began bathing my dog with it and it seems to be better suited for him.</li>
            <li> I like the smell - I think this shampoo will work well for anyone with normal scalp -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind paying extra for the service, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not terrible for me, just did not fit the bill for my needs.</li>
            <li> This winter I have still had a few problems with static electricity</li>
            <li> It made my dry and coarse hair soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> Finally a natural and affordable product that actually WORK on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased and will definitely make this go to shampoo and conditioner..at lease as long as I have flaky and oily scalp</li>
            <li> then conditioner is VERY concentrated, use about a third as much as you normally would when applying it.</li>
            <li> I formerly used a rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner from a very good but expensive company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with shampoos and just did not like the way this made my hair feel; kind of dry, limp and with no pizzazz</li>
            <li> After doing further research, I am left to conclude that this product is NOT definitively gluten free and it is not labeled as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not buy this shampoo because you will notice that your hair falls out a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with this shampoo and conditioner yesterday and I am VERY pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> If the price goes down I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> On my first use,  i didn&#x27;t really feel much of a tingle and the shampoo dried out my hair ALOT</li>
            <li> Large quantities, should last several&lt;br /&gt;months.</li>
            <li> If your not familiar with sulfate free products, shampoos do not lather that well.</li>
            <li> I feel only a little tingle,but wasn&#x27;t expecting to feel more.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that works with my natural hair no matter how much my hair texture changes.  </li>
            <li> I was totally how surprised much</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my face goes from oily to flaky and the Tea Tree Tingle does not irritate it.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and manageable  </li>
            <li> This was recommended on a natural hair care site I visited</li>
            <li> Having to be completely GF</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper if you buy it directly from Trader Joes...</li>
            <li> and wow was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> However, as several people have already pointed out, this item is MUCH cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s ($3.99 each).</li>
            <li> Since there is no TJ&#x27;s anywhere near me (closest is over 3 hours drive away)</li>
            <li> a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you to buy.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is the mint smell.</li>
            <li> and she was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Works stops my hair from itchiness and you can feel all the natural ingredients in this..healthy for your hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this if you want healthier hair with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> fool!&lt;br /&gt;You know the old saying \\&quot;Buyer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about trader joe&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners and I finally tried for myself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will be my go to product yet because my scalp tingled as promised, but my hair was not extremly soft, however, I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff but expensive</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy scalp now feels normal and my dandruff is very reduced.</li>
            <li> but I do not believe it is worth buying the other brand.  </li>
            <li> Not as minty as I would like but having some texture to my hair is nice because it&#x27;s difficult to work with when it&#x27;s newly washed and really soft.</li>
            <li> this combo leaves my oily hair clean and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> Try this product every day for two weeks, then go back to your normal routine.</li>
            <li> Will be a new regular in my shower.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have been dealing with very itchy and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> but recently I started to look for natural alternative..</li>
            <li> Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve developed dandruff so I am hoping the tea tree infused in this product will help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again, but next time probably directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s since it is a lot cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> My scalp is so sensitive to certain chemicals found in some shampoos (a good amount of hair will fall out if I use something like Suave and will dry out badly)</li>
            <li> Both products give tremendous coverage with only a little product.</li>
            <li> but shampoo is very  stripping it left my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> Then I used the conditioner and it soaked right up into my hair, yet it still did not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and can say it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I do have clean, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I will probably have to order the shampoo once or twice before that rich and thick conditioner runs out....</li>
            <li> this is an average shampoo, nothing special, not much &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the tinging, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much better - lathers well and takes care of the dryness left behind by the shampoo</li>
            <li> I am not able to use most conditioners because the residue weights my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product it left my hair feeling very dry even when I just only used conditioner, but it really comes to you in what type of hair you have and what issues you want to resolve with your hair care regimen</li>
            <li> The price beats any shampoo you would find at Whole Foods or other organic stores!</li>
            <li> I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo and Conditioner on my natural hair that is 4C kinky and dry, and it cleans and softens it up.  </li>
            <li> My curls didn&#x27;t look dry, instead they were soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> We do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s but tried this shampoo &amp; conditioner when we found it on vacation.  </li>
            <li> and I have natural, black 4 b/c hair</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to the expensive tea tree shampoos available in the market.</li>
            <li> it left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> If you have a dry and itchy head, DEFINITELY try this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo &amp; conditioner that I have found that can control my itchy and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in my hair the moment I got out the shower and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I had recently bought some Tea Tree Oil because have terribly dry hands, and working in a doctors office, I am washing my hands all the time.  </li>
            <li> i have natural black hair</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a single-star rating after only a single usage, after which I read the labeling.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, I just don&#x27;t live to a trader Joe&#x27;s :(</li>
            <li> but they leave her hair tangled and not very soft.  </li>
            <li> and it really leaves my scalp feeling moisturized and no more dry scalp &#x3D;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to get to the closest Trader Joe&#x27;s where I live.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t enough to send it back,  was just enough to make a mess of the 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s priced so high on here, but if you have a Trader Joes in your area, just get it there.</li>
            <li> Hard to figure out how much to use.</li>
            <li> My package came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner seems to not really condition that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> I have life long, frosted.</li>
            <li> Will stick with Carrots, because this one did the opposite of what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> Left my dyed honey blonde hair with platinum highlights feeling dry, tangled, greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair or skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my husband said he thought it was the conditioner that seems to dry out his hair..</li>
            <li> My scalp was so dry, flaky and itchy</li>
            <li> very little natural mint scent.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall was</li>
            <li> Does not have all those other chemicals that other shampoos and conditioners have especially sodium sulphate and no parabens.  </li>
            <li> and he has well over half a bottle of both left.</li>
            <li> i love the small of this product but unfortunately for me, i don&#x27;t feel any tingle whatsoever, which was the biggest reason i wanted to try this.</li>
            <li> but unlike me, she has oily hair that requires that it be washed every two to three days, while my hair is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and the tingle that you get when you use this however the shampoo leaves my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> it must have been to tightly wrapped and the shampoo bottle cap opened just enough to leak some.  </li>
            <li> I added a little extra Rosemary oil in both the conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> It sucks the natural oils out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t control the dandruff as expected, it has no noticeable effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Results were not as expected</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that Amazon seems to have based the search &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; on nothing more than a single comment here by what appears to be a uninformed Amazon shopper.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or hard but quite the opposite</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, there is also no celiac or other GF site that will say that this is GF.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wash like other tea tree shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I was not too overwhelmed with the tingling sensation, though - in that sense, it just felt like every other shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase any other shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and any of their other products to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews and reviewing the ingredients I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be a little dry</li>
            <li> My hair felt too dry using this everyday.</li>
            <li> The negative for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last in between shampoos, about 48 hours max and my hair</li>
            <li> The conditioner is about average.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price or the aggravation.</li>
            <li> not worth overpaying $15</li>
            <li> Not effective enough to help treat psoriasis.</li>
            <li> You either love it or you hate it.</li>
            <li> fine/med thick, shoulder length hair and in my 50&#x27;s, and this product definitely has my praise.  </li>
            <li> In trader joe these products and all other kinds of shampoo and conditionals are 3$ each!</li>
            <li> I should add that half of the shampoo had leaked out into the package before arriving at my home.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product that was twice the cost and half the size.</li>
            <li> As for the peppermint tingle, Trader Joe&#x27;s has a tad bit less zing</li>
            <li> with my hair length I need less than a quarter size squirt of the conditioner, and it begins to work immediately to make my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> I also have tightly coily hair.</li>
            <li> Sealed overly tightly with tape that refused to come off without use of a paring knife.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that in the Bay Area, where I live, it can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I just wish the smell and tingle was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> but it actually made my hair worse.</li>
            <li> I always run a comb through my hair with the conditioner still in to get the tangles out, and I had a lot of trouble running the comb through.</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes very little lather.</li>
            <li> no more flakes</li>
            <li> Product works, but no better than what I use when I stay in a motel.</li>
            <li> and I usually like the mint/floral fragrance combinations too.  </li>
            <li> Due to the dry weather this summer my scalp has become dry and I hated the noticeable flakes I was getting due to it, so I decided to try this shampoo</li>
            <li> But this shampoo and conditioner has a very heavy peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it is even less expensive than the other brand that didn&#x27;t quite do the job for me.</li>
            <li> Extra BONUS is that the eucalyptus ingredient is a natural lice repellent.</li>
            <li> but it sucks</li>
            <li> is is less expensive than what I was buying at the salon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately TJ&#x27;s isn&#x27;t on every street corner yet.  </li>
            <li> I have weird scalp - my hair gets oily within 2 days of washing it</li>
            <li> 24 mile round-trip, horrible parking, always packed - overall, a nightmare.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Sorry, will be giving this away.  </li>
            <li> Its terrible my head will itch as soon as my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> It dried my scalp out terribly.</li>
            <li> I felt dirty.</li>
            <li> It is very sad that Amazon lists this product in the search results for &amp;#34;shampoo gluten free&amp;#34; when the Amazon description of the product says nothing about gluten.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one is not that way for me, so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to find out that amazon does that</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser told us that lice HATE eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> With school-age kids, you always get those awful notes from school saying some kid in your child&#x27;s class had lice.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! We have a lot of long haired gals in our family and this shampoo and conditioner makes our hair feel so soft and tangle free. It has also been a great deterrent for lice when that is going around the schools. This is a good price for the amount you get too. I will keep this product in auto order!</li>
            <li> I buy this monthly at my local Trader Joes.. The price beats any shampoo you would find at Whole Foods or other organic stores! It does cost a little more here on AMAZON but if you aren&#x27;t close to a trader joes, it is worth the price.. In my local store this is $2.99/bottle ($3.99 at some store is looks like.  Price, like everything, varies between geographic location)..  The shampoo is made of very quality ingredients and works very well! Has a great smell!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair or skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it great product I am going natural this is the perfect product for my hair!! I love how it made my scalp feel</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price.  Not a overpowering tea tree smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells good, but the insects don&#x27;t like it so I no longer get attacked by gnats &amp; mosquitoes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair feels great afterwards. first time trying them. definitely will buy them again. and they got to my house at the time it said it would.</li>
            <li> These products are great on my hair!  Doesn&#x27;t leave it dry or hard but quite the opposite and I have natural, black 4 b/c hair so I need all the moisture I can get.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a single-star rating after only a single usage, after which I read the labeling. Those not concerned about gluten can ignore this review but those who are should read the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We came across this item by searching Amazon for &amp;#34;shampoo gluten free&amp;#34; assuming that was a fact-based search result. We bought five sets for ourselves and our kids only to find nothing on the label to suggest that the product is GF. After doing further research, I am left to conclude that this product is NOT definitively gluten free and it is not labeled as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond just the labeling, there is nothing in its description on the Trader Joe&#x27;s site listing it as GF even though Joe&#x27;s says it labels all it certified GF products as such. It is listed as &amp;#34;cruelty-free&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; but not GF. (FYI, while searching, I found that Trader Joe&#x27;s definition of GF is 20 parts per million which is the EU standard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there is also no celiac or other GF site that will say that this is GF. It is very sad that Amazon lists this product in the search results for &amp;#34;shampoo gluten free&amp;#34; when the Amazon description of the product says nothing about gluten. I am really disappointed that Amazon seems to have based the search &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; on nothing more than a single comment here by what appears to be a uninformed Amazon shopper.</li>
            <li> This is good for oily hair but only to use once or twice a week. My hair felt too dry using this everyday. Not as minty as I would like but having some texture to my hair is nice because it&#x27;s difficult to work with when it&#x27;s newly washed and really soft.</li>
            <li> Great - lower price at Trader Joe&#x27;s, though.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful products. We started using tea tree shampoo after a lice epdisode and will continue doing so as a preventative. The Trader Joe&#x27;s brand works great is is less expensive than what I was buying at the salon.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this shampoo/conditioner combo would work for me but it actually made my hair worse. My hair felt like straw, even after using the conditioner. It dried my scalp out terribly. And not only did it not work, but I guess I over paid as well. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Everything was great. My package came earlier than expected. The only issue was that my conditioner was leaking. I think it had more to do with the elevation. Love the shampoo and conditioner. My hair felt so soft after using it and it was very manageable</li>
            <li> This is totally overpriced on Amazon considering its $3.99 each at Trader Joe&#x27;s. Unfortunately TJ&#x27;s isn&#x27;t on every street corner yet.  The bottle is huge which makes it an awesome deal for the price and very little is needed to create a pile of lather on your head. It smells awesome, very minty and yes it does make your scalp tingle in a good way. The conditioner smells good too but I don&#x27;t get the same tingly feel as with the shampoo and a little goes a long way. Both products give tremendous coverage with only a little product. It leaves my hair smelling great with very soft and full body. The negative for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last in between shampoos, about 48 hours max and my hair is screaming for a shampoo.  Even with that I&#x27;ll probably buy it again because it smells so delicious and does leave my hair feeling great on day one.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Excellent for natural mixed hair.</li>
            <li> Nice tingly feeling after using this. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, and leaves it feeling cool and smelling minty!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my head after a while.  My hair is SO soft.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this shampoo because you will notice that your hair falls out a lot more than usual. Also it&#x27;s dries out your hair.</li>
            <li> Yes.. you DO overpay here on Amazon..at the Trader Joes store each go for $3.99 but my review is for the product, not price difference. I have weird scalp - my hair gets oily within 2 days of washing it yet I have always had issues with itch and dandruff. I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders for years but recently I started to look for natural alternative..did some research here on Amazon and came across these guys and decided to give them a try. I washed my hair with this shampoo and conditioner yesterday and I am VERY pleasantly surprised! The scent is VERY pleasant compared to other tea tree shampoos which smell like medicine. I loved the tingly feeling because it tells me that the shampoo is actually reaching and working on my scalp. The conditioner is amazing! It made my dry and coarse hair soooo smooth! I checked my hair after I towel dried it - no dandruff, no dryness - super clean and soft hair. I was so excited! Finally a natural and affordable product that actually WORK on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased and will definitely make this go to shampoo and conditioner..at lease as long as I have flaky and oily scalp</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, happy w my purchase. Love this shampoo and conditioner, I just don&#x27;t live to a trader Joe&#x27;s :(</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up really well and tingles ever-so-slightly. The conditioner is about average. After a few uses I began bathing my dog with it and it seems to be better suited for him. I should add that half of the shampoo had leaked out into the package before arriving at my home. The top was secured as best as it could be so the problem was in the design.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!  I have sensitive skin and my face goes from oily to flaky and the Tea Tree Tingle does not irritate it.  My hair feels great after using it.  Just be careful of getting it in your eyes because the peppermint oil will leave a cool sting!</li>
            <li> Love the way the product works.Makes hair soft and manageable  BUT, when it arrived it was two bottles of conditioner instead of shampoo and conditioner. Still no response regarding exchange.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use but it sucks I have to pay these gouger prices online when it&#x27;s only $3 each at the store. I wish they&#x27;d open a Trader Joes in my town.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo does the trick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had itchy scalp for some time but, after using these it literally all went away. Absolutely love using them. Will be purchasing over and over as needed.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Very unique with the tingling sensation to me.</li>
            <li> I like a little more tingle than this offers, but It works good for the price</li>
            <li> I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have been dealing with very itchy and dry scalp.  On my first use,  i didn&#x27;t really feel much of a tingle and the shampoo dried out my hair ALOT and I noticed my hair was coming out as I combed it. The next day,  my scalp was still somewhat itchy.  Was hoping this product would be great but so far not so great.</li>
            <li> I have celiac and must use gluten free and I love this - it smells good and my hair feels nice after using it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great tea tree product with no sulfates. This was recommended on a natural hair care site I visited and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Conditioner is amazing. Shampoo stripped oils from my hair. The overall experience of both of these products is top notch. I will definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my dandruf after one use!!!</li>
            <li> Since we don&#x27;t have a trader joe&#x27;s anywhere around I was really excited to find this product on amazon! I have been using another product that was twice the cost and half the size. This one is much better</li>
            <li> Like the conditioner but shampoo is very  stripping it left my hair really dry.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner. It has helped keep my hair from falling out!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s actually another brand of shampoo that has tea tree and peppermint that is more &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; and leaves my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> favorite shampoo and condition. i love the tingle and the way it cleans my hair. also love the natural ingredients :</li>
            <li> Finally! Relief for my itching scalp. I have tried many different shampoos that say they will take care of itchy scalp, but none of them have worked very well for me. I had been using another tea tree shampoo and conditioner and had some relief, so I thought this would be worth a shot. This product arrived two weeks ago and I tried it that evening. I was amazed at the results, no itching and nice soft hair. As an added bonus, it is even less expensive than the other brand that didn&#x27;t quite do the job for me. Usage note: then conditioner is VERY concentrated, use about a third as much as you normally would when applying it.</li>
            <li> I have a scalp that will get itchy and flake. I also have tightly coily hair. The shampoo is great for scalp but somewhat drying for hair. I found that putting a litle bit in an applicator bottle and the rest water. Then I go through at my scalp. works great. Conditioner has lots of slip for detangling.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has eczema on her scalp.  The shampoo and conditioner work great for that but they leave her hair tangled and not very soft.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair dry. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree...no where close?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wash like other tea tree shampoos do. Was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to get to the closest Trader Joe&#x27;s where I live. 24 mile round-trip, horrible parking, always packed - overall, a nightmare. So, happy to have it sent to my home.</li>
            <li> I like the smell - I think this shampoo will work well for anyone with normal scalp - I have dandruff issues so I had to move on to a medicated shampoo to treat my issue.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.  Having to be completely GF I love the way this makes my hair feel and smell. I have tried others and I don&#x27;t feel they clean my hair that well.  This is very affordable and even if you are not GF a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I was looking for both a dandruff and highlight safe shampoo and conditioner.  These are the bomb!  They feel great on the scalp, and are great in treating dandruff.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit much considering it is way cheaper in the store. However I don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s in my area, so I just bought it online. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints and it&#x27;s gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair smell like a candy cane!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much about these products since I just started using them and I got them based on Youtuber&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner I have recommended it to all of my friends. I will never switch to another product.</li>
            <li> The prod. Is nit bad jyst not the best fir my gair, I eillnuse it until its gone but I will likely not buy it again. I have 3C and 4a hair so its just not my cup if tea.</li>
            <li> good shampooo...  no animals are tortured.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is amazing! If smells like mint and it slips nicely on my 4a/4b hair. Love how the ingredients are natural. You get what you pay for with this, worth the money!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the tinging, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and&lt;br /&gt;it was more brittle like.  Possibly because my hair is color processed.&lt;br /&gt;The itchy scalp came back the next day.  Will pass it on to a friend who&lt;br /&gt;does not color treat her hair and wait for results.</li>
            <li> I AM TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT. I AM ACTUALLY ALMOST OUT OF BOTH OF THESE, SO I PROMISE YOU I WILL BE ORDERING MORE ASAP! :)</li>
            <li> I recently got the Keratin treatment done again and needed sulfate free combo. I didn&#x27;t mind paying extra for the service, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price - nothing soothes my psoriasis and itchy scalp safely and naturally like Trader joes Tea Tree Shampoo.  No longer have to use smelly coal tar shampoo and it really makes your scalp tingle - we also use it as a body wash.  I love the smell.  Very healing and tried all kinds of knock-offs but nothing works like TJs. And glad to pay the extra price to avoid driving to Trader Joes 43 miles away!</li>
            <li> I couldnt tell you if the shampoo cleans my hair better then others or if the conditioner is better then others...I just know I love the tingle on my head when I use them and my hair feels clean and fresh. I love that feeling.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than most tea tree shampoos and conditioners, but just as good.  It makes my hair silky and soft, smells great, works great, and a great price</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that works with my natural hair no matter how much my hair texture changes.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Oh, I just love these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> What is it, a joke? In trader joe these products and all other kinds of shampoo and conditionals are 3$ each! Very disappointing to find out that amazon does that</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, wakes me up!</li>
            <li> I purchased this duo out of desperation because my scalp itch would be calmed by anything except Scalpicin, and I am hesitant to use that too often.  I&#x27;m not certain if I have a sensitivity to detergents, but the tea tree, eucalyptus, and mint oils are exceptionally soothing and cooling.  The conditioner is especially effective on my very long, very fine, easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have criticized the price.  There isn&#x27;t a Trader Joe&#x27;s within 4 hours of me, and similiar products here sell for double the price or more.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great. If your not familiar with sulfate free products, shampoos do not lather that well. The only problem was that these products are way overpriced on here. You can get the same size at Trader&#x27;s Joe for $7.98 for both.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper if you buy it directly from Trader Joes...I love the product, shampoo and conditioner, though.  Recommend purchase from store if you are close to one.</li>
            <li> Luv this shampoo. makes my hair feel so good. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to the expensive tea tree shampoos available in the market.</li>
            <li> very little natural mint scent.  this combo leaves my oily hair clean and fluffy.  I dilute these products with 1/ 2 and 1/2 product water.  the results are still great</li>
            <li> I formerly used a rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner from a very good but expensive company. working part-time I can no longer afford those luxuries...or so I thought! I was standing online at Trader Joes and happened to grab this product on a whim. Both my husband and I used it that night and wow was I pleasantly surprised. Going on it smelled and felt like my high end rosemary mint brand, and the results were just as good for a fraction of the price. Both my hair and hubby&#x27;s hair was soft, shiny and smelled great. Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve developed dandruff so I am hoping the tea tree infused in this product will help. I highly recommend folks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner. I was not too overwhelmed with the tingling sensation, though - in that sense, it just felt like every other shampoo or conditioner. But, it does leave my hair feeling and looking healthy, and that is ultimately what I am looking for in a hair care product. However, as several people have already pointed out, this item is MUCH cheaper at Trader Joe&#x27;s ($3.99 each). If you are able to purchase the item directly from the store, I highly suggest it. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the requested price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special. It doesn&#x27;t control the dandruff as expected, it has no noticeable effect on my hair. The tingle isn&#x27;t even all that noticeable. It&#x27;s a basic, minty smelling shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell was great and the tingly feeling. The only down fall was it left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I love it; my scalp feels so clean. My hair was squeaky clean and no itchy scalp days later. I saw this on YouTube reviewed by modernmrshuxtable. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. Your hair will be a little dry but I followed up w/ the conditioner. And argan/palm rosa/jasmine/coconut oils mixture.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner from trader joe&#x27;s for $8 and it&#x27;s awesome. It works great for itchy scalp. It is the only thing that has been able to ease my itching. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase any other shampoo or conditioner. I added a little extra Rosemary oil in both the conditioner and shampoo. I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and i must say it leaves my hair feeling amazing!!! The shampoo has this tingling sensation that allows you to know your hair is being cleansed very good and the conditioner leaves the hair feeling sooooooo soft I LOVE IT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TRADER JOES YOU ROCK!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are African American but unlike me, she has oily hair that requires that it be washed every two to three days, while my hair is very dry.  This shampoo leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair clean with a tingly feel to her scalp without over stripping her hair, while the conditioner leaves her hair soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve only heard good things about the Trader Joe line of hair care products, particularly in the natural hair community.  I would recommend this and any of their other products to anyone.</li>
            <li> it came on time and it was great the only problem was that the shampoo was opened and spilled in the package so i didn&#x27;t get a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special for a small fraction of the price. Since there is no TJ&#x27;s anywhere near me (closest is over 3 hours drive away) the price that Amazon charges for this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells cleaner than mint! The bottles are nice and tall so you get a lot of the stuff. The organic ingredients are a nice plus, but be aware that not all of the ingredients are organic. My scalp is so sensitive to certain chemicals found in some shampoos (a good amount of hair will fall out if I use something like Suave and will dry out badly) so I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I use. These are great for those with sensitive scalps!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling cleaner than it has in a while. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the conditioner seems to not really condition that well. I always run a comb through my hair with the conditioner still in to get the tangles out, and I had a lot of trouble running the comb through. Had to add some extra conditioner of another brand. All in all though, a good system!</li>
            <li> This review is how I feel about the product now and I will come back after finishing up the product and make additional comments.  I bought this set as a comparative to the Keranique 8 oz. shampoo and conditioner which are around $19.00 each.  As for the peppermint tingle, Trader Joe&#x27;s has a tad bit less zing but I do not believe it is worth buying the other brand.  This seems to lather fine and I know lather has nothing to do with clean but it helps to manipulate the product to the scalp where you want the invigorating tingle and it does rinse clean.  The conditioner is light and the smell is not offensive nor overpowering.  Price/amount to similar products...GREAT.  How it performs to the end of the bottle...get back to you on that one.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle shampoo &amp; conditioner now for 2 weeks and the feeling it leaves in my scalp after I use it is relaxing. Due to the dry weather this summer my scalp has become dry and I hated the noticeable flakes I was getting due to it, so I decided to try this shampoo and it really leaves my scalp feeling moisturized and no more dry scalp &#x3D; no more flakes YES! The tingle it has feels super relaxing and even after I get out of the shower I can still feel it, I love it! I totally recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product it left my hair feeling very dry even when I just only used conditioner, but it really comes to you in what type of hair you have and what issues you want to resolve with your hair care regimen</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Doesn&#x27;t take much at all per wash. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Both are only $3.99 at Trader Joe&#x27;s. This seems like a deal, but it is not. If this were priced as normal, this would be a deal to snag right way.</li>
            <li> I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo and Conditioner on my natural hair that is 4C kinky and dry, and it cleans and softens it up.  I love the tingle cooling feeling also.  I mostly use natural products on my hair but monthly, I give my scalp a good cleaning and this shampoo is one that I use, and the conditioner works well to soften my hair. Of course the added bonus is that they are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Sealed overly tightly with tape that refused to come off without use of a paring knife. Container shape looks good on a shelf, not that easy to handle in the shower and conditioner wants to stay in the container with the pyramid shape (not as pictured here) can&#x27;t be stored upside down without external support. Product works, but no better than what I use when I stay in a motel. Not worth the price or the aggravation.</li>
            <li> Helped my dandruff.  It has a wonderful smell, not mediciny like other products. Left my hair clean and shiny. I recommend it although the price was a bit pricey.  If the price goes down I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently at a Trader Joe&#x27;s store, it&#x27;s AMAZING. I didn&#x27;t want anything with SLS and this is it! I love the smell, the tingle, my scalp doesn&#x27;t have buildup anymore and it&#x27;s really shiny and soft. Only downside is the price on Amazon! Go to a store and buy it for $3.99/bottle and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner, works great for dandruff on humans and our pups</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Smells great and at about 1/4 the cost of Paul Mitchell. Tea tree is a very specific scent. You either love it or you hate it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is cruelty free and I usually like the mint/floral fragrance combinations too.  But this shampoo and conditioner has a very heavy peppermint smell.  The consistency is watery and I end up using more of the product to get a good lather.  The conditioner does not give me enough moisturizer.  If you have oily hair and love the smell of peppermint, I think you will like this product.  Not terrible for me, just did not fit the bill for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have an itchy scalp with EVERY shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Its terrible my head will itch as soon as my hair is dry. Someone recommended tea tree shampoo and conditioner to me and I am Soo glad they did. My head hasn&#x27;t felt this good in... I don&#x27;t know how long. Amazing product. If you have a dry and itchy head, DEFINITELY try this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have life long, frosted. fine/med thick, shoulder length hair and in my 50&#x27;s, and this product definitely has my praise.  When my hair is styled, it is very manageable, and when i pat the top of my head, my hair is SPRINGY.  I will probably have to order the shampoo once or twice before that rich and thick conditioner runs out....with my hair length I need less than a quarter size squirt of the conditioner, and it begins to work immediately to make my hair feel silky. .Oh....and your scalp feels cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> Left my dyed honey blonde hair with platinum highlights feeling dry, tangled, greasy and weighed down. GROSS! Going to return and try another alternative. Do not bother with this if you have color treated hair. D: I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo &amp; conditioner that I have found that can control my itchy and dry scalp.  I have tried many brands and this is the best.  I have been using it for a couple months now with a scalp massage brush.  I love it!</li>
            <li> quick ship great product</li>
            <li> I was very please, arrived on tim. Will order again!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product for natural hair users, also it feels and smells good. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good tea tree shampoo! It does NOT however tingle. It DOES feel fresh against against the skin and smell lovely. Some people are sold on the tingle (I am) but if you can not afford Paul Mitchell which I can&#x27;t this is great instead.</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy scalp now feels normal and my dandruff is very reduced. I know this product makes no claims to do this, but it&#x27;s true. I leave each product on my scalp for 2-3 minutes before rinsing. Try this product every day for two weeks, then go back to your normal routine. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the shampoo and conditioner! I definitely noticed a difference in my hair the moment I got out the shower and let it air dry. My curls didn&#x27;t look dry, instead they were soft and shiny. My hair felt so healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner on the market.  The only advise I would give is too find a Trader Joe&#x27;s near you to buy.  I will be much cheaper and you can stock up.</li>
            <li> this is an average shampoo, nothing special, not much &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li> This product is great! Love the smell and the way it makes your scalp feel!!!</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair, seek a better sulfate free shampoo. For the price on Amazon, you&#x27;re better off with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my hair being colored for 12 years, it&#x27;s in pretty good shape. L&#x27;Oreal EverPure is my hands down favorite shampoo but this is cheaper so, why not, right? WRONG. My hair is constantly tangled, brittle, and there are waaaay more split ends now. The conditioner isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing considering how stripped my hair feels from the shampoo. I have to use a lot of leave-in conditioner to detangle my hair now.</li>
            <li> Sorry, will be giving this away.  I&#x27;m very picky with shampoos and just did not like the way this made my hair feel; kind of dry, limp and with no pizzazz</li>
            <li> The product said it would be tingly and I&#x27;ve had some peppermint shampoos that were. This one is not that way for me, so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good for natural hair, cleans hair very well and gives excellent shine and moisture. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like about this product is the mint smell. If you like mint you would probably love this.</li>
            <li> I was totally how surprised much I liked these 2 products.  I had recently bought some Tea Tree Oil because have terribly dry hands, and working in a doctors office, I am washing my hands all the time.  The oil worked great on my hands so I figured why not the shampoo and conditioner.  I bought them to just try them out. I REALLY love them.  I have fine dry hair,  but it gets greasy at the roots if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.  I used this shampoo and my hair felt so clean,  NOT STRIPPED of natural oils, just clean.  Then I used the conditioner and it soaked right up into my hair, yet it still did not feel heavy.  Once it dried it was, shiny,  clean,  and bouncy,  full of life.  I also notice if I don&#x27;t wash every day,  my hair does not have that greasy look,  that I get most of the time.  I am truly ecstatic with these products.  My only reason for giving it a 4 star instead of a 5, is because of the packaging...  When I received them they were in a good, non-damaged box,  in bubble wrap.  But they had used a cellophane wrapping to wrap both bottles together,  it must have been to tightly wrapped and the shampoo bottle cap opened just enough to leak some.  Granted it wasn&#x27;t enough to send it back,  was just enough to make a mess of the 2 bottles.  Overall I LOVE the product,  they just need to figure out how to ship better.</li>
            <li> Hard to figure out how much to use. A dime size amount would be too mild and would only lather or clean your hair unless you used way too much. Using too much leaves scalp flakier and hair drier than before. I felt dirty. not worth overpaying $15</li>
            <li> Found out about this by reading my daughter&#x27;s face page. (It was public)  She had no idea&lt;br /&gt;I had seen it and she was really surprised.</li>
            <li> This duo is fabulous. Will definitely buy again.  Feels very good while washing and hair makes hair look wonderful once dry. wonderful product.</li>
            <li> These products give a great mint smell and they feel very cleansing. They really do tingle. After I remove the product my hair and scalp feel very refreshed and vigorating, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  Good results washing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a review on how well the products are, because I literally just purchased them today. What I can say is that in the Bay Area, where I live, it can get expensive. I went to Trader Joes and paid $8.66 for both the shampoo and conditioner together and both were 16oz each. Not sure why it&#x27;s priced so high on here, but if you have a Trader Joes in your area, just get it there.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner! I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Only a mild tingle. Not effective enough to help treat psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Strong yet gentle on all hair types and even color treated hair.  Does not have all those other chemicals that other shampoos and conditioners have especially sodium sulphate and no parabens.  Been using this shampoo and conditioner for about two years and will not change it.  The scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Works stops my hair from itchiness and you can feel all the natural ingredients in this..healthy for your hair I would recommend buying this if you want healthier hair with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Lathers, works perfectly</li>
            <li> Results were not as expected</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Nice scent, does the job fairly well. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again, but I still hope to find something better so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy other brands in search of the perfect tea tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smell good left my hair really soft and tingly..i have natural black hair</li>
            <li> Love it!  My daughter-in-law introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> Great value. Does not smell as strongly as I had hoped. My husband likes it. I bought it as a Christmas gift for him, it&#x27;s now May and he has well over half a bottle of both left. Good quality and well packaged product.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 2 stars only because of the price.  The product is a really good product.  But the price is way too HIGH!!!!!  I went to Trader Joes and paid $3.99 for the shampoo and $3.99 for the conditioner!  Talk about feeling like a fool!&lt;br /&gt;You know the old saying \\&quot;Buyer Beware\\&quot;  In this  case it is oh so true!  I do love the shampoo and conditioner.  It is a good product.</li>
            <li> Quality shampoo and conditioner. Approx. twice more expensive than if you buy it at an actual Trader Joe&#x27;s store , but the newest store is over an hour away.. the gas expense alone more than makes up the price difference. Large quantities, should last several&lt;br /&gt;months.</li>
            <li> i love the small of this product but unfortunately for me, i don&#x27;t feel any tingle whatsoever, which was the biggest reason i wanted to try this. when it&#x27;s gone, i&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo/conditioner to swap out with my Yes to Carrots Scalp relief (I like to rotate periodically). While I liked the scent (minty tea tree oil), and it was fine for my hair, this product made my scalp even drier than usual. Will stick with Carrots, because this one did the opposite of what I&#x27;d expected. Not terrible, but not worth the price, IME.</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes very little lather. Very nice conditioner. Smoothing (fewer frizzies) and rinses clean. The set are not the best for those who want to shower immediately before bed.</li>
            <li> i have not used this product personally...but my husband said he thought it was the conditioner that seems to dry out his hair..</li>
            <li> Choosing CRUELTY FREE cosmetics and cleaning products is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner although I&#x27;m finding it a bit drying.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff but expensive</li>
            <li> Cleans well, and has a very nice smell!  Love the light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t weigh down long hair.  Will re-order!</li>
            <li> Love this! My scalp was so dry, flaky and itchy so I gave this a try. What a lifesaver! It smells nice and works like a charm. My scalp and I love all the essential oils and the light tingling sensation is pleasing and let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s working. Will be a new regular in my shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about trader joe&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners and I finally tried for myself. I was impressed with the results and the tingle on my scalp long after I&#x27;d completed shampooing and conditioning my hair. I don&#x27;t know if this will be my go to product yet because my scalp tingled as promised, but my hair was not extremly soft, however, I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I have a double whammy.  My hair is long, color treated, and very fine and I live in the desert and many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; components actually dry out your hair here.  After reading other reviews and reviewing the ingredients I decided to give this a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and can say it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but I do have clean, shiny hair.  I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, and my hair still looks good.  This winter I have still had a few problems with static electricity so I made up a potion of 1/3 conditioner and 2/3 water in a spray bottle and use this on the ends in between shampoos for the fly aways.  It is not greasy and works well for added moisturizing.  I feel only a little tingle,but wasn&#x27;t expecting to feel more.The tea tree oil smell is dominent but goes away as your hair dries.  Over all, I like this combination and would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon was my first experience with this shampoo and conditioner. It is mostly organic and made from essential oils without sulfates. I like it quite a bit. I&#x27;d buy it again, but next time probably directly from Trader Joe&#x27;s since it is a lot cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!! Hubby&#x27;s hair looks and smells clean and feels moisturized</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair and scalp feel. I don&#x27;t itch nearly as much and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> The shampoo washes out of my hair easily and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of shampoo to get your hair clean.  The conditioner is the one that tingles my scalp and makes it feel good.  I am not able to use most conditioners because the residue weights my hair down.  I don&#x27;t like it when my hair feels like it has a coating of product on it.This one is better because it makes my hair look healthy and I can style my hair easier.  The last time I had my hair cut my hair dresser said that my hair was in good condition.</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair and smells nice.  I have medium length/wavy hair and it made my hair very frizzy.  This is suppose to be a no poo/curly girl product as it is sulfate free, but I&#x27;ve never had frizzy hair like this before.  It sucks the natural oils out of your hair.  I&#x27;m going back to deva curl shampoo and conditioner even though it costs a significant amount of more money.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this shampoo and conditioner for my 2 children that are in grade school to void any lice issues. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great delivery time, too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the tingle that you get when you use this however the shampoo leaves my hair very dry.  The conditioner is much better - lathers well and takes care of the dryness left behind by the shampoo</li>
            <li> We do not live near a Trader Joe&#x27;s but tried this shampoo &amp; conditioner when we found it on vacation.  It is SO GOOD that we have stockpiled several bottles.  :)  I use it on my daughter and it keeps her naturally sleek hair shiny, clean, well-conditioned and very healthy. She gets lots of compliments on her beautiful hair and I think this shampoo and conditioner get a lot of the credit. Extra BONUS is that the eucalyptus ingredient is a natural lice repellent. Our hairdresser told us that lice HATE eucalyptus.  With school-age kids, you always get those awful notes from school saying some kid in your child&#x27;s class had lice.  This way, you know they&#x27;re covered.  ;)  This shampoo and conditioner smell tea tree, minty FRESH and our hairdresser noted how it does not build up on our daughter&#x27;s hair.  The ingredient list is impressive and the results are great.  Going on another trip soon and will be stocking up again.  It&#x27;s so good that I will be bringing back some for friends who have requested it.  Glad to see this is offered on Amazon &amp; that&#x27;s nice for those who can&#x27;t get to the stores.  However, it is much cheaper in the store.  ($3.99 a bottle, I believe)</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between Trader Joe&#x27;s and the Brand Name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pay more on Amazon but it includes delivery to your door so it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;Rip-Off&amp;#34; at all. I plan on buying the soap and body wash.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know anything about the product because I haven&#x27;t used it but is this product good for natural African-American hair? Does anyone know?</li>
            <li> I really like it makes my hair feel nice and soft. I just wish the smell and tingle was a little stronger. I&#x27;m going to get the body wash soon.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I use it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and it real shines!</li>
