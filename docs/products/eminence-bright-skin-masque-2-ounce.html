            <li> In looking for a masque, I saw Eminence Bright Skin Masque being promoted by a host on the Today show. She said she uses it every day, and her skin feels soft and clean. The directions say to use this once or twice a week, I will follow these directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masque arrived well packaged, and in a attractive white box with directions and ingredients printed on the side of the box. The jar itself is also attractive and a small scoop accompanies the jar. Directions state to emulsify a small amount in your hands with a few drops of water,and then apply this to your clean face. Leave on for 5-10 minutes, and then wash it off with a clean washcloth and rinse until water runs clear. I followed directions and my skin did feel smooth and clean.

            <li> I use it on the back of my hands every night. It makes my hands less old and boney. Doesn&#x27;t do much for dark spots though.</li>
            <li> I like it you feel your face clean and smooth</li>
            <li> I love this masque. It smells good and really brightens, lightens, and softens my skin. I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I can see my skin changing for the good.</li>
            <li> I like the masque,all of Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far were good.I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one,that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I tried this  product line because a host on a national talk show uses it and has flawless skin. It is a good as she said. Rather than following the directions on the jar, I do as she advised---- after washing and exfoliating, put as much as you think you will need for your face and neck (it takes less than you think) and add only one or two drops of water. The less the better. Mix together and spread on face and neck. LEAVE IT ON FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS as you prepare for the day. Then rinse your face and neck liberally with water and apply moisturizer. You won&#x27;t believe how wonderful your skin feels. When I saw the jar, I thought that no way would this last for 3  months as the talk show host had said, but I&#x27;ve had it for more than 3 weeks and it looks as if I&#x27;ve hardly touched it., and I do this daily.  I chose this particular masque because I am getting up there in age and this sounded like the right product for me. I am extremely well pleased with the product and the fact that my skin looked and felt wonderfully rejuvenated after the first application. Do yourself a favor and try this product or one more suited to your skin type  in this line---they have many choices. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I love this masque!!! Hands down Eminence everything I&#x27;ve tried is amazing and exceeds my expectations!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eminence Products for over 3 years now and this Bright Skin Masque works wonderfully. I usually do a masque once or twice a week and sometimes I rotate over to the Blueberry Soy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff....started noticing results after 2 weeks!! A bit pricey but hard to find at retail stores.</li>
            <li> Great for my ole&#x27; skin.  Very gentle and moisturizing.  My skin has been soft and clear since starting to use all the Eminence products.</li>

            <li> Thank you perfect experience</li>
            <li> Excellent, tingly spa experience at home! My skin has been improving little by little with frequent use. It looks clearer and healthier.  Eminence are simply the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried on my skin!</li>
            <li> LOVE eminence products!  They have made my skin so nice and it&#x27;s nice to know that they are non-toxic to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scented, all natural masque.  I believe it does impart a bit of brightness to the skin..I&#x27;m sure if I used it more regularly it would be even better..also seems to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; the skin a tiny bit making it feel a bit less drawn. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with the line of products. I&#x27;ve used other Eminence masques but really like this one too!</li>
            <li> 47-years old.  Was standing at a work event when a female coworker commented that I looked radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I had used the Bright Skin MAsque that morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CRUELTY FREE products.  I love them all.</li>
            <li> All the Eminence products are wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used them for years.  The best part is the packaging and how you can get every last drop of goodness out of the jar!</li>
            <li> awesome skin masque&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this was a bit too &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; for my taste. Left a little residue on my skin. Otherwise, smells neutral and feels good.</li>
            <li> I really like this masque. I use it in th morning instead of washing my face. It seems to tighten my pores and brighten my skin. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love how soft this masque makes my skin feels so soft, smooth, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great natural product to remove dark spots.</li>
