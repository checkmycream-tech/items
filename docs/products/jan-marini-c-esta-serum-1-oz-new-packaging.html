            <li>The nice thing about the Jan Marini products is that they deliver!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it, because it does good things for the skin, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because of the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have  used this product and loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this and the smell is great</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I LOVE JAN MARINI!</li>
            <li>Love both the face cream and the serum!</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a one size fits all kind of thing - nor should it</li>
            <li>be.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think the C Esta serum probably is good for most people.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price for a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great product and you will see results quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast service, product was great, love these products!</li>
            <li>The cream was fine, but the pump didn&#x27;t work well at all!</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Since using it (many years now), my skin tone has improved, and it leaves a healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li>I have tried many but none give you the effect of a smoother more even skin than JM.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon because I would never be able to buy this otherwise.</li>
            <li>The very best product I have ever used, have been using since mid 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love Jan Marini C Esta Serum.</li>
            <li>had some residue on the top as if it has been opened.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years--absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the product however the pump isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I am unscrewing the top and dumping it into my hand.</li>
            <li>The first results that I noticed was that the skin on my face is plumped out, a good way to make fine lines and wrinkles disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The Jan Marini C Esta Serum goes on easily.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs easily and putting sunscreen over this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong fragrance, like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced in any other cosmetic product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for combination or dry skin and all of the other C-Esta products make for a great regimen.</li>
            <li>I received a fresh bottle that was identical to a product I bought elsewhere for much more.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>but my skin certainly looks and feels more youthful.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line and its fantastic!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin and neck.</li>
            <li>This serum is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>After cosmetic surgery, this facial program was recommended at the hospital and is keeping this 77 year old looking good.</li>
            <li>Glad to have this back in my life.</li>
            <li>this product used to come in open bottles, now it is in a better sealed bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After cleansing my skin in the morning, I apply one squirt of this and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Good Morning World&amp;#34;-I really fell that my skin wakes up!</li>
            <li>It should be the first thing to touch your skin after you cleanse, morning and night.</li>
            <li>: Other reviewers have really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>My spa wants to sell this to me for $90 plus tax.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am going thru it much faster since it just pours out.</li>
            <li>So, I put a layer of light nightime Neutrogena moisturizer over it at night and some Clinique daily moisturizer over it during the day and it&#x27;s a little better.</li>
            <li>This serum is light and absorbs well into my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A standard of mine for years and the results are evident as I age.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on reducing the deep lines on my forehead, between my eyes as well as around my mouth.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Same old clogging bottle!</li>
            <li>it goes on nicely but has slight perfume-y smell and is slightly runny..a little sticky on the skin once applied..color is orangish</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to put it on right after my shower when my skin is crying DRY!  </li>

            <li> Glad to have this back in my life. Nothing like it for sun damaged aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen a great improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> This serum is well worth the price. It is light and absorbs easily and putting sunscreen over this you don&#x27;t feel like you have thick layers on your face. That and it&#x27;s really helped the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> The opening gets clogged often.  After only a few uses the pump doesn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;ve had to throw out...at least 1/2.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to vitamin C serum for my face.  Since using it (many years now), my skin tone has improved, and it leaves a healthy glow to my face.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist 8 years ago and I have been using it ever since...</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me what this product should look and smell like? I havent use this before and a bit concerned as product was in a box but not sealed..I question authenticity..it goes on nicely but has slight perfume-y smell and is slightly runny..a little sticky on the skin once applied..color is orangish</li>
            <li> Jan Marini is the BEST vitamin C serum on the market. I have tried many but none give you the effect of a smoother more even skin than JM.</li>
            <li> Jan Marini&#x27;s line of products are great. You do have to aim for the ones you like best because she puts out a number of products and it&#x27;s not a one size fits all kind of thing - nor should it be.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think the C Esta serum probably is good for most people.</li>
            <li> We are all looking for that fountain of youth and if you are like me you have tried everything.  The nice thing about the Jan Marini products is that they deliver!  I haven&#x27;t found that fountain but my skin certainly looks and feels more youthful.</li>
            <li> Fast service, product was great, love these products!</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year and feel naked without it! It absorbs quickly into my skin and neck.</li>
            <li> It was sent sooner than I expected. This product works very well on reducing the deep lines on my forehead, between my eyes as well as around my mouth.</li>
            <li> They forgot to add a pump in the bottle so now I have to open the bottle &amp; pour it out to use the product</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my sensitive skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to put it on right after my shower when my skin is crying DRY!  It keep my face from having that dry skin itch!  Love it!</li>
            <li> this product used to come in open bottles, now it is in a better sealed bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It will last longer</li>
            <li> Addicted to Jan Marini products! I love this and the smell is great, you&#x27;re skin feels amazing. I use the whole line and its fantastic!</li>
            <li> My spa wants to sell this to me for $90 plus tax. I know this product is the same from the smell and the results. Thank goodness for Amazon because I would never be able to buy this otherwise.</li>
            <li> The very best product I have ever used, have been using since mid 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This was not as it shold be.  I have used for years and it is a cream and this came out watery and awful.</li>
            <li> I love Jan Marini C Esta Serum. I started using this product last summer each morning after I wash and dry my face. Excellent product and I first learned about the product form my plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Same old clogging bottle!</li>
            <li> The cream was fine, but the pump didn&#x27;t work well at all!</li>
            <li> This is great product and you will see results quickly. This is one must have product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my esthetician, she said if I was going to spend money on anything for my face, it should be this. She was right. You will see improvement in the texture of your skin in days.</li>
            <li> After cosmetic surgery, this facial program was recommended at the hospital and is keeping this 77 year old looking good.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and has a nice fragrance. No issues with dispenser at all. Although my skin looks brighter I do notice that it has dried out my skin just a touch. So, I put a layer of light nightime Neutrogena moisturizer over it at night and some Clinique daily moisturizer over it during the day and it&#x27;s a little better. I will continue to use this until my skin becomes immune to the benefits and then it&#x27;s on to something else! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product.  Expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I use it twice a day.  Results are obvious.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> After cleansing my skin in the morning, I apply one squirt of this and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Good Morning World&amp;#34;-I really fell that my skin wakes up! This serum is light and absorbs well into my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This serum works.  Firms and livens up my skin.  Others have noticed the difference.  Only thing is, the pump does not always work even after cleaning it out.  This is my second time to order this here.  I have never had this problem when ordered on the official Jan Marini website.  I have to unscrew the cap and pour sparingly into my hand which is a hassle.</li>
            <li> makes skin feel smooth and hydrated!!</li>
            <li> I actually love the product, but this is my third time using it with this crazy pump.  The pump ALWAYS breaks, therefore I have to open the cap and pour.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, brightens skin and firms, very light don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it and great scent! I LOVE JAN MARINI!</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price for a great product.  I received a fresh bottle that was identical to a product I bought elsewhere for much more.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> The packaging seems legit but the serum has an odd texture. It might be a fraudulent product.</li>
            <li> had some residue on the top as if it has been opened.  No seal so unable to know.</li>
            <li> The Jan Marini C Esta Serum goes on easily. My skin immediately feels softer. The first results that I noticed was that the skin on my face is plumped out, a good way to make fine lines and wrinkles disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance is almost intolerable to me. It&#x27;s a very strong fragrance, like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced in any other cosmetic product. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, because it does good things for the skin, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because of the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Other reviewers have really liked the fragrance. I&#x27;ll just take off one star because I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Comment</li>
            <li> Always a great moisturizer at a great price from this vendor. Perfect for combination or dry skin and all of the other C-Esta products make for a great regimen.</li>
            <li> I have  used this product and loved it. But this time the consistency is too runny! It is difficult to use because it is like water.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years--absolutely love it.  It should be the first thing to touch your skin after you cleanse, morning and night.</li>

            <li> A standard of mine for years and the results are evident as I age.</li>
            <li> Love both the face cream and the serum!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin so soft.</li>
