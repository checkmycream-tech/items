            <li>very nice</li>
            <li>The plates are very nice quality</li>
            <li>Pueen has always done very nice stamping plates and this set is no exception.</li>
            <li>and I loved it works great</li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>

            <li>I must say that this is a really nice nail art stamp collection from PUEEN, its simply beautiful</li>

            <li>24B - STAMPING BUFFET arrived LOL as I was watching a YouTube video from one of the ladies I subscribe to and decided I wanted to do my nails kind of like hers.  </li>
            <li>With these plates they fit them perfectly!</li>
            <li>it looks good.</li>
            <li>but I think that for the price they are a good buy.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to piece together images to get something that looks good.</li>
            <li>and it stamps really good.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful plates, so many designs.</li>
            <li>So many beautiful designs, it took my forever to decide which plate</li>
            <li>All not so usable , as to be seen on nail but most are great.</li>
            <li>then I used my old card as a scraper and the images were perfectly etched and beautiful</li>
            <li>but when I opened it the smell was very overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>So cute great stamping plate.</li>

            <li>I keep discovering more ways to use them.</li>
            <li>and more.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I just love the collage type nail stamps.</li>
            <li>Hoping for more designs like this.</li>
            <li>I have been taying many stamping plates over time</li>
            <li>After closely viewing it and testing it I came up with my opinion that there is much more improvement to be done.</li>
            <li>I love these stamping plates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these plates are well done with interesting and lovely images for creative stamping.</li>
            <li>I am still enjoying them, soon to order more, thank you.</li>
            <li>Love the designs and plates.</li>
            <li>Love this set</li>
            <li>one of them was a favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>so I had to purchase one separately however still in love with the product.</li>
            <li>So many images, so many ways to use them.</li>
            <li>Came as described and love that they came with a holder.</li>
            <li>But I like infinity plates better</li>
            <li>They are too many and are so pretty!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that great plates with great designs.  </li>
            <li>This is my third set of Pueen plates and I love these!!!</li>
            <li>The 99cent plates are no where near as good!</li>
            <li>Im so happy with my new stamping plates!</li>
            <li>nicely etched ...stamps clean</li>
            <li>This set has some great scroll/flower designs which I like and for the price, all around decent stamp plates.</li>
            <li>This collection has nice mix of elegant flourishes, flowers and swirls, bold geometric shapes and lines, and some wording as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they have pretty good images (plenty to pick from)  </li>
            <li>Very nice set, nice case and deeply etched.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li>they are sorta positioned in triangle shapes, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you want something easy to use, and don&#x27;t care about a &amp;#34;mosaic&amp;#34; of sorts on your nail, then these are definitely better than the old/smaller designed plates.</li>
            <li>I love that the shipping was really fast, the plates were already in the storage case and everything but plate 69 was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>So far the images I have used have all stamped great.  </li>
            <li>Below are my more detailed thoughts on the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used stamping polish and nail polish to stamp and so far the images pick up great.</li>
            <li>Pueen makes my favorite stamping plates because of the fantastic quality and this set is just as good; the images are detailed and crisp, they are just a breeze to work with.</li>
            <li>I have no problem picking up a nice clean image that covers my full nail.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can choose sections and it&#x27;s perfect for my clients with super long nails!!</li>
            <li>and I found the designs to be unique and interesting.</li>
            <li>It is so cool!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to grasp with the stamper.</li>
            <li>but the plates slide in and out of their slots easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;--Plates have crisp etching and the designs transferred nicely to the stamper and my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love full coverage designs.</li>
            <li>Nice crisp images</li>
            <li>everything was fine</li>
            <li>I love the concept of covering the whole plate!!</li>
            <li>Between the different stampers I have and plates, it all works great with practice.</li>
            <li>Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li>If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li>a wider range of choices makes for some happy teen girls...</li>
            <li>case.&lt;br /&gt;--Larger images to fit my larger/</li>
            <li>and I enjoy stamping with them.</li>
            <li>fantastic plates ...</li>
            <li>If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li>This set is just as fabulous as everything else</li>
            <li>Used one of the plates for the first time today... pretty good, some attempts the color was lighter and then sometimes darker, but i believe that was on my end with the amount of polish.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that these are excellent quality and so easy for anyone to use, whether they are an amateur or an advanced</li>
            <li>Very well etched for precision pick up!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pueen is by far my most favorite stamping brand because of the quality of the designs, so I couldn&#x27;t hit the order button fast enough when I saw this awesome &amp;#34;buffet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The plates are outstanding and stamp so well making such beautiful designs that are very clear and detailed.  </li>
            <li>Definitly worth the price!</li>
            <li>These small disc are great!</li>
            <li>I was excited to buy them.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my stamps today</li>
            <li>did some test stamping and for the most part all of the plates are well etched and stamps are crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>Out of all the Pueen plate collections this is my favorite some images are too large for a nail</li>
            <li>I was in love with the designs but they are too large to get the full design on the nail.  </li>
            <li>so when I got it I was super excited.</li>
            <li>This comes with a pink case to keep everything organized and a  great assortment of designs.</li>
            <li>They have really cute designs, and full designs for your whole nail</li>
            <li>All of the plates stamp nice and clear.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy and it works well with regular polish.</li>
            <li>I prefer a full nail design</li>
            <li>Love these plates, they are very well crafted.  </li>
            <li>These have become my favorite as my nails have gotten much longer</li>
            <li>The case is cute but it also stained the plastic on the inside, which I don&#x27;t really mind since the plates are not stained.</li>
            <li>Love these, but the one thing I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care so much about was if it came with a case for the plates or not.  </li>
            <li>Really nice plates images stamp clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like doing business this way and as much as I want the love elements 24B set</li>
            <li>These nail plates are completely full of images, designs, themes, wording, etc.</li>
            <li>Not a bad set of screens for the price.  </li>
            <li>I started using this with a cheap scraper and couldn&#x27;t get the images right and was worried</li>
            <li>The designs pick up pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>The size of various stamps is perfect for longer nails and even the big toe!</li>
            <li>delivered quickly delivered on time</li>
            <li>But that my issue and it has nothing to do with these plates, which I love, so I HIGHLY recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these plates to ladies who love stamping and have longer nails.</li>
            <li>These plates are very pretty.</li>
            <li>very pretty can&#x27;t wait till i try it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty plates.</li>
            <li>The images transfer easily and are very clear and detailed.</li>
            <li>Well etched, quick shipping and so much fun to work with.  </li>
            <li>i wish they can sell it separately  and not in a set, but overall they are pretty good</li>
            <li>anyway besides that, all the images are beautiful, stamps well and comes out clear with regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The items arrived early in a super cute storage case.</li>
            <li>I have large nails and the images are very crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li>These actually fit on real finger nails.</li>
            <li>Having fun.</li>
            <li>They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with them.</li>
            <li>The designs are really cool and pretty.</li>
            <li>I rarely use them there</li>
            <li>I love the idea of the seamless plates, but some are still lacking.</li>
            <li>Instead of giving more pattern they&#x27;re just making them bigger, and there is a significant difference.</li>
            <li>But still love them more than my other plates.</li>
            <li>I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy.</li>
            <li>I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy.</li>
            <li>Other than that they will stamp really good.</li>
            <li>led me right to it here on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have purchase sets from them in the past and this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li>And the 3 flower plates were cute too, but on two of the plates there weren&#x27;t enough sizes to choose from, some smaller ones would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I loved that they are designed to fit larger nails as well as smaller nail beds.</li>
            <li>I really love the other Pueen plates,but these exceed it every set I own by far!</li>
            <li>Out of the entire Pueen nail art stamp collection, this is by far my most favorite.</li>
            <li>I really like that plate because of the fact I can take images from pretty much anywhere on the plate and make an entire scene on my manicure and it goes well over bright ombre nails</li>
            <li>Love the ability to be able to select a few images in one stamp.</li>
            <li>It was shipped super fast..</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First stamping plates I got and used</li>
            <li>is my first time ever using PUEEN nail stamping plates</li>
            <li>I love this set, the infinite images allow you to create multiple designs with just one plate.</li>
            <li>My first Pueen Collection.</li>
            <li>I noticed the plates stamped better when I used my regular stamping tool and not my sticky stamper.</li>
            <li>I love doing my nails, and these plates are currently my favorites.</li>
            <li>If Pueen made another nail buffet set I would possibly buy it, but I would like to see more variety.</li>
            <li>And it was exactly what i needed for my collection.</li>
            <li>Too funny.</li>
            <li>Overall, I’m pleased and would recommend this collection.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that these are just one big design</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what stood out to me about PUEEN to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I hope PUEEN comes out with more designs in this size that are a big collective design on each plate.  </li>
            <li>but there are looking really great!&lt;br /&gt;Looking foward to ir!</li>
            <li>I really like that there&#x27;s a bit of everything in this set - dots, swirls, flowers, hearts, words (my faves!)</li>
            <li>these plates are the business im in love with all the different designs on each plate</li>
            <li>I have to drop a star because many of the patterns and images are so big</li>
            <li>Almost all the images or patterns with flowers are so big that I can&#x27;t use them and still be able to tell what the image is once it&#x27;s on the nail.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it, I thought I would probably not use it</li>
            <li>They are all in the case, the case is cute, and the images use the entire plate</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for anyone that wants to have fun images on their nails.</li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I like screens for first time use and building collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Pueen Stamping plates and since the first set I bought didn&#x27;t dissapointed me, I wanted (need) to have this one in my collection too.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, highly functional plates.</li>
            <li>and I love the full plate image on the Buffet plates, the stamping choices are endless.  </li>
            <li>but i was really disappointed to find that most, if not all, of the best images are waaay to large to use - even on a thumb nail..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the plates and so far no issues, the images pick up nice and crisp</li>
            <li>were not deep enough to hold the polish and provide a good transfer.  </li>
            <li>plates, you rarely can fit the entire design on your thumb -</li>
            <li>Fun and high quality stamps.</li>
            <li>Super great, only draw back is some of the designs are too big</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I wish the designs were a tad smaller so more could fit onto the nail.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also really well etched so you almost always get a crisp image.</li>
            <li>First real stamp kit i purchased and</li>
            <li>I tried them out right away, I did many manicures to test them out plus my other plates, my boyfriend was like &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>Conversely, Plate 52 has a bunch of fantastic geometric shapes, but there are so many on the plate, there isn&#x27;t enough room to get a lift of any of the individual patterns to cover the whole nail, what whatever you can lift is so enlarged</li>
            <li>Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper.  </li>
            <li>Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper.</li>
            <li>I have large nail beds</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for stamping plates that have large images.  </li>
            <li>but nope too large...</li>
            <li>but they were still to large...</li>
            <li>I can certainly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I love how there is plenty of pattern to easily fit over my entire thumb nail, unlike most smaller plates in other lots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Almost too much to choose from 😄.</li>
            <li>music notes didnt really work for me...</li>
            <li>so polish go on very well...</li>
            <li>I knew I had to do my nails as I was ready to fill them</li>
            <li>And, of course it is pink, my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>very god set.</li>
            <li>this cause will cover whole nail.</li>
            <li>but if you have a silicone stamper you can make the image smaller to fit.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>and I was very exited to try this collection.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much</li>
            <li>it came really fast</li>
            <li>I really like these plates.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping (that&#x27;s a A+)</li>
            <li>The opposite was true of other plates in that they had a cute overall design that looked good on the plate itself, but the scale was too big for nails—as if a normal design was just enlarged, losing density and detail (#72).  </li>
            <li>The stamping plates themselves are nice and deep, which makes it very easy to pick up the entire image without any of it missing.</li>
            <li>Overall I do love the deigns and wish that they would come out with these exact designs the size of regular designs on nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li>A real bargain if you compare to similar full plate design plates and you get a case.</li>
            <li>Though the smell on the storage case kind of settled down now, Im hoping it goes away completely in time.  </li>
            <li>This set is unique in that the patterns are all combined so that the entire plate is full of images, so there&#x27;s a big boost in variety without the limitations of being too &#x27;themed&#x27; as I think the MoYou plates are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With most of them the areas of a given design are large enough to allow you to pick different parts of it, giving you matching nails that aren&#x27;t cookie cutter identical.</li>
            <li>the drop design on the right side of plate #58 has spots that shouldn&#x27;t be there and there are some more small spots on record image on plate #62.</li>
            <li>Image is crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>These plates are definitely better for being able to stamp your entire nail in 1 swoop, but the way the designs are laid out, you are hard pressed to be able to get the same design on your entire nail.</li>
            <li>so I was kind of excited to see another company offer a set similar to it with new designs, and I have had Pueen plates in the past</li>
            <li>It took me about 2-3 hours of practice to get it decent and each time it got easier.  </li>
            <li>this set can do so many different nail designs and also if you have big nail beds like me</li>
            <li>I also love how I can all have my nails with the same motif without using an identical image the way you do with smaller images and stickers.</li>
            <li>I love that these work for any nail size and you can pick and choose what portions of images to stamp so that each nail can be the same or different as desired.</li>
            <li>These plates are more similar to the Moyou collection in that the entire Plate is one continuous image.</li>
            <li>My only gripes are I wish the designs were more varied, it looks like some of the design elements were repeated from plate to plate and tweaked a little to make them different, I like my designs more varied.</li>
            <li>highly recommend PUEEN</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality -</li>
            <li>But apart from that...as we all know pueen stamping plates are high quality</li>
            <li>as well love the little case that this comes with to hold all the nail plates it came with.  </li>
            <li>(normally I stamp each design on a sheet of paper and store it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail art and stamping plate and the techniques.</li>
            <li>and that is why I was on YouTube, looking for inspiration and something new for my design.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact they come with bigger images for women like me that have really long nails as the bigger images will cover my whole nail.  </li>
            <li>i so love these plates and pueen products have the storage cases and other sets of plates!!!</li>
            <li>I love all the different designs, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li>But if you want a consistent design on your entire finger, you might want to keep this in mind.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that some of the images(plate 50, 53) are to big and dont fit the nail appropriately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--Images stamped nicely using just a regular Konad stamper and regular polish—although you may need to use a larger, squishy stamper for larger nail</li>
            <li>I had no trouble using any  of the 4 or 5 plates (haven&#x27;t used them all yet)</li>
            <li>, that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>these plates, you can cover your whole thumb, but it probably won&#x27;t have the same design on it -</li>
            <li>Not only can I cover my whole nail without attempting contortions with my stamper, but I can create a variation of the design for each nail.  </li>
            <li>I am a nail stamping fanatic and this set gives you so many options for creativity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that the carrying case for the plates is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>(I had pretty long nails</li>
            <li>Although the idea is good and looks really pretty, some of the plates with multiple designs are a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li>Designs are very different then most other plates and are compatible for longer nails as well as short</li>
            <li>(especially if your like me and are proficient at everything else but doing ombre style blending I use a full nail design to hide over my lack of blending skills and it looks super professional) and it covers like a full nail design not individual images, but cherry blossoms are very limited to only a few weeks of the year</li>
            <li>Some had many different designs/patterns on a single plate so that you couldn’t cover your nails with just a single pattern (#52 and #56, for example).  </li>
            <li>They are crisp sharp images and are clearly visable when stamped on the nail.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly new to stamping and it definitely is a skill to acquire.</li>
            <li>really like most of the designs in this collection, but about half are various flower designs, which seems a bit unoriginal.</li>
            <li>Finally, they fit wide &amp; long nails and the roses are my favorites.</li>
            <li>Since I usually wear my nails fairly long, I’m always on the hunt for plates with larger designs areas and, for the most part, this collection fills the bill.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets</li>
            <li>, it makes for lots of fun and little extra time to plan out things just so.  </li>
            <li>I liked how some of the images on this plate were negative images (where you would typically be used to seeing blank space it would be where the polish was designed to go.)</li>
            <li>These rank right up with Dashica as the easiest plates I ever used, and they rank with Moyou for the most interesting and innovative designs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am in love with this set!!</li>
            <li> I hope they make more like these!!</li>
            <li> Very nice set.</li>
            <li> very nice</li>
            <li> The plates are very nice quality</li>
            <li> Pueen has always done very nice stamping plates and this set is no exception.</li>
            <li> and I loved it works great</li>
            <li> Nice!  </li>
            <li> These plates are great, all around good designs.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is a really nice nail art stamp collection from PUEEN, its simply beautiful</li>
            <li> But once you get the scraping pressure and angle accurate the stamps works great!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> all the plates were unscratched and I loved the designs.</li>
            <li> 24B - STAMPING BUFFET arrived LOL as I was watching a YouTube video from one of the ladies I subscribe to and decided I wanted to do my nails kind of like hers.  </li>
            <li> With these plates they fit them perfectly!</li>
            <li> it looks good.</li>
            <li> but I think that for the price they are a good buy.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to piece together images to get something that looks good.</li>
            <li> and it stamps really good.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful plates, so many designs.</li>
            <li> So many beautiful designs, it took my forever to decide which plate</li>
            <li> All not so usable , as to be seen on nail but most are great.</li>
            <li> then I used my old card as a scraper and the images were perfectly etched and beautiful</li>
            <li> but when I opened it the smell was very overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>

            <li> I Love pueen plates.</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> I keep discovering more ways to use them.</li>
            <li> and more.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I just love the collage type nail stamps.</li>
            <li> Hoping for more designs like this.</li>
            <li> I have been taying many stamping plates over time</li>
            <li> After closely viewing it and testing it I came up with my opinion that there is much more improvement to be done.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these plates are well done with interesting and lovely images for creative stamping.</li>
            <li> I am still enjoying them, soon to order more, thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the designs and plates.</li>
            <li> Love this set</li>
            <li> one of them was a favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> so I had to purchase one separately however still in love with the product.</li>
            <li> So many images, so many ways to use them.</li>
            <li> Came as described and love that they came with a holder.</li>
            <li> But I like infinity plates better</li>
            <li> They are too many and are so pretty!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that great plates with great designs.  </li>
            <li> This is my third set of Pueen plates and I love these!!!</li>
            <li> The 99cent plates are no where near as good!</li>
            <li> Im so happy with my new stamping plates!</li>
            <li> nicely etched ...stamps clean</li>
            <li> This set has some great scroll/flower designs which I like and for the price, all around decent stamp plates.</li>
            <li> This collection has nice mix of elegant flourishes, flowers and swirls, bold geometric shapes and lines, and some wording as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they have pretty good images (plenty to pick from)  </li>
            <li> Very nice set, nice case and deeply etched.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li> they are sorta positioned in triangle shapes, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you want something easy to use, and don&#x27;t care about a &amp;#34;mosaic&amp;#34; of sorts on your nail, then these are definitely better than the old/smaller designed plates.</li>
            <li> I love that the shipping was really fast, the plates were already in the storage case and everything but plate 69 was in good condition.  </li>
            <li> So far the images I have used have all stamped great.  </li>
            <li> Below are my more detailed thoughts on the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used stamping polish and nail polish to stamp and so far the images pick up great.</li>
            <li> Pueen makes my favorite stamping plates because of the fantastic quality and this set is just as good; the images are detailed and crisp, they are just a breeze to work with.</li>
            <li> I have no problem picking up a nice clean image that covers my full nail.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that I can choose sections and it&#x27;s perfect for my clients with super long nails!!</li>
            <li> and I found the designs to be unique and interesting.</li>
            <li> It is so cool!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to grasp with the stamper.</li>
            <li> but the plates slide in and out of their slots easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Plates have crisp etching and the designs transferred nicely to the stamper and my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love full coverage designs.</li>
            <li> Nice crisp images</li>
            <li> everything was fine</li>
            <li> I love the concept of covering the whole plate!!</li>
            <li> Between the different stampers I have and plates, it all works great with practice.</li>
            <li> Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li> If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li> a wider range of choices makes for some happy teen girls...</li>
            <li> case.&lt;br /&gt;--Larger images to fit my larger/</li>
            <li> and I enjoy stamping with them.</li>
            <li> fantastic plates ...</li>
            <li> If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail.</li>
            <li> This set is just as fabulous as everything else</li>
            <li> Used one of the plates for the first time today... pretty good, some attempts the color was lighter and then sometimes darker, but i believe that was on my end with the amount of polish.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that these are excellent quality and so easy for anyone to use, whether they are an amateur or an advanced</li>
            <li> Very well etched for precision pick up!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pueen is by far my most favorite stamping brand because of the quality of the designs, so I couldn&#x27;t hit the order button fast enough when I saw this awesome &amp;#34;buffet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The plates are outstanding and stamp so well making such beautiful designs that are very clear and detailed.  </li>
            <li> Definitly worth the price!</li>
            <li> These small disc are great!</li>
            <li> I was excited to buy them.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my stamps today</li>
            <li> did some test stamping and for the most part all of the plates are well etched and stamps are crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> Out of all the Pueen plate collections this is my favorite some images are too large for a nail</li>
            <li> I was in love with the designs but they are too large to get the full design on the nail.  </li>
            <li> so when I got it I was super excited.</li>
            <li> This comes with a pink case to keep everything organized and a  great assortment of designs.</li>
            <li> They have really cute designs, and full designs for your whole nail</li>
            <li> All of the plates stamp nice and clear.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy and it works well with regular polish.</li>
            <li> I prefer a full nail design</li>
            <li> Love these plates, they are very well crafted.  </li>
            <li> These have become my favorite as my nails have gotten much longer</li>
            <li> The case is cute but it also stained the plastic on the inside, which I don&#x27;t really mind since the plates are not stained.</li>
            <li> Love these, but the one thing I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care so much about was if it came with a case for the plates or not.  </li>
            <li> Really nice plates images stamp clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing business this way and as much as I want the love elements 24B set</li>
            <li> These nail plates are completely full of images, designs, themes, wording, etc.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set of screens for the price.  </li>
            <li> I started using this with a cheap scraper and couldn&#x27;t get the images right and was worried</li>
            <li> The designs pick up pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> The size of various stamps is perfect for longer nails and even the big toe!</li>
            <li> delivered quickly delivered on time</li>
            <li> But that my issue and it has nothing to do with these plates, which I love, so I HIGHLY recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these plates to ladies who love stamping and have longer nails.</li>
            <li> These plates are very pretty.</li>
            <li> very pretty can&#x27;t wait till i try it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty plates.</li>
            <li> The images transfer easily and are very clear and detailed.</li>
            <li> Well etched, quick shipping and so much fun to work with.  </li>
            <li> i wish they can sell it separately  and not in a set, but overall they are pretty good</li>
            <li> anyway besides that, all the images are beautiful, stamps well and comes out clear with regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The items arrived early in a super cute storage case.</li>
            <li> I have large nails and the images are very crisp and clean.  </li>
            <li> These actually fit on real finger nails.</li>
            <li> Having fun.</li>
            <li> They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with them.</li>
            <li> The designs are really cool and pretty.</li>
            <li> I rarely use them there</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the seamless plates, but some are still lacking.</li>
            <li> Instead of giving more pattern they&#x27;re just making them bigger, and there is a significant difference.</li>
            <li> But still love them more than my other plates.</li>
            <li> I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy.</li>
            <li> I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy.</li>
            <li> Other than that they will stamp really good.</li>
            <li> led me right to it here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have purchase sets from them in the past and this is the best one by far.  </li>
            <li> And the 3 flower plates were cute too, but on two of the plates there weren&#x27;t enough sizes to choose from, some smaller ones would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I loved that they are designed to fit larger nails as well as smaller nail beds.</li>
            <li> I really love the other Pueen plates,but these exceed it every set I own by far!</li>
            <li> Out of the entire Pueen nail art stamp collection, this is by far my most favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like that plate because of the fact I can take images from pretty much anywhere on the plate and make an entire scene on my manicure and it goes well over bright ombre nails</li>
            <li> Love the ability to be able to select a few images in one stamp.</li>
            <li> It was shipped super fast..</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First stamping plates I got and used</li>
            <li> is my first time ever using PUEEN nail stamping plates</li>
            <li> I love this set, the infinite images allow you to create multiple designs with just one plate.</li>
            <li> My first Pueen Collection.</li>
            <li> I noticed the plates stamped better when I used my regular stamping tool and not my sticky stamper.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails, and these plates are currently my favorites.</li>
            <li> If Pueen made another nail buffet set I would possibly buy it, but I would like to see more variety.</li>
            <li> And it was exactly what i needed for my collection.</li>
            <li> Too funny.</li>
            <li> Overall, I’m pleased and would recommend this collection.  </li>
            <li> LOVE that these are just one big design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what stood out to me about PUEEN to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I hope PUEEN comes out with more designs in this size that are a big collective design on each plate.  </li>
            <li> but there are looking really great!&lt;br /&gt;Looking foward to ir!</li>
            <li> I really like that there&#x27;s a bit of everything in this set - dots, swirls, flowers, hearts, words (my faves!)</li>
            <li> these plates are the business im in love with all the different designs on each plate</li>
            <li> I have to drop a star because many of the patterns and images are so big</li>
            <li> Almost all the images or patterns with flowers are so big that I can&#x27;t use them and still be able to tell what the image is once it&#x27;s on the nail.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I thought I would probably not use it</li>
            <li> They are all in the case, the case is cute, and the images use the entire plate</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anyone that wants to have fun images on their nails.</li>
            <li> I look forward to ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I like screens for first time use and building collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Pueen Stamping plates and since the first set I bought didn&#x27;t dissapointed me, I wanted (need) to have this one in my collection too.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, highly functional plates.</li>
            <li> and I love the full plate image on the Buffet plates, the stamping choices are endless.  </li>
            <li> but i was really disappointed to find that most, if not all, of the best images are waaay to large to use - even on a thumb nail..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the plates and so far no issues, the images pick up nice and crisp</li>
            <li> were not deep enough to hold the polish and provide a good transfer.  </li>
            <li> plates, you rarely can fit the entire design on your thumb -</li>
            <li> Fun and high quality stamps.</li>
            <li> Super great, only draw back is some of the designs are too big</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I wish the designs were a tad smaller so more could fit onto the nail.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also really well etched so you almost always get a crisp image.</li>
            <li> First real stamp kit i purchased and</li>
            <li> I tried them out right away, I did many manicures to test them out plus my other plates, my boyfriend was like &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> Conversely, Plate 52 has a bunch of fantastic geometric shapes, but there are so many on the plate, there isn&#x27;t enough room to get a lift of any of the individual patterns to cover the whole nail, what whatever you can lift is so enlarged</li>
            <li> Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper.  </li>
            <li> Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper.</li>
            <li> I have large nail beds</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for stamping plates that have large images.  </li>
            <li> but nope too large...</li>
            <li> but they were still to large...</li>
            <li> I can certainly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love how there is plenty of pattern to easily fit over my entire thumb nail, unlike most smaller plates in other lots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Almost too much to choose from 😄.</li>
            <li> music notes didnt really work for me...</li>
            <li> so polish go on very well...</li>
            <li> I knew I had to do my nails as I was ready to fill them</li>
            <li> And, of course it is pink, my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> very god set.</li>
            <li> this cause will cover whole nail.</li>
            <li> but if you have a silicone stamper you can make the image smaller to fit.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> and I was very exited to try this collection.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care so much</li>
            <li> it came really fast</li>
            <li> I really like these plates.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping (that&#x27;s a A+)</li>
            <li> The opposite was true of other plates in that they had a cute overall design that looked good on the plate itself, but the scale was too big for nails—as if a normal design was just enlarged, losing density and detail (#72).  </li>
            <li> The stamping plates themselves are nice and deep, which makes it very easy to pick up the entire image without any of it missing.</li>
            <li> Overall I do love the deigns and wish that they would come out with these exact designs the size of regular designs on nail stamping plates.</li>
            <li> A real bargain if you compare to similar full plate design plates and you get a case.</li>
            <li> Though the smell on the storage case kind of settled down now, Im hoping it goes away completely in time.  </li>
            <li> This set is unique in that the patterns are all combined so that the entire plate is full of images, so there&#x27;s a big boost in variety without the limitations of being too &#x27;themed&#x27; as I think the MoYou plates are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With most of them the areas of a given design are large enough to allow you to pick different parts of it, giving you matching nails that aren&#x27;t cookie cutter identical.</li>
            <li> the drop design on the right side of plate #58 has spots that shouldn&#x27;t be there and there are some more small spots on record image on plate #62.</li>
            <li> Image is crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> These plates are definitely better for being able to stamp your entire nail in 1 swoop, but the way the designs are laid out, you are hard pressed to be able to get the same design on your entire nail.</li>
            <li> so I was kind of excited to see another company offer a set similar to it with new designs, and I have had Pueen plates in the past</li>
            <li> It took me about 2-3 hours of practice to get it decent and each time it got easier.  </li>
            <li> this set can do so many different nail designs and also if you have big nail beds like me</li>
            <li> I also love how I can all have my nails with the same motif without using an identical image the way you do with smaller images and stickers.</li>
            <li> I love that these work for any nail size and you can pick and choose what portions of images to stamp so that each nail can be the same or different as desired.</li>
            <li> These plates are more similar to the Moyou collection in that the entire Plate is one continuous image.</li>
            <li> My only gripes are I wish the designs were more varied, it looks like some of the design elements were repeated from plate to plate and tweaked a little to make them different, I like my designs more varied.</li>
            <li> highly recommend PUEEN</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High quality -</li>
            <li> But apart from that...as we all know pueen stamping plates are high quality</li>
            <li> as well love the little case that this comes with to hold all the nail plates it came with.  </li>
            <li> (normally I stamp each design on a sheet of paper and store it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art and stamping plate and the techniques.</li>
            <li> and that is why I was on YouTube, looking for inspiration and something new for my design.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact they come with bigger images for women like me that have really long nails as the bigger images will cover my whole nail.  </li>
            <li> i so love these plates and pueen products have the storage cases and other sets of plates!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the different designs, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> But if you want a consistent design on your entire finger, you might want to keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the images(plate 50, 53) are to big and dont fit the nail appropriately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Images stamped nicely using just a regular Konad stamper and regular polish—although you may need to use a larger, squishy stamper for larger nail</li>
            <li> I had no trouble using any  of the 4 or 5 plates (haven&#x27;t used them all yet)</li>
            <li> , that I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> these plates, you can cover your whole thumb, but it probably won&#x27;t have the same design on it -</li>
            <li> Not only can I cover my whole nail without attempting contortions with my stamper, but I can create a variation of the design for each nail.  </li>
            <li> I am a nail stamping fanatic and this set gives you so many options for creativity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that the carrying case for the plates is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> (I had pretty long nails</li>
            <li> Although the idea is good and looks really pretty, some of the plates with multiple designs are a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Designs are very different then most other plates and are compatible for longer nails as well as short</li>
            <li> (especially if your like me and are proficient at everything else but doing ombre style blending I use a full nail design to hide over my lack of blending skills and it looks super professional) and it covers like a full nail design not individual images, but cherry blossoms are very limited to only a few weeks of the year</li>
            <li> Some had many different designs/patterns on a single plate so that you couldn’t cover your nails with just a single pattern (#52 and #56, for example).  </li>
            <li> They are crisp sharp images and are clearly visable when stamped on the nail.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly new to stamping and it definitely is a skill to acquire.</li>
            <li> really like most of the designs in this collection, but about half are various flower designs, which seems a bit unoriginal.</li>
            <li> Finally, they fit wide &amp; long nails and the roses are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Since I usually wear my nails fairly long, I’m always on the hunt for plates with larger designs areas and, for the most part, this collection fills the bill.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets</li>
            <li> , it makes for lots of fun and little extra time to plan out things just so.  </li>
            <li> I liked how some of the images on this plate were negative images (where you would typically be used to seeing blank space it would be where the polish was designed to go.)</li>
            <li> These rank right up with Dashica as the easiest plates I ever used, and they rank with Moyou for the most interesting and innovative designs.</li>
            <li> the only thing is I would NOT recommend this plate set if you have long nails ..</li>
            <li> The only shocker for me is that they&#x27;re a tiny bit harder to get the polish out of all the crevices after each use.  </li>
            <li> The only downside, for me, (and this is a personal issue cause I am slightly OCD when it comes to my nail designs and such) is I can&#x27;t document the designs for viewing purposes</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours combing Amazon to try and find it, then I had to do a search in google after about 2 hours of looking and low and behold google</li>
            <li> I have long nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;--Plates cleaned up easily—some plates have such rough edges around the design that they get covered in lint from whatever I’ve used to swipe them with (Q-tips, cotton balls, cotton pads).  </li>
            <li> I have long nails</li>
            <li> I have some what long nails</li>
            <li> Also, since my nails are long plus have a *lot* of side-to-side curvature, I sometimes have a hard time getting designs to stamp clearly even with larger stampers.  </li>
            <li> but these designs don&#x27;t work as well as some of the other plates with smaller design or nail shaped etched areas.</li>
            <li> so I will get lots of use from every single plate in this collection.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get the effect if you have average to smaller nails, like I do.</li>
            <li> and I was getting frustrated with my other plates not having big enough full images.</li>
            <li> The “scene” designs (#69, #70) are similar to Mo You plates, but it would be hard to get enough onto your nailto</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stamping for a few years, and I have a lot of stamping plates: Dashica, Moyou, Konad, Mash, Bundle Monster, Red Angel, Cici &amp; Sisi.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will take size ratio into consideration on the next round..</li>
            <li> I placed my order on Wednesday night from the Amazon seller and it was shipped on Thursday with and expected delivery of Monday.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really a downside to me though.  </li>
            <li> There are few images I could actually use.</li>
            <li> A few of the designs are not large enough to cover my nailbeds alone.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re backed with paper and carefully machined or something so that they aren&#x27;t as sharp on the edges as the other brands I&#x27;ve used (Salon Designs which aren&#x27;t backed and Bundle Monster which are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awaiting one plate replacement due ti scratch/defect.</li>
            <li> There were only two plates which I did not love.</li>
            <li> Nail Art Stamp Collection Set 24B - STAMPING BUFFET as there is an endless amount of designs you can accomplish on your nails, toenails, other stamping etc.  </li>
            <li> Sharp images</li>
            <li> endless possibilities.</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the down side about them but other than that they got a 5 star from me ...</li>
            <li> only reason didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the case is hard to get in and out of</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to find an image that fits my entire nail.</li>
            <li> Where ever you stamp down on one</li>
            <li> I like half of them a lot, and the rest</li>
            <li> The bird image on plate 69 has a slight flaw where it looks like there&#x27;s a little arrow on its head after stamping (???)</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  </li>
            <li> The one exception is the plates where the designs are in narrow bands or arches.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 differnt sets and to my surprise both the sets were missing 1 plate each.</li>
            <li> plate #69 was missing from my set.  </li>
            <li> but I was missing 3 plates and was refunded some of my purchase price.</li>
            <li> I was just missing those 3 and</li>
            <li> First, if you have never tried this, don&#x27;t get frustrated.  </li>
            <li> and I found it very hard to place a single flower.</li>
            <li> Only thing Was that the plates themselves had big scatches, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> (I got two of #54, rather than one #54 and one #64 and was just too darn lazy to return/</li>
            <li> I did not give 5 stars because two of my plates have some small defects in the etching,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at least six months ago and it sat and sat and sat.</li>
            <li> If you are a nail stamping fanatic then this buffet collection is a must have to add.</li>
            <li> wish the images were a bit smaller :(</li>
            <li> Also I used false nails to get the designs fully</li>
            <li> I hope someone reaches out to me to resolve this unfortunate situation.</li>
            <li> I have used some very bad plates in the past.</li>
            <li> Its very sad...</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t seem to get a bad design.</li>
            <li> i am extremely disappointed and would like plates that work.</li>
            <li> I was actually disappointed because I thought it came with the stamp and scrapers.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice set. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I love these plates! Unique,larger graphics done on each plate. Image is crisp and clear. Beautiful stamp every time. Also comes in a neat case. Definitly worth the price!</li>
            <li> Every stamp plate should be like these. These actually fit on real finger nails. Love the designs. Hope to see more sets like this.</li>
            <li> These plates work great . I love all the different designs, the possibilities are endless. I had no trouble using any  of the 4 or 5 plates (haven&#x27;t used them all yet), that I&#x27;ve used so far. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Can not get better than this! The 99cent plates are no where near as good!</li>
            <li> Beautiful plates, so many designs. Almost too much to choose from 😄. Awaiting one plate replacement due ti scratch/defect.</li>
            <li> This stamper works the best for me, and the scraper works also. I am fairly new to stamping and it definitely is a skill to acquire. But once you get the scraping pressure and angle accurate the stamps works great! I have several stampers, some harder some soft. It&#x27;s trial and error on using what stamper with the designs on the plate. If the soft stamper didn&#x27;t work on a design, I tried the harder one and it worked. So if one way doesn&#x27;t work, try it another way. Between the different stampers I have and plates, it all works great with practice.</li>
            <li> i always use this stamp set very cool!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!!!  so many options to choose from.  Great product !</li>
            <li> Their designs  are amazing and stamp to perfection. Love  them!</li>
            <li> Love them. All not so usable , as to be seen on nail but most are great. Having fun.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, nice case and deeply etched.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li> First, if you have never tried this, don&#x27;t get frustrated.  It took me about 2-3 hours of practice to get it decent and each time it got easier.  I would have given five stars but several of the engravings were not deep enough to hold the polish and provide a good transfer.  Lots of selections for designs but as I said, some are not deep enough so it&#x27;s a good thing there are so many!  If you don&#x27;t have a really good, fast drying topcoat you won&#x27;t be happy so make sure to get one!  LOVE how these came in a case because I did order a Bundle Monster and those were not in a handy case.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet but i am sure it will work.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and loving the variety!</li>
            <li> I have many sets of stamping plates and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  I have 4 sets of this brand and I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. This comes with a pink case to keep everything organized and a  great assortment of designs.</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> My pueen nail art stamp arrived in great condition . all the plates were unscratched and I loved the designs. There were only two plates which I did not love. These were plates with words like fashion etc.</li>
            <li> Daughter seems to like it, appears to work well.</li>
            <li> music notes didnt really work for me... thats why i bought them... but most of them do work... so thanks lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art and stamping plate and the techniques. .. I was fascinated and got this set... Kudos to Amazon for delivering this on time.. I started using this with a cheap scraper and couldn&#x27;t get the images right and was worried then I used my old card as a scraper and the images were perfectly etched and beautiful.. Would definitely recommend this... ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ’ž</li>
            <li> great. exactly what I was looking for. only reason didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the case is hard to get in and out of</li>
            <li> These small disc are great! Stamp well, would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Great gifts for Nail Stamping lovers!</li>
            <li> First stamping plates I got and used and I loved it works great</li>
            <li> They are crisp sharp images and are clearly visable when stamped on the nail.  There are many combinations you can put together so you don&#x27;t get the image on each nail. I have purchase sets from them in the past and this is the best one by far.  Finally, they fit wide &amp; long nails and the roses are my favorites.</li>
            <li> Loving how easy it&#x27;s to stamp with this gorgeous design they very deep so polish go on very well...</li>
            <li> I could not wait until my PUEEN Nail Art Stamp Collection Set 24B - STAMPING BUFFET arrived LOL as I was watching a YouTube video from one of the ladies I subscribe to and decided I wanted to do my nails kind of like hers.  I knew I had to do my nails as I was ready to fill them and that is why I was on YouTube, looking for inspiration and something new for my design.  When I saw the nail buffett plate #72 that she was using, I knew instantly that I wanted that plate.  I had never seen it before, but I fell instantly in love with it the minute I saw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours combing Amazon to try and find it, then I had to do a search in google after about 2 hours of looking and low and behold google led me right to it here on amazon.  I could not of been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally in LOVE with every one of these nail plates!!  I love the fact they come with bigger images for women like me that have really long nails as the bigger images will cover my whole nail.  That is so awesome to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time ever using PUEEN nail stamping plates but I can honestly say that I believe they have become my favorite nail stamping plate company.  The plates are outstanding and stamp so well making such beautiful designs that are very clear and detailed.  I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I as well love the little case that this comes with to hold all the nail plates it came with.  And, of course it is pink, my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend PUEEN Nail Art Stamp Collection Set 24B - STAMPING BUFFET as there is an endless amount of designs you can accomplish on your nails, toenails, other stamping etc.  It has something for everyone, but I personally love everyone of them and will get a ton of use out of them for years to come.  5++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful to you please rate it.  Thank you  :)</li>
            <li> I love this set, the infinite images allow you to create multiple designs with just one plate. The quality on these plates is superb. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These plates are definitely better for being able to stamp your entire nail in 1 swoop, but the way the designs are laid out, you are hard pressed to be able to get the same design on your entire nail. So basically saying, with the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; plates, you rarely can fit the entire design on your thumb - these plates, you can cover your whole thumb, but it probably won&#x27;t have the same design on it - they are sorta positioned in triangle shapes, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you want something easy to use, and don&#x27;t care about a &amp;#34;mosaic&amp;#34; of sorts on your nail, then these are definitely better than the old/smaller designed plates. But if you want a consistent design on your entire finger, you might want to keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> My first Pueen Collection. Amazing set, beautiful designs, they stamp very nice and clear. I give this set an A++.</li>
            <li> Beautiful stamping plates and easy to use. Fast shipping. Designs are very different then most other plates and are compatible for longer nails as well as short</li>
            <li> I have large nail beds so I&#x27;m always looking for stamping plates that have large images.  I have plates from monster bundle, moyou, etc.  This is by far my favorite.  The images are varied and etched well. I have no problem picking up a nice clean image that covers my full nail.  I love this set.  Hopefully, Pueen will make more like it.</li>
            <li> The plates I received were 75% scratched and the 25% that were not did not stamp properly. i am extremely disappointed and would like plates that work. I hope someone reaches out to me to resolve this unfortunate situation.</li>
            <li> These plates are very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates. There are a lot of different designs to choose from. Really am enjoying how the images blend together so nicely.</li>
            <li> stamps flawlessly some images are big but just position it correctly it is bound to be cute i love them</li>
            <li> I ordered my  plates on  a Monday night and I received them the next day (Tuesday). Super fast shipping and the plates are beautiful!  So many beautiful designs, it took my forever to decide which plate I wanted to use.  All of the plates stamp nice and clear. I noticed the plates stamped better when I used my regular stamping tool and not my sticky stamper. I definitely recommend this set. I already I ordered another set of their plates.  I think they are Love inspired images.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails, and these plates are currently my favorites. With most of them the areas of a given design are large enough to allow you to pick different parts of it, giving you matching nails that aren&#x27;t cookie cutter identical. The one exception is the plates where the designs are in narrow bands or arches. Still trying to figure out how I should use those.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these! If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail. Hoping for more designs like this. A real bargain if you compare to similar full plate design plates and you get a case. My favorite stamping plate set.</li>
            <li> Love the Pueen collection.  The size of various stamps is perfect for longer nails and even the big toe!</li>
            <li> Love love love it and ready to create beautiful designs. Sharp images</li>
            <li> This set is very similar to the Konad M66 plate. I really like that plate because of the fact I can take images from pretty much anywhere on the plate and make an entire scene on my manicure and it goes well over bright ombre nails (especially if your like me and are proficient at everything else but doing ombre style blending I use a full nail design to hide over my lack of blending skills and it looks super professional) and it covers like a full nail design not individual images, but cherry blossoms are very limited to only a few weeks of the year so I was kind of excited to see another company offer a set similar to it with new designs, and I have had Pueen plates in the past and I really liked them so being familar I was excited to buy them. When I got them out I tried them out right away, I did many manicures to test them out plus my other plates, my boyfriend was like &amp;#34;are you painting your nails again!?&amp;#34; I even tried doing it when he was sleeping one morning because he made me feel ashamed that I couldn&#x27;t decide on a manicure. I liked how some of the images on this plate were negative images (where you would typically be used to seeing blank space it would be where the polish was designed to go.) My only gripes are I wish the designs were more varied, it looks like some of the design elements were repeated from plate to plate and tweaked a little to make them different, I like my designs more varied. And I never thought I would ever be able to say this about a nail plate company ever but I am saying it now, some of the images were actually too big! Like the bird it was really cute, but there&#x27;s no way I could fit it on my nail! And the 3 flower plates were cute too, but on two of the plates there weren&#x27;t enough sizes to choose from, some smaller ones would have been nice. If Pueen made another nail buffet set I would possibly buy it, but I would like to see more variety.</li>
            <li> So far the images I have used have all stamped great.  A great variety to choose from! A great deal!</li>
            <li> This is my third set of Pueen plates and I love these!!! I have long nails so it is hard for me to find an image that fits my entire nail. With these plates they fit them perfectly! The only downside, for me, (and this is a personal issue cause I am slightly OCD when it comes to my nail designs and such) is I can&#x27;t document the designs for viewing purposes (normally I stamp each design on a sheet of paper and store it so I can decide which design I want to wear without going through each collection plate individually)  because they are so big. But that my issue and it has nothing to do with these plates, which I love, so I HIGHLY recommend them.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this set!! I&#x27;ve been stamping for a few years, and I have a lot of stamping plates: Dashica, Moyou, Konad, Mash, Bundle Monster, Red Angel, Cici &amp; Sisi. These rank right up with Dashica as the easiest plates I ever used, and they rank with Moyou for the most interesting and innovative designs. I&#x27;m so very impressed!</li>
            <li> Love the designs on the plates It was a good buy and it works well with regular polish.</li>
            <li> Great quality plates but i was really disappointed to find that most, if not all, of the best images are waaay to large to use - even on a thumb nail.. Hopefully they will take size ratio into consideration on the next round.. But the ones that are useable are lovely.</li>
            <li> Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper.  I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy. Oh and it came n like 2 days which is a plus!</li>
            <li> As a beauty blogger, I have definitely had my share of experiences when it comes to using nail stamping plates and I have to say that these are excellent quality and so easy for anyone to use, whether they are an amateur or an advanced stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images are plenty and I found the designs to be unique and interesting. I loved that they are designed to fit larger nails as well as smaller nail beds. The stamping plates themselves are nice and deep, which makes it very easy to pick up the entire image without any of it missing. The images transfer easily and are very clear and detailed. I have not had any troubles with these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent value for the price, and makes a wonderful addition to my stamping plate collection.</li>
            <li> very nice and I use  it almost everytime I do my nails ...i would recommend ..same quality as Konad and cheaper and nicer designs</li>
            <li> Well etched, quick shipping and so much fun to work with.  I highly recommend these plates to ladies who love stamping and have longer nails.</li>
            <li> Love these plates. There are so many options on them. The designs are so intricate you can use the same design but have it look different. 4 images per plate quadruples the value.</li>
            <li> I love how there is plenty of pattern to easily fit over my entire thumb nail, unlike most smaller plates in other lots.&lt;br /&gt;I really like most of the designs in this collection, but about half are various flower designs, which seems a bit unoriginal.</li>
            <li> I love this set. Very versatile. Stamp picks up with ease</li>
            <li> Very special plates!  I love the way they are designed.  I used some plates already and they stamped beautifully!</li>
            <li> It was in great shape when I received it!  And it was exactly what i needed for my collection. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughters love these and the fact that there are so many is even better...a wider range of choices makes for some happy teen girls...Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Not only can I cover my whole nail without attempting contortions with my stamper, but I can create a variation of the design for each nail.  Awesome job, Pueen!</li>
            <li> I had been lusting after this set for some time so when I got it I was super excited. The items arrived early in a super cute storage case. Great set!!! Love how all the designs just blend into one another. So many choices and so many creative designs. I&#x27;ll never tire of this buffet. I use nail  striping polish for stamping? It&#x27;s inexpensive ($1 LA Colors) and shows up great!! Metallic/foil type polishes work great too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at least six months ago and it sat and sat and sat. Make sure you buy the stamp to go with it. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get use, then she had a friend over and they broke this thing out. It is so cool! I don&#x27;t paint my nails, but I probably would with this designs. You can do some really creative things.</li>
            <li> Great product, stamps are awesome quality and always come out crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> First of all, whomever named this buffet, what a great name. Too funny. Anyway, great designs. Love the fact that I can choose sections and it&#x27;s perfect for my clients with super long nails!!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for longer nails and toes.</li>
            <li> great buy. endless possibilities. so glad i purchased and with prime it came in 2 days. perfect</li>
            <li> it came in 2 days! Im so happy with my new stamping plates! they work perfectly and came packaged great, nothing that looked super cheap. I WILL be buying from this company again. couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase</li>
            <li> Since I usually wear my nails fairly long, I’m always on the hunt for plates with larger designs areas and, for the most part, this collection fills the bill.  Also, since my nails are long plus have a *lot* of side-to-side curvature, I sometimes have a hard time getting designs to stamp clearly even with larger stampers.  These plates were easy to use, had a nice selection of designs, the designs transferred to my nails, and they’re a good value.  Overall, I’m pleased and would recommend this collection.  Below are my more detailed thoughts on the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Plates have crisp etching and the designs transferred nicely to the stamper and my nails.&lt;br /&gt;--Plates cleaned up easily—some plates have such rough edges around the design that they get covered in lint from whatever I’ve used to swipe them with (Q-tips, cotton balls, cotton pads).  That didn’t happen with these plates.&lt;br /&gt;--Variety of designs.&lt;br /&gt;--Cute—and convenient--faux leather case.&lt;br /&gt;--Larger images to fit my larger/longer nails.&lt;br /&gt;--Images stamped nicely using just a regular Konad stamper and regular polish—although you may need to use a larger, squishy stamper for larger nail surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn’t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--My set had a duplicate of one of the plates.  (I got two of #54, rather than one #54 and one #64 and was just too darn lazy to return/exchange the set.)&lt;br /&gt;--I had a problem with the design scale of some of the plates.  Some had many different designs/patterns on a single plate so that you couldn’t cover your nails with just a single pattern (#52 and #56, for example).  The opposite was true of other plates in that they had a cute overall design that looked good on the plate itself, but the scale was too big for nails—as if a normal design was just enlarged, losing density and detail (#72).  The “scene” designs (#69, #70) are similar to Mo You plates, but it would be hard to get enough onto your nailto look good—again, a problem with scale.  This detracted from the usefulness and beauty of some of the plates.&lt;br /&gt;--I didn’t care for many of the designs.  (I realize that’s just personal preference, tho, and probably a given with any collection, but I’m throwing it out there.)</li>
            <li> Great plates!  The designs pick up pretty easily.  The only thing is that I wish the designs were a tad smaller so more could fit onto the nail.</li>
            <li> I love these nail art stamp. They are gorgeous and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love the plates. Very well etched for precision pick up!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. Stamps beautifully</li>
            <li> My Pueen plates arrived ion time and were in excellent shape. The plates are made well and I enjoy stamping with them. They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this collection .. it has a lot of different looks all in one set.. i especially love the florals</li>
            <li> very pretty can&#x27;t wait till i try it.</li>
            <li> very god set. etched very well with great images.love the idea of these plates. Love the ability to be able to select a few images in one stamp. My only complaint is that some of the images(plate 50, 53) are to big and dont fit the nail appropriately. wish the images were a bit smaller :( and then they would be perfect.</li>
            <li> all plates were in great condition!</li>
            <li> If you are a nail stamping fanatic then this buffet collection is a must have to add. I love this set can do so many different nail designs and also if you have big nail beds like me then you definitely need this cause will cover whole nail. I have used stamping polish and nail polish to stamp and so far the images pick up great.</li>
            <li> I really liked these plates. The way it&#x27;s set up is so different and you can&#x27;t seem to get a bad design. Where ever you stamp down on one it looks good. I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with them. Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I love my Pueen set. It was shipped super fast..</li>
            <li> These plates are awesome!! The designs are really cool and pretty. Easy to grasp with the stamper. Love the Pueen products.</li>
            <li> Nice!  Although the idea is good and looks really pretty, some of the plates with multiple designs are a little hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I was in love with the designs but they are too large to get the full design on the nail.  I would love to be able to get the design of the girl on my nails or even the words plates but nope too large... Overall I do love the deigns and wish that they would come out with these exact designs the size of regular designs on nail stamping plates. The quality of the plates are excellent. Also I used false nails to get the designs fully but they were still to large...</li>
            <li> Love the variety of the designs and the holder for the plates! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Out of all the Pueen plate collections this is my favorite some images are too large for a nail but if you have a silicone stamper you can make the image smaller to fit.</li>
            <li> Are very good but not came with instructions.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly delivered on time product was beautiful when I opened it up everything was fine thank you so much</li>
            <li> I placed my order on Wednesday night from the Amazon seller and it was shipped on Thursday with and expected delivery of Monday.  I received it on Saturday.  I ordered Buffet set and Love Elements set both are excellent quality and stamp perfectly.  I&#x27;m very happy with my order.  The etching on the plates is well done and I love the full plate image on the Buffet plates, the stamping choices are endless.  The price point can&#x27;t be beat for the number of plates and the quality of these plates.</li>
            <li> Please please please release more like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pueen is by far my most favorite stamping brand because of the quality of the designs, so I couldn&#x27;t hit the order button fast enough when I saw this awesome &amp;#34;buffet&amp;#34; collection. I have long nails and I love full coverage designs. These are definitely more &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; designs, which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the design of these plates. I prefer a full nail design so I will get lots of use from every single plate in this collection.</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are WONDERFUL! I have used some very bad plates in the past. For the price they are even better. The selection is also very great. Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> High quality - but these designs don&#x27;t work as well as some of the other plates with smaller design or nail shaped etched areas.</li>
            <li> The only shocker for me is that they&#x27;re a tiny bit harder to get the polish out of all the crevices after each use.  That&#x27;s not really a downside to me though.  The plates are very nice quality and they&#x27;re backed with paper and carefully machined or something so that they aren&#x27;t as sharp on the edges as the other brands I&#x27;ve used (Salon Designs which aren&#x27;t backed and Bundle Monster which are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that these are just one big design, it makes for lots of fun and little extra time to plan out things just so.  It&#x27;s exactly what stood out to me about PUEEN to begin with.  I hope PUEEN comes out with more designs in this size that are a big collective design on each plate.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I Love pueen plates. Images are so crisp and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love these...work great!</li>
            <li> Fun and high quality stamps. I keep discovering more ways to use them. I also love how I can all have my nails with the same motif without using an identical image the way you do with smaller images and stickers.</li>
            <li> Great stamping plates with lots of great designs.</li>
            <li> love these easy to use beautiful crisp image 1st time using pueen will by again</li>
            <li> Its very sad...I bought 2 differnt sets and to my surprise both the sets were missing 1 plate each. It was like someone deliberately removed 1 plate from each set and send it to me. But apart from that...as we all know pueen stamping plates are high quality so I have no problem with the etching or stamping.</li>
            <li> they are really nice i wish they can sell it separately  and not in a set, but overall they are pretty good</li>
            <li> Complete Set and the Images are looking very beautiful and detailed!&lt;br /&gt;Hadn&#x27;t tried them yet but there are looking really great!&lt;br /&gt;Looking foward to ir!</li>
            <li> I love that these work for any nail size and you can pick and choose what portions of images to stamp so that each nail can be the same or different as desired. I really like that there&#x27;s a bit of everything in this set - dots, swirls, flowers, hearts, words (my faves!) and more.</li>
            <li> these are great, all stamped very good, plates are made very very good, would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> fantastic plates ... nicely etched ...stamps clean ...great buy</li>
            <li> Very pretty, highly functional plates. Thank you, Pueen💅.</li>
            <li> They re ok, nothing spectacular but they work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try! Nice crisp images</li>
            <li> Love these plates, they are very well crafted.  I have large nails and the images are very crisp and clean.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was...plate #69 was missing from my set.  I left amazon a message and they resolved the issue.  Other than that great plates with great designs.  The possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li> I rarely use them there okay no complaints I just don&#x27;t care for the designs</li>
            <li> these plates are the business im in love with all the different designs on each plate and my package came on time..</li>
            <li> Great plates with beautiful designs.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> i so love these plates and pueen products have the storage cases and other sets of plates!!!</li>
            <li> I love the concept of covering the whole plate!! These have become my favorite as my nails have gotten much longer and I was getting frustrated with my other plates not having big enough full images.</li>
            <li> I just love the collage type nail stamps. I am a nail stamping fanatic and this set gives you so many options for creativity. I&#x27;ve used them and they all work great.</li>
            <li> Love these! If you have longer nails these are amazing, they will cover the whole nail. Hoping for more designs like this. Love that the images offer a variety of combinations and images can cover long nails without having to stamp a nail twice to cover the whole nail when using an XL stamper. I hope Pueen and other companies continue to do nail art stamps like this because its a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have been taying many stamping plates over time and I was very exited to try this collection. After closely viewing it and testing it I came up with my opinion that there is much more improvement to be done. I have some what long nails and I found it very hard to place a single flower. There are few images I could actually use. I would not recommended for people with short nails. Unless you want to only use a couple of plates.  Other than that they will stamp really good.</li>
            <li> I have several different sets of nail stamping plates from different manufacturers. I really love the other Pueen plates,but these exceed it every set I own by far! I would even recommend these over Konad brand. These plates are more similar to the Moyou collection in that the entire Plate is one continuous image. You will not be disappointed! Check out my nail art slide show on YouTube [...]</li>
            <li> Great variety of designs to choose from in this set!  Plates are etched well and I have not had any problems picking up images on anything I have tried yet.</li>
            <li> 70% of these are way to big to fit&lt;br /&gt;On someone&#x27;s nails, I wouldn&#x27;t order this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love these stamping plates. Really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great plates and many fantastic images!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> Pueen has always done very nice stamping plates and this set is no exception. These are done in the current trend of the all-over, scenic type etching. This collection has nice mix of elegant flourishes, flowers and swirls, bold geometric shapes and lines, and some wording as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some test stamping and for the most part all of the plates are well etched and stamps are crisp and clean. I did not give 5 stars because two of my plates have some small defects in the etching, the drop design on the right side of plate #58 has spots that shouldn&#x27;t be there and there are some more small spots on record image on plate #62. Both of these defects are negligible and are not a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these plates are well done with interesting and lovely images for creative stamping. I can certainly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my stamps today but when I opened it the smell was very overwhelming.  Though the smell on the storage case kind of settled down now, Im hoping it goes away completely in time.  The case is cute but it also stained the plastic on the inside, which I don&#x27;t really mind since the plates are not stained. I love that the shipping was really fast, the plates were already in the storage case and everything but plate 69 was in good condition.  The bird image on plate 69 has a slight flaw where it looks like there&#x27;s a little arrow on its head after stamping (???).....anyway besides that, all the images are beautiful, stamps well and comes out clear with regular nail polish.  With that being said, I think this collection is still a great buy. Im really happy with this set.</li>
            <li> Very pretty plates. I like half of them a lot, and the rest I don&#x27;t care so much but I think that for the price they are a good buy. Very good quality and if you are just starting your collection this set would be a great one to start with. Also great for people with long-wide nails. I hope they make more like these!!</li>
            <li> This set is just as fabulous as everything else Pueen has set out to serve us. Fabulosity at its best.</li>
            <li> Pueen makes my favorite stamping plates because of the fantastic quality and this set is just as good; the images are detailed and crisp, they are just a breeze to work with. This set is unique in that the patterns are all combined so that the entire plate is full of images, so there&#x27;s a big boost in variety without the limitations of being too &#x27;themed&#x27; as I think the MoYou plates are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have to drop a star because many of the patterns and images are so big you can&#x27;t get the effect if you have average to smaller nails, like I do. Almost all the images or patterns with flowers are so big that I can&#x27;t use them and still be able to tell what the image is once it&#x27;s on the nail. Conversely, Plate 52 has a bunch of fantastic geometric shapes, but there are so many on the plate, there isn&#x27;t enough room to get a lift of any of the individual patterns to cover the whole nail, what whatever you can lift is so enlarged you can&#x27;t see the pattern once it&#x27;s on the nail anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the makers of stamping plates are hearing customers complaints and are finally giving us larger images, but they&#x27;re cheating. Instead of giving more pattern they&#x27;re just making them bigger, and there is a significant difference. I&#x27;ve seen this same problem with the Cisi &amp; Sisi sets as well).</li>
            <li> These are among my favorite!</li>
            <li> I am still enjoying them, soon to order more, thank you.</li>
            <li> Love these, but the one thing I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care so much about was if it came with a case for the plates or not.  It turns out I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that the carrying case for the plates is an added bonus.  When I first saw it, I thought I would probably not use it but the plates slide in and out of their slots easily and it is so convenient!  I&#x27;ve used several of the plates and so far no issues, the images pick up nice and crisp and I&#x27;ve been totally happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Beautiful plates. Beautiful results.</li>
            <li> Really nice plates images stamp clear.</li>
            <li> I was actually disappointed because I thought it came with the stamp and scrapers.</li>
            <li> Love the designs and plates. Only thing Was that the plates themselves had big scatches, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the seamless plates, but some are still lacking. A few of the designs are not large enough to cover my nailbeds alone. But still love them more than my other plates. Please come out with more!</li>
            <li> these are absolutely beautiful!! I can&#x27;t wait to use them. They are all in the case, the case is cute, and the images use the entire plate so imagination is the only limitation</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product. Received it in 3 days!</li>
            <li> Package came NO INSTRUCTIONS OR PAPERWORK. it came really fast but the stencil backs DO NOT COME OFF</li>
            <li> I really like these plates. They have really cute designs, and full designs for your whole nail so you don&#x27;t have to piece together images to get something that looks good. They&#x27;re also really well etched so you almost always get a crisp image. I would recommend these for anyone that wants to have fun images on their nails.</li>
            <li> Super great, only draw back is some of the designs are too big but I love them all!</li>
            <li> So cute great stamping plate. Fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> Love this set but I was missing 3 plates and was refunded some of my purchase price. I don&#x27;t like doing business this way and as much as I want the love elements 24B set I think I&#x27;m going to wait awhile. The plates themselves are amazing...I was just missing those 3 and one of them was a favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does not come with the actual stamp so I had to purchase one separately however still in love with the product.</li>
            <li> Out of the entire Pueen nail art stamp collection, this is by far my most favorite. Delivery was fast. I look forward to ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Used one of the plates for the first time today... pretty good, some attempts the color was lighter and then sometimes darker, but i believe that was on my end with the amount of polish.  Not a bad set of screens for the price.  First real stamp kit i purchased and I like screens for first time use and building collection.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great product.</li>
            <li> These plates are great, all around good designs. I wish the plates were bigger and some of the design prints where a bit big for my nails. This set has some great scroll/flower designs which I like and for the price, all around decent stamp plates.</li>
            <li> This collection of nail plates is AMAZING. So many images, so many ways to use them. These nail plates are completely full of images, designs, themes, wording, etc. They come in a very nice and functional case...small and compact, and offers great protection for your plates.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> They are too many and are so pretty!!! I like them a lot!!!</li>
            <li> Came as described and love that they came with a holder.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Pueen Plates! And love the cute case to store them in!</li>
            <li> I must say that this is a really nice nail art stamp collection from PUEEN, its simply beautiful and it stamps really good.  A must buy/to have for anyone who is into nail art and like to create bautiful manicures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Pueen Stamping plates and since the first set I bought didn&#x27;t dissapointed me, I wanted (need) to have this one in my collection too. I have no regrets and I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase. Every plate is beautiful in its own and very well made. There isn&#x27;t a defective plate nor anything I could complain about.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> This stamping plates work great ...they stamp perfect they have pretty good images (plenty to pick from)  Fast shipping (that&#x27;s a A+) the only thing is I would NOT recommend this plate set if you have long nails .. (I had pretty long nails and I had to shorten them a lil to make it work for me ) ... That&#x27;s the down side about them but other than that they got a 5 star from me ...</li>
            <li> No complaints...  But I like infinity plates better</li>
