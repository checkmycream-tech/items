            <li>I received some of these as a gift and loved them, so I bought more for myself and my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li>A nice variety of scents.</li>
            <li>They were all full and in good shape.</li>
            <li>They fade quickly, but that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, Good product.</li>
            <li>A lovely idea for a gift at holiday time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nectarine Blossom and Honey--First favorite.</li>
            <li>Bluebell--Second favorite.</li>
            <li>These are more tea</li>
            <li>like many of her scents that are marketed to both men and women...smells a bit too unisex for me.&lt;br /&gt;Earl</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t like Anise at all anyway and am not a fan of lavender. :)</li>
            <li>I love this set and would probably just keep ordering sample sets</li>
            <li>I would have given it more stars</li>
            <li>These fragrances are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They were just the right size and variety of aromas to help me choose my favorite.</li>
            <li>Roses--VERY realistic, but not the kind of roses I grow.</li>
            <li>What fun!</li>
            <li>Seller did give a quick refund though.</li>
            <li>Packaged in a protective container and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Different, nice to try, sharr</li>
            <li>Sensual and the most natural, like \\&quot;hey, let&#x27;s curl up on the couch and snuggle.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Wild</li>
            <li>An unusual flower scent, very \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;English Pear and Freesia--Third favorite.</li>
            <li>i only liked 2 out of the 10.  </li>
            <li>But they listed 11 not 10 (10 is the right number).</li>
            <li>Grey and Cucumber--Tart, tangy and kind of \\&quot;shouts\\&quot; out at me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the tester sizes of the different fragrances .</li>
            <li>Crisp like \\&quot;hey, let&#x27;s go for a hike.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Blackberry and Bay--</li>
            <li>Fourth favorite.</li>
            <li>Exactly the fragrances listed.</li>
            <li>so I may have to go for a love next time.</li>
            <li>Love them for traveling and for having different scents to match my mood.</li>
            <li>As far as the packaging, I don&#x27;t think it would be too hard to get a fun box for under $5 to make it a great gift.  </li>
            <li>These samples really hit the spot.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect to like this one.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal.hing synthetic.</li>
            <li>They are the real deal.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>Very timely with no complaints</li>
            <li>It may be due to my chemistry, I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with how these smelled on me.</li>
            <li>Half of these smelled more like for men...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more from Jo Malone in regular sizes.</li>
            <li>Love all the little samples..</li>
            <li>Got this little \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; very quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived via USPS in a little ziplocked container with bubble wrap securely around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nope.&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate Noir--Fruity, tangy, earthy, loud.</li>
            <li>far as the scents themselves go, wow.</li>
            <li>like I paid for something they probably give away at Neiman Marcus,Mobutu since I don&#x27;t have a Neiman Marcus near me</li>
            <li>The three bottles of same scent are the only one that I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I received was slightly different from what was listed as far as names of fragrances.</li>
            <li>but there are a few I don&#x27;t like and a few I LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Orange Blossom--Exactly like an orange blossom, right down to the sort of bitter under tone.&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit--Not what you might expect.</li>

            <li> Be careful of the glass vials, though--if you drop them on a tile floor, they will shatter!</li>
            <li> But I smell a little like a holiday dinner.&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>

            <li> Different, nice to try, sharr</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  I bought them for my daughter and almost didn&#x27;t give them to her.  No worries, you should try them.</li>
            <li> I do not know about the fragrance since it is a gift, but I can assure you ten little vials packaged in tissue paper is not what I was expecting to present to my daughter as a Xmas gift.  Why was a carrying bag not included in this purchase?  What is a lady to do, carry these 10 vials in a Walmart plastic bag when traveling?</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not all of the samples arrived, it was a partial shipment. Two vials were missing &amp; the package wasn&#x27;t apparently tampered with, so it must have originated at the source. In addition, the scents that did arrive were different Jo Malone scents than those described.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the tester sizes of the different fragrances . Beautiful packaged. A lovely idea for a gift at holiday time.</li>
            <li> Neither packaging nor scents were as advertised. Seller did give a quick refund though.</li>
            <li> Got this little \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; very quickly. The vials are glass with little pumps built in (they do not open), just FYI. They were all full and in good shape. Arrived via USPS in a little ziplocked container with bubble wrap securely around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I received was slightly different from what was listed as far as names of fragrances. But they listed 11 not 10 (10 is the right number). Here&#x27;s what I received in my collection:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nectarine Blossom and Honey--First favorite. Sensual and the most natural, like \\&quot;hey, let&#x27;s curl up on the couch and snuggle.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Wild Bluebell--Second favorite. An unusual flower scent, very \\&quot;pretty.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;English Pear and Freesia--Third favorite. Crisp like \\&quot;hey, let&#x27;s go for a hike.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Blackberry and Bay--Fourth favorite. I really didn&#x27;t expect to like this one. I mean, bay? Cooking bay? It works somehow. But I smell a little like a holiday dinner.&lt;br /&gt;Red Roses--VERY realistic, but not the kind of roses I grow. These are more tea rosey.&lt;br /&gt;Orange Blossom--Exactly like an orange blossom, right down to the sort of bitter under tone.&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit--Not what you might expect. Surprisingly manly.&lt;br /&gt;Lime Basil and Mandarin--Great, but like many of her scents that are marketed to both men and women...smells a bit too unisex for me.&lt;br /&gt;Earl Grey and Cucumber--Tart, tangy and kind of \\&quot;shouts\\&quot; out at me. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate Noir--Fruity, tangy, earthy, loud. Has a bit of patchouli in it. Not for me. Might be good for a swingin&#x27; night club...on someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two scents listed in the product description, Amber and Lavender, and Vanilla and Anise were not in my order. I think those two must be rotated in and out, because I got Red Roses instead. And I&#x27;m good with that because I don&#x27;t like Anise at all anyway and am not a fan of lavender. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scents themselves go, wow. I&#x27;ve never smelled Jo Malone scents before, but always heard they were \\&quot;real.\\&quot; They are. They fade quickly, but that&#x27;s good. No scent headaches here, no overpowering odors, nothing synthetic. They are the real deal.hing synthetic. They are the real deal.</li>
            <li> These fragrances are fantastic. Bought these to set up a fragrance bar at my sons wedding, and all the ladies were impressed.</li>
            <li> Exactly the fragrances listed. They are NOT boxed but that was perfect for my needs. Packaged in a protective container and arrived quickly. Found my perfect fragrance in Pomegranate Noir!</li>

            <li> What fun! Every day is a surprise.  I love this set and would probably just keep ordering sample sets but there are a few I don&#x27;t like and a few I LOVE so I may have to go for a love next time.

            <li> Love all the little samples.. Helped me to decide which fragrance I liked the best ..</li>
            <li> The fragrances are beautiful. I would have given it more stars but it looked to me like some of the scents had been used because the levels on the bottles were lower.</li>
            <li> I received some of these as a gift and loved them, so I bought more for myself and my sister as a gift. Love them for traveling and for having different scents to match my mood. Be careful of the glass vials, though--if you drop them on a tile floor, they will shatter!</li>
            <li> All of these fragrances smell terrific! I love them all! I will definitely be buying more from Jo Malone in regular sizes.</li>
            <li> A nice variety of scents.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, Good product. the only thing I don&#x27;t like is there only 8 different scent in it.  The three bottles of same scent are the only one that I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> loved it, great way to try them out and find your favorite! Very timely with no complaints</li>
            <li> Great way to sample many fragrances. I discovered that these scents were not for me. It may be due to my chemistry, I just wasn&#x27;t pleased with how these smelled on me.</li>
