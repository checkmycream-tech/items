            <li>Otherwise, they&#x27;re just great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not designed for superior grip.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled.  </li>
            <li>the money you may be better off with a trimmer and nice pair of blunt scissors.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m learning how to use it more effectively and avoid said pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use this spring-operated trimmer for minutes on end, and while it will trim some of the hairs, it will miss many.</li>
            <li>Electric ones are better if the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li>All this thing does is grab hairs and yank them out, you&#x27;re better off using a pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>If you fall within this class, scissors or an electric trimmer would be better options.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seemed to just pull the nose hairs and didn&#x27;t do a very clean job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>Although not as compact, for about the same money you can get a very good battery operated trimmer like this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E4PMQAO/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A3QR44KON2MLZ3.</li>
            <li>so fits easily into a dop kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>They cut fine, they do not yank or pull.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Once the offending hair is reasonably short, this device can effectively maintaining a suitable length, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, easy to clean, and as effective as anything I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>At times, it pulls hairs and I tried to avoid this by operating it quickly, which I believe may have helped.</li>
            <li>even more so, if it is curly, this product will not be effective for all of the reasons provided in the other reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>but this Tweezerman Deluxe Nose Hair Trimmer a small scissor  is lot better than this thing.  </li>
            <li>I experienced it yanking a hair out too not very pleasant, and I found myself clipping a lot more than with regular safety nose scissors.      </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a regular pair of nose hair scissors.</li>
            <li>This is my first one.</li>

            <li>It does not cut the hairs very well.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer end is stainless steel and appears to be a precision tool, however it does not trim particularly well.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two of these and bought a third one for a friend, and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;, \\&quot;yanking\\&quot; or just not cutting.</li>
            <li>Works, but just does not work nearly as well as a decent electric.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well - the only electric I&#x27;ve ever used was a cheapo Remington model, and the problem with that</li>

            <li>My first such utility.</li>
            <li>Luckily it wasn&#x27;t super expensive because it certainly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The nose hair trimmer, for example, isn&#x27;t weighted properly, so it just floats in your hands... and the mechanism which rotates the inner blade isn&#x27;t lubricated very well --</li>
            <li>I felt it is my moral obligation to write this review so that people do not waste their money like I did.</li>
            <li>As a result, I only use it for finishing after I clean up with small scissors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this product could easily be improved to overcome many of the objections/faults noted in other reviews, for example, making the cutting slots wider at the top, increasing the number of cutting slots, angling the shearing edges, making the outer tube thinner, using a torsion spring that surround the outer tube, etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works pretty well - the only electric I&#x27;ve ever used was a cheapo Remington model, and the problem with that (as I imagine is the problem with all electrics) is that it&#x27;s hard to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, just run it under hot water and dry it off after using and it&#x27;s fine.  Also it&#x27;s very small so fits easily into a dop kit.</li>
            <li> The concept of this design is that it is suppose to catch nose hair in the grooves and then clip them... But it&#x27;s really difficult to get your nose hair in the groove if you have pretty straight hair.  I experienced it yanking a hair out too not very pleasant, and I found myself clipping a lot more than with regular safety nose scissors.      You&#x27;re better off using a regular pair of nose hair scissors.</li>
            <li> Save your money, buy something else. 1) The squared-off clipping head just does not get any hair to fall into it, hence, no hair gets cut. 2) Were that not enough to dissuade you from purchasing the Tweezerman, the action of squeezing the levers that operate the cutting motion is hard to control and make the cutting head move in and out of your nose.</li>
            <li> No good.  Pulls hairs....ouch.</li>
            <li> dont but this Tweezerman Deluxe Nose Hair Trimmer a small scissor  is lot better than this thing.  the hairs get dtruck in it and than it hurts a lot so you have to pull it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product locally, not on Amazon, but I felt I should post a review.  The product seems to be reasonably well made, and I bought it because from experience, I thought Tweezerman stood behind its products.  (I am guessing that this company has been bought out by a larger one, and that it is now operated differently.)  The trimmer end is stainless steel and appears to be a precision tool, however it does not trim particularly well.  You can use this spring-operated trimmer for minutes on end, and while it will trim some of the hairs, it will miss many. At times, it pulls hairs and I tried to avoid this by operating it quickly, which I believe may have helped. After several months, the spring simply broke.  I will not be purchasing another and do not recommend this item. Although not as compact, for about the same money you can get a very good battery operated trimmer like this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E4PMQAO/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A3QR44KON2MLZ3.</li>
            <li> The tweeszerman trimmer is over priced and does not work as well as advertised. I would look to another product for your nose trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Nothing extra ordinary, simple function for a simple tasks. I got tired of sticking scissors up my nose. Got some extra business sticking outta your ears and nose? Go for it. Solid construction, by a solid brand.</li>
            <li> I steered towards the tweezerman line of products because their product photos portray a high level of craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality, I&#x27;m afraid, doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer, for example, isn&#x27;t weighted properly, so it just floats in your hands... and the mechanism which rotates the inner blade isn&#x27;t lubricated very well -- so it moves in a hurky-jerky fashion. Which is more than a little disconcerting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that you have to position it \\&quot;just so\\&quot; to clip anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have just purchased a pair of bull-nose scissors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a manual nose hair clipper, one that shaved inside nose withOUT a battery, not plucked it. This is not it and I do not like it at all, wish I had some means of returning it. Please advise me.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It is too slow so it can&#x27;t cut.  Instead it grabs nose hairs.  Electric ones are better if the battery is charged.  If the battery is low, they are too slow and also grab hairs just like this manual one.     I use short rounded end trimming scissors now which is less painful than this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I usually do not post reviews. This is my first one. I felt it is my moral obligation to write this review so that people do not waste their money like I did.</li>
            <li> Works, but just does not work nearly as well as a decent electric. If you have some crazy phobia about electric nose hair clippers I suppose these would do...everyone else should look elsewhere...</li>
            <li> Easy to use...easy to clean. The unit arrived on time. The unit was purchased for travel. Has not been confiscated by TSA yet...!</li>
            <li> Get rid of the electric.  When my Panasonic trimmer bought the proverbial farm, it was time to get something else.  Problem is, I&#x27;m sick of using batteries.  The waste or the recharge ... it&#x27;s a hassle either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I picked this up and I&#x27;m thrilled.  You squeeze the ends.  The center cylinder rotates.  It cuts hairs.  It&#x27;s simple, easy to clean, and as effective as anything I&#x27;ve used.  It hasn&#x27;t even pulled any hairs (which my previous electric DID.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, it&#x27;s not a car engine.  It isn&#x27;t self-lubricating.  You have to oil it now and then.  I mean, it&#x27;s raw metal on raw metal otherwise.  What man would expect to not have to oil this from time to time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were the other criticisms?  Craftsmanship?  It&#x27;s fine.  Maybe the other guy got a dud?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is make sure you have clean, dry hands when you use it.  It&#x27;s not designed for superior grip.  If your hands are wet or slick with lotion or something, these are a bit tricky to use.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re just great.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m not using this thing correctly somehow but it just does not work at all.  All this thing does is grab hairs and yank them out, you&#x27;re better off using a pair of tweezers.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t super expensive because it certainly doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have a number of Tweezerman products and I ordered this one thinking it would be to the same standards as the others.  That was not the case.  The trimmer seemed to just pull the nose hairs and didn&#x27;t do a very clean job of trimming.  Forcing me to go back over with a trimmer and scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you may be better off with a trimmer and nice pair of blunt scissors.</li>
            <li> If your nose hair (I&#x27;m using &amp;#34;nose hair&amp;#34; in this review, but the same considerations apply equally to other hair) falls in long and lush tresses, and even more so, if it is curly, this product will not be effective for all of the reasons provided in the other reviews of this product. If you fall within this class, scissors or an electric trimmer would be better options. Once the offending hair is reasonably short, this device can effectively maintaining a suitable length, though. As such, you will need to go in every few weeks or so (your milage may vary depending on the growth rate of your nasal hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too reduce the chance of pulling, try cutting a smaller number of hairs per operation: insert the tip of the business end against the inner wall of the nares, cut, move the business end around the circumference of the inner wall in steps, cutting at each position, then insert further in and repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this product could easily be improved to overcome many of the objections/faults noted in other reviews, for example, making the cutting slots wider at the top, increasing the number of cutting slots, angling the shearing edges, making the outer tube thinner, using a torsion spring that surround the outer tube, etc.</li>
            <li> Never seemed to cut the hairs let alone cut them close.  For being top rated, they were a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> It does not cut the hairs very well.  Oftentimes the hairs get pulled when moving the trimmer away from the nose.</li>
            <li> Snags and pulls about as many hairs as it actually cuts. As a result, I only use it for finishing after I clean up with small scissors.</li>
            <li> My first such utility. It gets a little pinchy but I&#x27;m learning how to use it more effectively and avoid said pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Inexpensive, no electronics to worry about, nice low-gloss black finish on mine&lt;br /&gt;Con: Tickles occasionally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is talking about; possible fake bad reviews from competitors? I&#x27;ve owned two of these and bought a third one for a friend, and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;, \\&quot;yanking\\&quot; or just not cutting. They cut fine, they do not yank or pull.</li>
            <li> I purchased one from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and it lasted almost 30 seconds with no exaggeration before it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor design with the materials and quality of manufacture the same.</li>
