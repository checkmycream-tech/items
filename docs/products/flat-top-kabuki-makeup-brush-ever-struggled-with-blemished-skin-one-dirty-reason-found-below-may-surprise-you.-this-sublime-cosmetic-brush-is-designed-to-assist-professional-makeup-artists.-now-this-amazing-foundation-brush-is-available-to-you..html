            <li>Flawlessly Me!</li>
            <li>great buy &amp; great price!!!!</li>
            <li>great discovery and a great buy!!</li>
            <li>The brush works great and came timely.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush for well over a month - it is VERY nice.</li>
            <li>Gives my foundation a flawless full coverage, not making you look too cakey!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I was sooooo happy when I decided to get new brushes that i went with the Flawlessly Me brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived in two days using my Amazon Prime (love Prime!).</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the way my makeup looks!</li>
            <li>It certainly will give everyone a flawless finish to their face.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>I found this brush and really liked the look of it and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>and I am soooo loving it.</li>
            <li>handle is nice to hold too.</li>
            <li>Chunky and smooth, with a really nice rounded end that feels good to hold.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was really impressed by how dense and soft it is.</li>
            <li>so glad that I chose THIS Kabuki makeup brush</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li>and there is no shedding, but it&#x27;s not my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>This brush holds more powder because the bristles are so dense.</li>
            <li>The denseness allows for a more full-coverage application of mineral powder makeup than you&#x27;d get from a Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>I love mineral powders because you can&#x27;t tell you are wearing it</li>
            <li>decided to give this brush a workout, so I kept brushing and brushing, using more and more pressure trying to see if any bristles would fall out.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of applying my makeup, and is extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I also love that the brush is cruelty free and vegan approved.</li>
            <li>I stipple lightly into the foundation, then swirl with a Bob Ross &amp;#34;three hairs and some air&amp;#34; pressure and get a lovely air-brushed finish with light-to-medium coverage.</li>
            <li>The powder goes on so smoothly and easily; plus, it gives me a beautiful, natural matte finish.</li>
            <li>However, I can easily buy one myself.</li>
            <li>It does a good job applying my mineral foundation and even a decent job with cream foundation.</li>
            <li>The brush is very easy to handle and the bristles are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>brush arrived fast - Love Amazon Prime! -</li>
            <li>The handle is a great size and feels very solid in your hand.</li>
            <li>They also make a great gift when you combine them with the eye brushes from this same seller.</li>
            <li>I will keep it to use for bronzer application but still looking for a good flat top foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this brush after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It might be my imagination, but it seems easier to clean, as they claim.</li>
            <li>As far as I could tell, the Flawlessly Me Kabuki brush is the only one with a 1 year guarantee, so I figured I had nothing to lose and ordered</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft &amp; goes on smooth!!</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful application brush i used it to apply my mac studio fix ,and i really saw a difference right away, it really allowed me to use less product,and the design allow the product to cover my skin nicely</li>
            <li>brush does not irritate my sensitive skin, which is also nice.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but I love wearing mineral powder - mainly [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The handle is long and it fits nicely in my hand making it easy to put on my make-up.</li>
            <li>So this is my new favorite make-up brush.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it came with some kind of storage bag (besides the plastic wrap), since I don&#x27;t have a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know, cleaning makeup brushes will never be a fun job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NO WORRIES - - the brush was wrapped securely in plastic and was NEW !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could press harder or build and get full coverage if that&#x27;s what I was after.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li>It has a flat top, which makes it easier to apply powder all over my face and chest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really dense and there&#x27;s no shedding whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Also very light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To describe this brush in one word:  WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>The fibers are soft and it just glides on my skin so swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;You could go to Sephora and easily pay 5x for a similar brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works fine for any dry mediums - powder, bronzer etc.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it picked up the make-up easily and applied it smoothly.</li>
            <li>I wanted a flat top brush especially for foundation application.  </li>
            <li>As a vegan and lifelong animal lover this is extremely important to</li>
            <li>This is a substantial brush that I bet will last for a long time before it needs to be replaced, so I&#x27;m glad I added it to my collection of brushes.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased the Bare Essent.....</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, but it&#x27;s not dense.</li>
            <li>The coverage it provides is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good brush and easily worth the money, but I want another Dior next time, even though it&#x27;s 3-4 times as expensive.</li>
            <li>Did I mention soft?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt a make-up brush so soft!</li>
            <li>It still feels soft and maintained its shape!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy brushes, so I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to look for.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazingly soft, soft, soft!</li>
            <li>So far, no bristles have fallen out or escaped - LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end result is natural looking</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old Dior foundation brush and ended up trying this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft, but not fully as dense as my old Dior.</li>
            <li>My old make-up brush was falling apart</li>
            <li>It was not as soft as claimed, in fact it feels quite scratchy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>some brushes are too soft and won&#x27;t pick up any product.  </li>
            <li>face mineral powders I got a brush with them, but it wasn&#x27;t that soft.</li>
            <li>It works good but the thing for me is that it gets dirty too fast</li>
            <li>I did not feel the brush was worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>So I purchased various other brushes over the years but never found one this soft and light.</li>
            <li>They are silky soft and are much higher quality than other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This brush is not only soft, but it&#x27;s dense too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can barely feel it on your face and it blends perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saw this brush on Amazon after seeing the cutest video with a little hamster showing everyone that synthetic brushes are every bit as soft as animal hair ones, and MUCH kinder.</li>
            <li>Not a single one.</li>
            <li>Not a single bristle has fallen off.</li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve only used a regular old makeup brush.</li>
            <li>, I did not experience any shedding with this brush even with using it the first few times.</li>

            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Translucide Naturally Luminous Loose Powder]].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average brush (3 starts), soft but not the softest.  </li>
            <li> The brush is wonderfully soft, but the bristles are firm and densely packed, which is what makes that airbrushed look possible.</li>
            <li> SINGLE.</li>
            <li> Bonus: after a month, it hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles would start shedding leaving a mess everywhere and one brush I had actually made me itch when I used it.  </li>
            <li> It was a little bigger than I was thinking it would be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for soft makeup brushes...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well for anything wet.</li>
            <li> would go back to Everyday Mineral for their brushes.</li>
            <li> I like to have a few on hand for different uses...powder, bronzer, and a spare while others are drying after being washed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a cream foundation (CoverGirl Olay Ageless) and find this flat-top brush a vast improvement over the kabuki (round) I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how it works with anything other than powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep it for bronzer maybe, but not good enough for foundation application.</li>
            <li> I had been using the brush that came with my powder foundation and was shocked at how much softer this brush was!</li>
            <li> You know, the cheap ones with the black handle and black bristles that usually come off as you brush it across your face - ANNOYING!!</li>
            <li> You will NOT be sorry with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but I love wearing mineral powder - mainly [[ASIN:B000YHNLRS L&#x27;Oreal Paris Translucide Naturally Luminous Loose Powder]]. All my life I&#x27;ve only used a regular old makeup brush. You know, the cheap ones with the black handle and black bristles that usually come off as you brush it across your face - ANNOYING!! I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a Kabuki brush, but have never had the funds to do so until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I chose THIS Kabuki makeup brush; it&#x27;s absolutely amazing and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It&#x27;s really dense and there&#x27;s no shedding whatsoever. It has a flat top, which makes it easier to apply powder all over my face and chest. The powder goes on so smoothly and easily; plus, it gives me a beautiful, natural matte finish. When I&#x27;m done, you can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m wearing powder, which is the look that I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does not irritate my sensitive skin, which is also nice. I only wish that it came with some kind of storage bag (besides the plastic wrap), since I don&#x27;t have a makeup bag. However, I can easily buy one myself. I also love that the brush is cruelty free and vegan approved. There&#x27;s no animal hair or fur used, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things about this brush. You will NOT be sorry with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The brush is very easy to handle and the bristles are nice and soft.  Blends well. It was time to replace my Kabuki brush and I&#x27;m glad that I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for well over a month - it is VERY nice. So far, no bristles have fallen out or escaped - LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a big deal, but the packaging that you see in the ad, was NON-EXISTANT. It was basically thrown in a brown box. NO WORRIES - - the brush was wrapped securely in plastic and was NEW !</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful application brush i used it to apply my mac studio fix ,and i really saw a difference right away, it really allowed me to use less product,and the design allow the product to cover my skin nicely</li>
            <li> The brush works great and came timely. It was a little bigger than I was thinking it would be but it is still what I needed.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, but it&#x27;s not dense. The coverage it provides is pretty sheer. I have to use a lot of of my mineral powder foundation to get the desired amount of coverage. The end result is natural looking and there is no shedding, but it&#x27;s not my favorite brush. I will keep it for bronzer maybe, but not good enough for foundation application.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft &amp; goes on smooth!! I highly recommend this to everyone!! great buy &amp; great price!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush holds more powder because the bristles are so dense. The denseness allows for a more full-coverage application of mineral powder makeup than you&#x27;d get from a Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Dior foundation brush and ended up trying this one. It does a good job applying my mineral foundation and even a decent job with cream foundation. It&#x27;s really soft, but not fully as dense as my old Dior. It might be my imagination, but it seems easier to clean, as they claim. But I don&#x27;t know, cleaning makeup brushes will never be a fun job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good brush and easily worth the money, but I want another Dior next time, even though it&#x27;s 3-4 times as expensive.</li>
            <li> A bit softer than the one I was used to but seems to work well and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> It works good but the thing for me is that it gets dirty too fast and I DID break out when I used it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this brush after reading the reviews.  I wanted a flat top brush especially for foundation application.  It works fine for any dry mediums - powder, bronzer etc.  But immediately started shedding hairs when I used it with foundation and washed it. Like *clumps* of hairs, not one or two. Disappointing.  It&#x27;s an average brush (3 starts), soft but not the softest.  Doesn&#x27;t do well for anything wet. I will keep it to use for bronzer application but still looking for a good flat top foundation brush.</li>
            <li> My old make-up brush was falling apart so I looked around on Amazon and discovered this kabuki brush. It must be me, but every make-up brush I buy seems to fall apart. The bristles would start shedding leaving a mess everywhere and one brush I had actually made me itch when I used it.  As far as I could tell, the Flawlessly Me Kabuki brush is the only one with a 1 year guarantee, so I figured I had nothing to lose and ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in two days using my Amazon Prime (love Prime!). To describe this brush in one word:  WOW!!!  This brush is amazingly soft, soft, soft! Did I mention soft?! I&#x27;ve never felt a make-up brush so soft! The handle is long and it fits nicely in my hand making it easy to put on my make-up. I used it to apply my Mary Kay mineral foundation powder and it went on... FLAWLESSLY! Seriously, it picked up the make-up easily and applied it smoothly. I love mineral powders because you can&#x27;t tell you are wearing it and this brush applied mine perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this brush a workout, so I kept brushing and brushing, using more and more pressure trying to see if any bristles would fall out. NOPE! Not a single one. It still feels soft and maintained its shape! So this is my new favorite make-up brush. I&#x27;m throwing away all my others and will pick this one up everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What great discovery and a great buy!!</li>
            <li> I did not feel the brush was worth the money spent. It was not as soft as claimed, in fact it feels quite scratchy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would go back to Everyday Mineral for their brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for soft makeup brushes...I like to have a few on hand for different uses...powder, bronzer, and a spare while others are drying after being washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some brushes are too soft and won&#x27;t pick up any product.  This brush is not only soft, but it&#x27;s dense too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder is applied evenly with this brush.  I have not used it with any cream foundation yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works with anything other than powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I did not experience any shedding with this brush even with using it the first few times. This is a substantial brush that I bet will last for a long time before it needs to be replaced, so I&#x27;m glad I added it to my collection of brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a set of Sephora brushes for awhile now and I&#x27;ve totally had it with the bristles falling off on my face EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was sooooo happy when I decided to get new brushes that i went with the Flawlessly Me brush. They are silky soft and are much higher quality than other brushes I&#x27;ve used. Not a single bristle has fallen off. And the best part is its way cheaper than Sephora!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the texture and the way my makeup looks! I would recommend it to anyone else!! N</li>
            <li> I use a cream foundation (CoverGirl Olay Ageless) and find this flat-top brush a vast improvement over the kabuki (round) I&#x27;d been using. I stipple lightly into the foundation, then swirl with a Bob Ross &amp;#34;three hairs and some air&amp;#34; pressure and get a lovely air-brushed finish with light-to-medium coverage. I&#x27;m sure I could press harder or build and get full coverage if that&#x27;s what I was after. The brush is wonderfully soft, but the bristles are firm and densely packed, which is what makes that airbrushed look possible. Bonus: after a month, it hasn&#x27;t shed a single hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy brushes, so I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure what to look for. I found this brush and really liked the look of it and decided to give it a try. When it arrived, I was really impressed by how dense and soft it is. I had been using the brush that came with my powder foundation and was shocked at how much softer this brush was! It does an amazing job of applying my makeup, and is extremely easy to clean. The handle is a great size and feels very solid in your hand. The other thing that completely amazed me is that the bristles don&#x27;t fall out! I highly recommend this brush!!</li>
            <li> What a great tool! Gives my foundation a flawless full coverage, not making you look too cakey! The fibers are soft and it just glides on my skin so swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;You could go to Sephora and easily pay 5x for a similar brush.&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending this brush to all my friends. They also make a great gift when you combine them with the eye brushes from this same seller.</li>
            <li> Saw this brush on Amazon after seeing the cutest video with a little hamster showing everyone that synthetic brushes are every bit as soft as animal hair ones, and MUCH kinder. As a vegan and lifelong animal lover this is extremely important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush arrived fast - Love Amazon Prime! - and I am soooo loving it. This is THE softest make-up brush I have ever owned or used. When I first purchased the Bare Essent..... face mineral powders I got a brush with them, but it wasn&#x27;t that soft. So I purchased various other brushes over the years but never found one this soft and light. You can barely feel it on your face and it blends perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is nice to hold too. Chunky and smooth, with a really nice rounded end that feels good to hold. Also very light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has the perfect name too.......Flawlessly Me! It certainly will give everyone a flawless finish to their face.</li>
