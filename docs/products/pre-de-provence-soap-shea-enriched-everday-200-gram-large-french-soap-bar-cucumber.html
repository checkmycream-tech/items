            <li>Best smelling soap ever in Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Just another excellent soap from Pre de Provence.  </li>
            <li>This is probably one of the greatest soaps I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t get gooey.  </li>
            <li>In that respect, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>Great soap - it lasts quite a while</li>

            <li>Treat yourself to a great shower or bath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on a search for that great sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling \\&quot;coated\\&quot; by something.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Sandelwood and this was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent lingers on your skin for a while after using it, which is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>good smell for men too.</li>
            <li>I have been using Avalon Organics bath products, but wanted to try something sandlewood scented, since I&#x27;ve always loved the smell.  </li>
            <li>This soap does a good job of cleaning, without leaving a noticeable film on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this soap!  </li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>Nice manly smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I shower it&#x27;s so nice because the lather is so nice and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Kind to the skin.  </li>

            <li>Good soap with a strong, but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>It has a very unique scent that everyone will love!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Sandalwood soap on the market.  </li>
            <li>It is light and it smells good, not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>Insofar as the soap itself, yes, it does a very fine job of cleaning and rinsing off with no leftover film.</li>
            <li>Smells great and one bar lasts a whole month!</li>
            <li>This is really good soap and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle soap with a great scent.</li>
            <li>Its appropriate for both a man and a woman.  </li>
            <li>This soaps scent is medicinal - not at all refreshing or heady...</li>
            <li>ok -</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sandalwood soap.</li>
            <li>Whether your work in Corp America or not, having a refreshing shower with an invigorating therapeutic aroma sets the pace for the day.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>but I find myself favoring this one more.</li>
            <li>and it feels a bit more luxurious</li>
            <li>(I said it was subjective :) )</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Pre De Provence soaps.</li>
            <li>Love the sandelwood.</li>
            <li>I am sure you will love the quality and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Out of all the soaps that I purchased, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I think most men would prefer this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the sandalwood, patchouli and earth scents.  </li>
            <li>I have a love affair going with this soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t melt in the shower tray and get used up quickly so it is worth every cent!!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and will linger in your bathroom for days after a single use.  </li>
            <li>makes the whole room smell good.</li>
            <li>Lovely rich perfumed lather.</li>
            <li>Great Soap, lasts longer than the average retail and good clean scent</li>
            <li>Lathers very well and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a big bar at a great price.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Right now the Sandalwood is a top 3 pick.</li>
            <li>Its useful for getting yourself clean in the shower but is probably more money than I should spend to do so.</li>
            <li>I was expecting light and slightly sweet after reading the description.</li>
            <li>I purchased this expecting the clean woodsy smell of sandal wood ..</li>
            <li>This soap has a clean smell, but it&#x27;s not a woody sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s not too flowery or sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and my whole family loves it too.</li>
            <li>For an everyday cleaning soap - good!</li>
            <li>mild non-drying.</li>
            <li>So far, of all the Sandalwood soaps out there, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price for me.  </li>
            <li>The other creamy bars in the top 3 are Milk (very light scent) and Tangerine ( orange cream sickle scent).</li>
            <li>After purchasing sandalwood scented shaving products I was hoping to find a good soap to really get my classic old man smell on.</li>
            <li>It has lasted a long while too, it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get a good lather worked up on a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>The large size is easy to hold onto, the fragrances are soft, quality is high, and the large size lasts about six months - a really high quality soap with so many fragrance choices - my daughter loves them</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like most commercial soaps as they have overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what size 200g would be, but this is a giant bath bar size.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers up well and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I order more bars and in different scents.</li>
            <li>Both last me over a month with daily and have an equally pleasant aroma</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the other products that I received from Pre de Provence; the honey &amp; almond bar is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty subtle and I must say that I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps do.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, the soap is creaming and will not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>Purely subjective  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one great little (or big) bar of soap!  </li>
            <li>The aroma wafts through my bathroom so gently-</li>
            <li>I really do like this soap.  </li>
            <li>When I unwapped the soap the room took on the smell of Sandelwood and always soothed my senses when I got ready to shower.</li>
            <li>To my disappointment the very good sandalwood scent that could be noticed right off disappeared before the shower was over.</li>
            <li>That said, the smell is OK, the soap is easy and gentle on the skin, and clearly will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The scent was extremely feminine and, for lack of a better word, cloying.   </li>
            <li>but I seem to like the aroma on this one slightly more than the other</li>
            <li>It also lasts a long time and is a huge bar.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, I actually feel clean with this soap as compared to cheaper soaps found in local stores.</li>
            <li>It has a rich lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>There are several other soaps that I have tried - Thyme lotus sandal for instance - that do leave a quiet but refreshing sandalwood scent but unfortunately not this one.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly clean, slightly flowery scent.</li>
            <li>Fast service, low shipping rates.</li>
            <li>The scent is very heavy and strong.</li>
            <li>This was simply not representative of their usually high level quality.</li>
            <li>very dissappointed with mild smell of soap not strong enough to linger  </li>
            <li>and I can quite definitely say that this was my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>I only have to spin this in my hands a couple times to get enough soap to lather my whole body.</li>
            <li>I love this soap&amp;#62;  Sandalwood is soft subtle yet mysterious.  </li>
            <li>the sandalwood scent is barely registering on my mega-sensitive nose appendex.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice, and rather expensive bar of soap.  </li>

            <li> I like the creamier types of soaps without the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; that are in some of the varieties (too scratchy on the skin plus the soaps don&#x27;t last as long).</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Soap last longer typical bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few different scents from Pre de Provence now</li>
            <li> For anything other than that, hang it up.</li>
            <li> Big manly bar, a little hard to handle when wet.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it creamy - and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Big bar last a long time...good as a shaving base creme, too.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Sandalwood soaps Pre de Provence takes a subtle approach to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Plus the sandalwood essence is not overdone but is subtle.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit artificial.</li>
            <li> Not the scent for me :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really good soap and well worth the price. Plus the sandalwood essence is not overdone but is subtle. I have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few different scents from Pre de Provence now and I can quite definitely say that this was my least favorite.  The scent was extremely feminine and, for lack of a better word, cloying.   I&#x27;ve enjoyed the other products that I received from Pre de Provence; the honey &amp; almond bar is my favorite by far. This was simply not representative of their usually high level quality.</li>
            <li> Lovely rich perfumed lather. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent of sandalwood overall but this soap... Amazingly clean, slightly flowery scent. The aroma wafts through my bathroom so gently- makes the whole room smell good. It lathers up very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling \\&quot;coated\\&quot; by something. Also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most soaps do. Doesn&#x27;t melt in the shower tray and get used up quickly so it is worth every cent!! Switched from \\&quot;South of France\\&quot; soap in Lavender to this one. Don&#x27;t like most commercial soaps as they have overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap ever in Sandalwood. mild non-drying. good smell for men too.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle soap with a great scent. I purchased it to make some crafts for winter gifts, and working with it was a dream. The sandalwood scent lingers on your skin for a while after using it, which is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> It has a very unique scent that everyone will love! Very hard to find! Worth buying for!!! TRY IT!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit artificial. I&#x27;m going to buy local and handmade from now on.</li>
            <li> I really do like this soap.  Big manly bar, a little hard to handle when wet.  Lathers very well and has a nice scent.  I bought 3 and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the Sandalwood smell.  Its appropriate for both a man and a woman.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a nice, and rather expensive bar of soap.  Its useful for getting yourself clean in the shower but is probably more money than I should spend to do so.</li>
            <li> The scent is very heavy and strong. I was expecting light and slightly sweet after reading the description. Not the scent for me :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this expecting the clean woodsy smell of sandal wood .. This soaps scent is medicinal - not at all refreshing or heady... The soap itself s lathers ok - I wouldn&#x27;t call it creamy - and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avalon Organics bath products, but wanted to try something sandlewood scented, since I&#x27;ve always loved the smell.  This soap does a good job of cleaning, without leaving a noticeable film on the skin.  The smell is wonderful and will linger in your bathroom for days after a single use.  It has lasted a long while too, it doesn&#x27;t take too much to get a good lather worked up on a washcloth.  It&#x27;s one great little (or big) bar of soap!  The only downside is that I wish it had an ingredients list somewhere.</li>
            <li> Just another excellent soap from Pre de Provence.  The smell is light, the soap is creaming and will not dry your skin.  The scent of sandalwood is neutral, in the sense that either men or women can use it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Sandalwood soap on the market.  Unlike other Sandalwood soaps Pre de Provence takes a subtle approach to fragrance.  It is light and it smells good, not overpowering at all.  It has a rich lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  This is my favorite sandalwood soap.</li>
            <li> Received a bar of Pre de Provence Sandalwood and immediately tried it out. To my disappointment the very good sandalwood scent that could be noticed right off disappeared before the shower was over. It didn&#x27;t even leave any lingering scent on my body at all. There are several other soaps that I have tried - Thyme lotus sandal for instance - that do leave a quiet but refreshing sandalwood scent but unfortunately not this one.  Insofar as the soap itself, yes, it does a very fine job of cleaning and rinsing off with no leftover film. In that respect, it&#x27;s very good. But again, when it comes to the amount of scent that has been used in this one is truly lacking. For an everyday cleaning soap - good! For anything other than that, hang it up.</li>
            <li> So far, of all the Sandalwood soaps out there, this one is my favorite. Whether your work in Corp America or not, having a refreshing shower with an invigorating therapeutic aroma sets the pace for the day. I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Its a toss up between this and the one from Mistral (which I also got from Amazon). Both last me over a month with daily and have an equally pleasant aroma but I find myself favoring this one more. Purely subjective  but I seem to like the aroma on this one slightly more than the other and it feels a bit more luxurious (I said it was subjective :) )</li>
            <li> very dissappointed with mild smell of soap not strong enough to linger  i just wish this soap was alittle stronger</li>
            <li> Great soap - it lasts quite a while</li>
            <li> the sandalwood scent is barely registering on my mega-sensitive nose appendex. Crank up the sandal oil and you&#x27;ll get my 5 stars</li>
            <li> This was my second time ordering this soap. I love it. Big bar last a long time...good as a shaving base creme, too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Pre De Provence soaps. It is a rich, creamy soap with a great scent. It feels soothing on the skin. I like the creamier types of soaps without the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; that are in some of the varieties (too scratchy on the skin plus the soaps don&#x27;t last as long). Right now the Sandalwood is a top 3 pick. The other creamy bars in the top 3 are Milk (very light scent) and Tangerine ( orange cream sickle scent).</li>
            <li> Love the sandelwood. Smells great and feels silky.</li>
            <li> I only have to spin this in my hands a couple times to get enough soap to lather my whole body. Nice manly smell that is not overpowering. It rinses well and leaves my skin moist. My wife loves the smell. I wasn&#x27;t sure what size 200g would be, but this is a giant bath bar size.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Sandelwood and this was perfect.  The soap lathers up well and leaves my skin soft and smooth.  When I unwapped the soap the room took on the smell of Sandelwood and always soothed my senses when I got ready to shower. I totally reccomend this for anyone who likes to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this type of soap for years for both myself and others.  The large size is easy to hold onto, the fragrances are soft, quality is high, and the large size lasts about six months - a really high quality soap with so many fragrance choices - my daughter loves them but I won&#x27;t tell her where I purchase them!  Treat yourself to a great shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Great Soap, lasts longer than the average retail and good clean scent</li>
            <li> Fast service, low shipping rates. I am sure you will love the quality and&lt;br /&gt;fragrance of this soap....It also lasts a long time and is a huge bar.</li>
            <li> It is a big bar at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this soap&amp;#62;  Sandalwood is soft subtle yet mysterious.  Out of all the soaps that I purchased, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, I actually feel clean with this soap as compared to cheaper soaps found in local stores. Soap last longer typical bars of soap. The sandalwood is one of my favorite scents. Itâ€™s not too flowery or sweet smelling. I think most men would prefer this scent.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the greatest soaps I have ever found.  It smells fantastic.  I love the sandalwood, patchouli and earth scents.  This soap lathers wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t get gooey.  The smell and feel does remind me of my trips to Europe.  I love this so much I order more bars and in different scents.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  The fragrance is lovely and my whole family loves it too. When I shower it&#x27;s so nice because the lather is so nice and creamy.  If you&#x27;re contemplating buying this don&#x27;t wait, BUY IT!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on a search for that great sandalwood scent.  This soap has a clean smell, but it&#x27;s not a woody sandalwood scent.  I will use this bar, but it&#x27;s not a re-order.</li>
            <li> After purchasing sandalwood scented shaving products I was hoping to find a good soap to really get my classic old man smell on. The scent is pretty subtle and I must say that I am really happy with my purchase. Now if I could only get my roommate to stop using it!</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell of sandalwood. That said, the smell is OK, the soap is easy and gentle on the skin, and clearly will last a long time. 4 stars then, and I still need a sandalwood soap, dammit!</li>
            <li> I have a love affair going with this soap.</li>
            <li> Good soap with a strong, but not overpowering scent.  You don&#x27;t need cologne or aftershave when showering with this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Smells great and one bar lasts a whole month!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price for me.  It lasts a long time.  The scent is lovely.  Kind to the skin.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
