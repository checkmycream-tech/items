            <li>but the spin brush is still working great</li>
            <li>i would have to say if you are looking for a great sauna for the face</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a great scrub the spin brush is great</li>
            <li>I used it one or two times and was quite happy with it</li>
            <li>and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and I like to put  a towel over my head for a really great steam.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>The brush with attachments is great.</li>
            <li>but when I do it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my sinuses also.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses these when she has sinus issues, and she is happy at how well it works.</li>
            <li>This piece piece is great.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
            <li>It makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>The scrub is great, the shipping was great, and so is the timer.</li>
            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I am happy because a shower opens my pores &amp; cleanses, and the brush does this when I don&#x27;t shower.  </li>
            <li>The amount of steam is not that great</li>
            <li>Nothing great.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a great purchase.</li>
            <li>At best, you can hope for a mildly effective effort on its part.</li>
            <li>The microderm abrasion tool also works as advertised to scrub your skin without causing any pain, and the moisturizer pad did a great job of working moisturizer into my skin.</li>
            <li>Really great system.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>I noticed that the problems were greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>The timer option is great</li>
            <li>Nice system for a great price!  </li>
            <li>brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof and eventually broke.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>This item works great on my face and nostrils.</li>
            <li>and my face looks great.</li>
            <li>Works great for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The timer is a great feature because I can just relax and let the stream do the trick.</li>
            <li>This product is a great investment.</li>
            <li>Gift for daughter-in-law who says it works great on her oily face and opens her pores.  </li>
            <li>This is a great machine for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The steam from this felt great and cleared up my headache when nothing else was working.  </li>

            <li>you can get more steam from a pot of boiling water!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great for facials as well as those plagued with allergies and any sinus condition.&lt;br /&gt;Compact for easy storage&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with great results.</li>
            <li>and it worked amazing.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing attractive about sitting at the table over a huge pot used for dinner while sweat and sinus fluids drop into it...</li>
            <li>This works amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>It fit just great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing price.</li>
            <li>Results was amazing.</li>
            <li>What an amazing system.</li>
            <li>AND SHE SAID SHE IS LOVING IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li>What a nice break.</li>
            <li>My GF saw the fascial cone and liked the unit as well, and the fascial brush was immediately disappeared by her as well.</li>
            <li>,i think it would have been nice if it were longer and narrower</li>
            <li>It came in nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It does take time to warm up.</li>
            <li>I really liked this item.</li>
            <li>The thing takes awhile to warm up and</li>
            <li>It is a nice item and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>My product came with the face scrubber and it is really nice</li>
            <li>It stayed warm to the touch even though I hadn&#x27;t used it for days.  </li>
            <li>I have run the faucet to a luke warm which takes 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my skin feel so good</li>
            <li>The timer is especially useful.</li>
            <li>feels like going into your own world</li>
            <li>This thing looks nice</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice to have the timer.</li>
            <li>- DO THIS: wash it with soap &amp; warm water before you use it.    </li>
            <li>Nice for the price and does what it says....</li>
            <li>I thought the brush / sponge tool was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its good for opening up pores.</li>
            <li>and then it kind of just sits there.</li>
            <li>keep a cup of warm water and keep replenishing.</li>
            <li>This really hydrates the face, ad I especially enjoyed the bonus cleanser brush.  </li>
            <li>After a year and more use is in good condition</li>
            <li>I found out that I have sleep apnea, and I have to wear the mask at night that blows warm heated moist air in my face while I sleep.</li>
            <li>Returned, not so effective</li>
            <li>Also if you don&#x27;t unplug the unit, it stays warm.</li>
            <li>So nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Nice compact size&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for my allergies mostly, and it works good for that too, when I wake up stuffy</li>
            <li>It was confining, and you have to have the perfect height table and chair to really make it work.  </li>
            <li>Then turned it on and waited for it to warm up (3 minutes).</li>
            <li>This is something nice to have , i even let my mum use it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the microdermabrasion (spelling?) thingamabob, but the steamer works nicely.</li>
            <li>The timer option (up to 15 min) is nice.</li>
            <li>nothing happened, the water got warm, but</li>
            <li>Also loving the exfoliate tool that it comes with.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage of face.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and really opens the sinuses</li>
            <li>I Was looking for something like this, its really nice and relaxing....</li>
            <li>I think using a washcloth and washing your face twice a day is just as effective...</li>
            <li>I liked the microderm brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Using mask right after steaming is very good idea too.</li>
            <li>Facial sauna is probably the Best thing you can do to clean your pores - you can apply scrub or pore cleaner after for best results.    </li>
            <li>Great product and well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>, this is perfect, even better than the first one I got.</li>
            <li>It proved to be very easy to use and to transport and it produced a nice flow of steam without burning my face.  </li>
            <li>and I am truly pleased with this system it is easy to use and the results are great</li>
            <li>This tool is awesome for clearing pores &amp; a gentle more effective way to handling your pimples.</li>
            <li>This is especially really great before exfoliating because it makes all your skin cells super saturated..</li>
            <li>Works good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use...</li>
            <li>Just received it today, and it was very easy to set up.  </li>
            <li>Of course it is more relaxing and better!</li>
            <li>It is the BEST thing that I ever bought as far as my sinuses are concerned.</li>
            <li>Since Conair the much more effective, bought another.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and this is the best my skin has ever looked.  </li>
            <li>and I will tell you more effective ways to break a sweat on ur face</li>
            <li>Conair is like a nice sports car at top speed and Olay is like a sedan.</li>
            <li>The steam is continuous and concentrated with this unit, therefore, you can expect much more effective results.  </li>
            <li>and I am so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Awesome steamer for home facials, to clear up stuffed noses, etc.</li>
            <li>Honestly, getting a pot of boiling water and putting your face over/steam is more productive that this produce.</li>
            <li>Honestly, using a pot of boiled water works better.</li>
            <li>More heads on the brush would have also been nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind that no matter how many times I wash, what I use or how I use it...</li>
            <li>When I was able to use it I liked it.</li>
            <li>the warm moist air sure does help the nose and throat.</li>
            <li>Excellent way to end a busy day.</li>
            <li>I like this product it does a good job...when used correctly the pores are opened and blackheads are so much more easy to remove....</li>
            <li>Do it, I am so happy right now with each breath I take.</li>
            <li>Great for steaming my face and was priced right.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The built in timer is easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Since using this product my skin is smooth and really does not need make up anymore which is the best part.  </li>
            <li>the included automatic brush works real nice &amp; you probably don&#x27;t need $200 clarisonic if you use this for cleaning - 2nd brush work real nice for applying moisturizer    Sauna itself - double whammy - good for your face skin + good for your breathing.</li>
            <li>Love this it is a perfect face steamer to clear pores</li>
            <li>Overall great price and great product</li>
            <li>I did not find it too hot, so that is great.  </li>
            <li>was great, in that I had been interested in seeing trying one.</li>
            <li>It has great steam output and if you put a towel over your head, it really makes you sweat!</li>
            <li>Its okay nothing real special.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong burnt smell, I think some kind of fuse may be burnt, which makes me doubt the safety of using this item that heats water.</li>
            <li>Just a nice easy at home one.  </li>
            <li>Water comes quick to boiling state and generate good amount of steam.  </li>
            <li>nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>anyway I think it&#x27;s OK because it steamed face quick good.</li>
            <li>Both my kids are using this very comfortably as the steam is appropriate for them.  </li>
            <li>Just wish there was a head rest or way to relax more without the neck strain.</li>
            <li>and I must say, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s therapeutic and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the scrub brush for microdermabrasion too.  </li>
            <li>but I put a towel over my head when using it - seems to make the steam more potent.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>it is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>skin look so much better......</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>in all its an ok product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>If this worked well, created more steam, I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li>The first try was absolutly amazing!</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll be using this anymore.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seems safer and more controlled.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than steaming your face over the stove.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>And during allergy season, you&#x27;ll breathe better.</li>
            <li>my opinion, the face tool/attachments don&#x27;t do any more than a loofah or washcloth + exfoliating cream.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-Sitting bent over the cone for any more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The MDF2R attachments in the photograph appear to be mounted in a flush fashion and probably spin with more stability.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>Wish it held more water, but it holds more than most.</li>
            <li>more note</li>
            <li>Sincerely  Wanda Rinehart.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li>Love love love this sauna..</li>
            <li>I;ve use it for more then 1 year.</li>
            <li>The result is satisfying</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d use it more than I did.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a safely measure.</li>
            <li>Perfect for at home facial steaming...</li>
            <li>Love the scrubber.</li>
            <li>I browsed many and then finalized this one based on price, look etc.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>I love this steamer.</li>
            <li>I wanted to rate this product after I used it one time, but I decided to wait one week again in able to use it again.  </li>
            <li>But still, I didn&#x27;t feel the steam more.  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it is still more convenient and faster than boiling water in a pot.</li>
            <li>but I would think it has to boil to be able to get the steam.</li>
            <li>but then again, I can&#x27;t even be sure since I don&#x27;t have that condition.  </li>
            <li>Over all I LOVE this product and would recommend anyone getting one to pamper your self a bit at home.</li>
            <li>I had to unplug it just to make sure it was off.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care because I love everything else.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The Steamer is okay to use...</li>
            <li>I love steaming my face</li>
            <li>I think it is OK, but I don&#x27;t know why the timer doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>steam is awesome and the facial is a bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent facial sauna system...</li>
            <li>and when I come back the steam was boiling perfectly.</li>
            <li>Happy with the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>She did complain that there isn&#x27;t more steam out of it.</li>
            <li>and when i used this product i was able to squeeze them out with out pushing bacteria to inside.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that my skin is actually smoother now because it adds water to the face, Very happy with the product</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better unit for the price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and lungs for better breathing  </li>
            <li>but I hope it produced more steam.</li>
            <li>It releases the sinus pressure and after a couple of days I feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I use it weekly or when I have time.  </li>
            <li>I would like for the product to put out more steam.</li>
            <li>This facial steamer is an excellent product!  </li>
            <li>That timer is such a great feature!  </li>
            <li>I suggest that you place a towel over your head while steaming to get better face steaming results.  </li>
            <li>I really love that this thing is a one-stop shop.</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for this machine</li>
            <li>and I found that recommendation to yield better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li>i use it with a towel over my head to get more of the steam without resting my face on it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, price is great, and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>I found the bowl method works much better and faster.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away to a friend because the DIY method is so much better.</li>
            <li>and they love it</li>
            <li>Makes enought steam and has a better effect if you use a towel around your head so it can keep the steam on your face.</li>
            <li>Just using it 10 minutes made me feel better as it loosened all my sinus pressure.</li>
            <li>I love steaming my face and then cleansing with a clay mask or using the oil cleansing method.  </li>
            <li>and I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I thought this would put out more steam than it does.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way my skin looks after using it.</li>
            <li>okay .... takes  time for  the steam to come ............</li>
            <li>):)  </li>
            <li>I love it &amp; so does my face.</li>
            <li>You get the most benefit when you breath out when using the unit.</li>
            <li>The steamer part is ok.</li>
            <li>It also comes with this wonderful battery operated facial exfoliating brush and sponge attachment that I use with my exfoliating scrub and finish with the sponge for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn&#x27;t neccessarily perform the greatest.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>More like 2 1/2 stars</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m better off sticking to a boiling pot of water and a towel…</li>
            <li>But overall it was great!</li>
            <li>i use the towel over my head for better coverage.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me steam my face in a faster more convenient way as opposed to waiting for water to boil on the stove.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Great item .. fast delivery ..</li>
            <li>I get much better results</li>
            <li>Okay I read a ton of reviews on this thing before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I was most concerned that people have said it would burn your face, but I went ahead and got it anyway just in case they didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works well, or anything else about the product because it is a gift, but I am sure it does</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased I purchased one for my sister for her upcoming birthday.  </li>
            <li>it would get even hotter.&lt;br /&gt;it is an okay product.</li>
            <li>Healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is when your finished sauna, please do a face mask, it will help your skin better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used to have one like this many years ago when I was in college.</li>
            <li>(That truly is MANY years ago.)  </li>
            <li>When I found this on Amazon, I ordered it immediately, and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>While they enjoyed it, it ended up being one of those items that gets infrequent use.  </li>
            <li>The edges of the bowl could have been better designed for comfort&lt;br</li>
            <li>More established tools like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>More established tools like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t steam for more than 11 minutes and it works</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and she sleeps better at night.</li>

            <li>Love this&lt;</li>
            <li>I love love love this sauna.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>Its not a horrible product</li>
            <li>You do have to use it one or two times a week to keep the good results it gives, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>i really love this...</li>
            <li>For once in my life, my face has lasted more than five minutes without being greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to overfill, water may splash and it&#x27;s boiling water</li>
            <li>Otherwise pleased</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I feel like I would get more steam from just standing by a hto sink</li>
            <li>Better than spending $35 on the Vicks steam inhaler.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again if it were to break. :)</li>
            <li>I dropped it in the shower too many times and from the water getting in the battery compartment it just stopped working.</li>
            <li>but I did like the conair one better.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Another greater alternative I use is adding tea with the water.</li>
            <li>I wish it was stronger and generated more steam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better and stronger steamers</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li>It also primes your face to get better results from your anti-aging and moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep an eye on the water level.  </li>
            <li>(eye area might be ok).  </li>
            <li>And, as I said, afterward my skin looked better than it ever has, and my pores looked cleaner than they have in years.</li>
            <li>The dual cones are most functional.  </li>
            <li>and my husband is getting better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love how whether you use the timer or not the unit will shut off (30 minutes without the timer and up to 15 minutes withtimer) to eliminate the chance of overheating.</li>
            <li>I made sure to use energizer batteries to test it, just to ensure maximum power.</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t why I bought it, but that seems to be the attachment getting the most use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better of heating a pot of water and using that as my steamer.</li>
            <li>better just to put a pot of water on the stove or an electric tea kettle.  </li>
            <li>I love this machine.</li>
            <li>I really love my machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is ok.</li>
            <li>Even on its highest setting it tends to lag for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i use it most of the times.</li>
            <li>You could get way more steam over a sink with a towel  or bowling water in a bowl with a towel.  </li>
            <li>Glad it has aut-shutoff feature.</li>
            <li>Use a towel over your head to help get more moisture.</li>
            <li>This allowed the steam to build up and it did a much better job.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I love this, my mom purchased it for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I was glad that it came with some accessories that I ended up having a use for.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this steamer over a sauna anyday because the steam is more concentrated.</li>
            <li>but I love the feeling of the steam on my skin when I am using it.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>steamer is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>in all its a top contender when price is also included.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for months now and love it.</li>
            <li>It does warm up pretty quick, and puts out a great amount of steam..</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it does work, just doesn&#x27;t put out as much steam and the steam isn&#x27;t very warm.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Well if youre looking for a simple and easy way to steam your face, this product is great!</li>
            <li>Great product very stable and easy to work.</li>
            <li>This facial sauna is great but the microdermabrasion brush that comes with it is even better!</li>
            <li>Also, fits whole face nicely!</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the purchase, delivery was quick, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It was so refreshing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it super often, but if I want to pamper myself and relax this is a nice way to do it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean..</li>
            <li>There is no doubt in my mind that its worth the price plus more!</li>
            <li>Works great, steam heats up pretty quick</li>
            <li>This one is way better than my old one, I am glad it broke!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with it :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure works fine.  </li>
            <li>I love this for quick steaming my face but love it even more when my sinuses start to act up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to put a large towel over your head to trap all the steam which enhances the experience.</li>
            <li>if you know your skin type and use the correct skin  cream to massage and then use this facial sauna to steam and clean, it renders magnificent results.  </li>
            <li>My face feels fresh, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Every woman should own this facial steamer, as it is truly a luxury in your own home!</li>
            <li>Amazon is great about returns so there was no trouble but feel off the product now and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>The MDF2R microdermabrasion unit  appears to be longer, which would be a better fit for my hand and presumably easier to control.</li>
            <li>I love the design and how you can place your head on it comfortable and</li>
            <li>Its great for facials or if you are stuffed up and need to clear your sinuses.  </li>
            <li>It has worked great so far</li>
            <li>After the unit is fully warmed up and ready to go, I place it in the bottom of whichever attachment you choose(Not in the water), and it feels great and leaves you feeling cool and refreshed after</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m returning this, no doubt quality of product material is good, but its not doing its job, steam produced is very weak.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>its not as powerful and effective i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It is really good for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved her xmas pressy thanks</li>
            <li>it feels so good and really clears up my face.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little sauna, it has done a great job cleaning pores and is also very healthy for sinuses.  </li>
            <li>The spin brush comes in very handy and the bristles on the brush is soft.</li>
            <li>I found one cup is enough for a good five minutes of steaming!</li>
            <li>Have used other saunas, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>When I received my steamer, yesterday, I was excited to be able to test it out.</li>
            <li>Item is compact and stores easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and makes my skin SO and glowing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>This is what I was expecting, easy to use and does what it needs to..</li>
            <li>The item is really easy to use out of the box.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I got it to clean more pores</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to put together and use, i recommended this product to all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and easy to put together</li>
            <li>Easy to use , multipurpose</li>
            <li>Makes at home facials easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>With this product I am able to get a deeper clean for my skin and improve my complexion.</li>
            <li>The steamer is light-weight and compact (easy to store).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a facial sauna but even greater for allergy and sinus congestion.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say the good old fashioned method is definitely better.  </li>
            <li>It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean.</li>
            <li>People complain about not enough room to hold the water but for 15 minutes at a time it is perfect and the right amount.</li>
            <li>It doesnt give you the full coverage like the salon, but it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The former was still in great condition, however, this one was a bit more advanced in features and accessories so for the price I replaced it.  </li>
            <li>Cool mist worked ok.</li>
            <li>I have to use this more often to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>I used it last night and now my skin&#x27;s glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing.</li>
            <li>sure why this one has a full view into the &amp;#34;steam boiler&amp;#34;receptacle</li>
            <li>and my face felt nice and clean, fresh.</li>
            <li>Easy routine to add to your skin care that offers incredible results and feels so relaxing to have the hot steam.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend skipping this product in lieu of the do-it-yourself method just because the DIY method is so much more effective.</li>
            <li>In fact, I had a professional facial at a good day spa not a year ago, and I don&#x27;t remember having had results this good!  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for cleansing purposed because my skin isn&#x27;t that great right now</li>
            <li>Had previously owned the Kaz steamer and that worked great!</li>
            <li>Not only is my skin flawless with consistent use, it also does wonders for my voice, as I am a singer.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>I could breath just fine.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the subject Sauna.  </li>
            <li>so it works fine for what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe 5 minutes, but then acts fine.</li>
            <li>scrubber and sponge are fine.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li>I must say I was very surprised by this steamer, in a good way, when I got it.</li>
            <li>Not the top quality but far better than I was expecting!</li>
            <li>This little sauna works perfectly and makes a lot of steam.  </li>
            <li>i have cycstic acne, huge bumps under the skin not caused by a cleanliness issue but by hormones.</li>
            <li>Overall, I cant complain and I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>but it is also great, especially if you drape a towel to tent your face in.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but I wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This is a great steamer for your home facial.</li>
            <li>This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great cost-effective facial sauna.</li>
            <li>The product works as described, but steaming your face over a bowl of water is MUCH easier, faster, and effective for opening your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean after use.</li>
            <li>so i can do it at home, for free.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>dont buy, it burns u up and is a cheap product as it broke in after using a couple of times</li>
            <li>The Conair Facial Sauna System is a great product.</li>
            <li>Looks kinda cheaply made and it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and relaxed feelings.</li>
            <li>for cheap price, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li>I think I was hoping against hope that this would work and I could enjoy facials at home.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>But basically it&#x60;s cheap</li>
            <li>This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers.</li>
            <li>this cheap and works like its cost lots of money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal and has lasted several years now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even feel totally comfortable with using it.</li>
            <li>Looks like it was made in the 1980&#x27;s, and made cheaply as well.</li>
            <li>It is great for facial cleaning and for sinus and allergy problems.  </li>
            <li>Package was secure, had everything it was supposed to come with.</li>
            <li>Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use facial scrubbers , but as steamer on face or sinus great.</li>
            <li>My  face doesn&#x27;t rest comfortably in it.  </li>
            <li>Great tool overall!</li>
            <li>it is cheaply made and it looks like it was made in the .1980&#x27;s</li>
            <li>it looks nice, and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I think this is important to decrease any chance of injury.</li>
            <li>So overall, I think the spin brush will be used a lot and looking forward to some great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>So you have to use it lightly.</li>
            <li>, MY ORDER WENT SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>Personally I think that this sauna works great .</li>
            <li>great facial and helped me through the allergies I suffer with here in the Ohio Valley!!</li>
            <li>Works great for an at home facial!</li>
            <li>Got a free gift as well.</li>
            <li>It also has a great facial attachment.</li>
            <li>This is great for steaming your face when you are congested or for a facial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 19 year old college student who has NEVER had good skin.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This works like the good old steamers.  </li>
            <li>First things first, I fell for the good reviews and Conair&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li>(btw, that was a good tip from manual, as you protect your sensitive skin around eyes).</li>
            <li>I used a towel over my head and it felt as good as a professional machine.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to much relief in the future and am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and it has held up for me so far.  </li>
            <li>My face has never been this clear it feels really good.</li>
            <li>But steamer works good s.o far</li>
            <li>I was nervous to order it at first because of the mix reviews, but it turned out to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>I think if you want a gentle steaming this is ok, but I think just boiling a pot of water is better.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much!!!</li>
            <li>positive is that it is easy to use for travel and probably good to travel with if you are going to a very arid region or desert.&lt;br /&gt;Limited</li>
            <li>It definitely opened my pores and it&#x27;s very warm and relaxing.     </li>
            <li>if you have sinus problem also, this is very useful.</li>
            <li>I would work best if you had a high counter and a low chair in order to relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li>and it has been very useful for me.</li>
            <li>I said, the Conair also works great as a facial spa/sauna, though my family uses it primarily to clean sinuses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing warm and gives a very all over clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Steam was very good and strong, but I would probably be more happier if the facial cone was a bit longer, so my face is not so very close to the steam coming right out of the machine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give as much steam as I would have hoped for, a pot of hot water and a towel as a tent definetly more effective</li>
            <li>PERFECTLY AND FAST   NICE AND SMALL  </li>
            <li>But, honestly, that is what I was doing with my hot water in the sink, prior to purchase, and it did just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth afterwards, so clean.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shine and clean.  </li>
            <li>Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>awesome little face steamer with auto turn off timer!</li>
            <li>this product really helps, very easy to set and use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use although it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is far more useful for me because of the timer and the signal to tell me when it&#x27;s ready...couldnt be better!</li>
            <li>I thing this brush is more gentle but yet more effective than just using my old brush.</li>
            <li>very fast delivery, like it. :)</li>
            <li>After wearing makeup 10 hours a day in this horrid southern humidity, this sauna system has become my new best friend to prevent pores from clogging.</li>
            <li>My new moisturizing mist facial sauna system is awesome.</li>
            <li>Better off with a bowl of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li>I originally received this as a gift.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to assemble and to use.  </li>
            <li>Save you money and buy something worth it!</li>
            <li>dies a better job if I could find a way to get the steam to come out and steam my face consistently.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this the intensity of the steam was a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this facial sauna.  </li>
            <li>The product was originally scheduled to be delivered on December 21, 2006.  </li>
            <li>I wish it steamed a bit stronger and was more consistent day to day.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing too...leaves my face feeling fresh, love it :-)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It also help to open up my sinuses, it&#x27;s nice to have this on hand!</li>
            <li>If you take the blue part OFF the unit (once it cools off and you remove the water), it will better fit in the original box for storage!!</li>
            <li>and then I use the scrubber to clean and exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>and I feel like no matter how much I clean</li>
            <li>I get the machine going as I start to clean up after dinner.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I keep it on a kitchen counter and steam sinuses whenever I catch free time.</li>
            <li>Suffered acne and this works to clean skin</li>
            <li>and it just felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer afterwards, and it calms my acne when I steam clean my face.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so clean</li>
            <li>allergy victim lol.</li>
            <li>This has a special face piece just for that reason......</li>
            <li>Give your face a special cleansing.</li>
            <li>Someone on the review said that there is a special attachment for nasal issues, and remarked that it helped their sinus</li>
            <li>, it has a special sinus took you can use, it works wonder.</li>
            <li>I use it when I want to give my face special treatment.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>but I love how soft and clean it makes me skin!</li>
            <li>good if you want it for medical purpose.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe this will eventually help me clear up this problem area permanently.</li>
            <li>In short, good buy.</li>
            <li>but once you actually put your face on the cone you get a good amount of steam.</li>
            <li>I love this product SO MUCH that I have like 3 back-ups in case</li>
            <li>This machine is totally cheaply made, not even worth to use.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Compared to its more costly competition it really stacked up.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know how this thing got such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My face feel super clean and hydrated every time.</li>
            <li>I even had to take my face out a bit to cool off.</li>
            <li>This puts out good steam and has the face basket for maximum facial effect.  </li>
            <li>Good for present.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good sauna.</li>
            <li>I think using a towel over your head will be very helpful if you want to steam your face for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>This unit does not leak water when I fill it to the maximum level, and I love the sinus steamer accessory, since I have migraines it really helps.</li>
            <li>its very relaxing :)</li>
            <li>Facial brush and sponge are good in quality.</li>
            <li>Overall it good and can recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I put a towel over my head for even more intense steam.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t say that too often, but it is well worth the money which is really cheap for the work it puts out.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating brush will be as good as the facial cream/</li>
            <li>I still have to make a tent over the unit to get the full steam effect that I want.</li>
            <li>The only way I could get a good steam was to put a towel over my head while using it.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap so worth a try for some</li>
            <li>I even had surgery for my sinus to no avail (hurt more than labor), even that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because I loved the actual unit.  </li>
            <li>You still get a good facial doing so.</li>
            <li>I tested it by pressing it up against my face gently and with greater force while it was on.</li>
            <li>It has been safe for me and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good steamer for the price.</li>
            <li>But again, this product is not a bad buy...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, very straight forward.</li>
            <li>It produces steam almost instantly, is 100% effective, and it easy to store when not in use.</li>
            <li>After one use I was astonished at how smooth and glowing my face was, and kept touching my cheeks all day to feel how soft they were!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it is also good for a facial sauna, but truthfully, I have only used it for sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li>I am happy I purchased this one instead of the other brand.</li>
            <li>I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features.</li>
            <li>Put towel over you head and a big bowl of hot water is lot more effective than this.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little sauna, I use it twice a week and it cleans my skin so nicely</li>
            <li>Your skin get so clean and firm after you steam clean it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I looked at all the different facial saunas/steamers, and the Conair was the best value (at $22/free shipping), with the two attachments, and some extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with the facial cleaner brush, but the system itself is okay.</li>
            <li>and this facial sauna with the smaller alternative cone fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Steam is adequate.  </li>
            <li>, that is super acne-prone.</li>
            <li>QUICK SUMMARY:</li>
            <li>It delivered really quickly, and everything was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a product that will most likely be used more by women than men, and the face cup seems to be designed with that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great value, creates a gentle steam facial quickly, as well as having a separate attachment for inhalation therapy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a facial steamer and it heats up fast and gives out a great amount of steam.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.. highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s a good idea to make a facial massage with this steamer, but there&#x27;s no enough steam produce, and you should be very close to it to feel some warm and steam!</li>
            <li>The product arrived in new condition and on time, it&#x27;s light weight and very portable, easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quick shipment and the facial sauna itself.  </li>
            <li>After the first week I had this huge sore on my nose.</li>
            <li>maybe other people got more use of it, but for me I didnt see any spectacular results....</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, but it works.</li>
            <li>It works great, Iv&#x27;e let boil down to no water at all and haven&#x27;t been splashed or scalded in any way.  </li>
            <li>The warm up takes a few minutes (make sure you have the water in before turning it on because doing the opposite may not produce a good steam before the beep).  </li>
            <li>I received a new item, and it love it.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, very comfortable while using, and I get a facial with each treatment...</li>
            <li>What a real treat to have this facial sauna in my own home!  </li>
            <li>I wanted something more portable and durable than using a pot.&lt;br /&gt;Works alright, steam rises to a good temperature.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 3 stars is because it&#x27;s small,</li>
            <li>The dual cones are very helpful, it has adjustable settings, and is just easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>The timer works pretty good also and it can be turned on only after the water has reached its temperature.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m enjoying this product!</li>
            <li>highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It is EXACTLY like products out there that cost over $300!</li>
            <li>I chose this item because I&#x27;m not really the spa-going type, and I wanted to steam my face more effectively than standing over a sink with hot water and a towel over my head.</li>
            <li>Just to add more effect to your steam facial treatment :) I set the timer on 10 minutes first time and it did work.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>The extension that comes with the one I got is great for sinus issues (mine came with that little cylinder extension and a rotating scrub brush).</li>
            <li>I fell for the few good reviews given for this product, which claimed it was so good that it made the skin smooth in just a single use, and Blah Blah Blah..</li>
            <li>This does a great job exfoliating dead skin and opening your pores.</li>
            <li>The facial steamer delivers amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Been going on a few months and the heating element still works great.  </li>
            <li>Now, I really don&#x27;t think I have a huge face...</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t really enjoy having to put my head in the plastic area to really get the benefit of any steam.  </li>
            <li>It will be useful for what i am going to use it for.</li>
            <li>For starters,the steam does not come out powerfully</li>
            <li>It is nice to put essential oils in the water for added relaxation.</li>
            <li>Does not produce enough steam to even be effective.</li>
            <li>I take me a nice relaxing facial so soothing</li>
            <li>Conair personal care products are of good quality and reasonably priced..</li>
            <li>My facial sauna came on vacation with me and my hostess loved it so much that I bought her one as a thank you gift.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a nice extra.     </li>
            <li>After started using, we realized that it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>The timer is useful</li>
            <li>I find that it has the same effect then even if you are not all the way on the facialtube, good to know for people with bigger faces, in addition to that I find it even more relaxing to steam away in the darkness under the towel-</li>
            <li>That is until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s. :-)    </li>
            <li>you don&#x60;t want to take it completely off :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for nearly a year now, no problems ~ and people asks me how I get my skin to look so healthy..</li>
            <li>and it is working, it is working as good as the spa one was working minus $70 every time i use it.</li>
            <li>It is a great to steam bath your face before a facial at home or just to clear your sinuses....</li>
            <li>I bought this so that I could do at home steam spa treatments which would be moisturizing and help my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li>but it is nice to use at home to open up your pores.</li>
            <li>I put on some nice relaxing music and let the facial sauna do its thing.</li>
            <li>I used it with my facial scrub and it gives a nice fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  thing to have for the facial routine.</li>
            <li>B00005A9WP Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna With Timer]] is a nice product for steaming your face.  </li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li>This is a nice facial steamer.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it, Face feels nice and soft and getting all them impurities out of your pores is a plus,  </li>
            <li>The unit is worth the money tho.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if you were getting it to help clear sinuses or something it would be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the nasal steamer but really liked what the facial sauna was doing to my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have distiller water at the moment but for the purpose of this test run I used warm faucet water, but will use distiller water for all future use!</li>
            <li>price and comes with a useful brush as well.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>and i love brush soft and exfoliating</li>
            <li>need to have for every woman, after you use it, your skin fresh like a baby skin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Steamer is useful for face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes only 30ml water at a time, however it runs for a good 10 minutes or so with just that much water.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>The low speed is too low to get any good use out of it and the high is better, but you have to use it really lightly.</li>
            <li>I love how convenient &amp; user friendly this facial sauna is.</li>
            <li>It runs out of water pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t get a lot of steam.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and allows you to steam your face pretty well.</li>
            <li>The brush itself comes with two attachments (the sponge, which you use after the face sauna, and the brush which you can use daily or however many times a week to keep your pores clean).</li>
            <li>The one smaller in diameter is great for helping clear sinuses, the larger one for giving facial pores a good \\&quot;sweat bath.\\&quot;  A fine addition to my health and beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful...just the right size.....</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I have to say that I would have given this product 5 starts, however the timer didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>I returned it right away.</li>
            <li>When doing this, the item does achieve what I want, although they should make the front part of the large cone a little taller and the edge more comfortable so you can TRULY rest your face on the rim, without searing your nose :)</li>
            <li>Provides warm moist heat and works exactly as advertised to open pores and invigorate skin.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this system and it really works!!</li>
            <li>After about two and a half months of usage, three times a week, I can say this is an excellent facial sauna.</li>
            <li>The Facial Sauna is compact, light weight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Sure you could use a towel, but wetting towels over and over again and washing them versus leaning over this machine that continuously creates steam and is easy to empty and fill....</li>
            <li>A facial sauna, nasal sauna and a spin brush all in one package for less than $25 is great!!!</li>
            <li>Although little more steam would have been better.</li>
            <li>( I think I look a little younger too, LOL !)</li>
            <li>i used to use one of these long time ago this product has bring back those days lol great , small, flexible, and get a pretty quick result</li>
            <li>I needed something to open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;The massaging sponge &amp; brush is great too especially with cleasing lotion/cream etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy enough with this unit and its results that I will continue using it several times a week.</li>
            <li>I have found the Conair Facial Sauna to be a great item that I have now used numerous times.</li>
            <li>The sauna works perfectly and only takes a few minutes for the water to start boiling.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for strong steaming action, this is NOT the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is great for sauna but not as a facial tool.</li>
            <li>Good construction, simple use and clean up plus includes a battery powered facial brush.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had more of a chin rest instead of the hard hot plastic</li>
            <li>and is pretty good, However, if you use this for first time, you have to be very patient because it looks the acne nerver end out of your face, this happen only the first time after that it is much easier the frequenly of using this machine depends of your sking in my case</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t put out much steam, and wasn&#x27;t very hot.</li>
            <li>This is a good steamer but The water will evaporate fast, water with drip out the steamer so if your careful hot water will get on you.</li>
            <li>2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet.</li>
            <li>Okay, right off the bat, this thing is tiny.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t produce very much steam.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend this for any household.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, thanks!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I ordered this product but soon found that it didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
            <li>It does seem to clear my pores somewhat and my face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad at all actually and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t steaming at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting married this fall</li>
            <li>and this product is an excellent alternative to expensive salon facials.</li>
            <li>It is an OK, but not really necessary.....</li>
            <li>I wonder why they put a non-working part on the device to fool around in the first place.</li>
            <li>I used mine as a sinus vaporizer and with the small cone supplier it really did a great job.</li>
            <li>Gets a bit too hot.</li>
            <li>Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.</li>
            <li>All in all, it did the job of cleansing her facial pores in a grand manner.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re willing to risk it I&#x27;d say this seems to be an affective device.  </li>
            <li>The facial brush is okay.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied-</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted, at an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, no complains here!</li>
            <li>Remove my blackheads qick ;)</li>
            <li>My face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t producing enough steam, that I was wondering if I should stick my face deeper into the mask to get more steam or to even just feel it.      </li>
            <li>The nasal cone is what I use most, but if I ever want to use the face cone I put a towel over my head as it helps with an actual &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; experience on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sinuses opened and my face looked better at the same time.</li>
            <li>The sauna system works more like a humidifier rather than a facial sauna.</li>
            <li>and they just wouldn&#x27;t come out, Having had facials before i knew that they use hot steam before extraction.</li>
            <li>We rushed her to the emergency room where she had first degree burns.  </li>
            <li>It was a replacement for a Conair I purchased 20 years ago from Marshall Fields in Chicago;)).  </li>
            <li>... buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it;)).</li>
            <li>I use my electric teapot to pour some hot water into it, hit the power button, and it starts steaming a minute or so thereafter.  </li>
            <li>its not too hot.</li>
            <li>I really love the price + the facial brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>but I use this way more now (especially since I have since replaced it with a clarisonic!)</li>
            <li>love this product,I am a licensed esthetician and I love using this on myself it open not only my pores but</li>
            <li>Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Save your money and to a real sauna!</li>
            <li>fast shipping used once so far loved it had one when I was a teen  </li>
            <li>Love this facial sauna!</li>
            <li>Regardless of what others say, when used correctly this unit produces hot steam and plenty of it.</li>
            <li>I think I like the pan of hot water and a towel over the head better than this, actually.</li>
            <li>Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li>The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap.</li>
            <li>This thing gets way too hot</li>
            <li>and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was just replacing my first Conair that I had for over 10 years and that exfoliating brush is a bargain.</li>
            <li>I use this for first time,.</li>
            <li>and there is more then enough room (safety space) between your face and the hot water.   </li>
            <li>Ok I suppose for the short run.</li>
            <li>The steam coming from that is not that efficient and when I use face brush I felt very pain but worth for  the price</li>
            <li>This inexpensive steamer worked pretty well for about six months.</li>
            <li>The day after I used this I went to work the next day and many people asked me what I had done.</li>
            <li>the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the angle of this.&lt;br /&gt;They should have made the part where your face goes in on more of a slant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It steams really hot.  </li>
            <li>it didnt get hot at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that nice.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it includes a cylindrical cup in which to pour the water to the exact amount required.  </li>
            <li>Many will find that the steam helps not only with skin care but also with opening the sinuses.  </li>
            <li>and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks CONAIR!</li>
            <li>Many years ago I owned a facial sauna</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin immediately after my first use.</li>
            <li>and it was hot.  </li>
            <li>I love the conair facial sauna.</li>
            <li>it really.. if i had say about it, is that the brush powerful</li>
            <li>Steam is pretty hot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a real treat!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to seasoned beauty veterans and first timers alike.</li>
            <li>then I recommend that you buy a higher end product.  </li>
            <li>and it is supposed to give off heat, but it gets really hot if you don&#x27;t move your face around.</li>
            <li>It does do its job for sure which is to open your pores.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I love my conair facial steamer.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes longer than a few minutes to warm up, but once it is steaming full strength it works miracles.</li>
            <li>You can also add a couple of drops of your favorite essential oils to help you relax or aid in the clearing of problem skin.</li>
            <li>Add the water before putting the blue top on - otherwise it sort of pours out here and there.  </li>
            <li>I decided to test the product out and try all the features to make sure it is operating properly.</li>
            <li>So overall, after just using the unit for 4 minutes, 2 minutes facial and 2 minutes nasal, I&#x27;m already loving the product!</li>
            <li>make sure that there is enough water as described and things will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Steam gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I used it a lot at first, ut now it is just sitting on a storage shelf.f.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST ORDER WITH AMAZON AND BEING A SENIOR AND NOT COMPUTER SAVVY</li>
            <li>Followed instructions exactly and</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use this more than ten minutes and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>The temperature is borderline too hot, but it is tolerable and hasn&#x27;t caused any burns .</li>
            <li>First time trying this type of product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this unit for a few months now and use it weekly, it produces a good amount of steam for a $20 steamer, you can amplify it with a towel over your head.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my face feels and looks good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE CONAIR FACIAL SAUNA CAME RATHER QUICKLY, PACKAGED SECURELY.  </li>
            <li>but really all this is is boiling water right in front of your face.</li>
            <li>I used it right away, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It starts to steam quickly, can last a half hr+, comes with great attachments and has a convenient timer.</li>
            <li>B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] may deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas.  </li>
            <li>B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] may deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas.  </li>
            <li>The brush was too soft to clean, and if you tried to run it on hi, (or sometimes on lo)</li>
            <li>love how easy this is to use  --  once or twice a week really improves my skin and clears trouble spots</li>
            <li>after using the sauna wash ur face with ur fav face wash and see how soft and clean ur face feels and looks afterwords..</li>
            <li>So glad I got the sauna for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Does the job for us, heats up fast and has a wide range of settings that come in handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the facial attachment, and also the sinus attachment - and have had nice, soft pores</li>
            <li>Very helpful to maintain healthy glow and helps to get rid of acnes.it should be used regularly .I</li>
            <li>good enough for home/ personal use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but after using the sauna my face felt really clear like it could breath and then to scrub it with the brush and wash it after my face felt clean and after that twice of using it i saw some good inprovements my face got more clear of dark spots and pore got smaller.</li>
            <li>It certainly does not wor as effectively as some other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li>Easy and simple to use, makes it much easier to get the junk out of your pores!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does exactly what I want for a facial system.</li>
            <li>Somewhere along the way, I lost my first one, and I really missed having it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than using a pan of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li>my pores were ready and willing to release all of the blackheads and junk.</li>
            <li>it may not be as convenient as the purmist ,  as it has too sit flat, but its much cheaper and works, I feel, better.</li>
            <li>and i found that using a pot with a towel is just as good, if not better, i used this product once.</li>
            <li>Not fazed since I usually get good service from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My product though barely was hot (warm) enough to make any steam</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that I can sit down instead of hovering over a stove and don&#x27;t have to worry about inhaling gas from the stove.</li>
            <li>The brush was way too soft to do much of anything, it took a long time to warm up, and once it did the steam wasn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li>and but it takes special effort to set it up and complete the whole process so its one of those things you think you&#x27;ll use all the time</li>
            <li>The additional accessories are very nice extra that are not offered with other machines.</li>
            <li>This product is very effective &amp; affordable for the amount you receive compared to the other facial steamers out there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and it works as a  personal inhaler too.</li>
            <li>overall, I think it&#x27;s functional, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its a v. basic no frills model that is v. easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall it is easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li>Regular use of the Conair steamer helps to loosen the mucus and enables me to breathe more normally.  </li>
            <li>I should have spent more and purchased a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you dry the unit well before storing to avoid calcification of metal parts.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to get some relief that I could get in the shower or in a closed bathroom with the hot water steaming up the room.  </li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The facial sauna is great for steam but the add-ons like the exfoliating brush and sponge for moisturizer are not useful.</li>
            <li>And the steam isn&#x27;t even strong enough.</li>
            <li>My head is large, dont know how to explain..</li>
            <li>My face certainly felt softer after using.</li>
            <li>I had a rather large zit on my face (that I thought might have been a cyst</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try the DIY method first, or I would have realized it does a completely sufficient job (and actually a better job).</li>
            <li>This facial Sauna works fine..</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  </li>
            <li>My pores are so much smaller, completion clearer, and fine lines diminished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for sinus relief but tried out all attachments and this thing performs!</li>
            <li>Works amazing for my little spa&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and the water in my building doesnt get hot enough to really clean your face.  </li>
            <li>(fill up the little included cup and pour into the bottom, then turn on the switch) and works great to open nasal passages when we can&#x27;t breath (just put a towel over our head to keep in moisture).</li>
            <li>This little sauna is great for opening up your facial pores.  </li>
            <li>It is too time consuming to screw on and off the large top clear plastic portion of the facial sauna when not in use.</li>
            <li>I had one of these for years that we used religiously but somehow misplaced in a move, so we happily repurchased.</li>
            <li>Very neat and fast execution of the order by the seller!Goods very well-proven.</li>
            <li>There is a very noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well with lots of extras.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for a teenager to control acne.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t put out that much steam.</li>
            <li>You almost have to put your face really close to the bottom to feel any type of steam.</li>
            <li>It was working really well and held alot of water</li>
            <li>The manufacturer really needs to improve their technology.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>well, i was really looking for a face steam</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t care so much for the timer.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>which I found not doing much at all.</li>
            <li>I think it will work very well with all the clogged noses we will have in winter.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>the item does what I need it to, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it.</li>
            <li>take up too much counter space</li>
            <li>shut off gives forgetful people like me peace of mind:) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can imagine how much steam it can generate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and moved around different areas, and that is what this sauna does!</li>
            <li>I have had my whole life, and I am 69 now.</li>
            <li>It comes with an exfoliating brush, which is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much because I keep forgeting I have it.</li>
            <li>I like the pampering I can do at home with this just as much as going out to spa.---</li>
            <li>That makes it a real money($) saver.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and generates a ton of steam.</li>
            <li>The steam was just too much</li>
            <li>and I can see much improvement of her face....</li>
            <li>we really like the brush...  </li>
            <li>Well his conclusion is, if you stick your face so much deeper, you could burn your nose.      </li>
            <li>The steam isn&#x27;t a lot, it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to wait for 10 min.</li>
            <li>I got more than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li>It also really helped daughter with acne.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Works really well with opening pores.</li>
            <li>timer works very well too</li>
            <li>I know its not costly, just 21 bucks but still, its supposed to produce freaking steam, which it does very miserly.     </li>
            <li>Most of these units will probably work as described, but be careful if you hear a noise like the water is boiling.  </li>
            <li>It heats up in 3 minutes and beeps to let you know when it&#x27;s ready for you to steam your face.  </li>
            <li>my whole face doesn&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So  like I&#x60;ve said - product works very well</li>
            <li>With the towel and music ready, pour the boiling water into the bowl</li>
            <li>or you are simply ready to finish (I recommend three to seven minutes)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my face doesn&#x27;t really need them</li>
            <li>Very relaxing way to spend a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very therapeutic and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the Alba papaya peel and it work really well.</li>
            <li>really could feel my pores opening thank you</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use the brush that came with this, but I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li>The brush accessory I do not use as much, but I do like the softer bristles.  </li>
            <li>I dont use any of these things as much</li>
            <li>It really helps dissolve oil and plugged pores.</li>
            <li>i just don&#x27;t use it much after 1-2 uses..</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to clear up and when combined with my Olay skincare it is looking a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>She said it makes a lot of steam and is gentle.</li>
            <li>The instructions...or lack there of...was/is a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Also putting the towel over the head really helps.</li>
            <li>I got it as u  decribe it thanks</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s if anyone wants it.  </li>
            <li>It started clearing his face up fast.</li>
            <li>When the buzzer sounds to let you know it is ready, it is not.</li>
            <li>My face is so much clearer and smoother</li>
            <li>the delivery very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>already used,  my skin feel very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>u so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t kick out as much steam as I want it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got that safety timer, it tells you when it&#x27;s ready, it comes with two cones to choose from.</li>
            <li>This definately makes your face feel much softer and helps rid it of impurities.</li>
            <li>Some days it steams really well and</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It feels very soothing and the steam doesn&#x27;t burn your face.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how it practically shrunk my pimples and made my face feel fresh &amp; if every pore is alive.</li>
            <li>Better system than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all really well priced too.  </li>
            <li>I tossed the whole unit eventually</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading this.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting a towel over my head  - which defeats the whole purpose of having this device.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and filled the reservoir up to the max fill line, placed the facial nozzle on and plugged the unit in.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>when you have a cold, this is an excellent way to help your throat and sinuses.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this really targets the front of my face and not the sides.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing as well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Overall, its okay if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want too much steam.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap and does open up my pours.</li>
            <li>And fast shipped...</li>
            <li>VERY helpful for nose and throat &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>One thing I would say is a con is that it does not seem to get your forehead very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I was looking at proactiv as a last resort, but thought I should try something more natural.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even put green tea or any kind of herbs in it.</li>
            <li>Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle.  </li>
            <li>I wud have preferred to pay 50-60 bucks for a nice product then waste 21 on something I&#x27;m might trash.</li>
            <li>Takes a few minutes to warm up but it works.</li>
            <li>Awsome ,cleared my acne up in a week chemical free , best and only thing that worked for me.other products only made it worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The results are better by far than devices that cost triple (including the Clairisonic facial scrubber).</li>
            <li>(nothing better then a professional facial</li>
            <li>Not enough for an effective facial steam.</li>
            <li>I had an older model Conair facial steamer and liked it very much even though the water reservoir was more shallow</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Its very useful and simple to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, the BEST way to get the most out of this product, is to throw a LARGE towel OVER your head and AROUND the unit as to create a steam TENT, and get your face as CLOSE the the base of the unit as possible without BURNING your nostrils ;)</li>
            <li>The size is large enough for most people with small to medium sized faces, though many will have to adjust their heads side to side to get even steaming all around.  </li>
            <li>My main reason for purchasing the unit was to help with the large clogged pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>Brush is very soft and work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It works really well and actually makes your skin look really clean.</li>
            <li>Works really well to open your pores up so you can clean them out when done.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought this only for the face brush</li>
            <li>After reading some of the other reviews, I think I will try adding a couple drops of eucalyptus oil to see if that helps even more.</li>
            <li>The heat settings could have been a little higher for more effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I have many scars on my face due to pimples, i wanted to use this before the derma roller.</li>
            <li>I found that the other product was built with quite cheap workmanship and it also could very easily burn a person if one wasn&#x27;t ever so careful.  </li>
            <li>Mine got old enough to replace with a new one, but could not find anything else better and so order it again.</li>
            <li>Ok - for those who want to do a general facial sauna.</li>
            <li>I can see the actual difference in the amount of residue that shows up when I hand clean and when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li>I went there for a deep pores clean.</li>
            <li>B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad]].  </li>
            <li>B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad]].  </li>
            <li>my wife and i use this regularly to keep our face clean</li>
            <li>Using to clean my sinuses and especially around this time of year it&#x27;s a life saver.  </li>
            <li>Amazon return services will only cover $15 of the return shipping cost and the cost of shipping this item (which is very large) back to Amazon will cost more than what I paid for the item and the shipping costs as I live in Australia.</li>
            <li>good enough for the money paid; but by far not producing as much steam as expected.</li>
            <li>If you have ever gotten a true facial before you would know that they don&#x27;t just drown your face with the steam</li>
            <li>She used the facial steamer and then a lot of masks, which i am sure they were expensive and good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m retired and get up pretty early.</li>
            <li>It looks bigger in the picture, and the box was pretty small, but it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>There is a pretty loud beep that alerts you when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>The face brush includes two small heads for cleaning and moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t seem extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoyed giving each other facials!</li>
            <li>I add some essential oils to the little bowl and the steam is a good temp with towel over head.</li>
            <li>Which is probably how you&#x27;re supposed to exfoliate, but I use a bead wash and need a little more pressure to really work it up and exfoliate the area.</li>
            <li>I was a new person !</li>
            <li>Forget doctors for sinus, forget the salon for better skin and way less acne...</li>
            <li>It does not really get warm enough to steam your face.</li>
            <li>Conair Facial Sauna has helped my sinuses tremendously.</li>
            <li>Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I only use the Olay.  </li>
            <li>i love using this before i use a face mask, let it open up my pores so they can get in deep.</li>
            <li>Also, my personal recommendation - I would probably not use brush to exfoliate your facial skin more often than once in a week or two.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for my sinus problem.</li>
            <li>With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM.</li>
            <li>the heating bowl actually heats up fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>The unit works well for sinus but for the facial, the heat is too mild.</li>
            <li>Decent amount of steam is produced quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water barely boils, to get a good steam I put a towel over my head when using the wide facial steamer.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the very first time while doing my weekly mini facial.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too small to cover whole face,  timer is only good for 15 minutes and not help...</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>When i purchased this item little more then a month ago it was 20 bucks even</li>
            <li>The unit little water, requiring most people to refill it to finish a session&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another</li>
            <li>If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another product.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who didn&#x27;t mind spending a little more time about once a week helping their skin out.</li>
            <li>This is very good for kids when they have cold.  </li>
            <li>You kind of have to pull your face back a little bit, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>This is quick easy and very little water needed so no mess.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and gentle but</li>
            <li>As for me, I use a towel to completely cover and go very close to the sauna</li>
            <li>I suffer from sinusitis on a frequent basis and the steamer really helps.</li>
            <li>I have been frustrated with my skin for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t find the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>Although it does make steam, it&#x27;s too hot to bare with no control.</li>
            <li>I suggest adding a few drops of your favorite oils.</li>
            <li>Please understand that this isn&#x27;t as powerful as a day spa facial machine.</li>
            <li>I bought this because for few months I could not use the stove top.  </li>
            <li>This is better then picking at your face everyday and damaging your skin.</li>
            <li>A nice product for least price.</li>
            <li>I got this for my face and oily skin, this leaves my skin feeling fresh, and it definitely keeps blemishes off my face, and it helped me get rid of a sty of of my eye.</li>
            <li>Extra sinus attachment may be useful for some&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>Both the normal steamer or sinus attachment help to relieve congestion</li>
            <li>B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]] is probably worth looking into.  </li>
            <li>B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]] is probably worth looking into.  </li>
            <li>After steaming for 15 minutes a day, withing 3 days I was breathing normally again.</li>
            <li>: Put a towel over your head to get the most steam trapped on your face before whatever it is you&#x27;re going to do.</li>
            <li>Gets hot leaves my face wet, i actually have to pull away from it before time because it does get super hot.</li>
            <li>The Conair Facial Sauna system was properly packaged; shipped quickly; easy to use and set up.  </li>
            <li>Since I have received this, I have NOT had a single headache and that is remarkable, since I usually get 3 sinus headaches a month!&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes i&#x27;d feel the steam on the right side and sometimes on the left.</li>
            <li>I use it to open my up my pores right before I use a peel away gel mask.  </li>
            <li>Not professional by any means but adequate for home.  </li>
            <li>The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam</li>
            <li>The only benefit was the electric facial brush which works fine.</li>
            <li>My only thought is that a little longer cord would be nice.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is a matter of acclimating to a new product.</li>
            <li>For the price i am paying for it, i can live with that.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still brand new basically, but I am going to give it away</li>
            <li>I returned it and was sent a new one.</li>
            <li>As a huge fan of taking care of my skin through natural means, I was really looking forward to this product but it let me down.</li>
            <li>I got it because it was cheap, but one of my most questionable purchases.</li>
            <li>Finally, the product is a big rip off, if the manufactor wanted someone to enjoy it they would have made a product that is productive.</li>
            <li>I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System.</li>
            <li>I use this system everyday for my own personal spa day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The higher flow of steam coming from a whole bowl, rather than the Conair&#x27;s small heated surface area, does a faster and much more complete job to open up your pores.</li>
            <li>have a big face and it doesn&#x27;t fit in properly.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first by other reviews of it not getting hot enough, but it produces the right amount of steam and heat.</li>
            <li>me say that I have very sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li>This product is excellant for individuals who have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>very little steam better than none</li>
            <li>I think sticking your head over a bowl of hot water would do the same job as this.</li>
            <li>I was scared every second that hot water will splash into my face.</li>
            <li>Second, the amount of steam coming for the unit is like a cup of hot coffee.</li>
            <li>The first time i used the steamer, I put a towel on my head following the advice in the manual.</li>
            <li>Even at this price I am experiencing professional results!  </li>
            <li>The steam is pretty stationary and only moves while you exhale from your nose.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product along with another more expensive steamer tjat was more concentrated</li>
            <li>when using the sauna it got really hot twice and on the third try</li>
            <li>My first one did not have the facial brush, so this was an added treat!</li>
            <li>and I usually put a towel draped over my head and the sauna system to keep the steam enclosed to get a better pore-opening steam.</li>
            <li>This surprised me because I didn&#x27;t think it would help,  but it does!  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, after ten minutes of steaming in this facial sauna (i put a towl over the back of my head to keep trap even more steam)</li>
            <li>Small cup holder but steam is ok.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that the Secura would have had better steam</li>
            <li>I think you can get the same results with hot water running in a sink, lowering your head with a towel over your head....</li>
            <li>This Product works as I expected and as advertised, which is true of all Conair products.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product when I was pregnant and was having some serious sinus problems.</li>
            <li>The manual instructs you to clean your face PRIOR to using the facial sauna.</li>
            <li>Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses</li>
            <li>Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses</li>
            <li>the amount of water it holds is too less, and the steam is too light, like water vapor.</li>
            <li>The Conair - Moisturizing Mist Facial Sauna System with Timer is at most an average product.</li>
            <li>I had to put a towel over my head to confine the steam to stay in one place long enough to open my pores better.</li>
            <li>I read the review about this product making the hot water explode into face, with no apparent reaction time to get away from device.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to use a facial steamer for a long time, personally I suggest you should consider investing in a better model or something.</li>
            <li>so you have to sit like for a long time for it to be effective.and its kind of wide and short</li>
            <li>Given this problem, however, the old-fashion method of boiling a pot of water and covering your head with a towel is probably more effective, and certainly less expensive.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get something that actually works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad some people are getting what they need out of this product, but my story is a little different.</li>
            <li>It also helps to clear my nasal passages.</li>
            <li>The steam is fast and helps open the pores and clear your skin.</li>
            <li>I even used it to clear up my sinuses</li>
            <li>and he sat there with it to clear up his sinuses.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have been using boiling water in pot so far, but I find this product to be very convenient way of doing steam facial.</li>
            <li>The unit is a bit bigger than the old one and heats faster, I also really like the timer.</li>
            <li>Need to run it awhile to clear congestion.</li>
            <li>Let me clear your doubts, the water is never boiling (bubbling)</li>
            <li>Daughter has added it to her regimen to treat her acne, it is helping to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li>I have used steamers for facials before, cheap ones too, but this one was the most disappointing of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Technically you could boil a pot of water and stick your head over it, but this way is much nicer.</li>
            <li>I have had my face steamed during a facial and it was very relaxing.</li>
            <li>My mom bought one back in the 80s that really steams and did the job.</li>
            <li>and my skin was so soft after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>inhale deeply for about 3-5 minutes, then blow your nose gently, and all those irritants and particles will come out.</li>
            <li>One family member developed permanent health problems from over-reliance on things like prescription drugs &amp; Tylenol Sinus, when natural options like this are faster, safer, and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really recommended to anyone who wants deep facial cleaning, but also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have am a 33 year old man with ache on my chin area and have some problems with the hair growing on that area too.</li>
            <li>Works very well, simple to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot and not something you can stay under for a long while.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of professional facials</li>
            <li>I bought it for my sinus problems and so far it seems to help.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it work fast</li>
            <li>I always put a towel over my head just to keep in as much steam as possible.</li>
            <li>and I did not find the beep too loud.</li>
            <li>Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>It has to be refilled frequently.</li>
            <li>I am used to steaming my face the old fashion way, boil some water, cover with a towel and steam as needed.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li>this product was bought for some sauna action</li>
            <li>and so far i have used it 4 times without any problems.</li>
            <li>It took a long time to heat up and the steam wasn&#x27;t all that hot.</li>

            <li>B001884QDK Clarisonic PRO Professional Skin Care System]]</li>
            <li>Our daughter said that she much prefers this facial sauna system to either of our products.</li>
            <li>but I feel that I can get the exact same result simply being in a hot shower/bath to open up my pores....</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>before I hop into bed and my pores are open and ready for any creams or serums you may collect--especially those pricy</li>
            <li>My face instantly looked much firmer and glowing.</li>
            <li>I bought this to give my boyfriend &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; facials since his skin is  sensitive and he tends to get a lot of blackheads</li>
            <li>and I really surprised.  </li>
            <li>-- my boyfriend has sinus problems and uses the smaller cone for steaming and it really helps for a while.</li>
            <li>The direction warn you to not place your face directly ON the unit but to hover over it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Facial Spin Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The spin brush looked very simple and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it.</li>
            <li>A side benefit of steaming my sinuses is that it has made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smaller cone for nasal congestion.</li>
            <li>I am a skin care professional and wanted something to use at home.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with breakouts, breathing, and overall look of skin!</li>
            <li>The bottom barely got hot enough to create steam.</li>
            <li>I have used this facial steamer a few times, and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I like to add a few drops of essential oils to the water for an even more relaxing experience.</li>
            <li>The steam is just right--not too hot, yet effective--although I had to put my face down into the opening in order to really get the benefit.</li>
            <li>The first one arrived &amp; the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It requires very little water and the water heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Returned as easy as usual with amazon.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a month, but so far, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Steamer comes with a little cup to fill the right amount of water in the steamer!</li>
            <li>But this particular one only hold about 1/8 cup of water.</li>
            <li>and I was only really interested in the facial steam function.  </li>
            <li>The main issue I have with it, is it doesn&#x27;t put out NEARLY enough steam and FORCE with the steam for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I am an older man and maybe still alittle vain from my younger years.</li>
            <li>However to have a decent lasting steam, you&#x27;ll have to continually adding water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if larger units that hold more water for steaming are sold here.  </li>
            <li>Some said it didn&#x27;t produce enough steam or it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Also - what goes very nicely with this set is to get a small bottle of Essential oils (I use 10ml peppermint with just a few drops)</li>
            <li>but I used it today with a little bit of Lush&#x27;s facial stuff that you put in a pot for steaming and it worked just fine; no damage to the unit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend wearing a headband and tilting your head back at times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $100 before on facial steamer and yes, more expensive, works better</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a high and low option on the side of the unit.</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a cheaper alternative to the pricier systems that do the same thing.</li>
            <li>mean its ok generally but</li>
            <li>The little derma machine included is a cute bonus, but I can do the same thing with a mini face brush with more accuracy and less mess +</li>
            <li>it takes two batterys and you can use any facial cleaner and use the brush to scrub it in more its not to soft and not to hard.</li>
            <li>I was suffering from terrible sinus congestion and the Conair helped greatly to keep my nose free and clear</li>
            <li>The container to hold water is so small that it can fit your tears when you cry!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>as well, not a good face fit, and feels like too hot temperature, but can play around it with a towel over the head and just hovering above it.</li>
            <li>I bought this facial sauna after my first visit, to a SPA, in USA for a deep pore cleansing where i was very desappointed because my face was looking the same after the facial and after $70 payed.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin but using harsh astringents really just makes you skin produce more oil to combat being dried out.</li>
            <li>Take a few minutes to heat up to full steam.</li>
            <li>The level of steam is so low, so small and the overall setup is so ineffective that you are better off just using a regular but good quality humidifier and sticking your head down where the steam comes off (within a few inches so you don&#x27;t burn your skin or anything).</li>
            <li>The face thing should be wider, and because of this I&#x27;m often uncomfortable from trying to twist my face in a certain position, to make sure it gets some steam.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product i was concerned about the safety issue since someone had posted that the blue neck is not long enough and it might be too close to the hot water.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the secondary cone which directs the steam more to the nose area than the entire face.</li>
            <li>The cup doesn&#x27;t hold enough and at the constant boiling rate, the evaporation is too fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not big enough to steam your whole face.</li>
            <li>The face brush doesn&#x27;t produce enough friction to really perform deep cleaning</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if I like the facial brush or not as I bought a Calrisonic and use that instead, but I will say that I like using the sauna to steam my face before putting a mask on and occasionally after I put on moisturizer to really let it seep into my pores.</li>
            <li>I put a mask on directly afterwards to complete my facial.</li>
            <li>a sudden - had to return the product and ask for a refund which the amazon guys did - Big THANKS to them for helping me</li>
            <li>Is like a real sauna for your face, ill use once in a week&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this product :)</li>
            <li>Also, the nasal sauna is good to clear nasal passages for a cold or flu.</li>
            <li>The facial scrubber bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>The face mask on this product fits awkwardly, I wish it was a little more comfortable since you really need to keep it on for awhile to work well.</li>
            <li>Since then, my throat has constricted and mucus gets stuck in my windpipe, causing major breathing problems.</li>
            <li>She used this sauna the first day it arrived and has used it almost every OTHER day since it arrived.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned, it is just too small to steam your entire face at once, and it gets pretty hot, but not as hot as I would like.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to rely on Conair to produce quality products, but in the past several years the quality has definitely declined.</li>
            <li>This uit is easy to use and very effective for the cold weather and homes with less than average humidity--great for clearing nasal passages too.</li>
            <li>The unit has paid for itself many times over, furthermore, in lieu of the brutal reviews, simply return it; both Conair and Amazon are amazing when it comes to customer satisfaction on this front.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to maintaine an acne free skin.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars, because its hard to fit your face into it.</li>
            <li>It is a little hot if you put your face directly into the funnel and drape a towel over it like it says to.</li>
            <li>i dont see how is it possible that 15 ml water can burst up so high and get your face a third degree burnt.</li>
            <li>The Conair claims manager was rude and appeared as if she could care less that my wife experienced this due to their product.  </li>
            <li>You do not get the quality steaming as with the huge machines at the spa but at least here you do not have to bother with distilled water (referring to build up).</li>
            <li>When you have a cloged nose or just want to relax in general</li>
            <li>I have issues with cystic acne, and general oily skin.</li>
            <li>My wife was using it one day (as directed, water only) to try and clear up her sinuses.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I clear my sinuses, but I get a skin treatment.  </li>
            <li>That only thing I can say that i dislike about it is the loud beep it makes.</li>
            <li>i so far only used the face one.</li>
            <li>If purchased at a store, would be returning to see how to complete the above.    </li>
            <li>It takes nearly 10min to steam and the steam is also very low...</li>
            <li>I barely use the brush because it slings the face wash everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and I only used it twice so far, so</li>
            <li>So if your goal is to open those pores to extract blackheads, save your money and use the old method of placing boiling water in a pot and cover your head with a towel.</li>
            <li>Quality of materials is average, though the first item that was delivered to us wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected at all.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product as an alternative to a professional facial.  </li>
            <li>I barely touched it and a glob of blackhead stuff came out.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the big cone doesn&#x27;t really hold the steam well to actually steam your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from a spa experience and probably will not give you the same results as a professional facial, but it DOES work.  </li>
            <li>This facial sauna works well so far.</li>
            <li>It barely can circulate when pressure is applied to it.  </li>
            <li>The unit makes short of a hissing noise as the water boils, but it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I Was very surprise and got beyond what was expected.</li>
            <li>First, the product is smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The base stays cool even after using for 10-15 minutes &lt;br /&gt;-Produces effective amounts of steam to open pores and clear out the sinuses &lt;br /&gt;-Ability to set a timer is convenient</li>
            <li>I was kind of mad,wrong timing for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say as of yet that my skin is looking better, but I can say that the lines on my lips decreased dramatically after one session, and they looked plumper as well.</li>
            <li>So there is a little learning curve and you will leaned to move your face to the right angle in order to make the steam hit those spots.   </li>
            <li>I think I will get a better cleaning experience with the spinning feature breaking down the dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li>If you spend just a little time to clean and exfoliate your skin it will pay off in the long run</li>
            <li>So great for at home mini facials or for when you are sick or stuffed up with allergies</li>
            <li>First off this item seems great, but while using it the first time I couldn&#x27;t help being a little fearful that the water would somehow shoot up and burn my face/eyes.  </li>
            <li>She heard a &#x27;bubbling&#x27; and the unit exploded hot water on the lower half of her face.  </li>
            <li>Then the other day I heard one of my colleague&#x27;s wife had a burn by spilled boiling hot water while exercising the same.</li>
            <li>Due to a medical condition I cannot use decongestants, so I needed something to duplicate the congestion-busting effects of a hot shower (nothing against showers, but let&#x27;s face it:</li>
            <li>I usually break out every so often &amp; now I can see a tremendous change in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not great because it didn&#x27;t give enough steam as I expected from the facial sauna but for the money you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>might as well  make use of the whole benefit since it came with the other accessories.  </li>
            <li>One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I&#x27;m on drugs)to the point where they feel like they&#x27;re burning</li>
            <li>after five and so minutes the steam was turning too much for me (probably the steam volume you and other complaining costumer here want).</li>
            <li>But other than that which to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t care about...</li>
            <li>The facial brush that comes along with it is a little powerhouse cleaner, well worth the money of the two alone.  </li>
            <li>My wife always has a very stuffy nose with the onset of cold, and more so during the fall.</li>
            <li>The facial steamer and microdermabrasion tool have left me with an incredibly soft skin texture and appearance.  </li>
            <li>I like the timer feature so that I don&#x27;t have to think about how much time I am spending there, especially since you need to keep your eyes closed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The steamer DOES heat up in 3 minutes and lets you know with a peep that it&#x27;s done heating up, it does point out in the booklet though that it sometimes could take a couple of minutes more then 3 minutes to heat up, probably depending on how much water you put in, or how cold the water is you put in there to begin</li>
            <li>If you are still skeptical about buying this product, just go for it, it&#x27;s really worth it, and worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described, I wish it was made a little sturdier.  </li>
            <li>My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it just use with caution and be careful</li>
            <li>This facial sauna emits less steam than a hot cup of coffee.  </li>
            <li>It only took 3 days for the product to arrived, and the product was great too, but unfortunately, after few day I brought this product, I found out that this product had reduced its price to $17.45.....</li>
            <li>keeps the brush apparatus and the smaller components in the clear plastic container, positioned to the left of the facial sauna.</li>
            <li>Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impatient</li>
            <li>The Conair product works on the entire face without having to move around one small wand for full facial results.  </li>
            <li>I read a review when I ordered mine that indicated the water splashed out and burned someone, but I have had no problems with this on my first one and the one I ordered a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>I found that the chin/mouth area got extremely hot for a few seconds and when it became unbearable I moved my face.</li>
            <li>I live up north, and my skin and sinuses get very dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value overall &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>steam is too gentle and the water quantity it can hold is too less..</li>
            <li>It came with a thin, easy to understand and to the point</li>
            <li>The timer is not long enough to have any effects.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to everyone in a tight budget.</li>
            <li>It holds up very little water so dry up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and a little water makes steam for a long time.</li>
            <li>But then I didn&#x27;t pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to get up the steam, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>We live in the south so pollen, mold and other allergens are almost always present.</li>
            <li>I had another similar type home unit in the past which was far better and am sorry I don&#x27;t still have it now, since no one seems to make any of high quality anymore.</li>

            <li> Great item</li>
            <li> I am happy with the price.  </li>
            <li> but it works great at opening my nasal passages.  </li>
            <li> The sauna is great.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with it and i am recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Besides being great for skin care, leaving your face glowing, it comes with this nasal cone for sinus relief.</li>
            <li> but still great.</li>
            <li> Great value</li>
            <li> because i don&#x27;t think the effect is really great.</li>
            <li> The exfoliator is great too when you have fully charged batteries, can&#x27;t tell you how it compares to a clairsonic although at 100x the price</li>
            <li> It is also great for opening pores before I do a mask or use a strip to remove those pesky blackhead that get in one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> but the spin brush is still working great</li>
            <li> i would have to say if you are looking for a great sauna for the face</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a great scrub the spin brush is great</li>
            <li> I used it one or two times and was quite happy with it</li>
            <li> and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> and I like to put  a towel over my head for a really great steam.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush with attachments is great.</li>
            <li> but when I do it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my sinuses also.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses these when she has sinus issues, and she is happy at how well it works.</li>
            <li> This piece piece is great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
            <li> It makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> The scrub is great, the shipping was great, and so is the timer.</li>
            <li> lol...</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> I am happy because a shower opens my pores &amp; cleanses, and the brush does this when I don&#x27;t shower.  </li>
            <li> The amount of steam is not that great</li>
            <li> Nothing great.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> At best, you can hope for a mildly effective effort on its part.</li>
            <li> The microderm abrasion tool also works as advertised to scrub your skin without causing any pain, and the moisturizer pad did a great job of working moisturizer into my skin.</li>
            <li> Really great system.  </li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> This works great</li>
            <li> I noticed that the problems were greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> The timer option is great</li>
            <li> Nice system for a great price!  </li>
            <li> brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof and eventually broke.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This item works great on my face and nostrils.</li>
            <li> and my face looks great.</li>

            <li> \\&quot;Olay Prof Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System\\&quot; &amp;    The ideal piece would be combining the Olay&#x27;s brush and the Conair&#x27;s mechanics.    </li>
            <li> I am very glad I bought this and would recommend it to anyone who fights acne.</li>

            <li> Not too hot for your skin, meanwhile getting the perfect spa effect.</li>
            <li> you can get more steam from a pot of boiling water!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for facials as well as those plagued with allergies and any sinus condition.&lt;br /&gt;Compact for easy storage&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with great results.</li>
            <li> and it worked amazing.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing attractive about sitting at the table over a huge pot used for dinner while sweat and sinus fluids drop into it...</li>
            <li> This works amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> It fit just great.  </li>
            <li> Amazing price.</li>
            <li> Results was amazing.</li>
            <li> What an amazing system.</li>
            <li> AND SHE SAID SHE IS LOVING IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> What a nice break.</li>
            <li> My GF saw the fascial cone and liked the unit as well, and the fascial brush was immediately disappeared by her as well.</li>
            <li> ,i think it would have been nice if it were longer and narrower</li>
            <li> It came in nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> It does take time to warm up.</li>
            <li> I really liked this item.</li>
            <li> The thing takes awhile to warm up and</li>
            <li> It is a nice item and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> My product came with the face scrubber and it is really nice</li>
            <li> It stayed warm to the touch even though I hadn&#x27;t used it for days.  </li>
            <li> I have run the faucet to a luke warm which takes 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feel so good</li>
            <li> The timer is especially useful.</li>
            <li> feels like going into your own world</li>
            <li> This thing looks nice</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice to have the timer.</li>
            <li> - DO THIS: wash it with soap &amp; warm water before you use it.    </li>
            <li> Nice for the price and does what it says....</li>
            <li> I thought the brush / sponge tool was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its good for opening up pores.</li>
            <li> and then it kind of just sits there.</li>
            <li> keep a cup of warm water and keep replenishing.</li>
            <li> This really hydrates the face, ad I especially enjoyed the bonus cleanser brush.  </li>
            <li> After a year and more use is in good condition</li>
            <li> I found out that I have sleep apnea, and I have to wear the mask at night that blows warm heated moist air in my face while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Returned, not so effective</li>
            <li> Also if you don&#x27;t unplug the unit, it stays warm.</li>
            <li> So nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Nice compact size&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it for my allergies mostly, and it works good for that too, when I wake up stuffy</li>
            <li> It was confining, and you have to have the perfect height table and chair to really make it work.  </li>
            <li> Then turned it on and waited for it to warm up (3 minutes).</li>
            <li> This is something nice to have , i even let my mum use it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the microdermabrasion (spelling?) thingamabob, but the steamer works nicely.</li>
            <li> The timer option (up to 15 min) is nice.</li>
            <li> nothing happened, the water got warm, but</li>
            <li> Also loving the exfoliate tool that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage of face.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and really opens the sinuses</li>
            <li> I Was looking for something like this, its really nice and relaxing....</li>
            <li> I think using a washcloth and washing your face twice a day is just as effective...</li>
            <li> I liked the microderm brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Using mask right after steaming is very good idea too.</li>
            <li> Facial sauna is probably the Best thing you can do to clean your pores - you can apply scrub or pore cleaner after for best results.    </li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> , this is perfect, even better than the first one I got.</li>
            <li> It proved to be very easy to use and to transport and it produced a nice flow of steam without burning my face.  </li>
            <li> and I am truly pleased with this system it is easy to use and the results are great</li>
            <li> This tool is awesome for clearing pores &amp; a gentle more effective way to handling your pimples.</li>
            <li> This is especially really great before exfoliating because it makes all your skin cells super saturated..</li>
            <li> Works good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use...</li>
            <li> Just received it today, and it was very easy to set up.  </li>
            <li> Of course it is more relaxing and better!</li>
            <li> It is the BEST thing that I ever bought as far as my sinuses are concerned.</li>
            <li> Since Conair the much more effective, bought another.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and this is the best my skin has ever looked.  </li>
            <li> and I will tell you more effective ways to break a sweat on ur face</li>
            <li> Conair is like a nice sports car at top speed and Olay is like a sedan.</li>
            <li> The steam is continuous and concentrated with this unit, therefore, you can expect much more effective results.  </li>
            <li> and I am so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome steamer for home facials, to clear up stuffed noses, etc.</li>
            <li> Honestly, getting a pot of boiling water and putting your face over/steam is more productive that this produce.</li>
            <li> Honestly, using a pot of boiled water works better.</li>
            <li> More heads on the brush would have also been nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind that no matter how many times I wash, what I use or how I use it...</li>
            <li> When I was able to use it I liked it.</li>
            <li> the warm moist air sure does help the nose and throat.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to end a busy day.</li>
            <li> I like this product it does a good job...when used correctly the pores are opened and blackheads are so much more easy to remove....</li>
            <li> Do it, I am so happy right now with each breath I take.</li>
            <li> Great for steaming my face and was priced right.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The built in timer is easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin is smooth and really does not need make up anymore which is the best part.  </li>
            <li> the included automatic brush works real nice &amp; you probably don&#x27;t need $200 clarisonic if you use this for cleaning - 2nd brush work real nice for applying moisturizer    Sauna itself - double whammy - good for your face skin + good for your breathing.</li>
            <li> Love this it is a perfect face steamer to clear pores</li>
            <li> Overall great price and great product</li>
            <li> I did not find it too hot, so that is great.  </li>
            <li> was great, in that I had been interested in seeing trying one.</li>
            <li> It has great steam output and if you put a towel over your head, it really makes you sweat!</li>
            <li> Its okay nothing real special.</li>
            <li> It also has a strong burnt smell, I think some kind of fuse may be burnt, which makes me doubt the safety of using this item that heats water.</li>
            <li> Just a nice easy at home one.  </li>
            <li> Water comes quick to boiling state and generate good amount of steam.  </li>
            <li> nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> anyway I think it&#x27;s OK because it steamed face quick good.</li>
            <li> Both my kids are using this very comfortably as the steam is appropriate for them.  </li>
            <li> Just wish there was a head rest or way to relax more without the neck strain.</li>
            <li> and I must say, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s therapeutic and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the scrub brush for microdermabrasion too.  </li>
            <li> but I put a towel over my head when using it - seems to make the steam more potent.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> it is okay.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> skin look so much better......</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> in all its an ok product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> If this worked well, created more steam, I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> The first try was absolutly amazing!</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll be using this anymore.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s seems safer and more controlled.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than steaming your face over the stove.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> And during allergy season, you&#x27;ll breathe better.</li>
            <li> my opinion, the face tool/attachments don&#x27;t do any more than a loofah or washcloth + exfoliating cream.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Sitting bent over the cone for any more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The MDF2R attachments in the photograph appear to be mounted in a flush fashion and probably spin with more stability.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> Wish it held more water, but it holds more than most.</li>
            <li> more note</li>
            <li> Sincerely  Wanda Rinehart.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li> Love love love this sauna..</li>
            <li> I;ve use it for more then 1 year.</li>
            <li> The result is satisfying</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d use it more than I did.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a safely measure.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home facial steaming...</li>
            <li> Love the scrubber.</li>
            <li> I browsed many and then finalized this one based on price, look etc.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this steamer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this product after I used it one time, but I decided to wait one week again in able to use it again.  </li>
            <li> But still, I didn&#x27;t feel the steam more.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it is still more convenient and faster than boiling water in a pot.</li>
            <li> but I would think it has to boil to be able to get the steam.</li>
            <li> but then again, I can&#x27;t even be sure since I don&#x27;t have that condition.  </li>
            <li> Over all I LOVE this product and would recommend anyone getting one to pamper your self a bit at home.</li>
            <li> I had to unplug it just to make sure it was off.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care because I love everything else.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The Steamer is okay to use...</li>
            <li> I love steaming my face</li>
            <li> I think it is OK, but I don&#x27;t know why the timer doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> steam is awesome and the facial is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent facial sauna system...</li>
            <li> and when I come back the steam was boiling perfectly.</li>
            <li> Happy with the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> She did complain that there isn&#x27;t more steam out of it.</li>
            <li> and when i used this product i was able to squeeze them out with out pushing bacteria to inside.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that my skin is actually smoother now because it adds water to the face, Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better unit for the price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and lungs for better breathing  </li>
            <li> but I hope it produced more steam.</li>
            <li> It releases the sinus pressure and after a couple of days I feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I use it weekly or when I have time.  </li>
            <li> I would like for the product to put out more steam.</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is an excellent product!  </li>
            <li> That timer is such a great feature!  </li>
            <li> I suggest that you place a towel over your head while steaming to get better face steaming results.  </li>
            <li> I really love that this thing is a one-stop shop.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this machine</li>
            <li> and I found that recommendation to yield better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> i use it with a towel over my head to get more of the steam without resting my face on it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, price is great, and it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I found the bowl method works much better and faster.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away to a friend because the DIY method is so much better.</li>
            <li> and they love it</li>
            <li> Makes enought steam and has a better effect if you use a towel around your head so it can keep the steam on your face.</li>
            <li> Just using it 10 minutes made me feel better as it loosened all my sinus pressure.</li>
            <li> I love steaming my face and then cleansing with a clay mask or using the oil cleansing method.  </li>
            <li> and I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I thought this would put out more steam than it does.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way my skin looks after using it.</li>
            <li> okay .... takes  time for  the steam to come ............</li>
            <li> ):)  </li>
            <li> I love it &amp; so does my face.</li>
            <li> You get the most benefit when you breath out when using the unit.</li>
            <li> The steamer part is ok.</li>
            <li> It also comes with this wonderful battery operated facial exfoliating brush and sponge attachment that I use with my exfoliating scrub and finish with the sponge for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn&#x27;t neccessarily perform the greatest.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> More like 2 1/2 stars</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m better off sticking to a boiling pot of water and a towel…</li>
            <li> But overall it was great!</li>
            <li> i use the towel over my head for better coverage.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me steam my face in a faster more convenient way as opposed to waiting for water to boil on the stove.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Great item .. fast delivery ..</li>
            <li> I get much better results</li>
            <li> Okay I read a ton of reviews on this thing before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was most concerned that people have said it would burn your face, but I went ahead and got it anyway just in case they didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works well, or anything else about the product because it is a gift, but I am sure it does</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased I purchased one for my sister for her upcoming birthday.  </li>
            <li> it would get even hotter.&lt;br /&gt;it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> Healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is when your finished sauna, please do a face mask, it will help your skin better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to have one like this many years ago when I was in college.</li>
            <li> (That truly is MANY years ago.)  </li>
            <li> When I found this on Amazon, I ordered it immediately, and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> While they enjoyed it, it ended up being one of those items that gets infrequent use.  </li>
            <li> The edges of the bowl could have been better designed for comfort&lt;br</li>
            <li> More established tools like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> More established tools like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t steam for more than 11 minutes and it works</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> and she sleeps better at night.</li>
            <li> You absolutely need it for a great and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Love this&lt;</li>
            <li> I love love love this sauna.</li>
            <li> I Love It.</li>
            <li> Its not a horrible product</li>
            <li> You do have to use it one or two times a week to keep the good results it gives, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> i really love this...</li>
            <li> For once in my life, my face has lasted more than five minutes without being greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to overfill, water may splash and it&#x27;s boiling water</li>
            <li> Otherwise pleased</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I feel like I would get more steam from just standing by a hto sink</li>
            <li> Better than spending $35 on the Vicks steam inhaler.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again if it were to break. :)</li>
            <li> I dropped it in the shower too many times and from the water getting in the battery compartment it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> but I did like the conair one better.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Ok product.</li>
            <li> Another greater alternative I use is adding tea with the water.</li>
            <li> I wish it was stronger and generated more steam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better and stronger steamers</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li> It also primes your face to get better results from your anti-aging and moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep an eye on the water level.  </li>
            <li> (eye area might be ok).  </li>
            <li> And, as I said, afterward my skin looked better than it ever has, and my pores looked cleaner than they have in years.</li>
            <li> The dual cones are most functional.  </li>
            <li> and my husband is getting better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love how whether you use the timer or not the unit will shut off (30 minutes without the timer and up to 15 minutes withtimer) to eliminate the chance of overheating.</li>
            <li> I made sure to use energizer batteries to test it, just to ensure maximum power.</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t why I bought it, but that seems to be the attachment getting the most use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better of heating a pot of water and using that as my steamer.</li>
            <li> better just to put a pot of water on the stove or an electric tea kettle.  </li>
            <li> I love this machine.</li>
            <li> I really love my machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is ok.</li>
            <li> Even on its highest setting it tends to lag for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i use it most of the times.</li>
            <li> You could get way more steam over a sink with a towel  or bowling water in a bowl with a towel.  </li>
            <li> Glad it has aut-shutoff feature.</li>
            <li> Use a towel over your head to help get more moisture.</li>
            <li> This allowed the steam to build up and it did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love this, my mom purchased it for my birthday.</li>
            <li> I was glad that it came with some accessories that I ended up having a use for.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this steamer over a sauna anyday because the steam is more concentrated.</li>
            <li> but I love the feeling of the steam on my skin when I am using it.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> steamer is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> in all its a top contender when price is also included.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for months now and love it.</li>
            <li> It does warm up pretty quick, and puts out a great amount of steam..</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it does work, just doesn&#x27;t put out as much steam and the steam isn&#x27;t very warm.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Well if youre looking for a simple and easy way to steam your face, this product is great!</li>
            <li> Great product very stable and easy to work.</li>
            <li> This facial sauna is great but the microdermabrasion brush that comes with it is even better!</li>
            <li> Also, fits whole face nicely!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the purchase, delivery was quick, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It was so refreshing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it super often, but if I want to pamper myself and relax this is a nice way to do it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean..</li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that its worth the price plus more!</li>
            <li> Works great, steam heats up pretty quick</li>
            <li> This one is way better than my old one, I am glad it broke!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with it :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure works fine.  </li>
            <li> I love this for quick steaming my face but love it even more when my sinuses start to act up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to put a large towel over your head to trap all the steam which enhances the experience.</li>
            <li> if you know your skin type and use the correct skin  cream to massage and then use this facial sauna to steam and clean, it renders magnificent results.  </li>
            <li> My face feels fresh, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Every woman should own this facial steamer, as it is truly a luxury in your own home!</li>
            <li> Amazon is great about returns so there was no trouble but feel off the product now and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> The MDF2R microdermabrasion unit  appears to be longer, which would be a better fit for my hand and presumably easier to control.</li>
            <li> I love the design and how you can place your head on it comfortable and</li>
            <li> Its great for facials or if you are stuffed up and need to clear your sinuses.  </li>
            <li> It has worked great so far</li>
            <li> After the unit is fully warmed up and ready to go, I place it in the bottom of whichever attachment you choose(Not in the water), and it feels great and leaves you feeling cool and refreshed after</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m returning this, no doubt quality of product material is good, but its not doing its job, steam produced is very weak.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> its not as powerful and effective i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It is really good for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved her xmas pressy thanks</li>
            <li> it feels so good and really clears up my face.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little sauna, it has done a great job cleaning pores and is also very healthy for sinuses.  </li>
            <li> The spin brush comes in very handy and the bristles on the brush is soft.</li>
            <li> I found one cup is enough for a good five minutes of steaming!</li>
            <li> Have used other saunas, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> When I received my steamer, yesterday, I was excited to be able to test it out.</li>
            <li> Item is compact and stores easily.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and makes my skin SO and glowing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> This is what I was expecting, easy to use and does what it needs to..</li>
            <li> The item is really easy to use out of the box.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I got it to clean more pores</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to put together and use, i recommended this product to all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to put together</li>
            <li> Easy to use , multipurpose</li>
            <li> Makes at home facials easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> With this product I am able to get a deeper clean for my skin and improve my complexion.</li>
            <li> The steamer is light-weight and compact (easy to store).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a facial sauna but even greater for allergy and sinus congestion.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say the good old fashioned method is definitely better.  </li>
            <li> It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean.</li>
            <li> People complain about not enough room to hold the water but for 15 minutes at a time it is perfect and the right amount.</li>
            <li> It doesnt give you the full coverage like the salon, but it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The former was still in great condition, however, this one was a bit more advanced in features and accessories so for the price I replaced it.  </li>
            <li> Cool mist worked ok.</li>
            <li> I have to use this more often to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and now my skin&#x27;s glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing.</li>
            <li> sure why this one has a full view into the &amp;#34;steam boiler&amp;#34;receptacle</li>
            <li> and my face felt nice and clean, fresh.</li>
            <li> Easy routine to add to your skin care that offers incredible results and feels so relaxing to have the hot steam.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend skipping this product in lieu of the do-it-yourself method just because the DIY method is so much more effective.</li>
            <li> In fact, I had a professional facial at a good day spa not a year ago, and I don&#x27;t remember having had results this good!  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for cleansing purposed because my skin isn&#x27;t that great right now</li>
            <li> Had previously owned the Kaz steamer and that worked great!</li>
            <li> Not only is my skin flawless with consistent use, it also does wonders for my voice, as I am a singer.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> I could breath just fine.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the subject Sauna.  </li>
            <li> so it works fine for what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe 5 minutes, but then acts fine.</li>
            <li> scrubber and sponge are fine.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li> I must say I was very surprised by this steamer, in a good way, when I got it.</li>
            <li> Not the top quality but far better than I was expecting!</li>
            <li> This little sauna works perfectly and makes a lot of steam.  </li>
            <li> i have cycstic acne, huge bumps under the skin not caused by a cleanliness issue but by hormones.</li>
            <li> Overall, I cant complain and I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> but it is also great, especially if you drape a towel to tent your face in.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but I wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a great steamer for your home facial.</li>
            <li> This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great cost-effective facial sauna.</li>
            <li> The product works as described, but steaming your face over a bowl of water is MUCH easier, faster, and effective for opening your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean after use.</li>
            <li> so i can do it at home, for free.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> dont buy, it burns u up and is a cheap product as it broke in after using a couple of times</li>
            <li> The Conair Facial Sauna System is a great product.</li>
            <li> Looks kinda cheaply made and it&#x27;s plastic.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and relaxed feelings.</li>
            <li> for cheap price, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I think I was hoping against hope that this would work and I could enjoy facials at home.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> But basically it&#x60;s cheap</li>
            <li> This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers.</li>
            <li> this cheap and works like its cost lots of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and has lasted several years now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even feel totally comfortable with using it.</li>
            <li> Looks like it was made in the 1980&#x27;s, and made cheaply as well.</li>
            <li> It is great for facial cleaning and for sinus and allergy problems.  </li>
            <li> Package was secure, had everything it was supposed to come with.</li>
            <li> Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use facial scrubbers , but as steamer on face or sinus great.</li>
            <li> My  face doesn&#x27;t rest comfortably in it.  </li>
            <li> Great tool overall!</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made and it looks like it was made in the .1980&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it looks nice, and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I think this is important to decrease any chance of injury.</li>
            <li> So overall, I think the spin brush will be used a lot and looking forward to some great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> So you have to use it lightly.</li>
            <li> , MY ORDER WENT SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> Personally I think that this sauna works great .</li>
            <li> great facial and helped me through the allergies I suffer with here in the Ohio Valley!!</li>
            <li> Works great for an at home facial!</li>
            <li> Got a free gift as well.</li>
            <li> It also has a great facial attachment.</li>
            <li> This is great for steaming your face when you are congested or for a facial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old college student who has NEVER had good skin.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This works like the good old steamers.  </li>
            <li> First things first, I fell for the good reviews and Conair&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> (btw, that was a good tip from manual, as you protect your sensitive skin around eyes).</li>
            <li> I used a towel over my head and it felt as good as a professional machine.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to much relief in the future and am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and it has held up for me so far.  </li>
            <li> My face has never been this clear it feels really good.</li>
            <li> But steamer works good s.o far</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order it at first because of the mix reviews, but it turned out to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> I think if you want a gentle steaming this is ok, but I think just boiling a pot of water is better.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much!!!</li>
            <li> positive is that it is easy to use for travel and probably good to travel with if you are going to a very arid region or desert.&lt;br /&gt;Limited</li>
            <li> It definitely opened my pores and it&#x27;s very warm and relaxing.     </li>
            <li> if you have sinus problem also, this is very useful.</li>
            <li> I would work best if you had a high counter and a low chair in order to relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li> and it has been very useful for me.</li>
            <li> I said, the Conair also works great as a facial spa/sauna, though my family uses it primarily to clean sinuses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing warm and gives a very all over clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Steam was very good and strong, but I would probably be more happier if the facial cone was a bit longer, so my face is not so very close to the steam coming right out of the machine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as much steam as I would have hoped for, a pot of hot water and a towel as a tent definetly more effective</li>
            <li> PERFECTLY AND FAST   NICE AND SMALL  </li>
            <li> But, honestly, that is what I was doing with my hot water in the sink, prior to purchase, and it did just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth afterwards, so clean.</li>
            <li> Smooth, shine and clean.  </li>
            <li> Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quick to set up and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> awesome little face steamer with auto turn off timer!</li>
            <li> this product really helps, very easy to set and use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use although it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is far more useful for me because of the timer and the signal to tell me when it&#x27;s ready...couldnt be better!</li>
            <li> I thing this brush is more gentle but yet more effective than just using my old brush.</li>
            <li> very fast delivery, like it. :)</li>
            <li> After wearing makeup 10 hours a day in this horrid southern humidity, this sauna system has become my new best friend to prevent pores from clogging.</li>
            <li> My new moisturizing mist facial sauna system is awesome.</li>
            <li> Better off with a bowl of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li> I originally received this as a gift.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to assemble and to use.  </li>
            <li> Save you money and buy something worth it!</li>
            <li> dies a better job if I could find a way to get the steam to come out and steam my face consistently.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this the intensity of the steam was a bit overwhelming</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this facial sauna.  </li>
            <li> The product was originally scheduled to be delivered on December 21, 2006.  </li>
            <li> I wish it steamed a bit stronger and was more consistent day to day.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing too...leaves my face feeling fresh, love it :-)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It also help to open up my sinuses, it&#x27;s nice to have this on hand!</li>
            <li> If you take the blue part OFF the unit (once it cools off and you remove the water), it will better fit in the original box for storage!!</li>
            <li> and then I use the scrubber to clean and exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> and I feel like no matter how much I clean</li>
            <li> I get the machine going as I start to clean up after dinner.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I keep it on a kitchen counter and steam sinuses whenever I catch free time.</li>
            <li> Suffered acne and this works to clean skin</li>
            <li> and it just felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer afterwards, and it calms my acne when I steam clean my face.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so clean</li>
            <li> allergy victim lol.</li>
            <li> This has a special face piece just for that reason......</li>
            <li> Give your face a special cleansing.</li>
            <li> Someone on the review said that there is a special attachment for nasal issues, and remarked that it helped their sinus</li>
            <li> , it has a special sinus took you can use, it works wonder.</li>
            <li> I use it when I want to give my face special treatment.</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> but I love how soft and clean it makes me skin!</li>
            <li> good if you want it for medical purpose.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this will eventually help me clear up this problem area permanently.</li>
            <li> In short, good buy.</li>
            <li> but once you actually put your face on the cone you get a good amount of steam.</li>
            <li> I love this product SO MUCH that I have like 3 back-ups in case</li>
            <li> This machine is totally cheaply made, not even worth to use.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Compared to its more costly competition it really stacked up.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how this thing got such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My face feel super clean and hydrated every time.</li>
            <li> I even had to take my face out a bit to cool off.</li>
            <li> This puts out good steam and has the face basket for maximum facial effect.  </li>
            <li> Good for present.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good sauna.</li>
            <li> I think using a towel over your head will be very helpful if you want to steam your face for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This unit does not leak water when I fill it to the maximum level, and I love the sinus steamer accessory, since I have migraines it really helps.</li>
            <li> its very relaxing :)</li>
            <li> Facial brush and sponge are good in quality.</li>
            <li> Overall it good and can recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I put a towel over my head for even more intense steam.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t say that too often, but it is well worth the money which is really cheap for the work it puts out.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating brush will be as good as the facial cream/</li>
            <li> I still have to make a tent over the unit to get the full steam effect that I want.</li>
            <li> The only way I could get a good steam was to put a towel over my head while using it.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap so worth a try for some</li>
            <li> I even had surgery for my sinus to no avail (hurt more than labor), even that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because I loved the actual unit.  </li>
            <li> You still get a good facial doing so.</li>
            <li> I tested it by pressing it up against my face gently and with greater force while it was on.</li>
            <li> It has been safe for me and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good steamer for the price.</li>
            <li> But again, this product is not a bad buy...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, very straight forward.</li>
            <li> It produces steam almost instantly, is 100% effective, and it easy to store when not in use.</li>
            <li> After one use I was astonished at how smooth and glowing my face was, and kept touching my cheeks all day to feel how soft they were!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it is also good for a facial sauna, but truthfully, I have only used it for sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I am happy I purchased this one instead of the other brand.</li>
            <li> I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features.</li>
            <li> Put towel over you head and a big bowl of hot water is lot more effective than this.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little sauna, I use it twice a week and it cleans my skin so nicely</li>
            <li> Your skin get so clean and firm after you steam clean it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the different facial saunas/steamers, and the Conair was the best value (at $22/free shipping), with the two attachments, and some extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with the facial cleaner brush, but the system itself is okay.</li>
            <li> and this facial sauna with the smaller alternative cone fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Steam is adequate.  </li>
            <li> , that is super acne-prone.</li>
            <li> QUICK SUMMARY:</li>
            <li> It delivered really quickly, and everything was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a product that will most likely be used more by women than men, and the face cup seems to be designed with that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great value, creates a gentle steam facial quickly, as well as having a separate attachment for inhalation therapy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a facial steamer and it heats up fast and gives out a great amount of steam.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.. highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s a good idea to make a facial massage with this steamer, but there&#x27;s no enough steam produce, and you should be very close to it to feel some warm and steam!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in new condition and on time, it&#x27;s light weight and very portable, easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quick shipment and the facial sauna itself.  </li>
            <li> After the first week I had this huge sore on my nose.</li>
            <li> maybe other people got more use of it, but for me I didnt see any spectacular results....</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, but it works.</li>
            <li> It works great, Iv&#x27;e let boil down to no water at all and haven&#x27;t been splashed or scalded in any way.  </li>
            <li> The warm up takes a few minutes (make sure you have the water in before turning it on because doing the opposite may not produce a good steam before the beep).  </li>
            <li> I received a new item, and it love it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, very comfortable while using, and I get a facial with each treatment...</li>
            <li> What a real treat to have this facial sauna in my own home!  </li>
            <li> I wanted something more portable and durable than using a pot.&lt;br /&gt;Works alright, steam rises to a good temperature.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 3 stars is because it&#x27;s small,</li>
            <li> The dual cones are very helpful, it has adjustable settings, and is just easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> The timer works pretty good also and it can be turned on only after the water has reached its temperature.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It is EXACTLY like products out there that cost over $300!</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I&#x27;m not really the spa-going type, and I wanted to steam my face more effectively than standing over a sink with hot water and a towel over my head.</li>
            <li> Just to add more effect to your steam facial treatment :) I set the timer on 10 minutes first time and it did work.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> The extension that comes with the one I got is great for sinus issues (mine came with that little cylinder extension and a rotating scrub brush).</li>
            <li> I fell for the few good reviews given for this product, which claimed it was so good that it made the skin smooth in just a single use, and Blah Blah Blah..</li>
            <li> This does a great job exfoliating dead skin and opening your pores.</li>
            <li> The facial steamer delivers amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Been going on a few months and the heating element still works great.  </li>
            <li> Now, I really don&#x27;t think I have a huge face...</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t really enjoy having to put my head in the plastic area to really get the benefit of any steam.  </li>
            <li> It will be useful for what i am going to use it for.</li>
            <li> For starters,the steam does not come out powerfully</li>
            <li> It is nice to put essential oils in the water for added relaxation.</li>
            <li> Does not produce enough steam to even be effective.</li>
            <li> I take me a nice relaxing facial so soothing</li>
            <li> Conair personal care products are of good quality and reasonably priced..</li>
            <li> My facial sauna came on vacation with me and my hostess loved it so much that I bought her one as a thank you gift.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a nice extra.     </li>
            <li> After started using, we realized that it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> The timer is useful</li>
            <li> I find that it has the same effect then even if you are not all the way on the facialtube, good to know for people with bigger faces, in addition to that I find it even more relaxing to steam away in the darkness under the towel-</li>
            <li> That is until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s. :-)    </li>
            <li> you don&#x60;t want to take it completely off :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for nearly a year now, no problems ~ and people asks me how I get my skin to look so healthy..</li>
            <li> and it is working, it is working as good as the spa one was working minus $70 every time i use it.</li>
            <li> It is a great to steam bath your face before a facial at home or just to clear your sinuses....</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could do at home steam spa treatments which would be moisturizing and help my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li> but it is nice to use at home to open up your pores.</li>
            <li> I put on some nice relaxing music and let the facial sauna do its thing.</li>
            <li> I used it with my facial scrub and it gives a nice fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  thing to have for the facial routine.</li>
            <li> B00005A9WP Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna With Timer]] is a nice product for steaming your face.  </li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial steamer.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it, Face feels nice and soft and getting all them impurities out of your pores is a plus,  </li>
            <li> The unit is worth the money tho.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you were getting it to help clear sinuses or something it would be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for the nasal steamer but really liked what the facial sauna was doing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have distiller water at the moment but for the purpose of this test run I used warm faucet water, but will use distiller water for all future use!</li>
            <li> price and comes with a useful brush as well.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> and i love brush soft and exfoliating</li>
            <li> need to have for every woman, after you use it, your skin fresh like a baby skin,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Steamer is useful for face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes only 30ml water at a time, however it runs for a good 10 minutes or so with just that much water.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> The low speed is too low to get any good use out of it and the high is better, but you have to use it really lightly.</li>
            <li> I love how convenient &amp; user friendly this facial sauna is.</li>
            <li> It runs out of water pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t get a lot of steam.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and allows you to steam your face pretty well.</li>
            <li> The brush itself comes with two attachments (the sponge, which you use after the face sauna, and the brush which you can use daily or however many times a week to keep your pores clean).</li>
            <li> The one smaller in diameter is great for helping clear sinuses, the larger one for giving facial pores a good \\&quot;sweat bath.\\&quot;  A fine addition to my health and beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful...just the right size.....</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I have to say that I would have given this product 5 starts, however the timer didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Price is right.  </li>
            <li> I returned it right away.</li>
            <li> When doing this, the item does achieve what I want, although they should make the front part of the large cone a little taller and the edge more comfortable so you can TRULY rest your face on the rim, without searing your nose :)</li>
            <li> Provides warm moist heat and works exactly as advertised to open pores and invigorate skin.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this system and it really works!!</li>
            <li> After about two and a half months of usage, three times a week, I can say this is an excellent facial sauna.</li>
            <li> The Facial Sauna is compact, light weight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sure you could use a towel, but wetting towels over and over again and washing them versus leaning over this machine that continuously creates steam and is easy to empty and fill....</li>
            <li> A facial sauna, nasal sauna and a spin brush all in one package for less than $25 is great!!!</li>
            <li> Although little more steam would have been better.</li>
            <li> ( I think I look a little younger too, LOL !)</li>
            <li> i used to use one of these long time ago this product has bring back those days lol great , small, flexible, and get a pretty quick result</li>
            <li> I needed something to open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;The massaging sponge &amp; brush is great too especially with cleasing lotion/cream etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy enough with this unit and its results that I will continue using it several times a week.</li>
            <li> I have found the Conair Facial Sauna to be a great item that I have now used numerous times.</li>
            <li> The sauna works perfectly and only takes a few minutes for the water to start boiling.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for strong steaming action, this is NOT the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is great for sauna but not as a facial tool.</li>
            <li> Good construction, simple use and clean up plus includes a battery powered facial brush.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it had more of a chin rest instead of the hard hot plastic</li>
            <li> and is pretty good, However, if you use this for first time, you have to be very patient because it looks the acne nerver end out of your face, this happen only the first time after that it is much easier the frequenly of using this machine depends of your sking in my case</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t put out much steam, and wasn&#x27;t very hot.</li>
            <li> This is a good steamer but The water will evaporate fast, water with drip out the steamer so if your careful hot water will get on you.</li>
            <li> 2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet.</li>
            <li> Okay, right off the bat, this thing is tiny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t produce very much steam.</li>
            <li> I very much recommend this for any household.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very fast.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, thanks!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I ordered this product but soon found that it didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clear my pores somewhat and my face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad at all actually and the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t steaming at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting married this fall</li>
            <li> and this product is an excellent alternative to expensive salon facials.</li>
            <li> It is an OK, but not really necessary.....</li>
            <li> I wonder why they put a non-working part on the device to fool around in the first place.</li>
            <li> I used mine as a sinus vaporizer and with the small cone supplier it really did a great job.</li>
            <li> Gets a bit too hot.</li>
            <li> Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.</li>
            <li> All in all, it did the job of cleansing her facial pores in a grand manner.</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you&#x27;re willing to risk it I&#x27;d say this seems to be an affective device.  </li>
            <li> The facial brush is okay.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this.</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied-</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted, at an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, no complains here!</li>
            <li> Remove my blackheads qick ;)</li>
            <li> My face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t producing enough steam, that I was wondering if I should stick my face deeper into the mask to get more steam or to even just feel it.      </li>
            <li> The nasal cone is what I use most, but if I ever want to use the face cone I put a towel over my head as it helps with an actual &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; experience on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sinuses opened and my face looked better at the same time.</li>
            <li> The sauna system works more like a humidifier rather than a facial sauna.</li>
            <li> and they just wouldn&#x27;t come out, Having had facials before i knew that they use hot steam before extraction.</li>
            <li> We rushed her to the emergency room where she had first degree burns.  </li>
            <li> It was a replacement for a Conair I purchased 20 years ago from Marshall Fields in Chicago;)).  </li>
            <li> ... buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it;)).</li>
            <li> I use my electric teapot to pour some hot water into it, hit the power button, and it starts steaming a minute or so thereafter.  </li>
            <li> its not too hot.</li>
            <li> I really love the price + the facial brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> but I use this way more now (especially since I have since replaced it with a clarisonic!)</li>
            <li> love this product,I am a licensed esthetician and I love using this on myself it open not only my pores but</li>
            <li> Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Save your money and to a real sauna!</li>
            <li> fast shipping used once so far loved it had one when I was a teen  </li>
            <li> Love this facial sauna!</li>
            <li> Regardless of what others say, when used correctly this unit produces hot steam and plenty of it.</li>
            <li> I think I like the pan of hot water and a towel over the head better than this, actually.</li>
            <li> Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li> The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap.</li>
            <li> This thing gets way too hot</li>
            <li> and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was just replacing my first Conair that I had for over 10 years and that exfoliating brush is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I use this for first time,.</li>
            <li> and there is more then enough room (safety space) between your face and the hot water.   </li>
            <li> Ok I suppose for the short run.</li>
            <li> The steam coming from that is not that efficient and when I use face brush I felt very pain but worth for  the price</li>
            <li> This inexpensive steamer worked pretty well for about six months.</li>
            <li> The day after I used this I went to work the next day and many people asked me what I had done.</li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the angle of this.&lt;br /&gt;They should have made the part where your face goes in on more of a slant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It steams really hot.  </li>
            <li> it didnt get hot at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that nice.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it includes a cylindrical cup in which to pour the water to the exact amount required.  </li>
            <li> Many will find that the steam helps not only with skin care but also with opening the sinuses.  </li>
            <li> and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Thanks CONAIR!</li>
            <li> Many years ago I owned a facial sauna</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin immediately after my first use.</li>
            <li> and it was hot.  </li>
            <li> I love the conair facial sauna.</li>
            <li> it really.. if i had say about it, is that the brush powerful</li>
            <li> Steam is pretty hot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a real treat!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to seasoned beauty veterans and first timers alike.</li>
            <li> then I recommend that you buy a higher end product.  </li>
            <li> and it is supposed to give off heat, but it gets really hot if you don&#x27;t move your face around.</li>
            <li> It does do its job for sure which is to open your pores.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions exactly</li>
            <li> I love my conair facial steamer.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes longer than a few minutes to warm up, but once it is steaming full strength it works miracles.</li>
            <li> You can also add a couple of drops of your favorite essential oils to help you relax or aid in the clearing of problem skin.</li>
            <li> Add the water before putting the blue top on - otherwise it sort of pours out here and there.  </li>
            <li> I decided to test the product out and try all the features to make sure it is operating properly.</li>
            <li> So overall, after just using the unit for 4 minutes, 2 minutes facial and 2 minutes nasal, I&#x27;m already loving the product!</li>
            <li> make sure that there is enough water as described and things will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Steam gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I used it a lot at first, ut now it is just sitting on a storage shelf.f.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST ORDER WITH AMAZON AND BEING A SENIOR AND NOT COMPUTER SAVVY</li>
            <li> Followed instructions exactly and</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use this more than ten minutes and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> The temperature is borderline too hot, but it is tolerable and hasn&#x27;t caused any burns .</li>
            <li> First time trying this type of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for a few months now and use it weekly, it produces a good amount of steam for a $20 steamer, you can amplify it with a towel over your head.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my face feels and looks good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE CONAIR FACIAL SAUNA CAME RATHER QUICKLY, PACKAGED SECURELY.  </li>
            <li> but really all this is is boiling water right in front of your face.</li>
            <li> I used it right away, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It starts to steam quickly, can last a half hr+, comes with great attachments and has a convenient timer.</li>
            <li> B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] may deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas.  </li>
            <li> B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] may deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas.  </li>
            <li> The brush was too soft to clean, and if you tried to run it on hi, (or sometimes on lo)</li>
            <li> love how easy this is to use  --  once or twice a week really improves my skin and clears trouble spots</li>
            <li> after using the sauna wash ur face with ur fav face wash and see how soft and clean ur face feels and looks afterwords..</li>
            <li> So glad I got the sauna for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Does the job for us, heats up fast and has a wide range of settings that come in handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the facial attachment, and also the sinus attachment - and have had nice, soft pores</li>
            <li> Very helpful to maintain healthy glow and helps to get rid of acnes.it should be used regularly .I</li>
            <li> good enough for home/ personal use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but after using the sauna my face felt really clear like it could breath and then to scrub it with the brush and wash it after my face felt clean and after that twice of using it i saw some good inprovements my face got more clear of dark spots and pore got smaller.</li>
            <li> It certainly does not wor as effectively as some other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> Easy and simple to use, makes it much easier to get the junk out of your pores!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does exactly what I want for a facial system.</li>
            <li> Somewhere along the way, I lost my first one, and I really missed having it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than using a pan of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li> my pores were ready and willing to release all of the blackheads and junk.</li>
            <li> it may not be as convenient as the purmist ,  as it has too sit flat, but its much cheaper and works, I feel, better.</li>
            <li> and i found that using a pot with a towel is just as good, if not better, i used this product once.</li>
            <li> Not fazed since I usually get good service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My product though barely was hot (warm) enough to make any steam</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it is that I can sit down instead of hovering over a stove and don&#x27;t have to worry about inhaling gas from the stove.</li>
            <li> The brush was way too soft to do much of anything, it took a long time to warm up, and once it did the steam wasn&#x27;t consistent.  </li>
            <li> and but it takes special effort to set it up and complete the whole process so its one of those things you think you&#x27;ll use all the time</li>
            <li> The additional accessories are very nice extra that are not offered with other machines.</li>
            <li> This product is very effective &amp; affordable for the amount you receive compared to the other facial steamers out there!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and it works as a  personal inhaler too.</li>
            <li> overall, I think it&#x27;s functional, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Its a v. basic no frills model that is v. easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall it is easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> Regular use of the Conair steamer helps to loosen the mucus and enables me to breathe more normally.  </li>
            <li> I should have spent more and purchased a higher quality product.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you dry the unit well before storing to avoid calcification of metal parts.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to get some relief that I could get in the shower or in a closed bathroom with the hot water steaming up the room.  </li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The facial sauna is great for steam but the add-ons like the exfoliating brush and sponge for moisturizer are not useful.</li>
            <li> And the steam isn&#x27;t even strong enough.</li>
            <li> My head is large, dont know how to explain..</li>
            <li> My face certainly felt softer after using.</li>
            <li> I had a rather large zit on my face (that I thought might have been a cyst</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try the DIY method first, or I would have realized it does a completely sufficient job (and actually a better job).</li>
            <li> This facial Sauna works fine..</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  </li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller, completion clearer, and fine lines diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for sinus relief but tried out all attachments and this thing performs!</li>
            <li> Works amazing for my little spa&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and the water in my building doesnt get hot enough to really clean your face.  </li>
            <li> (fill up the little included cup and pour into the bottom, then turn on the switch) and works great to open nasal passages when we can&#x27;t breath (just put a towel over our head to keep in moisture).</li>
            <li> This little sauna is great for opening up your facial pores.  </li>
            <li> It is too time consuming to screw on and off the large top clear plastic portion of the facial sauna when not in use.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years that we used religiously but somehow misplaced in a move, so we happily repurchased.</li>
            <li> Very neat and fast execution of the order by the seller!Goods very well-proven.</li>
            <li> There is a very noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well with lots of extras.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for a teenager to control acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t put out that much steam.</li>
            <li> You almost have to put your face really close to the bottom to feel any type of steam.</li>
            <li> It was working really well and held alot of water</li>
            <li> The manufacturer really needs to improve their technology.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> well, i was really looking for a face steam</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t care so much for the timer.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> which I found not doing much at all.</li>
            <li> I think it will work very well with all the clogged noses we will have in winter.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> the item does what I need it to, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it.</li>
            <li> take up too much counter space</li>
            <li> shut off gives forgetful people like me peace of mind:) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can imagine how much steam it can generate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and moved around different areas, and that is what this sauna does!</li>
            <li> I have had my whole life, and I am 69 now.</li>
            <li> It comes with an exfoliating brush, which is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much because I keep forgeting I have it.</li>
            <li> I like the pampering I can do at home with this just as much as going out to spa.---</li>
            <li> That makes it a real money($) saver.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and generates a ton of steam.</li>
            <li> The steam was just too much</li>
            <li> and I can see much improvement of her face....</li>
            <li> we really like the brush...  </li>
            <li> Well his conclusion is, if you stick your face so much deeper, you could burn your nose.      </li>
            <li> The steam isn&#x27;t a lot, it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to wait for 10 min.</li>
            <li> I got more than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> It also really helped daughter with acne.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> Works really well with opening pores.</li>
            <li> timer works very well too</li>
            <li> I know its not costly, just 21 bucks but still, its supposed to produce freaking steam, which it does very miserly.     </li>
            <li> Most of these units will probably work as described, but be careful if you hear a noise like the water is boiling.  </li>
            <li> It heats up in 3 minutes and beeps to let you know when it&#x27;s ready for you to steam your face.  </li>
            <li> my whole face doesn&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So  like I&#x60;ve said - product works very well</li>
            <li> With the towel and music ready, pour the boiling water into the bowl</li>
            <li> or you are simply ready to finish (I recommend three to seven minutes)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t really need them</li>
            <li> Very relaxing way to spend a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very therapeutic and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the Alba papaya peel and it work really well.</li>
            <li> really could feel my pores opening thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really use the brush that came with this, but I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> The brush accessory I do not use as much, but I do like the softer bristles.  </li>
            <li> I dont use any of these things as much</li>
            <li> It really helps dissolve oil and plugged pores.</li>
            <li> i just don&#x27;t use it much after 1-2 uses..</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to clear up and when combined with my Olay skincare it is looking a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> She said it makes a lot of steam and is gentle.</li>
            <li> The instructions...or lack there of...was/is a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Also putting the towel over the head really helps.</li>
            <li> I got it as u  decribe it thanks</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s if anyone wants it.  </li>
            <li> It started clearing his face up fast.</li>
            <li> When the buzzer sounds to let you know it is ready, it is not.</li>
            <li> My face is so much clearer and smoother</li>
            <li> the delivery very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> already used,  my skin feel very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> u so much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t kick out as much steam as I want it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that safety timer, it tells you when it&#x27;s ready, it comes with two cones to choose from.</li>
            <li> This definately makes your face feel much softer and helps rid it of impurities.</li>
            <li> Some days it steams really well and</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It feels very soothing and the steam doesn&#x27;t burn your face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how it practically shrunk my pimples and made my face feel fresh &amp; if every pore is alive.</li>
            <li> Better system than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all really well priced too.  </li>
            <li> I tossed the whole unit eventually</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading this.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting a towel over my head  - which defeats the whole purpose of having this device.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and filled the reservoir up to the max fill line, placed the facial nozzle on and plugged the unit in.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> when you have a cold, this is an excellent way to help your throat and sinuses.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this really targets the front of my face and not the sides.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing as well.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Overall, its okay if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want too much steam.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap and does open up my pours.</li>
            <li> And fast shipped...</li>
            <li> VERY helpful for nose and throat &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> One thing I would say is a con is that it does not seem to get your forehead very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was looking at proactiv as a last resort, but thought I should try something more natural.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even put green tea or any kind of herbs in it.</li>
            <li> Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle.  </li>
            <li> I wud have preferred to pay 50-60 bucks for a nice product then waste 21 on something I&#x27;m might trash.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to warm up but it works.</li>
            <li> Awsome ,cleared my acne up in a week chemical free , best and only thing that worked for me.other products only made it worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results are better by far than devices that cost triple (including the Clairisonic facial scrubber).</li>
            <li> (nothing better then a professional facial</li>
            <li> Not enough for an effective facial steam.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Conair facial steamer and liked it very much even though the water reservoir was more shallow</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Its very useful and simple to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, the BEST way to get the most out of this product, is to throw a LARGE towel OVER your head and AROUND the unit as to create a steam TENT, and get your face as CLOSE the the base of the unit as possible without BURNING your nostrils ;)</li>
            <li> The size is large enough for most people with small to medium sized faces, though many will have to adjust their heads side to side to get even steaming all around.  </li>
            <li> My main reason for purchasing the unit was to help with the large clogged pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> Brush is very soft and work pretty well.</li>
            <li> It works really well and actually makes your skin look really clean.</li>
            <li> Works really well to open your pores up so you can clean them out when done.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought this only for the face brush</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I think I will try adding a couple drops of eucalyptus oil to see if that helps even more.</li>
            <li> The heat settings could have been a little higher for more effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have many scars on my face due to pimples, i wanted to use this before the derma roller.</li>
            <li> I found that the other product was built with quite cheap workmanship and it also could very easily burn a person if one wasn&#x27;t ever so careful.  </li>
            <li> Mine got old enough to replace with a new one, but could not find anything else better and so order it again.</li>
            <li> Ok - for those who want to do a general facial sauna.</li>
            <li> I can see the actual difference in the amount of residue that shows up when I hand clean and when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li> I went there for a deep pores clean.</li>
            <li> B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad]].  </li>
            <li> B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad]].  </li>
            <li> my wife and i use this regularly to keep our face clean</li>
            <li> Using to clean my sinuses and especially around this time of year it&#x27;s a life saver.  </li>
            <li> Amazon return services will only cover $15 of the return shipping cost and the cost of shipping this item (which is very large) back to Amazon will cost more than what I paid for the item and the shipping costs as I live in Australia.</li>
            <li> good enough for the money paid; but by far not producing as much steam as expected.</li>
            <li> If you have ever gotten a true facial before you would know that they don&#x27;t just drown your face with the steam</li>
            <li> She used the facial steamer and then a lot of masks, which i am sure they were expensive and good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired and get up pretty early.</li>
            <li> It looks bigger in the picture, and the box was pretty small, but it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> There is a pretty loud beep that alerts you when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> The face brush includes two small heads for cleaning and moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t seem extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoyed giving each other facials!</li>
            <li> I add some essential oils to the little bowl and the steam is a good temp with towel over head.</li>
            <li> Which is probably how you&#x27;re supposed to exfoliate, but I use a bead wash and need a little more pressure to really work it up and exfoliate the area.</li>
            <li> I was a new person !</li>
            <li> Forget doctors for sinus, forget the salon for better skin and way less acne...</li>
            <li> It does not really get warm enough to steam your face.</li>
            <li> Conair Facial Sauna has helped my sinuses tremendously.</li>
            <li> Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I only use the Olay.  </li>
            <li> i love using this before i use a face mask, let it open up my pores so they can get in deep.</li>
            <li> Also, my personal recommendation - I would probably not use brush to exfoliate your facial skin more often than once in a week or two.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for my sinus problem.</li>
            <li> With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM.</li>
            <li> the heating bowl actually heats up fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> The unit works well for sinus but for the facial, the heat is too mild.</li>
            <li> Decent amount of steam is produced quickly&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water barely boils, to get a good steam I put a towel over my head when using the wide facial steamer.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the very first time while doing my weekly mini facial.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small to cover whole face,  timer is only good for 15 minutes and not help...</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not so high quality of the brush but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations or hopes were too high</li>
            <li> have prohibitively high price</li>
            <li> have prohibitively high price tags.    </li>
            <li> No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> When i purchased this item little more then a month ago it was 20 bucks even</li>
            <li> The unit little water, requiring most people to refill it to finish a session&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another</li>
            <li> If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another product.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who didn&#x27;t mind spending a little more time about once a week helping their skin out.</li>
            <li> This is very good for kids when they have cold.  </li>
            <li> You kind of have to pull your face back a little bit, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> This is quick easy and very little water needed so no mess.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle but</li>
            <li> As for me, I use a towel to completely cover and go very close to the sauna</li>
            <li> I suffer from sinusitis on a frequent basis and the steamer really helps.</li>
            <li> I have been frustrated with my skin for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t find the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> Although it does make steam, it&#x27;s too hot to bare with no control.</li>
            <li> I suggest adding a few drops of your favorite oils.</li>
            <li> Please understand that this isn&#x27;t as powerful as a day spa facial machine.</li>
            <li> I bought this because for few months I could not use the stove top.  </li>
            <li> This is better then picking at your face everyday and damaging your skin.</li>
            <li> A nice product for least price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my face and oily skin, this leaves my skin feeling fresh, and it definitely keeps blemishes off my face, and it helped me get rid of a sty of of my eye.</li>
            <li> Extra sinus attachment may be useful for some&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> Both the normal steamer or sinus attachment help to relieve congestion</li>
            <li> B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]] is probably worth looking into.  </li>
            <li> B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]] is probably worth looking into.  </li>
            <li> After steaming for 15 minutes a day, withing 3 days I was breathing normally again.</li>
            <li> : Put a towel over your head to get the most steam trapped on your face before whatever it is you&#x27;re going to do.</li>
            <li> Gets hot leaves my face wet, i actually have to pull away from it before time because it does get super hot.</li>
            <li> The Conair Facial Sauna system was properly packaged; shipped quickly; easy to use and set up.  </li>
            <li> Since I have received this, I have NOT had a single headache and that is remarkable, since I usually get 3 sinus headaches a month!&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes i&#x27;d feel the steam on the right side and sometimes on the left.</li>
            <li> I use it to open my up my pores right before I use a peel away gel mask.  </li>
            <li> Not professional by any means but adequate for home.  </li>
            <li> The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam</li>
            <li> The only benefit was the electric facial brush which works fine.</li>
            <li> My only thought is that a little longer cord would be nice.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is a matter of acclimating to a new product.</li>
            <li> For the price i am paying for it, i can live with that.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still brand new basically, but I am going to give it away</li>
            <li> I returned it and was sent a new one.</li>
            <li> As a huge fan of taking care of my skin through natural means, I was really looking forward to this product but it let me down.</li>
            <li> I got it because it was cheap, but one of my most questionable purchases.</li>
            <li> Finally, the product is a big rip off, if the manufactor wanted someone to enjoy it they would have made a product that is productive.</li>
            <li> I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System.</li>
            <li> I use this system everyday for my own personal spa day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The higher flow of steam coming from a whole bowl, rather than the Conair&#x27;s small heated surface area, does a faster and much more complete job to open up your pores.</li>
            <li> have a big face and it doesn&#x27;t fit in properly.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li> I was worried at first by other reviews of it not getting hot enough, but it produces the right amount of steam and heat.</li>
            <li> me say that I have very sensitive, oily skin</li>
            <li> This product is excellant for individuals who have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> very little steam better than none</li>
            <li> I think sticking your head over a bowl of hot water would do the same job as this.</li>
            <li> I was scared every second that hot water will splash into my face.</li>
            <li> Second, the amount of steam coming for the unit is like a cup of hot coffee.</li>
            <li> The first time i used the steamer, I put a towel on my head following the advice in the manual.</li>
            <li> Even at this price I am experiencing professional results!  </li>
            <li> The steam is pretty stationary and only moves while you exhale from your nose.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product along with another more expensive steamer tjat was more concentrated</li>
            <li> when using the sauna it got really hot twice and on the third try</li>
            <li> My first one did not have the facial brush, so this was an added treat!</li>
            <li> and I usually put a towel draped over my head and the sauna system to keep the steam enclosed to get a better pore-opening steam.</li>
            <li> This surprised me because I didn&#x27;t think it would help,  but it does!  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, after ten minutes of steaming in this facial sauna (i put a towl over the back of my head to keep trap even more steam)</li>
            <li> Small cup holder but steam is ok.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that the Secura would have had better steam</li>
            <li> I think you can get the same results with hot water running in a sink, lowering your head with a towel over your head....</li>
            <li> This Product works as I expected and as advertised, which is true of all Conair products.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product when I was pregnant and was having some serious sinus problems.</li>
            <li> The manual instructs you to clean your face PRIOR to using the facial sauna.</li>
            <li> Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses</li>
            <li> Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses</li>
            <li> the amount of water it holds is too less, and the steam is too light, like water vapor.</li>
            <li> The Conair - Moisturizing Mist Facial Sauna System with Timer is at most an average product.</li>
            <li> I had to put a towel over my head to confine the steam to stay in one place long enough to open my pores better.</li>
            <li> I read the review about this product making the hot water explode into face, with no apparent reaction time to get away from device.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to use a facial steamer for a long time, personally I suggest you should consider investing in a better model or something.</li>
            <li> so you have to sit like for a long time for it to be effective.and its kind of wide and short</li>
            <li> Given this problem, however, the old-fashion method of boiling a pot of water and covering your head with a towel is probably more effective, and certainly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and get something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad some people are getting what they need out of this product, but my story is a little different.</li>
            <li> It also helps to clear my nasal passages.</li>
            <li> The steam is fast and helps open the pores and clear your skin.</li>
            <li> I even used it to clear up my sinuses</li>
            <li> and he sat there with it to clear up his sinuses.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have been using boiling water in pot so far, but I find this product to be very convenient way of doing steam facial.</li>
            <li> The unit is a bit bigger than the old one and heats faster, I also really like the timer.</li>
            <li> Need to run it awhile to clear congestion.</li>
            <li> Let me clear your doubts, the water is never boiling (bubbling)</li>
            <li> Daughter has added it to her regimen to treat her acne, it is helping to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li> I have used steamers for facials before, cheap ones too, but this one was the most disappointing of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Technically you could boil a pot of water and stick your head over it, but this way is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I have had my face steamed during a facial and it was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> My mom bought one back in the 80s that really steams and did the job.</li>
            <li> and my skin was so soft after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> inhale deeply for about 3-5 minutes, then blow your nose gently, and all those irritants and particles will come out.</li>
            <li> One family member developed permanent health problems from over-reliance on things like prescription drugs &amp; Tylenol Sinus, when natural options like this are faster, safer, and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really recommended to anyone who wants deep facial cleaning, but also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have am a 33 year old man with ache on my chin area and have some problems with the hair growing on that area too.</li>
            <li> Works very well, simple to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot and not something you can stay under for a long while.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of professional facials</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sinus problems and so far it seems to help.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it work fast</li>
            <li> I always put a towel over my head just to keep in as much steam as possible.</li>
            <li> and I did not find the beep too loud.</li>
            <li> Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> It has to be refilled frequently.</li>
            <li> I am used to steaming my face the old fashion way, boil some water, cover with a towel and steam as needed.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li> this product was bought for some sauna action</li>
            <li> and so far i have used it 4 times without any problems.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to heat up and the steam wasn&#x27;t all that hot.</li>

            <li> Our daughter said that she much prefers this facial sauna system to either of our products.</li>
            <li> but I feel that I can get the exact same result simply being in a hot shower/bath to open up my pores....</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li> before I hop into bed and my pores are open and ready for any creams or serums you may collect--especially those pricy</li>
            <li> My face instantly looked much firmer and glowing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to give my boyfriend &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; facials since his skin is  sensitive and he tends to get a lot of blackheads</li>
            <li> and I really surprised.  </li>
            <li> -- my boyfriend has sinus problems and uses the smaller cone for steaming and it really helps for a while.</li>
            <li> The direction warn you to not place your face directly ON the unit but to hover over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Facial Spin Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The spin brush looked very simple and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it.</li>
            <li> A side benefit of steaming my sinuses is that it has made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smaller cone for nasal congestion.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care professional and wanted something to use at home.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with breakouts, breathing, and overall look of skin!</li>
            <li> The bottom barely got hot enough to create steam.</li>
            <li> I have used this facial steamer a few times, and I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I like to add a few drops of essential oils to the water for an even more relaxing experience.</li>
            <li> The steam is just right--not too hot, yet effective--although I had to put my face down into the opening in order to really get the benefit.</li>
            <li> The first one arrived &amp; the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It requires very little water and the water heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Returned as easy as usual with amazon.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a month, but so far, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Steamer comes with a little cup to fill the right amount of water in the steamer!</li>
            <li> But this particular one only hold about 1/8 cup of water.</li>
            <li> and I was only really interested in the facial steam function.  </li>
            <li> The main issue I have with it, is it doesn&#x27;t put out NEARLY enough steam and FORCE with the steam for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I am an older man and maybe still alittle vain from my younger years.</li>
            <li> However to have a decent lasting steam, you&#x27;ll have to continually adding water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if larger units that hold more water for steaming are sold here.  </li>
            <li> Some said it didn&#x27;t produce enough steam or it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Also - what goes very nicely with this set is to get a small bottle of Essential oils (I use 10ml peppermint with just a few drops)</li>
            <li> but I used it today with a little bit of Lush&#x27;s facial stuff that you put in a pot for steaming and it worked just fine; no damage to the unit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend wearing a headband and tilting your head back at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $100 before on facial steamer and yes, more expensive, works better</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a high and low option on the side of the unit.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a cheaper alternative to the pricier systems that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> mean its ok generally but</li>
            <li> The little derma machine included is a cute bonus, but I can do the same thing with a mini face brush with more accuracy and less mess +</li>
            <li> it takes two batterys and you can use any facial cleaner and use the brush to scrub it in more its not to soft and not to hard.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible sinus congestion and the Conair helped greatly to keep my nose free and clear</li>
            <li> The container to hold water is so small that it can fit your tears when you cry!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> as well, not a good face fit, and feels like too hot temperature, but can play around it with a towel over the head and just hovering above it.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial sauna after my first visit, to a SPA, in USA for a deep pore cleansing where i was very desappointed because my face was looking the same after the facial and after $70 payed.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but using harsh astringents really just makes you skin produce more oil to combat being dried out.</li>
            <li> Take a few minutes to heat up to full steam.</li>
            <li> The level of steam is so low, so small and the overall setup is so ineffective that you are better off just using a regular but good quality humidifier and sticking your head down where the steam comes off (within a few inches so you don&#x27;t burn your skin or anything).</li>
            <li> The face thing should be wider, and because of this I&#x27;m often uncomfortable from trying to twist my face in a certain position, to make sure it gets some steam.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product i was concerned about the safety issue since someone had posted that the blue neck is not long enough and it might be too close to the hot water.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the secondary cone which directs the steam more to the nose area than the entire face.</li>
            <li> The cup doesn&#x27;t hold enough and at the constant boiling rate, the evaporation is too fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not big enough to steam your whole face.</li>
            <li> The face brush doesn&#x27;t produce enough friction to really perform deep cleaning</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if I like the facial brush or not as I bought a Calrisonic and use that instead, but I will say that I like using the sauna to steam my face before putting a mask on and occasionally after I put on moisturizer to really let it seep into my pores.</li>
            <li> I put a mask on directly afterwards to complete my facial.</li>
            <li> a sudden - had to return the product and ask for a refund which the amazon guys did - Big THANKS to them for helping me</li>
            <li> Is like a real sauna for your face, ill use once in a week&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this product :)</li>
            <li> Also, the nasal sauna is good to clear nasal passages for a cold or flu.</li>
            <li> The facial scrubber bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> The face mask on this product fits awkwardly, I wish it was a little more comfortable since you really need to keep it on for awhile to work well.</li>
            <li> Since then, my throat has constricted and mucus gets stuck in my windpipe, causing major breathing problems.</li>
            <li> She used this sauna the first day it arrived and has used it almost every OTHER day since it arrived.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, it is just too small to steam your entire face at once, and it gets pretty hot, but not as hot as I would like.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to rely on Conair to produce quality products, but in the past several years the quality has definitely declined.</li>
            <li> This uit is easy to use and very effective for the cold weather and homes with less than average humidity--great for clearing nasal passages too.</li>
            <li> The unit has paid for itself many times over, furthermore, in lieu of the brutal reviews, simply return it; both Conair and Amazon are amazing when it comes to customer satisfaction on this front.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to maintaine an acne free skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars, because its hard to fit your face into it.</li>
            <li> It is a little hot if you put your face directly into the funnel and drape a towel over it like it says to.</li>
            <li> i dont see how is it possible that 15 ml water can burst up so high and get your face a third degree burnt.</li>
            <li> The Conair claims manager was rude and appeared as if she could care less that my wife experienced this due to their product.  </li>
            <li> You do not get the quality steaming as with the huge machines at the spa but at least here you do not have to bother with distilled water (referring to build up).</li>
            <li> When you have a cloged nose or just want to relax in general</li>
            <li> I have issues with cystic acne, and general oily skin.</li>
            <li> My wife was using it one day (as directed, water only) to try and clear up her sinuses.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I clear my sinuses, but I get a skin treatment.  </li>
            <li> That only thing I can say that i dislike about it is the loud beep it makes.</li>
            <li> i so far only used the face one.</li>
            <li> If purchased at a store, would be returning to see how to complete the above.    </li>
            <li> It takes nearly 10min to steam and the steam is also very low...</li>
            <li> I barely use the brush because it slings the face wash everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I only used it twice so far, so</li>
            <li> So if your goal is to open those pores to extract blackheads, save your money and use the old method of placing boiling water in a pot and cover your head with a towel.</li>
            <li> Quality of materials is average, though the first item that was delivered to us wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product as an alternative to a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> I barely touched it and a glob of blackhead stuff came out.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the big cone doesn&#x27;t really hold the steam well to actually steam your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from a spa experience and probably will not give you the same results as a professional facial, but it DOES work.  </li>
            <li> This facial sauna works well so far.</li>
            <li> It barely can circulate when pressure is applied to it.  </li>
            <li> The unit makes short of a hissing noise as the water boils, but it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I Was very surprise and got beyond what was expected.</li>
            <li> First, the product is smaller than what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The base stays cool even after using for 10-15 minutes &lt;br /&gt;-Produces effective amounts of steam to open pores and clear out the sinuses &lt;br /&gt;-Ability to set a timer is convenient</li>
            <li> I was kind of mad,wrong timing for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say as of yet that my skin is looking better, but I can say that the lines on my lips decreased dramatically after one session, and they looked plumper as well.</li>
            <li> So there is a little learning curve and you will leaned to move your face to the right angle in order to make the steam hit those spots.   </li>
            <li> I think I will get a better cleaning experience with the spinning feature breaking down the dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li> If you spend just a little time to clean and exfoliate your skin it will pay off in the long run</li>
            <li> So great for at home mini facials or for when you are sick or stuffed up with allergies</li>
            <li> First off this item seems great, but while using it the first time I couldn&#x27;t help being a little fearful that the water would somehow shoot up and burn my face/eyes.  </li>
            <li> She heard a &#x27;bubbling&#x27; and the unit exploded hot water on the lower half of her face.  </li>
            <li> Then the other day I heard one of my colleague&#x27;s wife had a burn by spilled boiling hot water while exercising the same.</li>
            <li> Due to a medical condition I cannot use decongestants, so I needed something to duplicate the congestion-busting effects of a hot shower (nothing against showers, but let&#x27;s face it:</li>
            <li> I usually break out every so often &amp; now I can see a tremendous change in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not great because it didn&#x27;t give enough steam as I expected from the facial sauna but for the money you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> might as well  make use of the whole benefit since it came with the other accessories.  </li>
            <li> One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I&#x27;m on drugs)to the point where they feel like they&#x27;re burning</li>
            <li> after five and so minutes the steam was turning too much for me (probably the steam volume you and other complaining costumer here want).</li>
            <li> But other than that which to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t care about...</li>
            <li> The facial brush that comes along with it is a little powerhouse cleaner, well worth the money of the two alone.  </li>
            <li> My wife always has a very stuffy nose with the onset of cold, and more so during the fall.</li>
            <li> The facial steamer and microdermabrasion tool have left me with an incredibly soft skin texture and appearance.  </li>
            <li> I like the timer feature so that I don&#x27;t have to think about how much time I am spending there, especially since you need to keep your eyes closed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The steamer DOES heat up in 3 minutes and lets you know with a peep that it&#x27;s done heating up, it does point out in the booklet though that it sometimes could take a couple of minutes more then 3 minutes to heat up, probably depending on how much water you put in, or how cold the water is you put in there to begin</li>
            <li> If you are still skeptical about buying this product, just go for it, it&#x27;s really worth it, and worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described, I wish it was made a little sturdier.  </li>
            <li> My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it just use with caution and be careful</li>
            <li> This facial sauna emits less steam than a hot cup of coffee.  </li>
            <li> It only took 3 days for the product to arrived, and the product was great too, but unfortunately, after few day I brought this product, I found out that this product had reduced its price to $17.45.....</li>
            <li> keeps the brush apparatus and the smaller components in the clear plastic container, positioned to the left of the facial sauna.</li>
            <li> Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impatient</li>
            <li> The Conair product works on the entire face without having to move around one small wand for full facial results.  </li>
            <li> I read a review when I ordered mine that indicated the water splashed out and burned someone, but I have had no problems with this on my first one and the one I ordered a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I found that the chin/mouth area got extremely hot for a few seconds and when it became unbearable I moved my face.</li>
            <li> I live up north, and my skin and sinuses get very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value overall &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> steam is too gentle and the water quantity it can hold is too less..</li>
            <li> It came with a thin, easy to understand and to the point</li>
            <li> The timer is not long enough to have any effects.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to everyone in a tight budget.</li>
            <li> It holds up very little water so dry up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and a little water makes steam for a long time.</li>
            <li> But then I didn&#x27;t pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get up the steam, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> We live in the south so pollen, mold and other allergens are almost always present.</li>
            <li> I had another similar type home unit in the past which was far better and am sorry I don&#x27;t still have it now, since no one seems to make any of high quality anymore.</li>
            <li> I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too!</li>
            <li> I mean is it really worth damaging me eye sight?</li>
            <li> Some have complained about it not working right-</li>
            <li> And if you want to stick you&#x27;re whole face in its unbelievably hot and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it and it is small enough to store without using much space...  </li>
            <li> steam is super weak.</li>
            <li> Anyways, if you are still looking for a decent steamer - go for JSB Steamer Vaporizer or any other product but certainly not Conair.</li>
            <li> So far i have not witnessed any hissing noises since i only use the machine for 15mins or under with still little water left in the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and was so excited to use it right away, only to get so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was just not good or worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, small, does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping that this product will last long.</li>
            <li> I felt that the steam won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I just hope it lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> Yet newer versions of the brush concept may not necessarily be better than a washcloth to gently clean away dead layers and dirt from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have noticed about this unit is that It stays warm even when the unit is turned off.  </li>
            <li> and I finally saw the water is all dry...</li>
            <li> expecting to have at least half of my face clean, but it didn&#x27;t happend.</li>
            <li> The water area is small and take a long time to steam and doesn&#x27;t put out much steam.</li>
            <li> Great for sinus issues, or common cold too....</li>
            <li> Three minutes of heavy breathing later, my sinuses are clear.  </li>
            <li> I DO NOT want to pay the $300 for the only other facial scrubber out there I have seen.  </li>
            <li> The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working.</li>
            <li> steam is not hot enough for  facial sauna.</li>
            <li> Finally, the number of creams and other cleansers that may achieve similar results without steaming is almost infinite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, the number of creams and other cleansers that may achieve similar results without steaming is almost infinite.    </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how little water it needed.</li>
            <li> The steam is just the right temperature.. not too weak not too scalding.  </li>
            <li> The plastic cone is an awkward size for most people, and it hurts my neck after 5 minutes of resting my face in it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to be harsh, since it might very well be only for me but the bottom-line is a crude cheap product which I WILL ADVICE to purchase if you&#x27;re looking for a simple model doing just that steaming to your face</li>
            <li> I even contacted the company about how much of a pain this is and they made suggestions that were common sense and things I had already tried.  </li>
            <li> In regards to the negative reviews, I really don&#x27;t get it at all...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I was desperate to find something, I purchased this product, and cannot emphasize how glad I am that I did.  </li>
            <li> The most disappointing part is the amount of steam.  </li>
            <li> this product is a waste of money and clutters the environment with useless items that are most likely thrown away..</li>
            <li> i love the way it make my face feels when i have a cold</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just lazy, I use it only two times so far since I have it for almost 1 year.</li>
            <li> I have not used the sauna part because of the caution not to use an extension cord &amp; I can&#x27;t find a place in my small apartment that is near enough (unless I kneel on the floor).  </li>
            <li> The product came in a lot sooner than I had expected especially during the holiday season.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> But only after a month it stopped working, its not meant to get wet at all, even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it.</li>
            <li> However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how long I have been steamed...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even waste your money and time trying to put your face near it for 15 mins or until u get neck</li>
            <li> and I am a  long time</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up and produce steam.</li>
            <li> Some said it wasn&#x27;t wide enough for the sides of their face.  </li>
            <li> , then you hit another button for the timer and it shuts off automatically after how ever long you have it set for.</li>
            <li> I just spent $30 on the olay face brush and it&#x27;s almost the same</li>
            <li> Not necessarily burn you but just be careful.</li>
            <li> it took me this long to discover it.  </li>
            <li> It came with a battery powered facial brush thing for exfoliating, which I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I&#x27;m curious to see if I like it.</li>
            <li> even though it says to use with your eyes closed, I&#x27;ve been using it with my eye open with no issues.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a small amount of water in the reservoir, but I got tired of the steam :-)</li>
            <li> I recommend putting the unit on a few phonebooks (if you don&#x27;t mind possibly spilling water on them) to ease have to bend your back and/or neck so far down.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not the &amp;#34;spa facial steam&amp;#34; experience</li>
            <li> it was so painful, large, and unyielding), so I decided to buy the steamer as a last resort after three days of trying all sorts of natural and not so natural remedies to bring all of the gunk to the surface.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product due to the review I read where the unit exploded and caused a woman facial burns.</li>
            <li> In comparison to others that I&#x27;ve own, it seems a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> this is the only product (prescription drugs included) that I have found that relieves my sinus pressure due to a deviated septum.  </li>
            <li> Steam is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> due to a medical condition I have.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As the other post mentioned, use a big towel.  </li>
            <li> I personally had to use it a little longer to actually feel that it was doing something.</li>
            <li> I have a teenage son that has extreme acne.</li>
            <li> all other products were about the same.</li>
            <li> and I just used it for the 3rd time the other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the smaller cone due to sinus problems.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m wondering how I ever lived without it for this long!</li>
            <li> I love this product and quite frankly I&#x27;m kinda mad</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and constantly struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, steam mainly concentrate on the center and that might be an issue for few.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have something to stop it automatically when it is dry...    </li>
            <li> one problem i have dry skin</li>
            <li> The shape is awkward to fit the face and you constantly need to rotate face for steam to reach sides of face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with my dry eye issue....</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed by my ENT doctor for my dry membranes.</li>
            <li> Tried it again a few days later, same result.  </li>
            <li> Every product is not going be exactly what your looking for at times, but this particular facial steamer is not that bad.</li>
            <li> This unit requires refills for a single session.  </li>
            <li> The rotating brush can be a little harsh for sensitive skin types but I only use it two times a week maybe three.</li>
            <li> Taking a shower six or seven times a day in order to clear a stuffy head is just NOT practical, not to mention the wasted water!)</li>
            <li> Face is clear and no more stuffy noses for me.</li>
            <li> I complained again, sent the second one back and finally tried the Conair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Difficult to position yourself for comfort and full coverage</li>
            <li> I left the spa very disappointed starting to look online for my own facial sauna</li>
            <li> I will buy this same one again if mine ever breaks down the road.</li>
            <li> The product is different from what I have expected, the steam is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> The only little con is that I don&#x27;t think the timer runs as long as it states on the dial (i.e. The seven minute cycle selection</li>
            <li> Please consider your purchase carefully if you live in a remote area as shipping costs for such a large item will make this item very difficult to return.</li>
            <li> it only steams the lower half of my face.  </li>
            <li> There is PLENTY of steam that comes out; I even had to back away a little bit.</li>
            <li> I only got it today and just used it, I was a little nervous after reading one review that stated &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> but I am a little nervous about having boiling (may not be boiling but is definitely hotter than my faucet</li>
            <li> To my surprise the facial exfoliating brush has been great for him too, and now that I have a bad cold, I am using the nasal steam several times a day.  </li>
            <li> The item turned itself on and off when used and after only a few uses the item now will not turn on.</li>
            <li> I put the lotion on it and it was rough trying to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> All in all money well spent.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s really no way to order a replacement.</li>
            <li> You cannot rest your head on the cone, because it is too wide.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> The results were as I expected for my facials.</li>
            <li> After that minimal steam.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get to close.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel like the steam was dispensing at as wide a range as I would like.</li>
            <li> As with anything giving off steam be careful</li>
            <li> Total waste of money</li>
            <li> well spent for some \\&quot;me\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li> Even though this is advertised as &#x27;wide&#x27; my face just fits</li>
            <li> Brush heads &amp; applicator not much yo speak of, won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Careful not to burn your face.</li>
            <li> it really is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> i thought i&#x27;d try again with this since it&#x27;s been a few years since i&#x27;d last owned one.</li>
            <li> too wide across.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering it from a different site to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Feels like a real facial sauna, but you have to have the time to sit with a towel over your head, which means you can&#x27;t read or watch TV for the few minutes you are supposed to allow.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS AS I HAD EXPECTED IT TO.</li>
            <li> The sponge felt rough on my exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> Produced minimal steam.</li>
            <li> but the concept was not very well implemented in this product.</li>
            <li> Everything was delivered on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> The steam from this is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I actually returned this facial because the water reservior was very small.</li>
            <li> The unit is smaller than I expected, but then again, not sure what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not hot to produce an expected effect on the face.</li>
            <li> I feel it is not very powerful but for the price it does the job.</li>
            <li> The facial cone is an awkward shape and maybe a little short, but it&#x27;s reasonable for one size fits all.</li>
            <li> The facial cone is an awkward shape and maybe a little short, but it&#x27;s reasonable for one size fits all.</li>
            <li> I waited a little long and they refused my return.</li>
            <li> Got 2 days ago and only used a few times, each time less than 5min.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado (very dry), so I use it religiously and even take it on trips if I am going to another dry location or a very cold destination where the hotel heaters further dry the air.</li>
            <li> I use the small cone attachment for my colds, the big one for my face</li>
            <li> Other than that I give this a four</li>
            <li> I bought this to breathe in steam due to my sinus allergies .  </li>
            <li> It work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Had an idea this product would help with extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> But whatever you do, please consider using steam, neti pot, saline sprays, or something other than chemicals and prescription drugs to deal with sinus pressure.</li>
            <li> no comment on the other tools.</li>
            <li> Ladies please dont use the method with the pot an boiling water if you don&#x27;t have too, this is safer, and you can use it for a lot of other things than just the listed uses.</li>
            <li> The machine only takes a small amount of water to work and turns off after 30 minutes for safety reasons.</li>
            <li> 1st - I saw some reviews complaining about plastic smell (with some other saunas also)</li>
            <li> Not sure about the battery operated brush though as it seemed pretty weak.</li>
            <li> no comment on the other tools.</li>
            <li> other days it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating it mid-range due to this being a question posed for information gathering, and it not being a comment (per se), concerning the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the other thing</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewed, it took a while for the steam to come up.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely see a small difference in my skin after each use.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed with this product I have seen other brand work better than this one.</li>
            <li> Just be careful using it!</li>
            <li> Placed a small cotton pad above steam chamber with just a drop of peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> If your nose is dry or congested put a little mentholatum or eucalyptus oil in the water reservoir and do inhalations with the steam produced.</li>
            <li> The brushes provided are very rough...</li>
            <li> and we are always frying stuff, so I use this everyday, for 10 minutes, less blackhead, less oily skin, and my skin looks brighter and people have been giving me compliments, I put a towel over my head when I use it, and I use it before I give myself a home facial.  </li>
            <li> and i usually put several drops of tea tree oil to cure the acne and black head</li>
            <li> It does get VERY HOT though, enough to make breathing a bit painful, I found having my mouth half in and half out while I breathed through my mouth helped.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2007, used it less than 5 times, and just had to throw it away due to leaking.  </li>
            <li> Only down part is the base is kinda too short and the face gets a little hot at times.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want all that heat on your delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> Not worth my time.</li>
            <li> I would get lazy because of the long process.</li>
            <li> No fun when you are trying to relax.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really a useful product either.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this one and I have not one thing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Not powerful.</li>
            <li> Slow to heat and not enough flow</li>
            <li> When I put my head down into the steam it is just to close to my nose and chin</li>
            <li> The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down &amp; eventually fell apart...</li>
            <li> and i see that it has gone down a bit since then</li>
            <li> This product let me down.  </li>
            <li> and then whenever I turned it on and let it start up, it shuts down automatically before the water even heats up.</li>
            <li> I mean, you practically just use only water in it, so, yeah.</li>
            <li> Facial skin is very thin in general..</li>
            <li> After using the microdermabrasion, there are no more of those after I washed my face and dry.</li>
            <li> Product is a big failure.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the steam is a little slow.</li>
            <li> so typically i would leave it on for around 5-8 minutes or so..</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not necessarily loyal to the Conair brand.</li>
            <li> I also agree the noise is a slight hiss.</li>
            <li> make your skin less oily you should all try it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agee with previous review.</li>
            <li> This combo helps to remove unsightly black heads that have made it to my skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> Half of the times it never powers on.</li>
            <li> I thought the vapor rising from it would be a lot less than what it was.  </li>
            <li> But if this seems like less hassle</li>
            <li> I am sorry to hear about the previous comment about it exploding in the face--I have had no such problems and have used this Conair product for several months every evening.</li>
            <li> I can press the power button over and over again and nothing happens until after almost half an hour of it being plugged in .</li>
            <li> It helped my very much when I had a cold to use the steam vapors.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet when sick, but I can see that it will really help to open your sinuses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> At the low price we paid, if the unit fails because we are placing a few drops of essential oils into the heating receptacle along with the water, we&#x27;ll just purchase another one.  </li>
            <li> Not much steam, and kinda small for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I have to spend a few minutes tilted one way, and a few the other in order to reach all of my cheeks, forehead, and chin.</li>
            <li> That way you will be comfortable and you can hold the base of the steamer with one hand (for safety) and use the other if you wish to keep a towel over your head.   </li>
            <li> I poured chamomile tea into it and added few drops of menthol, covered my head with a towel and after half hour</li>
            <li> Less messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty idiot proof as there is a tiny fill cup you fill to the line, hit a button to start it --</li>
            <li> For the amount of steam that comes out of that thing i reather stay a little lomger in the shower.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this little thing before.</li>
            <li> This little product clears my sinuses every morning.  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit of vicks vapor rub in it sometimes too.</li>
            <li> The little battery operated scrubber thing is a piece of junk, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I could take a little nap while steaming...</li>
            <li> I like using it, feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself a little.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel ripped off because it cost so little, but I agree with another reviewer here...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over two years and dont use it often</li>
            <li> I have little to no acne with skin smoother than I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
            <li> exposing your delicate facial skin to extreme temperatures can cause spider veins to surface and cause broken blood vessels (capillaries) so be careful not to over do it!</li>
            <li> The Conair is very slow to steam and when it does heat up it produces such a little amount of steam.</li>
            <li> It takes just a little water and it vaporizes all the Vicks, so you don&#x27;t waste the Vicks too.</li>
            <li> The brushes and the massaging pad are too harsh for your skin and it stops rotating by little pressure...</li>
            <li> The steam is not very dense and I find it uncomfortable holding my head above it for the set amount of time needed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I did not buy it sooner because of reading the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this steamer for a few months now</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the mask piece, it&#x27;s not really designed for a face, it&#x27;s a bit akward getting your face in it without getting too close to the boiling water</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does the Job ended with this after trying a few.</li>
            <li> whatever you wanna call it is distributed unevenly.</li>
            <li> For me, the sinus pressure almost always goes away within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  waste your money, put a pot of water on the stove and use it.</li>
            <li> , my lower face has already dried up.    </li>
            <li> Before I used this product, I noticed my face after it dried from washing it that there are dry/crack/unpeel skin on.</li>
            <li> I think those are the dead skins.</li>
            <li> --the brush isn&#x27;t harsh at all on your skin like others I have come across.  </li>
            <li> Which this may not fit everyone&#x27;s rush rush schedule...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few times within one week</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my sinuses</li>
            <li> I followed another reviewer&#x27;s tip and added a few drops of aromatherapy oil into the water</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s is like those FIRM toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> It does not work and its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is not so harsh on your face.</li>
            <li> Start boiling a few cups of water&lt;</li>
            <li> Keep your face a few inches away from the water to avoid burning yourself (which is easy)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought mine a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a towel when using the narrow sinus cone.</li>
            <li> Using everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and i dont see ANY steam   a waste of money . . .</li>
            <li> Tried proactive and wasted a ton of money...</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This lasted for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this sauna is not as tall or as heavy</li>
            <li> I received this from my wishlist and now I&#x27;m thinking of grabbing a few for relatives.</li>
            <li> and then I had to quit for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and no longer have sinus headaches .</li>
            <li> totally waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Folks, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one .</li>
            <li> otherwise it was a waste of investment for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dimensions do not fit my face at all:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and space.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money .</li>
            <li> Now after reading that awful review and having the burning feeling of my eyes (btw they were closed the whole time and my face wasn&#x27;t directly fully inside the cone)</li>
            <li> this is hard for me but works as expected!</li>
            <li> Otherwise had none of the issues that the other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> No more having to boil water in a pot and make a mess.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are probably by those who did not read the directions or poured other ingredients besides plain water in the heating cup.</li>
            <li> People complained about it not getting hot enough-Common sense tells you NOT to put freezing cold water in the container.</li>
            <li> This is not a strong sauna at all.</li>
            <li> It is very less and does not give a feel of steaming.  </li>
            <li> After a little experimenting, My favortite thing to do is take a plastic cap from a small water bottle and put just a small dab of vicks in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I had to really work hard to give it a 2-star.</li>
            <li> I bought it in order to clean my pores but in the meantime got really bad sinuses infection and this little thing saved me !!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I found it inconvenient and not very useful.  </li>
            <li> Very little amount of water it can hold.</li>
            <li> and it uses very little water.</li>
            <li> so the steam comes out very little.  </li>
            <li> - that was pretty claustrophobic.</li>
            <li> the resovor was too small  and</li>
            <li> It is only difficult to control time and volume of water.</li>
            <li> I usually do the &lt;br /&gt;face</li>
            <li> The water capacity of the steamer is too small.</li>
            <li> The face mask is a tad bit small</li>
            <li> Not sure how it opens my pores</li>
            <li> I used the small sinus cone to concentrate steam on my nose</li>
            <li> The receptacle for water was quite small</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but its not satisfying....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and use it randomly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work the second.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this happens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> CONAIR_Very small, not like my vintage one that bit the dust.</li>
            <li> It says to use tap water and had a small receptacle for filling accurately--included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using this product for past 4 years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it cleaned up my face or not as I am really lazy and don&#x27;t use it as often as I should</li>
            <li> I was honestly skeptical about buying this product, but decided to go for it after reading some online reviews and being extremely desperate for quick relief.</li>
            <li> thus steam barely teacher past you cheeks because it&#x27;s aimed awkwardly.</li>
            <li> I get acne very bad, so I needed something like this to help me clean my pores.</li>
            <li> Steam is a little weak, but does the job after sometime.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how hard the brush is until I used the Olay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> There is hardly any steam that comes out of it.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find a place where it can be utilized without squatting or fearing it will tip over.  </li>
            <li> Using a towel behind the head seems to help a little. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to incure any late charges.</li>
            <li> I kept pulling away but after about a total of 10 minutes I washed my face and then rinsed in cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li> I use mine at least once a week</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain - at least the person who I got it for isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use the product at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I try to use the steamer at least once a week</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the middle of a head cold and pounced on using it.  </li>
            <li> You still have to wait an additional 20 minutes at least for the steam to produce.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had some sinus issues as of late and after purchasing this</li>
            <li> I remember reading a review where a woman used the sauna then cleaned her face and complained of burning.</li>
            <li> Only disappointment is, I din&#x27;t find a spare brush head anywhere.</li>
            <li> Heating up way too slow</li>
            <li> If you forced to lay your face on the cone, you&#x27;d probably end up burning your chin and not steaming you forehead.   </li>
            <li> The problem is the sedan Olay remains at that slow 30 mph speed.    </li>
            <li> also steam comes out too slow.  </li>
            <li> so I mean it pays for itself</li>
            <li> This product does what it says, but it is so uncomfortable to use that its not worth it.</li>
            <li> After four minutes there&#x27;s a subtle beep and the unit shuts off.</li>
            <li> The mist was so weak that hardly had any effect on her face</li>
            <li> The steam (what little there is) doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly and there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; that makes it a bit uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> this is no good.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use the timer because the beep noise is really loud and annoying.  </li>
            <li> I was up one morning using the big attachment for my face and then used the pore cleanser brush that comes with it after (which if bought alone can be $25+), and my husband woke up sick</li>
            <li> Use a \\&quot;My little steamer\\&quot; mini clothing steamer!!!</li>
            <li> At the very least its relaxing and clears up stuffy noses, just got sick recently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too weak.  </li>
            <li> Steam is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is weakly powered.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the steam comes out in a very weak, thin stream, making it almost impossible to fully open and cleanse the pores.</li>
            <li> However I am very unhappy with the tardy delivery as it was to be a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> steam comes out very slowly</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Mine had the brush broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all   Poor quality</li>
            <li> I myself was skeptical about this product after seeing some negative reviews but ordered without being scared away.</li>
            <li> It took approximately 3-5 minutes for water to heat up.</li>
            <li> The result of using this facial sauna was my face being un-evenly steamed - well on my nose, between my eyes, and on my cheeks (closest to my nose), but crap everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> Might have been broken, but I didn&#x27;t get anything out of this thing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, negative reviews are over exaggerated.</li>
            <li> it was then broken.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these products.</li>
            <li> The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel exhausted.</li>
            <li> After watching the \\&quot;Secret Life of a</li>
            <li> Annoyed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the piece used for the face is very small and does not allow for the steam to reach all parts of the face.</li>
            <li> The steam hardly touches your face and you just can&#x27;t feel the steam!!</li>
            <li> It was also a little claustrophobic putting your head on this</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I have never used a steamer before and was a little disappointed in the amount of steam the product produced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in it and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because it&#x27;s not cheap in our currency(MYR).</li>
            <li> steamer was very weak.</li>
            <li> the steam is very very weak.  </li>
            <li> Overall very disappointed!</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t found anything wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> But they are useless.   </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this product</li>
            <li> sorry please refund my money.</li>
            <li> The reason i bought this product is because i am obsessed with finding blemishes or pimples and squeezing the living life out of them.</li>
            <li> I replaced a well known name brand (expensive) with this item.  </li>
            <li> Once you have your face in the bowl mask you can feel a bit insecure because if that thing splashes water on you it will burn you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers claimed they were disappointed with the steam it produces, as I have found it to have plenty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would have worked so well because of the price, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> product is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I also do not like how your hairline and sides of your face to not get steamed unless you turn your head, which is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I have to write this,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the unit didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> so I tell her to trash the unit and sorry about that.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer may want to add one of these to prevent expensive recalls and consumer danger.</li>
            <li> Its completely useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely useless product- doesn&#x27;t give any steam .</li>
            <li> and it wasnt that expensive</li>
            <li> My daughter, unfortunately, has decided to take it over for her &amp;#34;facials&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> This product was so mediocre that I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality item.</li>
            <li> and I was so desperate for a solution in helping my skin and my sinus problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this for cold season.</li>
            <li> and when I have a cold.  </li>
            <li> My doctor said to try this since I couldn&#x27;t take any medications for my cold and stuffy head.</li>
            <li> plus a bit dangerous in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My daughter had congestion, and this helped along with her cold medicine (I couldn&#x27;t have gotten her to hold over a pot).</li>
            <li> Bionerd\\&quot;&#x27;s youtube tutorial on using a mixture of oils as a way to combat oily skin (sounds crazy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  </li>
            <li> If you have cold or head ache</li>
            <li> It is useless!</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I use this as an inhaler when I have a bad cold and it works for me.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very expensive</li>
            <li> My skin is horrible when I don&#x27;t drink at least 60 oz.</li>
            <li> Also when my sister was sick we used it as a vaporizer and added some liquid camomile and  mint to the water to help sooth her head cold.</li>
            <li> is not that bad, but yes amount of steam produced are not enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I felt so bad</li>
            <li> I think it will work well if I&#x27;m ever sick..</li>
            <li> and when I was sick, I would even use it as a humidifyer in my room.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed with the FM3C.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I am getting what I paid for...:-(</li>
            <li> I felt so stupid while putting my face on the mask.</li>
            <li> someone and conair did nothing to recall the item, help pay hospital bills and treatment, which I hate to hear.  </li>
            <li> The handheld microdermabrasion unit I received (model FM3C) mounts attachments about a quarter of an inch away from the base; it feels wobbly when applied to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say it</li>
            <li> Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchase with amazon.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are thinking about buying this and are skeptical, do not buy it!!!</li>
            <li> And the massager is horrible also, after one time use, the brush rigid and the pad became unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my sister, who has terrible sinusitis.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> awful.  </li>
            <li> The worst part about this is the brush heads....</li>
            <li> It is an awful product!!</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst.</li>
            <li> Shockingly with force it still operated well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> perfect for heating up your sinuses great for those sinus headaches.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m returning this, no doubt quality of product material is good, but its not doing its job, steam produced is very weak.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve re-rated my rating from 1 to 3.&lt;br /&gt;product is not that bad, but yes amount of steam produced are not enough.&lt;br /&gt;just good if you want it for medical purpose.</li>
            <li> The steam from this is not strong enough. The timer is not long enough to have any effects.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product due to the review I read where the unit exploded and caused a woman facial burns. After about two and a half months of usage, three times a week, I can say this is an excellent facial sauna. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the unit overheating or not functioning properly. There is a very noticeable difference in my skin. My main reason for purchasing the unit was to help with the large clogged pores on my nose. I&#x27;ve tried every type of cleanser, exfoliant, scrub, minimizer, gadget, device, etc. I honestly believe this will eventually help me clear up this problem area permanently. The unit came with a bonus facial brush that I use twice daily. You can&#x27;t beat the price either! This is a must-have item for anyone looking to unclog stubborn pores.</li>
            <li> Not the top quality but far better than I was expecting! Works very well with lots of extras.</li>
            <li> I needed this as I suffer from sinus infections!  This has a special face piece just for that reason...... This is easy to use, very comfortable while using, and I get a facial with each treatment...This is a win.......win......Also, a very good buy.  Saved a couple dollars....</li>
            <li> Used once and I loved it. i will be using it in daily basis.</li>
            <li> This facial sauna met my expectations and then some. This one is way better than my old one, I am glad it broke!!</li>
            <li> Ended up selling this at a garage sale for $2.  It didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I basically use it for everything! Allergies, facial cleansing, stuffy noses, colds, etc. It comes in real handy, otherwise a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Feels good. Take a few minutes to heat up to full steam.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the item for the price I paid. Just wish there was a head rest or way to relax more without the neck strain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this steamer for a few months now and I must say, I love it. It does exactly what its suppose to. It wonderful for keeping my face nice and hydrated. It also helps to clear my nasal passages. Overall I&#x27;m enjoying this product!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchase with amazon. The item I purchased, The Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer, was faulty. The prongs on the plum of the item were of different shapes and sizes which meant it could not be plugged in properly into the power point. The item turned itself on and off when used and after only a few uses the item now will not turn on. It also has a strong burnt smell, I think some kind of fuse may be burnt, which makes me doubt the safety of using this item that heats water. Amazon return services will only cover $15 of the return shipping cost and the cost of shipping this item (which is very large) back to Amazon will cost more than what I paid for the item and the shipping costs as I live in Australia. As a result, it does not appear that will get a solution to this problem. Very poor quality item. Please consider your purchase carefully if you live in a remote area as shipping costs for such a large item will make this item very difficult to return.</li>
            <li> I found that the product takes a while to produce steam. In comparison to others that I&#x27;ve own, it seems a little awkward to use. One would expect the steam to lift towards your face, based on the circumference of the globe. I hope that it will work out nevertheless. Perhaps it is a matter of acclimating to a new product.</li>
            <li> this is the only product (prescription drugs included) that I have found that relieves my sinus pressure due to a deviated septum.  I use it daily and it has truly been a wonder product.  highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I use the small cone attachment for my colds, the big one for my face and then I use the scrubber to clean and exfoliate my face. I got this on sale for about $15.</li>
            <li> This product does not produce enough steam to do anything. It is useless! I am sending it back! Save your money.</li>
            <li> I am looking for face steamer and stumbled onto this. It&#x27;s easy to operate and it works as a  personal inhaler too. Great 2 in 1 product. Only down part is the base is kinda too short and the face gets a little hot at times. For the price i am paying for it, i can live with that. In short, good buy.</li>
            <li> Every product is not going be exactly what your looking for at times, but this particular facial steamer is not that bad. It&#x27;s not bad at all actually and the price is cheap. I agree with some of the reviewers when they say the steam is too close. When I put my head down into the steam it is just to close to my nose and chin and you don&#x27;t want all that heat on your delicate facial skin. I love the exfoliating brush that comes with it. It is so soft and gentle but the sponge applicator they could have kept! I put the lotion on it and it was rough trying to apply it to my skin. Other than that I give this a four *.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old college student who has NEVER had good skin. It&#x27;s always been an uphill battle for me! I was looking at proactiv as a last resort, but thought I should try something more natural. This steamer is amazing! For those of you who believe there is not enoough steam, I don&#x27;t know what to say! There is PLENTY of steam that comes out; I even had to back away a little bit. I used it last night and I immediately saw and felt a difference. Every woman should own this facial steamer, as it is truly a luxury in your own home! Who knew under my breakouts, was beautiful glowing skin!? So thankful to have found this product! I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> its not really a facial sauna I feel like you have to put your face so close to that you have to put your head at an angle. I think it will work well if I&#x27;m ever sick.. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. That only thing I can say that i dislike about it is the loud beep it makes. It serves its purpose and steams your face. I also like the scrubber it comes with to use after. Technically you could boil a pot of water and stick your head over it, but this way is much nicer.</li>
            <li> I just got mine and tested it out tonight. I thought it wasn&#x27;t steaming at first but once you actually put your face on the cone you get a good amount of steam. It definitely opened my pores and it&#x27;s very warm and relaxing.     My biggest complaint is the mask piece, it&#x27;s not really designed for a face, it&#x27;s a bit akward getting your face in it without getting too close to the boiling water, that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.    I&#x27;ll be getting married this fall and this product is an excellent alternative to expensive salon facials.</li>
            <li> I SENT THIS PRODUCT TO MY AUNT AS A GIFT AND SHE SAID SHE IS LOVING IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> Great product ...good price....Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer....Very nice for \\&quot;Me\\&quot; time works well and I would recommend to others. The brush is a bonus item!~</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Doesn&#x27;t produce very much steam. Better off with a bowl of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just lazy, I use it only two times so far since I have it for almost 1 year. It is an OK, but not really necessary.....</li>
            <li> This is not just for skin care. If your nose is dry or congested put a little mentholatum or eucalyptus oil in the water reservoir and do inhalations with the steam produced. Cover your head and unit with towel for maximum concentration of vapor. It&#x27;s therapeutic and enjoyable. I&#x27;ve even used it to relieve tension headaches, and otherwise just to relax, by placing just a couple drops of essential lavender oil in the water. What a nice break. So glad I got the sauna for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> No power.  Takes a while to work.  I got it because it was cheap, but one of my most questionable purchases.</li>
            <li> The timer on the device does not work at all. I wonder why they put a non-working part on the device to fool around in the first place. Although it does make steam, it&#x27;s too hot to bare with no control. After all, it&#x27;s almost a junk.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product for the price. The face cleaners are an added xtra. Cleans my face exceptionally well before a shave. Perfect for what I needed it for. Getting my sinuses opened is an extra benefit. The timer is great too. Overall, I cant complain and I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I fell for the few good reviews given for this product, which claimed it was so good that it made the skin smooth in just a single use, and Blah Blah Blah.. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not true. The only thing that works about this is the steam, and that too takes about 5-7min to build up. But you don&#x27;t need to pay this price for just a steam producing machine.</li>
            <li> I originally received this as a gift.  So, I bought this 2 different times for others as a gift.  It is an awesome product.  Works great on sinuses, in winter and refreshes skin.  Love the scrub brush for microdermabrasion too.  Take a while to heat up but I put a towel over my head when using it - seems to make the steam more potent.  Would and have recommended to others.</li>
            <li> I got it at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, $25&lt;br /&gt;EXACTLY what I was Looking for AND for a great price!!!&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!! I bought it mainly for cleansing purposed because my skin isn&#x27;t that great right now and I feel like no matter how much I clean, it doesn&#x27;t get better. I needed something to open the pores.&lt;br /&gt;The massaging sponge &amp; brush is great too especially with cleasing lotion/cream etc. The brush feels like it&#x27;s tightening the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY RECOMMENDABLE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to breathe in steam due to my sinus allergies .  It does warm up pretty quick, and puts out a great amount of steam..It will be useful for what i am going to use it for.</li>
            <li> it is okay.  It doesnt give you the full coverage like the salon, but it is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I love it. It work extremely well. It does a good job between Facials.   I highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for over a year.  It is EXACTLY like products out there that cost over $300! I use the facial brush almost daily and my skin has improved drastically. I&#x27;m pretty impatient so I don&#x27;t take time often enough to use the steamer but it is also great, especially if you drape a towel to tent your face in.  I love this product SO MUCH that I have like 3 back-ups in case they ever discontinue it.  I DO NOT want to pay the $300 for the only other facial scrubber out there I have seen.  BUY THIS! You will not regret it.  I actually have not even had to replace the batteries in a year! WONDERFUL product</li>
            <li> Works wonderful...just the right size.....skin look so much better......</li>
            <li> Works great, but I wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Does the Job ended with this after trying a few. Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for use as a sinus vaporizer.  The well allows the addition of essential oils to the water and the sinus attachment simplifies the breathing of the vapor to open and ease sinus issues.</li>
            <li> An excellent value. I used mine as a sinus vaporizer and with the small cone supplier it really did a great job. My GF saw the fascial cone and liked the unit as well, and the fascial brush was immediately disappeared by her as well. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Item is compact and stores easily.  Provides warm moist heat and works exactly as advertised to open pores and invigorate skin.  Very helpful for a teenager to control acne.</li>
            <li> It does not really get warm enough to steam your face. I have had my face steamed during a facial and it was very relaxing. This was just not good or worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Gets a bit too hot.</li>
            <li> I would not order this again. It doesn&#x27;t put out that much steam. I think sticking your head over a bowl of hot water would do the same job as this. The well that you put the water in is only a few tablespoons deep so doesn&#x27;t hold much water. It was also a little claustrophobic putting your head on this and they recommend putting a towel over your head as well - that was pretty claustrophobic. I gave it three stars because it does work, just doesn&#x27;t put out as much steam and the steam isn&#x27;t very warm. Not great.</li>
            <li> This item not only moistens and clears out the nose for easier breathing, at the same time it moistens the face, might as well  make use of the whole benefit since it came with the other accessories.  I feel it is a good value for what i paid for it.</li>
            <li> I use this as an inhaler when I have a bad cold and it works for me.</li>
            <li> Mine had the brush broken upon arrival. Amazon is great about returns so there was no trouble but feel off the product now and won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> You almost have to put your face really close to the bottom to feel any type of steam. Even then, all you feel is heat, not steam. My mom bought one back in the 80s that really steams and did the job. It was working really well and held alot of water and when I was sick, I would even use it as a humidifyer in my room. But this particular one only hold about 1/8 cup of water. You can&#x27;t even put green tea or any kind of herbs in it.</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is totally a piece of junk. I thought it&#x27;s a good idea to make a facial massage with this steamer, but there&#x27;s no enough steam produce, and you should be very close to it to feel some warm and steam! And the massager is horrible also, after one time use, the brush rigid and the pad became unusable. This machine is totally cheaply made, not even worth to use. The manufacturer really needs to improve their technology.</li>
            <li> Steam is not hot enough. Price is reasonable. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years and still working. Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.</li>
            <li> well, i was really looking for a face steam and i bought this one.i mean its ok generally but its not as powerful and effective i thought it would be.For starters,the steam does not come out powerfully so you have to sit like for a long time for it to be effective.and its kind of wide and short,i think it would have been nice if it were longer and narrower i think.all in all its an ok product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my sister, who has terrible sinusitis.  She is using it to inhale essential oils through steam.  Note that this practice actually goes against manufacturer specs.  The manufacturer actually warns against placing anything but tap water into the heating receptacle.  So far, so good.  My sister is experiencing some relief.  At the low price we paid, if the unit fails because we are placing a few drops of essential oils into the heating receptacle along with the water, we&#x27;ll just purchase another one.  Great item for the money, and fast delivery, well-packaged and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> awesome little face steamer with auto turn off timer! rotating facial wand is a plus!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial sauna for home use,for my wife, who had just returned from six months of duty in Iraq, but she had never used a product like this before.  After following the directions, it worked like a charm. With 110V, it takes several minutes to heat up. You cannot be in a hurry with this product. The battery operated brush exfoliator was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;She keeps the brush apparatus and the smaller components in the clear plastic container, positioned to the left of the facial sauna. She also used a plastic bag to cover the facial sauna. It is too time consuming to screw on and off the large top clear plastic portion of the facial sauna when not in use. All in all, it did the job of cleansing her facial pores in a grand manner.</li>
            <li> I bought this home facial steamer as an alternative to going to a spa for facials. The steam is not very dense and I find it uncomfortable holding my head above it for the set amount of time needed. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive so I am still happy with my purchase. It is nice to put essential oils in the water for added relaxation. I put lavender and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, however steam/mist whatever you wanna call it is distributed unevenly. sometimes i&#x27;d feel the steam on the right side and sometimes on the left. The brush/scrub/toner is great!... no complaints about that item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  My husband bought this for me for Mother&#x27;s Day this year.  What a real treat to have this facial sauna in my own home!  It is easy to use and makes my skin SO and glowing.  Wonderful!  Feels very refreshing!</li>
            <li> this makes me feel refreshed. i have sinus infections and allergies so i luv using the steam to get my sinus cleared up.. i so far only used the face one. it does what it says. i heard some complements on how good my skin looks. downside is the noise it makes and i don&#x27;t care so much for the timer.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. I was scared every second that hot water will splash into my face. Overall very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This facial Sauna works fine..the only thing i have noticed is that..you cannot expect the steam to come immediately after it is plugged in(and when the lights stops blinking)..you have to wait for a while..so typically i would leave it on for around 5-8 minutes or so..then put a towel over my head and steam my face.</li>
            <li> This is not for big guys.&lt;br /&gt;Iam 6&#x27; 2, 220 lbs.My head is large, dont know how to explain..&lt;br /&gt;But this is hard for me but works as expected!</li>
            <li> Really bummed that I wasted my money on this product. Does not produce enough steam to even be effective. Not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> The bottom barely got hot enough to create steam. If this worked well, created more steam, I&#x27;d like it. Given this problem, however, the old-fashion method of boiling a pot of water and covering your head with a towel is probably more effective, and certainly less expensive.</li>
            <li> The first try was absolutly amazing! After your done, you can feel your face breathing its awesome! There is no doubt in my mind that its worth the price plus more! if your hesitating on getting this DONT! you will miss out. All I do is turn on some music and sink my face in for about 10+ mins. GET IT GET IT!</li>
            <li> First off this item seems great, but while using it the first time I couldn&#x27;t help being a little fearful that the water would somehow shoot up and burn my face/eyes.  Then I just read a review saying it did just that to someone and conair did nothing to recall the item, help pay hospital bills and treatment, which I hate to hear.  Anyway, if you&#x27;re willing to risk it I&#x27;d say this seems to be an affective device.  It clears out my pores and seems to them look smaller as well as some acne cyst I have due to a medical condition I have.  I also pat the sweat off then add a facial mask to my opened pores. It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy.  Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle.  The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores.  One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I&#x27;m on drugs)to the point where they feel like they&#x27;re burning and it makes me wonder if it could be causing damage to them.  Now after reading that awful review and having the burning feeling of my eyes (btw they were closed the whole time and my face wasn&#x27;t directly fully inside the cone) I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;ll be using this anymore.  I mean is it really worth damaging me eye sight? or getting my face burned? I may go back to boiling water in a pot it&#x27;s seems safer and more controlled. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN BUY REPLACEMENT HEADS LIKE THE BRUSH FOR THE FACIAL TOOL IT COMES WITH??</li>
            <li> This facial sauna emits less steam than a hot cup of coffee.  I was sorely disappointed.  Had previously owned the Kaz steamer and that worked great!</li>
            <li> love it I take me a nice relaxing facial so soothing</li>
            <li> Very nice. i like that you dont use a lot of water because i used distilled deer park water. I put my moisturizer on before I steam and my pores look way smaller the next morning. Drink lots of water too. With this order i never received the brush and I wrote to customer service. They sent me another one without me asking for it. I just wanted the brush and if you cant send just the brush dont bother Im good. Overall a good buy. It was my christmas present.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and a coworker. They bought loved it. I suggest adding a few drops of your favorite oils.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is horrible when I don&#x27;t drink at least 60 oz. of water daily or if I get stressed out. I get acne very bad, so I needed something like this to help me clean my pores. This product works very good. It don&#x27;t splatter water up in your face. You can adjust the temperature and set the timer so that you won&#x27;t over steam your face. The spin brush comes in very handy and the bristles on the brush is soft. I recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s much better than steaming your face over the stove. The seller was good at getting this product to me in 3 days. Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says, but it is so uncomfortable to use that its not worth it. The plastic cone is an awkward size for most people, and it hurts my neck after 5 minutes of resting my face in it. I do like the electric face brush, its great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Puts out a lot of steam and others in my family have benefitted from using the smaller attachment for sinus issues.  The facial brush is okay.</li>
            <li> Never knew a facial sauna like this existed...I love this product.  It is great value...if you know your skin type and use the correct skin  cream to massage and then use this facial sauna to steam and clean, it renders magnificent results.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The product came in a lot sooner than I had expected especially during the holiday season. It came in nicely packaged. I bought this for my teenage daughter. She loves it! She hasn&#x27;t found anything wrong with the product. The facial scrubber bristles are very soft.  I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Good choice for ease of use.  I use flitered water. Not tap.  I use this steamer to unclog my pores. Works well.</li>
            <li> Good for skin and sinuses. My skin is so smooth afterwards, so clean. Especially if you follow witha mask.  And during allergy season, you&#x27;ll breathe better.</li>
            <li> Great deal use item monthly, love it.</li>
            <li> This product is just not for me. The Steam coming out is not that great. Very little amount of water it can hold.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to assemble and to use.  I didn&#x27;t use the timer, you can turn it off when you feel like it. I didn&#x27;t figure out how to use the extra mask - that&#x27;s something about conair, they didn&#x27;t bother to provide you with graphic illustration of function of each accessory.  overall, I think it&#x27;s functional, easy to use.  I hope by spending &lt;30 dollars, I save some trips to facial salon- which I found not doing much at all.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a great steamer for your home facial. you dont have to go to a spa as often as before. It comes with a exfoliate scrubber. Great product. You are a winner to get this!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It does take time to warm up. I get the machine going as I start to clean up after dinner. In about 8-10 minutes the machine is going gung-ho. I thought it was a small amount of water in the reservoir, but I got tired of the steam :-) while there was a lot of it left!! I think it will work very well with all the clogged noses we will have in winter. The timer does not seem to work. So I set up the microwave timer to go off at 10 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt;I am using Deep Scrub on the face. It is much more softer to use the given brush than using my fingers to rub it in!! All in all money well spent.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t put out much steam, and wasn&#x27;t very hot. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp. up here. Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this. UPDATE 2011: Want steam??? Use a \\&quot;My little steamer\\&quot; mini clothing steamer!!! CAUTION: Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face.  I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too! Remember...do not put it too close to your face!!! It generates VERY HOT STEAM!!!</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I&#x27;m not really the spa-going type, and I wanted to steam my face more effectively than standing over a sink with hot water and a towel over my head. Oh, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. Overall I am satisfied- the item does what I need it to, and I feel like I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space &lt;br /&gt;-The base stays cool even after using for 10-15 minutes &lt;br /&gt;-Produces effective amounts of steam to open pores and clear out the sinuses &lt;br /&gt;-Ability to set a timer is convenient &lt;br /&gt;-Auto shut off gives forgetful people like me peace of mind:) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  &lt;br /&gt;-In my opinion, the face tool/attachments don&#x27;t do any more than a loofah or washcloth + exfoliating cream. Beware if you have long hair. Even though mine was pulled back, I got too close with the rotating tip and ended up having to cut some of my hair out of the tool.  &lt;br /&gt;-Sitting bent over the cone for any more than 10 minutes is neck-stiffening. I&#x27;ve tried propping the unit, using a taller chair, etc. but there&#x27;s no way around it that I&#x27;ve found.  &lt;br /&gt;-The larger of the face cones doesn&#x27;t quite get all of the facial areas. I&#x27;ve found that I have to spend a few minutes tilted one way, and a few the other in order to reach all of my cheeks, forehead, and chin. Using a towel behind the head seems to help a little. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy enough with this unit and its results that I will continue using it several times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once.  It&#x27;s too weak.  It&#x27;s just sitting in my room collecting dust.  Don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> I just got the item Dec. 24th two days after I ordered it.  It wasn&#x27;t suppose to arrive until Dec. 28th. I used it once since then and my skin was so soft after washing my face.  Great product and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> the product was vwey dissapointing the resovor was too small  and steamer was very weak. I want to return this product please  e-mail me how to return it ASAP also I havent recived the visa card nor the statement.  I don&#x27;t want to incure any late charges.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. The steam is not sufficient for anything. Just may be 20ml of water boiling and you can imagine how much steam it can generate. Never go for this. I returned this product immediately as it is of no use at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I&#x27;m even buying another one for my aunt! If you have ever gotten a true facial before you would know that they don&#x27;t just drown your face with the steam it&#x27;s light and moved around different areas, and that is what this sauna does! Just loved it! Probably would like it to be somehow I didn&#x27;t have to bend over for it, but if you stack it up right it&#x27;s much easier!</li>
            <li> The Conair product photographed and labeled \\&quot;Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer\\&quot; is model number MDF2R, which is what I intended to and thought I had purchased. What I received instead was model number FM3C. This difference is critical. The handheld microdermabrasion unit I received (model FM3C) mounts attachments about a quarter of an inch away from the base; it feels wobbly when applied to my skin. The MDF2R microdermabrasion unit  appears to be longer, which would be a better fit for my hand and presumably easier to control. The MDF2R attachments in the photograph appear to be mounted in a flush fashion and probably spin with more stability. I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed with the FM3C. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had an idea this product would help with extremely oily skin I have had my whole life, and I am 69 now. Conair personal care products are of good quality and reasonably priced.. This Product works as I expected and as advertised, which is true of all Conair products. The movie with Nicholas Cage was good also.</li>
            <li> For the amount of steam that comes out of that thing i reather stay a little lomger in the shower. Not worth my time. Returned as easy as usual with amazon.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the face steamer, so I could do my facials at home. I do not regret this decision as the steamer is perfect for opening the pores and cleaning the skin. It comes with an exfoliating brush, which is very helpful as well. You can&#x27;t beat this price for a home spa treatment. If you spend just a little time to clean and exfoliate your skin it will pay off in the long run</li>
            <li> Dr. Gross of MDskincare recommended this product in a Elle article ages ago and I finally got around to buying it. Its a v. basic no frills model that is v. easy to use. I steam and then use pore strips on my face and I love the results. With regular use pores are clearer and appear smaller. My facial sauna came on vacation with me and my hostess loved it so much that I bought her one as a thank you gift.</li>
            <li> Does the job for us, heats up fast and has a wide range of settings that come in handy. Wish it held more water, but it holds more than most.</li>
            <li> I used this Item on my clients for facials and they loved it. I am happy I purchased this one instead of the other brand.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted, at an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a sinus solution (Neti Pots work great, but sometimes I want something more soothing). I looked at all the different facial saunas/steamers, and the Conair was the best value (at $22/free shipping), with the two attachments, and some extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for me - just put in a couple ounces of water, wait about 60 seconds, and it pumps out steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the facial attachment, and also the sinus attachment - and have had nice, soft pores this winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just inhale deeply for about 3-5 minutes, then blow your nose gently, and all those irritants and particles will come out. Repeat if you still feel some \\&quot;junk\\&quot; up in your sinus passages. It even works when you&#x27;re stopped up - the steam will definitely work its way through your sinus passages and loosen any mucus. For me, the sinus pressure almost always goes away within a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note - I&#x27;m not necessarily loyal to the Conair brand. This just seemed like the best value, and it&#x27;s worked well. It seems to be a durable machine, and has performed flawlessly. But whatever you do, please consider using steam, neti pot, saline sprays, or something other than chemicals and prescription drugs to deal with sinus pressure. Be kind to your body! One family member developed permanent health problems from over-reliance on things like prescription drugs &amp; Tylenol Sinus, when natural options like this are faster, safer, and cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the Conair also works great as a facial spa/sauna, though my family uses it primarily to clean sinuses. Hope this helps in your purchasing decision!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, puts a lot of moisture in your skin and helps with sinus. Haven&#x27;t used it much because I keep forgeting I have it. LOL</li>
            <li> I really liked this item. Compared to its more costly competition it really stacked up. I use it about once a week and every time I use it my face feels like I just left the spa. Really recommended to anyone who wants deep facial cleaning, but also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. I bought two of them . one was a mistake and I couldn&#x27;t find any way of deleting the second one. I was charged for both and they came on time. But they are useless.   &lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t buy this. The thing takes awhile to warm up and the steam in of no use. Sincerely  Wanda Rinehart.</li>
            <li> Just bought this item. DOnt like it at all. Not enough steam by any stretch of the imagination. I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this product and I was so desperate for a solution in helping my skin and my sinus problems. Well I knocked out two birds with one stone.  I have am a 33 year old man with ache on my chin area and have some problems with the hair growing on that area too. My condition has dramatically improved with this machine. The steam is fast and helps open the pores and clear your skin. The exfoliating electric circular brush works so well with antibacterial/glisern bars. I also found this to be therapeutic for my sinuses. I am so pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li> This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers. Quick to set up and easy to use. The facial cone is an awkward shape and maybe a little short, but it&#x27;s reasonable for one size fits all. I bought it for sinus pain relief, so no comment on the other tools. It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is rated a 4 and not a 5 is because it&#x27;s not a high-end product.</li>
            <li> The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam but you can put a towel on if your looking to get deep into the pores. The facial scrubber cleaned out my blackheads. But only after a month it stopped working, its not meant to get wet at all, even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I LOVE IT!! sooo relaxing and makes ur skin glow!! Fast shipping, no complains here! thanx!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product in 2012 and it&#x27;s still working well. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love love love this sauna.. I;ve use it for more then 1 year. It&#x27;s easily clean and easy to use. The result is satisfying</li>
            <li> I have had this thing for years and it still works great. Ladies please dont use the method with the pot an boiling water if you don&#x27;t have too, this is safer, and you can use it for a lot of other things than just the listed uses.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to maintain healthy glow and helps to get rid of acnes.it should be used regularly .I loved it &amp; recommends this product .</li>
            <li> the item was refused. sorry please refund my money. i wanted face steam by kaz. i can purchase that steamer at walgreens for 10 bucks. when i clicked on steamer by kaz there was a offer and it was not for a brush. i have several brush. please refund as you can track the package i return</li>
            <li> Works very well, simple to use. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> You have to be really committed to using this, or it&#x27;s a waste of $.  It&#x27;s hot and not something you can stay under for a long while.  I thought I&#x27;d use it more than I did. Ended up giving it awa.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is not what is expect. First, the product is smaller than what I expected. Only the front of your face gets pampered, you have to manuever your face to get the sides steamed. Second, the amount of steam coming for the unit is like a cup of hot coffee. Finally, the product is a big rip off, if the manufactor wanted someone to enjoy it they would have made a product that is productive. Don&#x27;t  waste your money, put a pot of water on the stove and use it.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with the facial cleaner brush, but the system itself is okay. I felt like I was not getting enough steam. I had to put a towel over my head to confine the steam to stay in one place long enough to open my pores better. I guess it&#x27;s a safely measure. I just wish it had a control for the amount of steam it produces insteam of the timer. Overall, it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Its okay nothing real special. I feel it is not very powerful but for the price it does the job.</li>
            <li> I agree with reviews stating it takes awhile to get going but 8-10 minutes and it&#x27;s going great. I also agree the noise is a slight hiss. The only problem I had was that I got so relaxed the beep of the timer woke me.    I think this is a great product for the price. The brushes are a nice extra.     I like the pampering I can do at home with this just as much as going out to spa.--- That makes it a real money($) saver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this system at a \\&quot;Bed, Bath, and Beyond\\&quot; store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down &amp; eventually fell apart...And there&#x27;s really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer.</li>
            <li> It is a nice item and does what it is suppose to do. Although little more steam would have been better. As mentioned in other reviews, steam mainly concentrate on the center and that might be an issue for few. Overall it is easy to use and carry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home facial steaming... I love the spinning brush! Like the vaporizer attachment !  Very easy to use... Remove my blackheads qick ;)</li>
            <li> This has been a great product! Steam has helped my skin look so much better! Love the scrubber. Has been wonderful to use. Seller was good, would order again. I gave it 4 stars because the shipping company delivered my package to a neighbors home. After not receiving it, I tracked it and it said DELIVERED so I had to search where it was delivered to. After three days, I finally found it!!!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT  GOOD ITEM</li>
            <li> Heating up way too slow</li>
            <li> I use this system everyday for my own personal spa day.  The product work well, I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li> We bought Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna with Timer on 10/3/2010 for $22.00. My wife always has a very stuffy nose with the onset of cold, and more so during the fall. She takes a boiling jug of water and put some Vicks VaporRub into it and cover head and jug with a towel. This method works but the problem is the water cools off very soon and the vapor stops; basically your effort of 10 minutes is gone within 5 min and wastes a lot of Vicks. Then the other day I heard one of my colleague&#x27;s wife had a burn by spilled boiling hot water while exercising the same. I browsed many and then finalized this one based on price, look etc. After started using, we realized that it worth every penny. It takes just a little water and it vaporizes all the Vicks, so you don&#x27;t waste the Vicks too. I have recommended this to many of my friends. We don&#x27;t have use for the scrubber or the facial rotating head thing, but probably others have.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all   Poor quality it&#x27;s a toy sauna   It&#x27;s a rip off  Its some thing out of a happy meal box  Do not order this product wast of time and money  Seller refunded my money and told me to throw way   Sauna</li>
            <li> I love this steamer. Its a commercial grade steamer without the big price tag. It heats up fast and generates a ton of steam. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a facial steamer.</li>
            <li> what a piece of garbage. i don&#x27;t know how this thing got such good reviews.  the steam is very very weak.  i got it to open my pores, but when i put my face into it.  it only steams the lower half of my face.  and by the time, i reposition my face to get the upperhalf and have it steamed, my lower face has already dried up.    awful.  i do not recommend this product.  it now sits in my closet doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to rate this product after I used it one time, but I decided to wait one week again in able to use it again.  I was going to rate this low because of the steam. It has low steam. The first time i used the steamer, I put a towel on my head following the advice in the manual. But still, I didn&#x27;t feel the steam more.  The second time I used the steamer I used a big towel (towel used for bath). WOW!! after five and so minutes the steam was turning too much for me (probably the steam volume you and other complaining costumer here want). So I decided to give some space for the steam to come out. I didn&#x27;t feel any burn. The steam was just too much but it felt so good.  The microdermabrasion is great. Before I used this product, I noticed my face after it dried from washing it that there are dry/crack/unpeel skin on. I think those are the dead skins. After using the microdermabrasion, there are no more of those after I washed my face and dry. Smooth, shine and clean.  I really recommend this product to everyone in a tight budget. But you should have good products too for your face. You should have daily/nightly and weekly routine. Its hard to maintaine an acne free skin. I&#x27;m just hoping that this product will last long.</li>
            <li> You cannot rest your head on the cone, because it is too wide. So you have to just lean over the cone. If you forced to lay your face on the cone, you&#x27;d probably end up burning your chin and not steaming you forehead.   Also,I think the steam can cause permanent damage to some types of skin by bursting capillaries. I would not use the product longer than ten minutes.  I gave it three stars because it is still more convenient and faster than boiling water in a pot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the secondary cone which directs the steam more to the nose area than the entire face. Due to a medical condition I cannot use decongestants, so I needed something to duplicate the congestion-busting effects of a hot shower (nothing against showers, but let&#x27;s face it: Taking a shower six or seven times a day in order to clear a stuffy head is just NOT practical, not to mention the wasted water!) and this facial sauna with the smaller alternative cone fits the bill perfectly. It produces steam almost instantly, is 100% effective, and it easy to store when not in use. I realize it can&#x27;t be marketed as a health or medical aid but it sure does the job in that department!</li>
            <li> I like this product it does a good job...when used correctly the pores are opened and blackheads are so much more easy to remove....my granddaughter has problems with blackheads and I have being using this product on her for two weeks and I can see much improvement of her face....I would recommend this product to all teens...  I also used it on my face and my husband face...we both like the results...we really like the brush...  I would purchase this product again...</li>
            <li> This product works great. I am so happy I purchased this item. It has worked wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I only got it today and just used it, I was a little nervous after reading one review that stated &amp;#34;if you hear the water boiling it could explode&amp;#34; I hear the boiling but I would think it has to boil to be able to get the steam. I kept pulling away but after about a total of 10 minutes I washed my face and then rinsed in cold water to close my pores. My face is soft and smooth. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and was so excited to use it right away, only to get so disappointed.  I have tried a lot of professional facials so I know what I&#x27;m looking for.  I felt so stupid while putting my face on the mask. It wasn&#x27;t producing enough steam, that I was wondering if I should stick my face deeper into the mask to get more steam or to even just feel it.      My husband was trying to console me so he tried.  He was giggling while he&#x27;s doing it and he stuck his face deeper telling me it&#x27;s what I should do to make it work.  Well his conclusion is, if you stick your face so much deeper, you could burn your nose.      I&#x27;d give it credit maybe for sinus...but then again, I can&#x27;t even be sure since I don&#x27;t have that condition.  But it&#x27;s not for sinus after all!  Maybe they should start advertising it for sinus, like \\&quot;Moisturizing Mist Sinus Sauna System\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m surely returning it!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my sinus problems and so far it seems to help.  I get sinus headaches a lot and using this when I have a headache actually rids my headache.  My product came with the face scrubber and it is really nice--the brush isn&#x27;t harsh at all on your skin like others I have come across.  The nasal cone is what I use most, but if I ever want to use the face cone I put a towel over my head as it helps with an actual &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; experience on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This experience is sort of like when you are boiling pasta over the stove and you get that steam on your face.  Of course it is more relaxing and better!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I would have given this product 5 starts, however the timer didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  But other than that which to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t care about... This product is wonderful. My face feel super clean and hydrated every time. I was worried at first by other reviews of it not getting hot enough, but it produces the right amount of steam and heat. I even had to take my face out a bit to cool off. Over all I LOVE this product and would recommend anyone getting one to pamper your self a bit at home.</li>
            <li> I must say I was very surprised by this steamer, in a good way, when I got it. It is the BEST thing that I ever bought as far as my sinuses are concerned. I bought it in order to clean my pores but in the meantime got really bad sinuses infection and this little thing saved me !!! I poured chamomile tea into it and added few drops of menthol, covered my head with a towel and after half hour I was a new person ! Sinuses opened and my face looked better at the same time. I wish I knew about this little thing before. I love it so much that I keep it on a kitchen counter and steam sinuses whenever I catch free time. Great stuff !</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as much steam as I would have hoped for, a pot of hot water and a towel as a tent definetly more effective</li>
            <li> after some time it is not working</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have noticed about this unit is that It stays warm even when the unit is turned off.  It stayed warm to the touch even though I hadn&#x27;t used it for days.  I had to unplug it just to make sure it was off.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, but cannot connect the extra attachments to the unit.      If purchased at a store, would be returning to see how to complete the above.    catherine flaherty</li>
            <li> i like this thing make your skin less oily you should all try it&lt;br /&gt;or not ... whatever  anyway bye</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this facial steamer regularly whenever i do facial at home. I like this product a lot. It gives lot of relief. Not only for facial but also if you have sinus problem also, this is very useful.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times.  Great for steaming my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I myself was skeptical about this product after seeing some negative reviews but ordered without being scared away. Call me fearless or spontaneous...which ever. What worked for one person didn&#x27;t work for another. After reading some of the reviews and getting my product I decided on trial and error. Well it&#x27;s been 2 days since I&#x27;ve had it and the thought of returning it has NEVER crossed my mind.   *People complained about it not getting hot enough-Common sense tells you NOT to put freezing cold water in the container. I have run the faucet to a luke warm which takes 30 seconds. Then poured it in the machine did the rest.  *Some have complained about it not working right-I read one customer&#x27;s review about putting a towel over your head...and it works wonders. Not only does it work fast but it feels so relaxing. Which this may not fit everyone&#x27;s rush rush schedule...a facial is suppose to be relaxing and not a 2 minute fix!  *I highly recommend wearing a headband and tilting your head back at times. I&#x27;ve noticed that my chin doesn&#x27;t feel as loved as the rest of my face.   *Please understand that this isn&#x27;t as powerful as a day spa facial machine. Just a nice easy at home one.  The worst part about this is the brush heads....not a big fan of them, but then again they aren&#x27;t Clarisonic. Also I have no idea how the timer works or how to work it....but I don&#x27;t care because I love everything else.  FYI: I use Eminence Skin Collection...Love it.</li>
            <li> The Steamer is okay to use...It takes nearly 10min to steam and the steam is also very low...The brushes provided are very rough...I felt like its hurting my skin.The sauna system works more like a humidifier rather than a facial sauna.</li>
            <li> I love steaming my face and I used to do it by boiling water and putting it into a sink with a towel over my head. I would get lazy because of the long process. This made it easier and it works great. I love the design and how you can place your head on it comfortable and the heat is perfect. Thank you</li>
            <li> I think it is OK, but I don&#x27;t know why the timer doesn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t know how long I have been steamed... Until the water stopped boiling ( I can hear from the water) and I finally saw the water is all dry... Don&#x27;t have something to stop it automatically when it is dry...    anyway I think it&#x27;s OK because it steamed face quick good.</li>
            <li> This works like the good old steamers.  you know the one your mother had.  This puts out good steam and has the face basket for maximum facial effect.  glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin feel so good, I dont know how I ever lived without it!</li>
            <li> The first one arrived &amp; the facial sauna worked fine, but the little facial scrubber didn&#x27;t.  Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine.  Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial?  No.  But then I didn&#x27;t pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use.  The steam isn&#x27;t a lot, it&#x27;s gentle.  I did put a towel over my head &amp; that helped.  The sinus attachment works well.  I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Conair Facial Sauna has helped my sinuses tremendously. I am very happy with the quality of the product. The timer is especially useful.</li>
            <li> When you have a cloged nose or just want to relax in general it&#x27;s a great. It helps you think and unwind. Great product and well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for cold season. steam is awesome and the facial is a bonus. great price</li>
            <li> Thanks...as advertised</li>
            <li> Ok - for those who want to do a general facial sauna. The gadgets can be safely thrown away, the nose-apapter is useless. Takes some time to start up and in my case the timer does not work. Don&#x27;t want to be harsh, since it might very well be only for me but the bottom-line is a crude cheap product which I WILL ADVICE to purchase if you&#x27;re looking for a simple model doing just that steaming to your face and you&#x27;re ready to wait for 10 min. while the stuff heats up.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quick shipment and the facial sauna itself.  I got more than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> Not even 6 months, it doesn&#x27;t work now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my teenage son handle his breakouts and I was only really interested in the facial steam function.  To my surprise the facial exfoliating brush has been great for him too, and now that I have a bad cold, I am using the nasal steam several times a day.  I have only had it for a month, but so far, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is only difficult to control time and volume of water.I&#x27;d like to use this to relax and do a mask later.</li>
            <li> I already had one in my country house and had a different one in my city house.  Since Conair the much more effective, bought another. It&#x27;s an excellent facial sauna system...</li>
            <li> This is a great product to  have in your home to assist you with the cleansing of your face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few times within one week and I love it so far.I don&#x27;t have a problem not getting enough steam since I use the towel to cover my head entirely LOT of steam coming out. I fill the water and turn the machine on then went to take shower about 15mins and when I come back the steam was boiling perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for a few months now and use it weekly, it produces a good amount of steam for a $20 steamer, you can amplify it with a towel over your head.  I even used it to clear up my sinuses and it worked amazing.  Happy with the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> About four years ago I underwent radiation therapy for a tumor in my throat. Since then, my throat has constricted and mucus gets stuck in my windpipe, causing major breathing problems. Regular use of the Conair steamer helps to loosen the mucus and enables me to breathe more normally.  I wonder if it would be as beneficial to children with croup. I have two units, one of which I keep with me in my car and use it with an adaptor.</li>
            <li> For what I paid for this item, it is alright.  The main issue I have with it, is it doesn&#x27;t put out NEARLY enough steam and FORCE with the steam for my liking.  So, the BEST way to get the most out of this product, is to throw a LARGE towel OVER your head and AROUND the unit as to create a steam TENT, and get your face as CLOSE the the base of the unit as possible without BURNING your nostrils ;) When doing this, the item does achieve what I want, although they should make the front part of the large cone a little taller and the edge more comfortable so you can TRULY rest your face on the rim, without searing your nose :)</li>
            <li> Likes:  1) Price is right.  2) Lightweight and portable.  3) Steam is adequate.  4) Does work as advertised.  5) Built-in timer function.    Got this for my wife and she said for the price it is good. She did complain that there isn&#x27;t more steam out of it. Was going to return it but keep it since again it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is ok, a little uncomfortable. I would work best if you had a high counter and a low chair in order to relax and enjoy.</li>
            <li> The sauna part of this is great however the facial brush is crap.  I even contacted the company about how much of a pain this is and they made suggestions that were common sense and things I had already tried.  I barely use the brush because it slings the face wash everywhere.  I should have spent more and purchased a higher quality product.  Won&#x27;t be doing that again.... Save you money and buy something worth it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> The reason i bought this product is because i am obsessed with finding blemishes or pimples and squeezing the living life out of them. one problem i have dry skin and they just wouldn&#x27;t come out, Having had facials before i knew that they use hot steam before extraction. I have white heads and pimples that are deep under the skin and when i used this product i was able to squeeze them out with out pushing bacteria to inside. I was amazed that my skin is actually smoother now because it adds water to the face, Very happy with the product and I only used it twice so far, so that means you get instant results.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does the job and you get enough steam out of it. I always put a towel over my head just to keep in as much steam as possible. The timer is useful but you don&#x27;t always have to use it. Great for the price too.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and this is the best my skin has ever looked.  The facial steamer and microdermabrasion tool have left me with an incredibly soft skin texture and appearance.  I&#x27;ve had acne since my teens and also have keratosis pilaris which leads to a bumpy skin texture.  Since using this product my skin is smooth and really does not need make up anymore which is the best part.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  It also really helped daughter with acne.  Very relaxing.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this little sauna, it has done a great job cleaning pores and is also very healthy for sinuses.  You can&#x27;t get a better unit for the price.</li>
            <li> Works really well with opening pores. Suffered acne and this works to clean skin</li>
            <li> I had one of these for years that we used religiously but somehow misplaced in a move, so we happily repurchased. I&#x27;ve not used it for facials, but rather for allergies and colds when we have sinus issues. It&#x27;s easy to use (fill up the little included cup and pour into the bottom, then turn on the switch) and works great to open nasal passages when we can&#x27;t breath (just put a towel over our head to keep in moisture). Great product, glad they haven&#x27;t messed with the design.</li>
            <li> I wanted to take the time to let you know how much I liked this product! It came with a thin, easy to understand and to the point booklet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steamer DOES heat up in 3 minutes and lets you know with a peep that it&#x27;s done heating up, it does point out in the booklet though that it sometimes could take a couple of minutes more then 3 minutes to heat up, probably depending on how much water you put in, or how cold the water is you put in there to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer works very well too and I did not find the beep too loud. When the time you set is up and it beeped, the Steamer emmidietly shuts itself off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Steamer comes with a little cup to fill the right amount of water in the steamer! I found one cup is enough for a good five minutes of steaming! When I want to steam longer I simply fill twice the ammount in which works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a very big person (5ft4)so the facialtube is big enough for my face! To reach all the areas in the face, to get the hairline and to intensivy the effect all at the same time I always use a big towel over my head. I find that it has the same effect then even if you are not all the way on the facialtube, good to know for people with bigger faces, in addition to that I find it even more relaxing to steam away in the darkness under the towel- feels like going into your own world a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Microdermabrasion piece works great, spins two sides and runs in two speeds as well as it comes with two differend heads, one for the abrasion and one for massagning moisturizer in!</li>
            <li> I am an older man and maybe still alittle vain from my younger years. This moisturizing unit is wonderful, no only does it &lt;br /&gt;clean my skin  but breathing in the steam  opens my nasal &lt;br /&gt;and lungs for better breathing  so its like have two &lt;br /&gt;units working for you.Conair is a good name and I have always &lt;br /&gt;trusted their products and I do use them...I usually do the &lt;br /&gt;face moisturing  after I shave... its great and I may not &lt;br /&gt;look  younger but my face is aglow and  I feel great</li>
            <li> First things first, I fell for the good reviews and Conair&#x27;s name. I know its not costly, just 21 bucks but still, its supposed to produce freaking steam, which it does very miserly.     A request to all, please send me $5 and I will tell you more effective ways to break a sweat on ur face then this thingy will ever do for ya. I wud have preferred to pay 50-60 bucks for a nice product then waste 21 on something I&#x27;m might trash. This thing looks nice but I hope it produced more steam.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my sinuses and whenever they flare up I use this.  It releases the sinus pressure and after a couple of days I feel a lot better.  It&#x27;s is great for the complexion too!!</li>
            <li> Just a warning that this item worked as described up until about 3 weeks after we bought it.  My wife was using it one day (as directed, water only) to try and clear up her sinuses.  She heard a &#x27;bubbling&#x27; and the unit exploded hot water on the lower half of her face.  We rushed her to the emergency room where she had first degree burns.  I contacted Conair and they had us send the unit in for testing.  Two weeks later we received a check for $28 for reimbursement of the cost and the note simply read \\&quot;We enclose our refund check for the facial sauna\\&quot;. We are left with a $1800 bill from the emergency room and two days of lost wages (not to the mention the pain my wife endured for 2 days).  Most of these units will probably work as described, but be careful if you hear a noise like the water is boiling.  She did not have enough time to pull away from the time she heard the noise to the time it blew up in her face.  The Conair claims manager was rude and appeared as if she could care less that my wife experienced this due to their product.  Be careful.</li>
            <li> This does a great job exfoliating dead skin and opening your pores. Gets rid of all that dirt, oil and grease from your skin, I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it weekly or when I have time.  The brush is awesome, I use it to exfoliate but there aren&#x27;t any replacement heads to purchase online so that its a one-time deal.      I followed another reviewer&#x27;s tip and added a few drops of aromatherapy oil into the water and it made it a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Below is what I posted under the Olay facial brush.    Products being compared. Names copied from products&#x27; pages on Amazon.  \\&quot;CONAIR CORPORATION Facial Sauna Systems with Timer\\&quot;  \\&quot;Olay Prof Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System\\&quot; &amp;    The ideal piece would be combining the Olay&#x27;s brush and the Conair&#x27;s mechanics.    Brushes:  Conair - I didn&#x27;t know how hard the brush is until I used the Olay&#x27;s. Conair&#x27;s is like those FIRM toothbrushes.  Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    Mechanics:  Conair - Love it!  Olay&#x27;s - A lot slower than Conair&#x27;s.  Conair is like a nice sports car at top speed and Olay is like a sedan. The problem is the sedan Olay remains at that slow 30 mph speed.    Batteries: 2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet. I read a post on here of how to do it but I&#x27;ll have to scroll through to look for it. I already tossed the box.    Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I only use the Olay.  That is until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s. :-)    STEAMER  I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  Putting your face next to it will burn your face.  As the other post mentioned, use a big towel.  However to have a decent lasting steam, you&#x27;ll have to continually adding water.  The cup doesn&#x27;t hold enough and at the constant boiling rate, the evaporation is too fast.</li>
            <li> I would like for the product to put out more steam. It has to be refilled frequently. It does the job but the steam when I open my dishwasher dies a better job if I could find a way to get the steam to come out and steam my face consistently.</li>
            <li> Did not like it! The water capacity of the steamer is too small. Does not create enough steam to even feel it on the face. I think its going to lay around the house without any use.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughters for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I am told they work well.  Shipping was received on time.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The face mask is a tad bit small but if you place a towel over your head, the steam reaches all angles of your face without twisting and turning. It was so refreshing and easy to use. The timer works (yay), came with a SPINNING face brush (yay), and some directions on when to apply eye creams and stuff for maximum benefit.  I will be using this instead of a pot each week.</li>
            <li> I gave this product tto someone as a gift. They loved it. It does what its suppose to do . Give your face a special cleansing.</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is an excellent product!  It was a replacement for a Conair I purchased 20 years ago from Marshall Fields in Chicago;)).  The former was still in great condition, however, this one was a bit more advanced in features and accessories so for the price I replaced it.  Not only is my skin flawless with consistent use, it also does wonders for my voice, as I am a singer.  In regards to the negative reviews, I really don&#x27;t get it at all... for this price, what in the world do these people expect???  Even at this price I am experiencing professional results!  The unit has paid for itself many times over, furthermore, in lieu of the brutal reviews, simply return it; both Conair and Amazon are amazing when it comes to customer satisfaction on this front.  By the way, in response to the option of boiling water in a pot with a towel over the head?  This is simply tacky.  The steam is continuous and concentrated with this unit, therefore, you can expect much more effective results.  There is nothing attractive about sitting at the table over a huge pot used for dinner while sweat and sinus fluids drop into it... yuck!!!  People, it&#x27;s $30 something dollars?!... buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it;)).</li>
            <li> Great spa system!  It heats up in 3 minutes and beeps to let you know when it&#x27;s ready for you to steam your face.  Then you can (if you choose to) set the timer for up to 15 minutes of steaming.  That timer is such a great feature!  I suggest that you place a towel over your head while steaming to get better face steaming results.  I use mine at least once a week and it makes extractions (of acne) a breeze.</li>
            <li> Great item but.... does not last but like 8 mins when you put water in. Seller was excellent. Manufacture issue.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this! It is an awful product!! It does not work and its a waste of money. It&#x27;s not big enough to steam your whole face. And the steam isn&#x27;t even strong enough. It will stop working after 2 weeks! Ugh I&#x27;m so upset with this product. I do not recommend it to anyone. Don&#x27;t even waste your money and time trying to put your face near it for 15 mins or until u get neck pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star!! But that&#x27;s not an option on here</li>
            <li> I wanted something more portable and durable than using a pot.&lt;br /&gt;Works alright, steam rises to a good temperature.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 3 stars is because it&#x27;s small, my whole face doesn&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;I have to steam parts of it in intervals..</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed. I would recommend it to anyone. It works well. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. All Steam hits your nose and the rest escapes from the sides. The facial cleansing brush lasted about a month. Spend a little more and get something that actually works. I waited a little long and they refused my return.</li>
            <li> The Facial Sauna is compact, light weight, and easy to use. The compact size makes for ease of use and storage. The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  The results were as I expected for my facials. I have already recommended the product to my friends and given one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Does what is says. Can&#x27;t complain - at least the person who I got it for isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am used to steaming my face the old fashion way, boil some water, cover with a towel and steam as needed.  I bought this because for few months I could not use the stove top.  Let&#x27;s just say the good old fashioned method is definitely better.  Not enough steam and does not steam the entire face especially the upper neck and just below the jaw line.  Too soon to tell if the scrubber is helping my face.</li>
            <li> This little product clears my sinuses every morning.  I use my electric teapot to pour some hot water into it, hit the power button, and it starts steaming a minute or so thereafter.  Three minutes of heavy breathing later, my sinuses are clear.  I put a little bit of vicks vapor rub in it sometimes too.</li>
            <li> I really love that this thing is a one-stop shop. I was up one morning using the big attachment for my face and then used the pore cleanser brush that comes with it after (which if bought alone can be $25+), and my husband woke up sick so we put the smaller attachment on and he sat there with it to clear up his sinuses. There are so many uses for this machine and I highly recommend it. The brush itself comes with two attachments (the sponge, which you use after the face sauna, and the brush which you can use daily or however many times a week to keep your pores clean). The machine only takes a small amount of water to work and turns off after 30 minutes for safety reasons. They recommend you putting a towel over our head when using the facial sauna and I found that recommendation to yield better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that I have very sensitive, oily skin, that is super acne-prone. After one use of this thing I could see a difference in my skin. There was this glow about it and it just felt so clean. And finally, because it was steaming water into my face and not product, it did not irritate my skin at all. I very much recommend this for any household.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of difference to my face.  The product is around $21 and comes with the facial brush.  I am happy with the price.  Good for present.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to deal with my daughter&#x27;s acne thinking that the vapor was going to open her pores. No such luck! The mist was so weak that hardly had any effect on her face (she almost didn&#x27;t break a sweat). So if your goal is to open those pores to extract blackheads, save your money and use the old method of placing boiling water in a pot and cover your head with a towel. The only benefit was the electric facial brush which works fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. Easy and simple to use, makes it much easier to get the junk out of your pores! Very nice :)</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Works great, steam heats up pretty quick, it&#x27;s nice to have the timer. I add some essential oils to the little bowl and the steam is a good temp with towel over head. perfect.</li>
            <li> i love using this before i use a face mask, let it open up my pores so they can get in deep. i use it with a towel over my head to get more of the steam without resting my face on it. its not too hot. it feels really really good.</li>
            <li> This is a great cost-effective facial sauna. I really love the price + the facial brush that comes with it. I had originally bought this only for the face brush but I use this way more now (especially since I have since replaced it with a clarisonic!) This is especially really great before exfoliating because it makes all your skin cells super saturated.. I would totally recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good sauna. I want to try putting some essential oils in it! I</li>
            <li> I threw it out because it did not work well.</li>
            <li> After that minimal steam. Cool mist worked ok. I agee with previous review. Towel and a pot of steaming water for me.</li>
            <li> thus steam barely teacher past you cheeks because it&#x27;s aimed awkwardly. And if you want to stick you&#x27;re whole face in its unbelievably hot and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great price.&lt;br /&gt;It Works amazing for my little spa&lt;br /&gt;Days and Everything was just what&lt;br /&gt;I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from terrible sinus congestion and the Conair helped greatly to keep my nose free and clear&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, and used it the same evening. It took approximately 3-5 minutes for water to heat up. Meanwhile I washed my face and put some cream on my eye area (btw, that was a good tip from manual, as you protect your sensitive skin around eyes). Steam was very good and strong, but I would probably be more happier if the facial cone was a bit longer, so my face is not so very close to the steam coming right out of the machine. I think using a towel over your head will be very helpful if you want to steam your face for more than 10 minutes. Just to add more effect to your steam facial treatment :) I set the timer on 10 minutes first time and it did work. I have been using my facial brush to exfoliate my face in the shower, but I like this facial brush that comes with this product. Brush is very soft and work pretty well. I thing this brush is more gentle but yet more effective than just using my old brush. It is not so harsh on your face. Use a generous amount of cream or moisturizer after using brush to exfoliate your face. Also, my personal recommendation - I would probably not use brush to exfoliate your facial skin more often than once in a week or two. Facial skin is very thin in general.. you don&#x60;t want to take it completely off :) Using mask right after steaming is very good idea too. Yes, I have been using boiling water in pot so far, but I find this product to be very convenient way of doing steam facial. And one more tip, if you still miss steaming your face over a boiling pot with herbs (sage is excellent thing) use this herbal tea instead of using mask.. Simply damp the towel and put it on your face for couple of minutes after steaming. So  like I&#x60;ve said - product works very well and I am so far very happy with it. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I researched the web, and decided on this sauna.  Glad I did.. highly recommend it.  Noticed a difference in my skin tone and smoothness after just a couple of uses with this Conair sauna.  Have used other saunas, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The dual cones are very helpful, it has adjustable settings, and is just easy to use.  Shipping was fast, price is great, and it lasts.  I&#x27;ve used it for nearly a year now, no problems ~ and people asks me how I get my skin to look so healthy.. I tell them Conair.</li>
            <li> The facial steamer delivers amazing results.  My face glows every time I use it.  I would recommend it to those who want an affordable facial steamer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it opens my pores but it works great at opening my nasal passages.  Use it to help me breathe for sinus allergies and when I have a cold.  Just wish my dog wasn&#x27;t terrified of the one beep it makes when it heats up...he thinks it&#x27;s a smoke alarm.</li>
            <li> QUICK SUMMARY: The product works as described, but steaming your face over a bowl of water is MUCH easier, faster, and effective for opening your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as described; however, I compared this with simply using boiling water, a bowl, and a towel. I found the bowl method works much better and faster. I highly recommend skipping this product in lieu of the do-it-yourself method just because the DIY method is so much more effective. For those of you who don&#x27;t know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Start boiling a few cups of water&lt;br /&gt;2. Place a bowl on a desk or table; pull up a chair&lt;br /&gt;3. Turn on some music or a TV show to listen to while you steam&lt;br /&gt;4. Get a towel to drape over your head to trap the steam&lt;br /&gt;5. With the towel and music ready, pour the boiling water into the bowl&lt;br /&gt;5. Drape a towel over your head and the bowl&lt;br /&gt;6. Keep your face a few inches away from the water to avoid burning yourself (which is easy)&lt;br /&gt;7. Maintain that pose until the steam stops rising or you are simply ready to finish (I recommend three to seven minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The higher flow of steam coming from a whole bowl, rather than the Conair&#x27;s small heated surface area, does a faster and much more complete job to open up your pores. I tried the Conair five individual times and think it does not even compare to the DIY method. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try the DIY method first, or I would have realized it does a completely sufficient job (and actually a better job). I obviously can&#x27;t return it, but I am going to just recycle it. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away to a friend because the DIY method is so much better.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Easy to use and clean after use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my sinus and it works. Get rid of my headaches and the stuffiness in my nose. I did recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to a friend and they love it</li>
            <li> The sauna is great.  I use it to open my up my pores right before I use a peel away gel mask.  This combo helps to remove unsightly black heads that have made it to my skin&#x27;s surface.  The facial brush that comes along with it is a little powerhouse cleaner, well worth the money of the two alone.  I&#x27;ve seen products such as this brush sell on facial product infomercials and figured if nothing else it was just a bonus to the sauna..boy was I wrong!  It cleans my face so well, I know b/c I use a toner after cleaning with a cotton swab.  I can see the actual difference in the amount of residue that shows up when I hand clean and when I use the brush.  Gentle enough to use everyday and I do.  Been going on a few months and the heating element still works great.  NOTE:  Make sure you dry the unit well before storing to avoid calcification of metal parts.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you need steam to inhale. There is hardly any steam that comes out of it. The container to hold water is so small that it can fit your tears when you cry!!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this from Conair. The steam hardly touches your face and you just can&#x27;t feel the steam!!</li>
            <li> love this product,I am a licensed esthetician and I love using this on myself it open not only my pores but my sinsuses as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> WHO WOULD NOT WANT ONE OF THESE   WORKS PERFECTLY AND FAST   NICE AND SMALL  GREAT DEAL - NICE SHIPPING</li>
            <li> this product was bought for some sauna action and i found that using a pot with a towel is just as good, if not better, i used this product once.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial sauna after my first visit, to a SPA, in USA for a deep pore cleansing where i was very desappointed because my face was looking the same after the facial and after $70 payed. I went there for a deep pores clean. expecting to have at least half of my face clean, but it didn&#x27;t happend. She used the facial steamer and then a lot of masks, which i am sure they were expensive and good but my face doesn&#x27;t really need them,it needs just a DEEP PORES CLEANSING! I left the spa very disappointed starting to look online for my own facial sauna so i can do it at home, for free. That&#x27;s how i bought this product and it is working, it is working as good as the spa one was working minus $70 every time i use it. Makes enought steam and has a better effect if you use a towel around your head so it can keep the steam on your face. I personally add some tea in the water also, to me it makes a difference. You can add even the tea bags you have at home.I am happy with it and i am recommend it.</li>
            <li> 1st - I saw some reviews complaining about plastic smell (with some other saunas also) - DO THIS: wash it with soap &amp; warm water before you use it.    As for the quality - you get a lot of bang for money - the included automatic brush works real nice &amp; you probably don&#x27;t need $200 clarisonic if you use this for cleaning - 2nd brush work real nice for applying moisturizer    Sauna itself - double whammy - good for your face skin + good for your breathing. Facial sauna is probably the Best thing you can do to clean your pores - you can apply scrub or pore cleaner after for best results.    Also - what goes very nicely with this set is to get a small bottle of Essential oils (I use 10ml peppermint with just a few drops)</li>
            <li> Now, I really don&#x27;t think I have a huge face...but I think Conair might. The result of using this facial sauna was my face being un-evenly steamed - well on my nose, between my eyes, and on my cheeks (closest to my nose), but crap everywhere else.  Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face.  No fun when you are trying to relax.  And while you are tilting, the pores are closing on the parts of your face that are turned away from the steam.  Pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Revlon&#x27;s Facial Sauna, and found the same thing.  Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was honestly skeptical about buying this product, but decided to go for it after reading some online reviews and being extremely desperate for quick relief. I originally bought this product when I was pregnant and was having some serious sinus problems. My doctor said to try this since I couldn&#x27;t take any medications for my cold and stuffy head. I immediately loved it!! Just using it 10 minutes made me feel better as it loosened all my sinus pressure. I actually felt it working, and the extra benefit it that you get glowing skin as well. Its like you kill two birds with one stone. After reading some of the other reviews, I think I will try adding a couple drops of eucalyptus oil to see if that helps even more. If you are still skeptical about buying this product, just go for it, it&#x27;s really worth it, and worth the inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing way to spend a couple of minutes. Bought it for acne control can&#x27;t tell if its working. At the very least its relaxing and clears up stuffy noses, just got sick recently. It does get VERY HOT though, enough to make breathing a bit painful, I found having my mouth half in and half out while I breathed through my mouth helped.</li>
            <li> Steam is a little weak, but does the job after sometime. Quality of materials is average, though the first item that was delivered to us wasn&#x27;t working. The replacement came soon after I requested for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for my sinus problem. I used the small sinus cone to concentrate steam on my nose and I used it in conjunction with essential oils and I steam every day night before I go to bed for 3 minutes using the built-in timer and it has been very useful for me. I&#x27;m delighted with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I replaced a well known name brand (expensive) with this item.  It is far more useful for me because of the timer and the signal to tell me when it&#x27;s ready...couldnt be better!</li>
            <li> I bought mine a few years ago. It&#x27;s absolutely great. Even my kid (boy age 15) loves it. It&#x27;s very therapeutic and relaxing.  I love steaming my face and then cleansing with a clay mask or using the oil cleansing method.  Very good buy and I don&#x27;t feel the need to spend almost $200 for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brush. This works well enough for me and I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe sinus headaches, and was looking on Amazon for a vaporizer, when I saw the ConAir Facial Sauna.  Someone on the review said that there is a special attachment for nasal issues, and remarked that it helped their sinus problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was desperate to find something, I purchased this product, and cannot emphasize how glad I am that I did.  Since I have received this, I have NOT had a single headache and that is remarkable, since I usually get 3 sinus headaches a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it is also good for a facial sauna, but truthfully, I have only used it for sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T HESTITATE - THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Slow to heat and not enough flow</li>
            <li> It is a great to steam bath your face before a facial at home or just to clear your sinuses....fast delivery, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would put out more steam than it does. The water area is small and take a long time to steam and doesn&#x27;t put out much steam.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It came with a facial brush system (battery operated).</li>
            <li> Nice for the price and does what it says....daughter and I enjoyed giving each other facials! Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected at all. Might have been broken, but I didn&#x27;t get anything out of this thing. Save your money and to a real sauna!</li>
            <li> I use this with the Alba papaya peel and it work really well. The steam along with a peel helps my skin look and feel younger. The exfoliating brush is just meh though</li>
            <li> This works just as advertised and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I thought the brush / sponge tool was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Awesome steamer for home facials, to clear up stuffed noses, etc. I absolutely love the way my skin looks after using it. As a bonus, it came with a rotating facial cleansing brush. This thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> fast shipping used once so far loved it had one when I was a teen  really could feel my pores opening thank you</li>
            <li> its okay .... takes  time for  the steam to come ............but i like the facial brush :):)  product is good</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could do at home steam spa treatments which would be moisturizing and help my skin look fresh. This does give you a bit of a glow. I like the timer feature so that I don&#x27;t have to think about how much time I am spending there, especially since you need to keep your eyes closed. I don&#x27;t use it super often, but if I want to pamper myself and relax this is a nice way to do it. I think its great for the price range! One thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is a bit of calcification because I didn&#x27;t use distilled water, but I think this is my fault not the product, just a heads up. I didn&#x27;t really use the brush that came with this, but I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this facial sauna! My sister has used it and my husband loves it too. Easy to use and perfect for at home facials!</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; so does my face. I use it with a towel over my head and it works!!!</li>
            <li> I had an older model Conair facial steamer and liked it very much even though the water reservoir was more shallow and it leaked some water, but it eventually died. When I received this one I was very impressed with the unit and the accessories. This unit does not leak water when I fill it to the maximum level, and I love the sinus steamer accessory, since I have migraines it really helps. The unit is a bit bigger than the old one and heats faster, I also really like the timer. The brush accessory I do not use as much, but I do like the softer bristles.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Half of the times it never powers on. Wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described, I wish it was made a little sturdier.  I might recommend this to a friend.  Maybe</li>
            <li> Been an allergy/sinus sufferer all my life. Regardless of what others say, when used correctly this unit produces hot steam and plenty of it. Put a towel over your head. You get the most benefit when you breath out when using the unit. That forces the steam against your sinuses and magnifies the effect. You don&#x27;t need those $200-$1,000 units. This one gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The steamer part is ok. Not much steam, and kinda small for my face. The little battery operated scrubber thing is a piece of junk, in my opinion. The brush was too soft to clean, and if you tried to run it on hi, (or sometimes on lo) it slung soap all over the bathroom. I donated it to Miracle Hill. I think I like the pan of hot water and a towel over the head better than this, actually. I haven&#x27;t tried the sinus part yet. I will update if it improves my experience.</li>
            <li> now i can do my own spa treatment!!!!!! i really enjoy using this product. highly recommended. i don&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> dont buy, it burns u up and is a cheap product as it broke in after using a couple of times</li>
            <li> Works Ok.I got it for nose congestion. Need to run it awhile to clear congestion. I&#x27;m sure its good for opening up pores.</li>
            <li> I had read some review here of this burning someone&#x27;s face... I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible unless they were sticking their chin in the bottom or there was a power surge.... The water barely boils, to get a good steam I put a towel over my head when using the wide facial steamer. You don&#x27;t need a towel when using the narrow sinus cone.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it my skin has definitely gotten clearer. I would recommend this to anyone, negative reviews are over exaggerated. This is easy to use, very straight forward.</li>
            <li> The Conair Facial Sauna System is a great product. It has cleaned and improve my skin. I use the product at least once a day. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is what I was expecting, easy to use and does what it needs to..</li>
            <li> Besides being great for skin care, leaving your face glowing, it comes with this nasal cone for sinus relief. Which works great for colds and sinus problem! It gives you up to 15 minutes of steamed mist. It also comes with this wonderful battery operated facial exfoliating brush and sponge attachment that I use with my exfoliating scrub and finish with the sponge for moisturizing. Love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its great for facials or if you are stuffed up and need to clear your sinuses.  Makes your skin look good.  Be careful not to get to close.  Read the directions so you wont get a steam burn.</li>
            <li> An item you can do without. Before i bought this i would sit covered over a bowl of hot water. The benefit to having this product is that you can turn on the steam as soon as you need it. Still takes like 5 min for it to actually start steaming. Once you have your face in the bowl mask you can feel a bit insecure because if that thing splashes water on you it will burn you. The battery operated exfoliating brush (included) is loud and cheap. I dont use any of these things as much i thought i would.</li>
            <li> Product performed as stated.  Wish facial piece was larger have to turn face to get steam there but still great.</li>
            <li> This thing gets way too hot and I alway have to move my face away but I love how soft and clean it makes me skin!</li>
            <li> Great value and it is exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend buying this. The cone for clearing the sinus is a wonderful bonus.</li>
            <li> I will put a facial oil on my skin before steaming. It really helps dissolve oil and plugged pores. I don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer afterwards, and it calms my acne when I steam clean my face.</li>
            <li> i love it and well getting it again and also well tell others as well the best in the world</li>
            <li> For those of you that really wants a great facial steam, this product doesn&#x27;t neccessarily perform the greatest. Its good but it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire face. With a facial steam, you want to be able to cover the entire face --- in this case, I would suggest going to the gym where they have a STEAM ROOM. But again, this product is not a bad buy... i just don&#x27;t use it much after 1-2 uses.. because i don&#x27;t think the effect is really great.</li>
            <li> This facial sauna is great but the microdermabrasion brush that comes with it is even better! Most microderm brushes on the market just vibrate but this one rotates at two speeds and goes both directions! My skin has NEVER looked so good!  The rotating brush can be a little harsh for sensitive skin types but I only use it two times a week maybe three. I try to use the steamer at least once a week and but it takes special effort to set it up and complete the whole process so its one of those things you think you&#x27;ll use all the time and then it kind of just sits there. I just wish the steamer was attached to my table so I could take a little nap while steaming...its very relaxing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware tho....exposing your delicate facial skin to extreme temperatures can cause spider veins to surface and cause broken blood vessels (capillaries) so be careful not to over do it!</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to warm up but it works. You do not get the quality steaming as with the huge machines at the spa but at least here you do not have to bother with distilled water (referring to build up). If it helps you can put a towel around to help keep the steam in. I do not bother with that, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a cup of warm water and keep replenishing. The exfoliator is great too when you have fully charged batteries, can&#x27;t tell you how it compares to a clairsonic although at 100x the price and this comes with a steamer too? I&#x27;m fine with it :)</li>
            <li> Once a month I set up a deep cleaning day for my face. Only when I sit in front of my magnifying mirror do I see, how clog my pores have gotten. This is better then picking at your face everyday and damaging your skin. I was just replacing my first Conair that I had for over 10 years and that exfoliating brush is a bargain. Your skin get so clean and firm after you steam clean it, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use this for first time,. and is pretty good, However, if you use this for first time, you have to be very patient because it looks the acne nerver end out of your face, this happen only the first time after that it is much easier the frequenly of using this machine depends of your sking in my case i only use it oneevery month.</li>
            <li> good enough for the money paid; but by far not producing as much steam as expected. as well, not a good face fit, and feels like too hot temperature, but can play around it with a towel over the head and just hovering above it.</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair facial sauna (MDF2R)about a month ago and so far i have used it 4 times without any problems. The item is really easy to use out of the box. Before buying this product i was concerned about the safety issue since someone had posted that the blue neck is not long enough and it might be too close to the hot water. Let me clear your doubts, the water is never boiling (bubbling) so there is no splashing going on and there is more then enough room (safety space) between your face and the hot water.   You will have to move your face to either sides if you wish to steam those areas. The steam is pretty stationary and only moves while you exhale from your nose. So there is a little learning curve and you will leaned to move your face to the right angle in order to make the steam hit those spots.   The easiest way to use the product is on a waist level table OR on a bathroom sink counter while sitting on a chair. That way you will be comfortable and you can hold the base of the steamer with one hand (for safety) and use the other if you wish to keep a towel over your head.   So far i have not witnessed any hissing noises since i only use the machine for 15mins or under with still little water left in the reservoir. The timer works pretty good also and it can be turned on only after the water has reached its temperature. I have not used any of the attachments since I don&#x27;t have any need for them and therefore i will not review on it.   I definitely recommend this product if you are in the market for a facial sauna. When i purchased this item little more then a month ago it was 20 bucks even and i see that it has gone down a bit since then so good luck.</li>
            <li> Works good and easy to use.Also does not take up a lot of room. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> Lot smaller than I was expecting. It works just fine. Just wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I like using it, feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself a little. It does seem to clear my pores somewhat and my face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and good quality product. It is really good for the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the middle of a head cold and pounced on using it.  I was finally able to get some relief that I could get in the shower or in a closed bathroom with the hot water steaming up the room.  This concentrated the steam where I needed it.  I did not find it too hot, so that is great.  It is also great for opening pores before I do a mask or use a strip to remove those pesky blackhead that get in one&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> Works well and recommend this product. Not sure about the battery operated brush though as it seemed pretty weak. Otherwise had none of the issues that the other reviewers complained about.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, small, does the job. Looks kinda cheaply made and it&#x27;s plastic. Ok I suppose for the short run.</li>
            <li> The steam coming from that is not that efficient and when I use face brush I felt very pain but worth for  the price</li>
            <li> The Conair - Moisturizing Mist Facial Sauna System with Timer is at most an average product. It certainly does not wor as effectively as some other reviewers suggested. The heat settings could have been a little higher for more effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Comfortable and relaxed feelings. Using everyday. Must have for every household. Not so high quality of the brush but for cheap price, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> More like 2 1/2 stars…it&#x27;s works- just not well. The steam (what little there is) doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly and there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; that makes it a bit uncomfortable to use.  I think I was hoping against hope that this would work and I could enjoy facials at home. Unfortunately I&#x27;m better off sticking to a boiling pot of water and a towel…</li>
            <li> This really hydrates the face, ad I especially enjoyed the bonus cleanser brush.  I put moisturizer on immediately afterward ad lock in the hyddration</li>
            <li> I have issues with cystic acne, and general oily skin. I bought this facial steamer in the hopes of deep cleaning my pores and healing my breakouts. The first time I used this the intensity of the steam was a bit overwhelming but when I finished I could see all the gunk the steam pulled from my pores. My skin is starting to clear up and when combined with my Olay skincare it is looking a whole lot better. I am very glad I bought this and would recommend it to anyone who fights acne.</li>
            <li> great for opening my pores but its been more than a month and now it doesn&#x27;t steam as it did when I got it.</li>
            <li> After wearing makeup 10 hours a day in this horrid southern humidity, this sauna system has become my new best friend to prevent pores from clogging.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Plus you receive the extra spin-brush.  Fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> impressive fast shipping! It only took 3 days for the product to arrived, and the product was great too, but unfortunately, after few day I brought this product, I found out that this product had reduced its price to $17.45.....I was kind of mad,wrong timing for me unfortunately. But overall it was great! I like it so much!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad some people are getting what they need out of this product, but my story is a little different. This inexpensive steamer worked pretty well for about six months. The receptacle for water was quite small and I didn&#x27;t feel like the steam was dispensing at as wide a range as I would like. It took a long time to heat up and the steam wasn&#x27;t all that hot. Eventually, it just quit heating at all I didn&#x27;t feel ripped off because it cost so little, but I agree with another reviewer here... heat up a pot of water on your stove, throw a towel over your head and buy something else with your money.</li>
            <li> I love this for quick steaming my face but love it even more when my sinuses start to act up. No more having to boil water in a pot and make a mess. This is quick easy and very little water needed so no mess. Face is clear and no more stuffy noses for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Put towel over you head and a big bowl of hot water is lot more effective than this. It holds up very little water so dry up quickly. Steam is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> Delivery come on time with all parts included and in good condition.  A nice product for least price. Water comes quick to boiling state and generate good amount of steam.  Can set the timer for sauna.  Facial brush and sponge are good in quality. Overall it good and can recommend to others.</li>
            <li> the heating bowl actually heats up fairly quickly.  mine gets bubbles within about 4-6 min.  I thought the vapor rising from it would be a lot less than what it was.  definitely a good buy.  i use the towel over my head for better coverage.</li>
            <li> Wife likes this a lot.  She said it makes a lot of steam and is gentle.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x60;s a you can say \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product.  But basically it&#x60;s cheap &amp; it would never be something im always going to use   i feel like it just burn&#x60;s my face and i dont see ANY steam   a waste of money . . .</li>
            <li> The instructions...or lack there of...was/is a real problem.  I still have some pieces in the package which are not identified.  Were the instructions written in China or were some of the sentences or paragraphs deleted???</li>
            <li> This product has helped me steam my face in a faster more convenient way as opposed to waiting for water to boil on the stove.  It requires very little water and the water heats up very quickly.  The steam is just the right temperature.. not too weak not too scalding.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> This product IS fantastic for sinus pain sufferers. Quick to set up and easy to use. The facial cone is an awkward shape and maybe a little short, but it&#x27;s reasonable for one size fits all. I bought it for sinus pain relief, so no comment on the other tools. It&#x27;s a bargain and a major necessity if you need a safe and convenient way to steam your sinuses.</li>
            <li> The product is different from what I have expected, the steam is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> This product is excellant;facial brush cleans and smooths the facial skin.  Also, the nasal sauna is good to clear nasal passages for a cold or flu. I recommend this product as an alternative to a professional facial.  This product is excellant for individuals who have very sensitive skin.  I ordered two, one for a gift.  Will order additional ones for future Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> i used to use one of these long time ago this product has bring back those days lol great , small, flexible, and get a pretty quick result but u have to use cleaner with it.... that&#x27;s all and u will notice the difference...</li>
            <li> Great product. It brought everything to the surface and I went to my esthetician the next day to extract it all. Amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no replacement for a spa facial but it is nice to use at home to open up your pores. I personally had to use it a little longer to actually feel that it was doing something. As with anything giving off steam be careful but I didn&#x27;t have any issues that could cause any injuries.</li>
            <li> I use this facial sauna for my morning quiet time. I&#x27;m retired and get up pretty early. It helps with my meditation and relaxes me in this stressful environment. I put on some nice relaxing music and let the facial sauna do its thing. It&#x27;s good to put a large towel over your head to trap all the steam which enhances the experience. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great. Easy to use and does exactly what I want for a facial system. Very reasonably priced. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got it to clean more pores and I am a  long time allergy victim lol. The day after I used this I went to work the next day and many people asked me what I had done. Also putting the towel over the head really helps. One thing I think would help is a bigger holder for the water and a longer power cord.</li>
            <li> So great for at home mini facials or for when you are sick or stuffed up with allergies</li>
            <li> I received a new item, and it love it. Thank you seller!</li>
            <li> The unit works well for sinus but for the facial, the heat is too mild. I do not like the scrubs</li>
            <li> Great item .. fast delivery .. I got it as u  decribe it thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this sauna when I had bronchitis, so that I could get some moist air into my lungs.  It proved to be very easy to use and to transport and it produced a nice flow of steam without burning my face.  I look forward to using it and it is small enough to store without using much space...  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this facial sauna if you are looking forward to any steam coming out of it.  I was so disappointed when I first used it, so I used it again to see if I would have a better experience.  Well, I didn&#x27;t.  I wish I had never purchased this product.  I get much better results and I&#x27;m 100 times happier just by boiling water and putting it in a bowl and using that as steam for a sauna.  I have not used it since and I do not plan on using it ANYMORE!  It&#x27;s still brand new basically, but I am going to give it away, that&#x27;s if anyone wants it.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money!  I read some of the reviews and decided to get it.  I wish hadn&#x27;t purchased it.</li>
            <li> Well if youre looking for a simple and easy way to steam your face, this product is great! I put a towel over my head for even more intense steam. It does the job well! My face feels refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but its not satisfying.... some what shaggy made and steam comes out very slowly and you have to wait quit a bit until steam starts working...I still use it sometimes..</li>
            <li> Okay I read a ton of reviews on this thing before I purchased it. I was most concerned that people have said it would burn your face, but I went ahead and got it anyway just in case they didn&#x27;t know how to use it. I have used this facial steamer a few times, and I was pleased with the product. However, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should do to it being bulky and needing to be stored out of sight. I have had NO issues with the functionality of this product.</li>
            <li> Great steamer! Easy to use and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend picks the funniest gifts sometimes, but this was on his list this year and well, I bought it.  It delivered really quickly, and everything was packaged well.  The unit is smaller than I expected, but then again, not sure what I expected. I don&#x27;t know if it works well, or anything else about the product because it is a gift, but I am sure it does it&#x27;s intended purpose.  If not, I will update my posting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help with my sinuses. It heats up fairly quickly. I just added a drop of peppermint essential oil and draped a towel over me to help keep the steam in and after about 15 min. I could breath just fine.  I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied. All lived up to expectations. Very neat and fast execution of the order by the seller!Goods very well-proven. After a year and more use is in good condition</li>
            <li> I just used it for the very first time while doing my weekly mini facial.  I Love it! It produces a good amount of steam.  I used a towel over my head and it felt as good as a professional machine.  By using a towel over my head, I didn&#x27;t need to put my face so close to the cone.  It did the job as described.  Good tool for the money I payed.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product along with another more expensive steamer tjat was more concentrated so it was just fpr specific areas.  I found that the other product was built with quite cheap workmanship and it also could very easily burn a person if one wasn&#x27;t ever so careful.  The Conair product works on the entire face without having to move around one small wand for full facial results.  I was so pleased I purchased one for my sister for her upcoming birthday.  Everyone can save money by not having to go to the spa!!  Great product and I don&#x27;t say that too often, but it is well worth the money which is really cheap for the work it puts out.  Quite a steal!</li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the angle of this.&lt;br /&gt;They should have made the part where your face goes in on more of a slant.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any problems with it shutting off like others did.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it would get even hotter.&lt;br /&gt;it is an okay product.</li>
            <li> Love i! Healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Output is slim to none.</li>
            <li> Loved it....used it as soon as it came in the mail. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well for congestion symptoms and opening up your nasal passages.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a lot of steam this product is not for you. It runs out of water pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t get a lot of steam. Honestly, getting a pot of boiling water and putting your face over/steam is more productive that this produce. I returned it.</li>
            <li> very little steam better than none</li>
            <li> The most disappointing part is the amount of steam.  It is very less and does not give a feel of steaming.  This is very good for kids when they have cold.  Both my kids are using this very comfortably as the steam is appropriate for them.  As for me, I use a towel to completely cover and go very close to the sauna system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush provided is of very good use.. I used it with my facial scrub and it gives a nice fresh feeling.  Overall, I would recommend this for a family with kids.</li>
            <li> I got this for my face and oily skin, this leaves my skin feeling fresh, and it definitely keeps blemishes off my face, and it helped me get rid of a sty of of my eye. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I have a teenage son that has extreme acne. He is 16 so he has been stressing about this for a while. Tried proactive and wasted a ton of money...all other products were about the same. I found out that I have sleep apnea, and I have to wear the mask at night that blows warm heated moist air in my face while I sleep. After the first week I had this huge sore on my nose. It was red and hurt. I barely touched it and a glob of blackhead stuff came out. That is when I decided that this would work for him. The principle is the same, and it is a lot cheaper that paying a stranger at a spa to do the same thing. It started clearing his face up fast.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR PEOPLE WITH ACNE! Makes my face feel so clean I love it (:</li>
            <li> I have to use this more often to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Honestly, using a pot of boiled water works better. But if this seems like less hassle it&#x27;s not terrible. It serves the purpose, but it doesn&#x27;t get your entire face.</li>
            <li> Awsome ,cleared my acne up in a week chemical free , best and only thing that worked for me.other products only made it worse.</li>
            <li> This little sauna is great for opening up your facial pores.  It steams really hot.  You kind of have to pull your face back a little bit, but it works really well.  I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and use it randomly.  It also opens up your sinuses really good.  Very refreshing makes your face feel really good after using it. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me 20$). Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> ok i must say for this the spin brush is great i dont think you can find a spin brush this cheap and works like its cost lots of money. when using the sauna it got really hot twice and on the third try it didnt get hot at all but the spin brush is still working great it takes two batterys and you can use any facial cleaner and use the brush to scrub it in more its not to soft and not to hard. the shipping was only three days. i would have to say if you are looking for a great sauna for the face this is not it but if you are looking for a great scrub the spin brush is great and well you get to use the sauna twice or maybe it might work longer for you, and i just had a faulty product. but after using the sauna my face felt really clear like it could breath and then to scrub it with the brush and wash it after my face felt clean and after that twice of using it i saw some good inprovements my face got more clear of dark spots and pore got smaller.</li>
            <li> Good for both males and females.  It works well and we hope it continues to perform as well after time.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat up and produce steam. When the buzzer sounds to let you know it is ready, it is not. You still have to wait an additional 20 minutes at least for the steam to produce.  Once the steam does start it is intermittent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend, she loves it. It looks bigger in the picture, and the box was pretty small, but it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> This facial sauna system works well. I used it one or two times and was quite happy with it and I am sure you will, too!</li>
            <li> I have found the Conair Facial Sauna to be a great item that I have now used numerous times. It delivers everything as described. I&#x27;m not sure why some reviewers claimed they were disappointed with the steam it produces, as I have found it to have plenty. I do place a towel over my head while using it so the steam is concentrated, but there is plenty. I say you can&#x27;t beat the price on this system for what it delivers. A great value!</li>
            <li> steam is not hot enough for  facial sauna. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little sauna, I use it twice a week and it cleans my skin so nicely, I thought about the reviews and the lady getting burned but I have had no problem with it and it does a great job.  Heats up and I like to put  a towel over my head for a really great steam.</li>
            <li> works well and I can notice the difference in my skin with continued use</li>
            <li> this is no good. i plugged this in, turned on the power and the inside of it popped and fizzed, flamed up and there was smoke for 3 seconds. it was then broken. i had already thrown the packaging out since i trusted this product was going to work, so i can&#x27;t return it. don&#x27;t buy this. it&#x27;s also made of cheap plastic. It&#x27;s really not that nice. plus a bit dangerous in my opinion. I&#x27;m going to stick with a pot of boiling water and towel to steam my face.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for the price. It arrived in perfect condition. I like the fact that it includes a cylindrical cup in which to pour the water to the exact amount required.  Less messy. The sauna works perfectly and only takes a few minutes for the water to start boiling.  No problem with the timer.  I can&#x27;t say as of yet that my skin is looking better, but I can say that the lines on my lips decreased dramatically after one session, and they looked plumper as well. This lasted for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;To have a facial brush included (with batteries!) was great, in that I had been interested in seeing trying one.</li>
            <li> Love this! The brush with attachments is great. My face is so much clearer and smoother</li>
            <li> I think this is very good product! I  got it today, the delivery very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I  already used,  my skin feel very good.&lt;br /&gt; My suggestion is when your finished sauna, please do a face mask, it will help your skin better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;I will keeping try....&lt;br /&gt;thank u so much.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and has lasted several years now. I like to add a few drops of essential oils to the water for an even more relaxing experience. This helps any time my face starts to break out and helps to open up my sinuses if I&#x27;m stuffy. There is a pretty loud beep that alerts you when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> Not enough steam to open any pores. Total waste of money</li>
            <li> We took it out of the box and set it up and it wouldn&#x27;t even work. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this device.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, a great face steamer for a great price. The only problem is that the big cone doesn&#x27;t really hold the steam well to actually steam your face.</li>
            <li> it helps a lot and i usually put several drops of tea tree oil to cure the acne and black head</li>
            <li> I got refunded. steam is super weak. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I&#x27;ve spent $100 before on facial steamer and yes, more expensive, works better</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this. Maybe my expectations or hopes were too high but really all this is is boiling water right in front of your face. I don&#x27;t even feel totally comfortable with using it.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  For the price it work great!  Makes you feel like you are in a spa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over two years and dont use it often but when I do it works great. Gets hot leaves my face wet, i actually have to pull away from it before time because it does get super hot. Perfect for home</li>
            <li> Unit did not work. Water did not heat at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller, completion clearer, and fine lines diminished. Plus you get the bonus facial scrubber and moisturizing attachments.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not totally upset, despite.... Bought this item which worked perfectly the first time. Unfortunately it did not work the second. Not fazed since I usually get good service from Amazon. Would be returning however.</li>
            <li> Returned, not so effective</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift and also had a chance to use it.  In my opinion it&#x27;s a good item for the price.  It&#x27;s far from a spa experience and probably will not give you the same results as a professional facial, but it DOES work.  The exfoliating brush will be as good as the facial cream/moisturizer you use with it.  I do recommend this item but note this product does take some patience and results may not necessarily be seen with one use.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item to use for relief with my sinuses.  I look forward to much relief in the future and am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved her xmas pressy thanks</li>
            <li> I am not happy with these products. The steamer doesn&#x27;t create enough steam for a facial, even with holding a towel over my head. I can hear &amp; see the water bubbling and can&#x27;t help but wonder if it&#x27;s going to bubble boiling water onto my face. The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well. Looks like it was made in the 1980&#x27;s, and made cheaply as well. Very disappointed. Will return.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and I see improvements in the way my face feels. I like using the Conair Sauna rather then doing the ol&#x27; way of warming up water since I can control the level of temperature and avoid to have the skin burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice  thing to have for the facial routine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t kick out as much steam as I want it too. I still have to make a tent over the unit to get the full steam effect that I want. Also if you don&#x27;t unplug the unit, it stays warm.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this facial sauna.  I used to have one like this many years ago when I was in college. (That truly is MANY years ago.)  It was also a Conair, and actually made just about like this one.  I used it for years, and it worked perfectly.  Somewhere along the way, I lost my first one, and I really missed having it.  When I found this on Amazon, I ordered it immediately, and I have enjoyed using it.  It is great for facial cleaning and for sinus and allergy problems.  I read a review when I ordered mine that indicated the water splashed out and burned someone, but I have had no problems with this on my first one and the one I ordered a few months ago.  It also has a facial brush which is terrific.  My first one did not have the facial brush, so this was an added treat!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would have worked so well because of the price, but I was wrong.  It did everything it said it would do.  It&#x27;s great for my sinuses also.  My daughter had congestion, and this helped along with her cold medicine (I couldn&#x27;t have gotten her to hold over a pot). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;$25 well spent for some \\&quot;me\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the subject Sauna.  However I am very unhappy with the tardy delivery as it was to be a Christmas present. The product was originally scheduled to be delivered on December 21, 2006.  I received it on January 2, 2007. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;                        Margaret Espino</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!! Package was secure, had everything it was supposed to come with. My wife uses these when she has sinus issues, and she is happy at how well it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a conair facial sauna for years (and it was still working fine when I lost/misplced it) so I had to try another Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is perfect, even better than the first one I got. Why? It&#x27;s got that safety timer, it tells you when it&#x27;s ready, it comes with two cones to choose from. Plus, it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge. So nice. I used it last night and now my skin&#x27;s glowing beautifully, like it got a polishing. It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B00005A9WP Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna With Timer]] is a nice product for steaming your face.  The size is large enough for most people with small to medium sized faces, though many will have to adjust their heads side to side to get even steaming all around.  This is a product that will most likely be used more by women than men, and the face cup seems to be designed with that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this as a gift for somebody.  While they enjoyed it, it ended up being one of those items that gets infrequent use.  I started using it after that.  After doing some testing on it myself, I found that there were some good things about it and some that could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Very fair list price and a good value for the mix of functions&lt;br /&gt;+ Seems to work relatively well, depending on your needs&lt;br /&gt;+ Nice compact size&lt;br /&gt;+ Simple controls are intuitive to figure out&lt;br /&gt;+ Decent amount of steam is produced quickly&lt;br /&gt;+ Timer feature and auto-shut-off will be a pluses for some&lt;br /&gt;+ Extra sinus attachment may be useful for some&lt;br /&gt;+ Both the normal steamer or sinus attachment help to relieve congestion&lt;br /&gt;+ 2 year warrantee is quite generous given the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The face brush doesn&#x27;t produce enough friction to really perform deep cleaning&lt;br /&gt;- More heads on the brush would have also been nice&lt;br /&gt;- The unit little water, requiring most people to refill it to finish a session&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to position yourself for comfort and full coverage&lt;br /&gt;- The edges of the bowl could have been better designed for comfort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if larger units that hold more water for steaming are sold here.  This unit requires refills for a single session.  That can be distracting when you are trying to use this alone.  The face brush includes two small heads for cleaning and moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t seem extremely effective.  Yet newer versions of the brush concept may not necessarily be better than a washcloth to gently clean away dead layers and dirt from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item works, but there are alternatives.  The jury is still out on similar tools, even those with wider cleaning heads like the [[ASIN:B000V2J3ZK Neutrogena Wave Deep Clean Foaming Pad]].  Even tools like the [[ASIN:B0018S8MZ8 Clean &amp; Clear Blackhead Eraser Kit]] may deserve consideration for cleaning out problem areas.  More established tools like the [[ASIN:B001884QDK Clarisonic PRO Professional Skin Care System]] have prohibitively high price tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many will find that the steam helps not only with skin care but also with opening the sinuses.  Higher end steamers are also hard to find, but if you are primarily looking for something to aid your sinuses the [[ASIN:B0000TN7MY Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler]] is probably worth looking into.  Finally, the number of creams and other cleansers that may achieve similar results without steaming is almost infinite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need steam at the cheapest price, this unit is a good consideration.  If you want a little bit more comfort and capacity you may want to try another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.This item works, but there are alternatives.

            <li> I just ordered this and it is exactly what I wanted. This definately makes your face feel much softer and helps rid it of impurities. I would recommend it to anyone who didn&#x27;t mind spending a little more time about once a week helping their skin out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This product works quite well and the timer is a definite plus.  The additional accessories are very nice extra that are not offered with other machines.</li>
            <li> Great macine, works really well, and great price!</li>
            <li> nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my mom.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this steamer for 6 months.  If you are looking for strong steaming action, this is NOT the product for you.  The only way I could get a good steam was to put a towel over my head while using it.  Some days it steams really well and other days it doesn&#x27;t.  Not sure why this happens.  I don&#x27;t steam for more than 11 minutes and it works okay.  The warm up takes a few minutes (make sure you have the water in before turning it on because doing the opposite may not produce a good steam before the beep).  The quality is good and it has held up for me so far.  I don&#x27;t use the accessories (brush etc).  I wish it steamed a bit stronger and was more consistent day to day.  All in all it does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to help my daughter with her sinus problems. We live in the south so pollen, mold and other allergens are almost always present. She used this sauna the first day it arrived and has used it almost every OTHER day since it arrived. She said it helps her breath easier, lessens the severity of her sinus headaches and she sleeps better at night. My wife and I have a netipot and a SinuPulse Elite that we use for our sinus problems. Our daughter said that she much prefers this facial sauna system to either of our products. She is a senior in college and has told all of her friends about this item. SO, I guess she would recommend this item to women/females. Thanks CONAIR!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, it is just too small to steam your entire face at once, and it gets pretty hot, but not as hot as I would like. I use it, but still find myself using the ol&#x27; pot on the stove every now and then. The nice thing about it is that I can sit down instead of hovering over a stove and don&#x27;t have to worry about inhaling gas from the stove.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if the plastics on this unit are nontoxic? Putting one&#x27;s face in a steam bath enveloped in plastic seems illogical to me, esp. understanding that plastics cause a good part of our health problems today.  NOTE: I&#x27;m rating it mid-range due to this being a question posed for information gathering, and it not being a comment (per se), concerning the product.</li>
            <li> This piece piece is great. You absolutely need it for a great and healthy skin. j k k k k</li>
            <li> Many years ago I owned a facial sauna and I really loved its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this sauna is not as tall or as heavy and it is hard to find a place where it can be utilized without squatting or fearing it will tip over.  Even though this is advertised as &#x27;wide&#x27; my face just fits inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had heeded the reviewer who panned this product earlier.  This is probably going to end up in the give-away pile and I will put a towel over a steaming pot to accomplish the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have many scars on my face due to pimples, i wanted to use this before the derma roller. I literally had to put my face in the cylinder to have steam evenly on my face</li>
            <li> best thing i ever purchased. easy to put together and use, i recommended this product to all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I noticed a difference in my skin immediately after my first use. It&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the purchase! I recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> The shape is awkward to fit the face and you constantly need to rotate face for steam to reach sides of face.</li>
            <li> Best beauty buy. I am very pleased with my purchase. I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.</li>
            <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;It is great for facials as well as those plagued with allergies and any sinus condition.&lt;br /&gt;Compact for easy storage&lt;br /&gt;Quick heat up</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a girls night in. It&#x27;s soothing warm and gives a very all over clean feeling.  I receommend it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this sauna. It is very relaxing w/some tranquil music playing before you wash/moisturize your face. thanks</li>
            <li> Really awesome results. 1st I felt that the steam won&#x27;t last long but it last about 30 min and it uses very little water. It feels very soothing and the steam doesn&#x27;t burn your face. I Love It. Defiantly worth the price</li>
            <li> Its not a horrible product but I feel that I can get the exact same result simply being in a hot shower/bath to open up my pores....maybe other people got more use of it, but for me I didnt see any spectacular results....It is cheap so worth a try for some</li>
            <li> Just received it today, and it was very easy to set up.  I used it right away, and I really like it.  It&#x27;s much nicer than using a pan of hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li> This facial sauna works well so far. You do have to use it one or two times a week to keep the good results it gives, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought this product.  Some said it wasn&#x27;t wide enough for the sides of their face.  It fit just great.  Some said it didn&#x27;t produce enough steam or it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  I had lots of steam and it was hot.  I have no problems at all.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love the conair facial sauna. It makes a great gift. It works really well and actually makes your skin look really clean. Ive noticed a change in my face and the it looks after I use it. I recommend this to all mu friends. This is a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to alleviate symptoms from seasonal allergies. Every spring  my eyes itch and I&#x27;m constantly sneezing. Most allergy medications are too expensive and/or ineffective or cause drowiness. After researching the benefits of steam treatements for people like me I purchased the Conair Facial Sauna. I realize this product is designed for cosmetic reasons but it does the same thing the more expensive allergy/sinus steam machines do for a third of the price. I used it at night for 5 minutes and my eyes stop itching and I get restful sleep. I don&#x27;t know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars, because its hard to fit your face into it. The face thing should be wider, and because of this I&#x27;m often uncomfortable from trying to twist my face in a certain position, to make sure it gets some steam. The scrub is great, the shipping was great, and so is the timer. Guess for the price it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> if you have facial problems this will help you as well as SINUSes  i really love this...You have to try it.</li>
            <li> My face has never been this clear it feels really good. Its a must buy. Great item love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this versus paying $45 at the salon. For once in my life, my face has lasted more than five minutes without being greasy at all. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it practically shrunk my pimples and made my face feel fresh &amp; if every pore is alive. I&#x27;m the kind that no matter how many times I wash, what I use or how I use it... That grease look is there. It was GONE!!!! And after ONE use! Here&#x27;s the other thing, it has a special sinus took you can use, it works wonder. My lips get chapped from breathing through my mouth all the time. I even had surgery for my sinus to no avail (hurt more than labor), even that didn&#x27;t do much. After using it with a towel (locks in the stream perfectly), I stood up and took a breather through my nose. I started coughing from how well I could breath versus the strain my nose goes through daily. Best purchase of my life. Forget doctors for sinus, forget the salon for better skin and way less acne... It&#x27;ll be the best thing you&#x27;ve bought for yourself versus another pair of heels you can&#x27;t even walk in. Do it, I am so happy right now with each breath I take. I don&#x27;t feel exhausted. I feel absolution.</li>
            <li> I got mine to $21 n it works great! i lover it really.. if i had say about it, is that the brush powerful but it works and it was $21 lol...</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial steamer.  The only thing I would change:  I would make the plastic part where you put your face taller.</li>
            <li> Excelente articulo para realizarme mis limpiezas de cutis en mi casa, ahora no tengo que acudir al cosmetologo porque yo misma puedo hacer lo que ellos hacen en la comodidad de mi hogar y sin gastar mas de lo debido</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if I like the facial brush or not as I bought a Calrisonic and use that instead, but I will say that I like using the sauna to steam my face before putting a mask on and occasionally after I put on moisturizer to really let it seep into my pores. It heats up quickly and allows you to steam your face pretty well. I do have to turn my face to get all the areas and I usually put a towel draped over my head and the sauna system to keep the steam enclosed to get a better pore-opening steam.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to overfill, water may splash and it&#x27;s boiling water</li>
            <li> Bought to replace one I lost in move. Don&#x27;t use facial scrubbers , but as steamer on face or sinus great.</li>
            <li> Brush heads &amp; applicator not much yo speak of, won&#x27;t use them. But steamer works good s.o far</li>
            <li> It works well enough.</li>
            <li> My only thought is that a little longer cord would be nice. Otherwise pleased</li>
            <li> This is a life saver for sinus sufferers.</li>
            <li> Steam is pretty hot. Careful not to burn your face.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Amazing price. I&#x27;ve been adding 6 to 8 drops of essential oils to each capful of distilled water to achieve the effect I&#x27;m looking for. Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it everyday and my face feels and looks good. ( I think I look a little younger too, LOL !)</li>
            <li> I have not used the sauna part because of the caution not to use an extension cord &amp; I can&#x27;t find a place in my small apartment that is near enough (unless I kneel on the floor).  I do use the brush a lot.  This surprised me because I didn&#x27;t think it would help,  but it does!  I am happy because a shower opens my pores &amp; cleanses, and the brush does this when I don&#x27;t shower.  My skin is extremely sensitive.  As soon as I figure out what to do with the extension cord caution thing.  I will write back about the sauna part.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to hear about the previous comment about it exploding in the face--I have had no such problems and have used this Conair product for several months every evening. After watching the \\&quot;Secret Life of a Bionerd\\&quot;&#x27;s youtube tutorial on using a mixture of oils as a way to combat oily skin (sounds crazy I know!) I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are better by far than devices that cost triple (including the Clairisonic facial scrubber). I have oily skin but using harsh astringents really just makes you skin produce more oil to combat being dried out. I have never given myself a home facial like this and it&#x27;s a real treat! 5 minutes a day of zen time before I hop into bed and my pores are open and ready for any creams or serums you may collect--especially those pricy Sephora samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty idiot proof as there is a tiny fill cup you fill to the line, hit a button to start it --&gt; it beeps, then you hit another button for the timer and it shuts off automatically after how ever long you have it set for. Easy routine to add to your skin care that offers incredible results and feels so relaxing to have the hot steam. Sure you could use a towel, but wetting towels over and over again and washing them versus leaning over this machine that continuously creates steam and is easy to empty and fill....it really is a no brainer. I recommend this to seasoned beauty veterans and first timers alike. So happy with the product, even my boyfriend is thinking of getting one!!</li>
            <li> Better system than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not hot to produce an expected effect on the face. Will update after several use.</li>
            <li> This is not a strong sauna at all. I feel like I would get more steam from just standing by a hto sink</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2007, used it less than 5 times, and just had to throw it away due to leaking.  The steam was sufficient, especially for the price, but the workmanship must suck and I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now in 2 days for taking steam for my nasal decongestion. Works as expected. Better than spending $35 on the Vicks steam inhaler. Can be used for facial steam as well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot and buy it.  I received it two days ago and I really like it, Face feels nice and soft and getting all them impurities out of your pores is a plus,  I bought it for my allergies mostly, and it works good for that too, when I wake up stuffy I use that and it helps instantly. I would buy it again if it were to break. :)</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of steamers before buying this  and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this one! It starts to steam quickly, can last a half hr+, comes with great attachments and has a convenient timer. I love it! Also, fits whole face nicely!</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewed, it took a while for the steam to come up.  It&#x27;s small so the steam comes out very little.  I order for my sinus problem so it works fine for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying for face then I recommend that you buy a higher end product.  In conclusion, I am getting what I paid for...:-(</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2009 and I just used it for the 3rd time the other day. It&#x27;s not a bad product but it&#x27;s not really a useful product either. The amount of steam is not that great and I hate to say it but I think it&#x27;s easier just to use a pan with a towel. The face brush it came with was awesome and totally worth the price of the product but it didn&#x27;t last very long. I dropped it in the shower too many times and from the water getting in the battery compartment it just stopped working. I just spent $30 on the olay face brush and it&#x27;s almost the same but I did like the conair one better.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say that it is a steamer and it is supposed to give off heat, but it gets really hot if you don&#x27;t move your face around. I think the design of it can be improved to give off an even amount of steam everywhere. I found that the chin/mouth area got extremely hot for a few seconds and when it became unbearable I moved my face. It does do its job for sure which is to open your pores. My face certainly felt softer after using. I didn&#x27;t use distilled water either, I used filtered water. Easy to use, and easy to put together so it was a good investment for that reason.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because I loved the actual unit.  I follow the directions exactly and my face felt nice and clean, fresh. The brush that comes with it is weakly powered. It barely can circulate when pressure is applied to it.  The unit is worth the money tho.</li>
            <li> Not professional by any means but adequate for home.  The key is to put a towl over your head and around the steamer to get maximum results.  I like to put a drop of lavender oil or peppermint oil in the water for the sinuses and the relaxing smell.  It works great, Iv&#x27;e let boil down to no water at all and haven&#x27;t been splashed or scalded in any way.  I haven&#x27;t used the facial scrub thing but it&#x27;s for exfoliating and I&#x27;m sure works fine.  I only wanted the sauna machine and that facial scrubber was just a bonus.  It&#x27;s all really well priced too.  I gave it 4 stars because I LIKE it, I don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This uit is easy to use and very effective for the cold weather and homes with less than average humidity--great for clearing nasal passages too.</li>
            <li> I love my conair facial steamer. It deep cleanses my skin,  opens my pores, and serves as steamer for my sinuses. I suffer from sinusitis on a frequent basis and the steamer really helps.</li>
            <li> I received one of these as a gift a couple of years ago, and hoped that it would be a good way to add moisture and remove blackheads in between facials.  It never worked well in my opinion.  The brush was way too soft to do much of anything, it took a long time to warm up, and once it did the steam wasn&#x27;t consistent.  I also didn&#x27;t really enjoy having to put my head in the plastic area to really get the benefit of any steam.  It was confining, and you have to have the perfect height table and chair to really make it work.  I found myself at my kitchen table with a towel over my head to try to hold some of the steam in when the unit would stop cycling steam and waiting for it to head up again.  Overall, I found it inconvenient and not very useful.  Certainly not the &amp;#34;spa facial steam&amp;#34; experience I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you were getting it to help clear sinuses or something it would be worthwhile.  But if you&#x27;re hoping for a relaxing steam session, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.  I tossed the whole unit eventually, it was just taking up space on a shelf.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I like this product.  I wish the plastic cone where you place your face was shaped differently.  My  face doesn&#x27;t rest comfortably in it.  This design may be to allow for air to get into it to prevent suffocation.  I was surprised by how little water it needed.</li>
            <li> Ok product. Nothing great.</li>
            <li> i thought i&#x27;d try again with this since it&#x27;s been a few years since i&#x27;d last owned one. i have cycstic acne, huge bumps under the skin not caused by a cleanliness issue but by hormones. had to get an Rx to fix that issue. this product didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> this does wonders on my face!! a must use!</li>
            <li> Great value, creates a gentle steam facial quickly, as well as having a separate attachment for inhalation therapy. The only little con is that I don&#x27;t think the timer runs as long as it states on the dial (i.e. The seven minute cycle selection seems to run faster than that).  Otherwise, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product it makes my face feel amazing. Very soothing too...leaves my face feeling fresh, love it :-)</li>
            <li> This sauna was awesome to use. I would steam my face once a week and I definitely see a small difference in my skin after each use. I would follow up with a clay mask so it draws out everything from within my pores. Another greater alternative I use is adding tea with the water. Results was amazing. My face instantly looked much firmer and glowing. The only downside is the steam is a little slow. I wish it was stronger and generated more steam. It is still sufficient, you just have to take the extra time to wait for the steam. Great tool overall!</li>
            <li> system works as expect. it&#x27;s too small to cover whole face,  timer is only good for 15 minutes and not help...</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had a sinus infection. After purchasing every type of over the counter medicine and a neti-pot, this was the only thing that helped me. After steaming for 15 minutes a day, withing 3 days I was breathing normally again. I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use nightly as part of my nightly facial cleansing process. Prior to this, I had been relying on the steam from my kitchen steamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I ordered this product but soon found that it didn&#x27;t live up to expectations. Unfortunately, the piece used for the face is very small and does not allow for the steam to reach all parts of the face. Additionally, the steam comes out in a very weak, thin stream, making it almost impossible to fully open and cleanse the pores. Because the water reservoir is so small, the water runs out pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is absolutely useless. I&#x27;m disappointed in it and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the money. Hope this info helps someone!</li>
            <li> I actually returned this facial because the water reservior was very small. You have to stop to refill it about every 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The product it´s good.&lt;br /&gt;But i had a problem with the payment:  i shopped a product by 29.47 and my bank says i have to pay 32.19.</li>
            <li> Easy to use , multipurpose</li>
            <li> I bought this to give my boyfriend &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; facials since his skin is  sensitive and he tends to get a lot of blackheads and I am truly pleased with this system it is easy to use and the results are great (nothing better then a professional facial but this is close to it!)</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the purchase, delivery was quick, and the price was right. Thank you!</li>
            <li> the amount of water it holds is too less, and the steam is too light, like water vapor. I&#x27;ve seen better and stronger steamers</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and my face feels so much better. I do add some Epsom Salt Eucalyptus Spearmint in the water. it feels so good and really clears up my face.</li>
            <li> this product really helps, very easy to set and use.  This is the first time I use this system and it really works!!</li>
            <li> For those of you who are thinking about buying this and are skeptical, do not buy it!!! The day I got it I was so excited to try it. Well I didnt even get a chance to do that because it did not turn on. They sent me a defected face steamer that would not even turn on! So pissed. I returned it right away. it is cheaply made and it looks like it was made in the .1980&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes longer than a few minutes to warm up, but once it is steaming full strength it works miracles. I just turn it on while washing my face with the exfoliator brush before hand. The steamer opens your pores, and helps pull out impurities. I put a mask on directly afterwards to complete my facial. It also primes your face to get better results from your anti-aging and moisturizing products. You can also add a couple of drops of your favorite essential oils to help you relax or aid in the clearing of problem skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product.  It is rather relaxing to sit and pamper yourself.  The unit makes short of a hissing noise as the water boils, but it&#x27;s not too loud.  Make sure to keep an eye on the water level.  It shouldn&#x27;t all evaporate if you only do this for, say, 10 minutes, however longer times require water to be added and if you don&#x27;t add the water in time sort of a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; smell results.  Add the water before putting the blue top on - otherwise it sort of pours out here and there.  I don&#x27;t like to use the timer because the beep noise is really loud and annoying.  I wish the face cone was longer as well (as someone else noted) - while the steam doesn&#x27;t hurt my nose - it does sting my forhead if I tilt my head to steam that area.  I also do not like how your hairline and sides of your face to not get steamed unless you turn your head, which is uncomfortable.  I recommend putting the unit on a few phonebooks (if you don&#x27;t mind possibly spilling water on them) to ease have to bend your back and/or neck so far down.  Keep napkins nearby to move the unit - so as to not burn your hands if water spills.  Don&#x27;t put lotion on your face or else it will end up smeared all over the blue part (eye area might be ok).  The unit I purchased did not come with a face scrubber, so I have no comment on that.  If you take the blue part OFF the unit (once it cools off and you remove the water), it will better fit in the original box for storage!!</li>
            <li> We all know that when you buy a product, you shouldn&#x27;t actually expect it to do what the ads claim it will do. At best, you can hope for a mildly effective effort on its part. Not with this sauna. After one use I was astonished at how smooth and glowing my face was, and kept touching my cheeks all day to feel how soft they were! The steam is just right--not too hot, yet effective--although I had to put my face down into the opening in order to really get the benefit. The microderm abrasion tool also works as advertised to scrub your skin without causing any pain, and the moisturizer pad did a great job of working moisturizer into my skin. And, as I said, afterward my skin looked better than it ever has, and my pores looked cleaner than they have in years. In fact, I had a professional facial at a good day spa not a year ago, and I don&#x27;t remember having had results this good!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone, without hesitation!</li>
            <li> The dual cones are most functional.  The one smaller in diameter is great for helping clear sinuses, the larger one for giving facial pores a good \\&quot;sweat bath.\\&quot;  A fine addition to my health and beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Am using it to make steam infused with herbal oil for relief of bronchitis. I use it 6-10 times a day. I&#x27;ve had no problems at all. It is simple and easy to use. Jim</li>
            <li> Sorry I have to write this, last month I bought this one and received within a week. Thanks for quick shipping.  But when i received I gave to my friend as a Christmas gift.  Unfortunately, the unit didn&#x27;t work at all.  She didn&#x27;t tell me until now and I really surprised.  I know she is a electrical engineer and know how to use the machine.  Well, I felt so bad and I don&#x27;t know what to do with the machine. so I tell her to trash the unit and sorry about that.  I don&#x27;t know how to contact amazon and tell them what happen but i would like amazon customer please check the product before send it out.  I didn&#x27;t complain, just want to let amazon know my situation.  Thanks for reading this. Regards.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I use it every night. It makes your skin feel so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Product works good.  It is a little hot if you put your face directly into the funnel and drape a towel over it like it says to.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this item with my clogged sinuses in mind and it has delivered.  There are no miracles in life, but this is a good bandaid until that happens.  Not only do I clear my sinuses, but I get a skin treatment.  How good is that?</li>
            <li> Really great system.  Makes at home facials easy.  Attachments are one of the best parts. Added bonus -- my boyfriend has sinus problems and uses the smaller cone for steaming and it really helps for a while.</li>
            <li> I received this from my wishlist and now I&#x27;m thinking of grabbing a few for relatives. It works great. I can see a difference in the moisture retention of my face &amp; neck areas.</li>
            <li> This was in constant use for a week and then I had to quit for a few weeks. When I was able to use it I liked it. I bought it for the nasal steamer but really liked what the facial sauna was doing to my skin. I look forward to using it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the smaller cone due to sinus problems.I use it everyday and no longer have sinus headaches .</li>
            <li> This product is very effective &amp; affordable for the amount you receive compared to the other facial steamers out there! It&#x27;s a great value overall &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> CONAIR_Very small, not like my vintage one that bit the dust. It says to use tap water and had a small receptacle for filling accurately--included.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why this one has a full view into the &amp;#34;steam boiler&amp;#34;receptacle vs. my vintage one that had an interfacing cover with holes to protect from steam bursts/burns. The manufacturer may want to add one of these to prevent expensive recalls and consumer danger. My product though barely was hot (warm) enough to make any steam and I had to put a towel over my head with the unit just to get warmth of a steam glow going after 5 minutes. There is a better sinus &#x27;steam&#x27; from the shower than from this unit as the temp is so &#x27;lame&#x27; on delivery. The little derma machine included is a cute bonus, but I can do the same thing with a mini face brush with more accuracy and less mess +no AA batteries needed.&lt;br /&gt;A positive is that it is easy to use for travel and probably good to travel with if you are going to a very arid region or desert.&lt;br /&gt;Limited instructions on setting up things, but maximum precautions included with product!</li>
            <li> We bought this because my husbands doctor told us to. My husband is 70 and he had pneumonia with sinus situs and the doctor told him to breath in the steam. Of course this is after he has been on antibiotics for 20 days. This is at the tail end of his pneumonia and sinus situs. This works great and my husband is getting better. The doctor told us it would help to heal the sinus. We were worried about bacteria but there is none with this machine because you can wash it and it&#x27;s only steam. It has worked great so far and i am looking forward to using it as a facial for me.</li>
            <li> So, I just got my steamer in the mail today and just ripped it open. I had a rather large zit on my face (that I thought might have been a cyst it was so painful, large, and unyielding), so I decided to buy the steamer as a last resort after three days of trying all sorts of natural and not so natural remedies to bring all of the gunk to the surface. Let me tell you, after ten minutes of steaming in this facial sauna (i put a towl over the back of my head to keep trap even more steam) my pores were ready and willing to release all of the blackheads and junk. This product is a godsend, i&#x27;m definitely going to use it for those pesky &amp;#34;once-a-month&amp;#34; zits as well as just doing self-facials every now and again</li>
            <li> Product is a big failure. totally waste of money and time. Its completely useless.</li>
            <li> Folks, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one . It&#x27;s a completely useless product- doesn&#x27;t give any steam . Plus in my case it stopped working all of a sudden - had to return the product and ask for a refund which the amazon guys did - Big THANKS to them for helping me otherwise it was a waste of investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What surprises me is that people are giving it such rave reviews which it doesn&#x27;t deserve at all. Infact I had gone for the product after reading those reviews only. Anyways, if you are still looking for a decent steamer - go for JSB Steamer Vaporizer or any other product but certainly not Conair.</li>
            <li> I read the review about this product making the hot water explode into face, with no apparent reaction time to get away from device.  I decided not to get this one because of that review.  I don&#x27;t want to risk burn scars on my or my daughter&#x27;s face.  I am purchasing the Revlon brand instead.</li>
            <li> Worked for one day... Then wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Annoyed. Sending it back!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this Facial Sauna. She&#x27;s had some sinus issues as of late and after purchasing this I noticed that the problems were greatly diminished.  The product arrived in new condition and on time, it&#x27;s light weight and very portable, easy to use and easy to clean.  If I ever need another one like this, I&#x27;ll be purchasing it from this seller.</li>
            <li> I did not like it because of the shape of the face cone. It&#x27;s dimensions do not fit my face at all: too wide across. The vapor then escapes because there is room left between my cheeks and the walls of the cone. I ended up putting a towel over my head  - which defeats the whole purpose of having this device. Just go with a pot of water!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this steamer for the last 9 years.  My first lasted about 8 years, but got a little crusty by the end of it.  The timer option is great so  I don&#x27;t have to keep track of time.  This one includes a convenient measuring cup.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the exfoliation tool (prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda), but I guess it does the job.  I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads.</li>
            <li> it looks nice, and very convenient to use. No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
            <li> I did not order this product on Amazon. I ended up ordering it from a different site to save a few dollars. I just received the unit today so this is a review of my initial thoughts. I&#x27;m going to review the sauna and spin brush in two separate parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair Facial Sauna:&lt;br /&gt;This sauna is great and the price is a great deal! I decided to test the product out and try all the features to make sure it is operating properly. I am very pleased. Before using I read over the manual before taking anything out or assembling anything, just to assure I wouldn&#x27;t break anything or void any possible warranties. It states that you are supposed to use distiller water ONLY so please keep that in mind to increase the longevity of the product. I don&#x27;t have distiller water at the moment but for the purpose of this test run I used warm faucet water, but will use distiller water for all future use! I followed the directions and filled the reservoir up to the max fill line, placed the facial nozzle on and plugged the unit in. Then turned it on and waited for it to warm up (3 minutes). There&#x27;s no burst of steam so if that&#x27;s what your looking for this is not the steamer for you. Looking at the unit you wouldn&#x27;t think it was a sufficient amount of steam to do justice but I did take the advice of the manual and placed a towel over my head to concentrate the steam and it was wonderful. The direction warn you to not place your face directly ON the unit but to hover over it. I think this is important to decrease any chance of injury. You still get a good facial doing so. I then replaced the facial nozzle for the nasal nozzle to concentrate on my sinuses. It felt good to loosen up the build up in my nose! :) I did all of this with the timer set to 4 minutes just to test out how well the timer works. After four minutes there&#x27;s a subtle beep and the unit shuts off. I love how whether you use the timer or not the unit will shut off (30 minutes without the timer and up to 15 minutes withtimer) to eliminate the chance of overheating. The manual instructs you to keep an eye on the water level because it will deplete after 10-20 minutes. Then you should just replace it. So overall, after just using the unit for 4 minutes, 2 minutes facial and 2 minutes nasal, I&#x27;m already loving the product! I have sinusitis and think this will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Spin Brush:&lt;br /&gt;The spin brush looked very simple and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it. I made sure to use energizer batteries to test it, just to ensure maximum power. There&#x27;s a high and low option on the side of the unit. I tested it by pressing it up against my face gently and with greater force while it was on. Shockingly with force it still operated well. I have another facial brush that vibrates but I think I will replace using that to use this spin brush. I think I will get a better cleaning experience with the spinning feature breaking down the dead skin on my face. So overall, I think the spin brush will be used a lot and looking forward to some great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price paid I think it&#x27;s a bargain to get the facial sauna AND spin brush. The manual instructs you to clean your face PRIOR to using the facial sauna. I remember reading a review where a woman used the sauna then cleaned her face and complained of burning. Not a good idea. A facial sauna, nasal sauna and a spin brush all in one package for less than $25 is great!!! I just hope it lasts long enough. Thanks for reading. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Nice system for a great price!  I use this to steam my sinuses and it works great!!!  It was shipped very fast.  A side benefit of steaming my sinuses is that it has made my skin really soft.  Very good product for anybody to buy!</li>
            <li> I like this unit. It takes a little while to get up the steam, but it works really well. I really like the smaller cone for nasal congestion. That isn&#x27;t why I bought it, but that seems to be the attachment getting the most use.</li>
            <li> This product let me down.  It doesn&#x27;t produce enough steam to make any difference to my face.  Just not enough power.</li>
            <li> This is something nice to have , i even let my mum use it and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews made me afraid like boiling water comes into your face but so far i used it 3 times and it was safe and good.&lt;br /&gt;Only make sure that there is enough water as described and things will be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good price and comes with a useful brush as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item recently and returned it immediately. I am a skin care professional and wanted something to use at home. I had another similar type home unit in the past which was far better and am sorry I don&#x27;t still have it now, since no one seems to make any of high quality anymore. The Conair is very slow to steam and when it does heat up it produces such a little amount of steam. Not enough for an effective facial steam. I&#x27;m better of heating a pot of water and using that as my steamer. Like their blow dryers, they are practically ineffective. I used to be able to rely on Conair to produce quality products, but in the past several years the quality has definitely declined.</li>
            <li> the steam is not enough for facial it does not open the pores. i was disappointed with this product I have seen other brand work better than this one.</li>
            <li> The Conair Facial Sauna system was properly packaged; shipped quickly; easy to use and set up.  It is definitely worth every penny! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Steam gets really hot. Worth It&#x27;s cost! People complain about not enough room to hold the water but for 15 minutes at a time it is perfect and the right amount. I recommend!</li>
            <li> love how easy this is to use  --  once or twice a week really improves my skin and clears trouble spots</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to be effective.  also steam comes out too slow.  better just to put a pot of water on the stove or an electric tea kettle.  this product is a waste of money and clutters the environment with useless items that are most likely thrown away..</li>
            <li> I honestly love this steamer, I like to pamper myself and this is perfect, I sometimes add oils to relive sinus pressure.</li>
            <li> I love this machine. Could I say anymore...I will. I like to keep my face clean, and steam is the easiest, safest and more effective way to do this. It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out, while adding moisture to the skin, then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean. You can use it every day, or night and the results will be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well for your sinuses too. I put this on my counter and lean over it, just don&#x27;t wiggle it or hit it while it is on. It has been safe for me and heats up fast. I really love my machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was great, it worked well to cleanse before the steam, but it isn&#x27;t waterproof and eventually broke.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the microdermabrasion (spelling?) thingamabob, but the steamer works nicely. Makes steam. I use it before I shave my face.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Put a towel over your head to get the most steam trapped on your face before whatever it is you&#x27;re going to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and can&#x27;t complain. The timer option (up to 15 min) is nice. It would be nice if it had more of a chin rest instead of the hard hot plastic (it tends to make me sleepy and my face will bob and hit it). The brush is ok. Even on its highest setting it tends to lag for lack of a better word. The low speed is too low to get any good use out of it and the high is better, but you have to use it really lightly. The slightest pressure to the face tends to stop it. So you have to use it lightly. Which is probably how you&#x27;re supposed to exfoliate, but I use a bead wash and need a little more pressure to really work it up and exfoliate the area. Over all I&#x27;d highly recommend it as a cheaper alternative to the pricier systems that do the same thing. Might want to go buy a different brush though.</li>
            <li> My wonderful .. Not yet used it ..The problem is that a 120-volt electric line only ..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do something water so I can do Ba Sthaddamh .. Greetings to you</li>
            <li> I am using this product for past 4 years. Mine got old enough to replace with a new one, but could not find anything else better and so order it again. Only disappointment is, I din&#x27;t find a spare brush head anywhere.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses for her skin and for clearing nasal areas for singing.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it almost daily. Very helpful with breakouts, breathing, and overall look of skin! Great value over all!</li>
            <li> when you have a cold, this is an excellent way to help your throat and sinuses. have had no problems with water pops, but I fill it to the line as told, not overflow it. it may not be as convenient as the purmist ,  as it has too sit flat, but its much cheaper and works, I feel, better. the warm moist air sure does help the nose and throat.</li>
            <li> Feels like a real facial sauna, but you have to have the time to sit with a towel over your head, which means you can&#x27;t read or watch TV for the few minutes you are supposed to allow. I used it a lot at first, ut now it is just sitting on a storage shelf.f.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST ORDER WITH AMAZON AND BEING A SENIOR AND NOT COMPUTER SAVVY, MY ORDER WENT SMOOTHLY AND I RECEIVED THE ORDER RATHER QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONAIR FACIAL SAUNA CAME RATHER QUICKLY, PACKAGED SECURELY.  IT WORKS AS I HAD EXPECTED IT TO. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM AND NOT HESITATE TO ORDER ROM AMAZON AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Does not produce one bit of steam.  Followed instructions exactly and nothing happened, the water got warm, but nothing else.  No steam.  Tried it again a few days later, same result.  Returning promptly!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> This thing is the really awesome. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this to open my pores before cleaning it and it works well for that purpose. It&#x27;s very easy to use although it doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean..I mean, you practically just use only water in it, so, yeah. Just has to handled with care, I guess.</li>
            <li> Personally I think that this sauna works great . I&#x27;ve used it for a facial steamer and it heats up fast and gives out a great amount of steam. Also when my sister was sick we used it as a vaporizer and added some liquid camomile and  mint to the water to help sooth her head cold.</li>
            <li> I love how convenient &amp; user friendly this facial sauna is. I have been using this item for the past 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m wondering how I ever lived without it for this long! I have been frustrated with my skin for years &amp; couldn&#x27;t find the perfect balance. I usually break out every so often &amp; now I can see a tremendous change in my skin. I have little to no acne with skin smoother than I&#x27;ve ever seen it. The steam is perfect. Not too hot for your skin, meanwhile getting the perfect spa effect. Also loving the exfoliate tool that it comes with. A must have! I also recommend purchasing \\&quot;body toolz double loop facial skin care tool\\&quot;. This tool is awesome for clearing pores &amp; a gentle more effective way to handling your pimples.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order it at first because of the mix reviews, but it turned out to be pretty good. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i dont see how is it possible that 15 ml water can burst up so high and get your face a third degree burnt.</li>
            <li> i love the way it make my face feels when i have a cold and i love brush soft and exfoliating</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my mother-in-law. She had been looking for one. She loves this facial sauna and uses it regularly. It is easy to use with great results. Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I recieved the Revlon RVSP3503B1 as a gift. It never worked! I returned it and was sent a new one. It didn&#x27;t work either. I complained again, sent the second one back and finally tried the Conair. It worked beautifully. The Revlon gets zero stars and the Conair gets 5.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Easy to use. Nice coverage of face.  Daughter has added it to her regimen to treat her acne, it is helping to clear up her skin.</li>
            <li> good.. i use it most of the times. does take some time to heat up. maybe 5 minutes, but then acts fine.</li>
            <li> Great product and gets a very nice steam.</li>
            <li> Got 2 days ago and only used a few times, each time less than 5min. Now the power button doesn&#x27;t work already. The water won&#x27;t heat up. Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good steamer but The water will evaporate fast, water with drip out the steamer so if your careful hot water will get on you. Not necessarily burn you but just be careful. The cup is smallI fell it should have been bigger.</li>
            <li> Cheaper in Walmart.  Not great quality, lightweight cheap feeling plastic.</li>
            <li> Love this it is a perfect face steamer to clear pores</li>
            <li> Not so steamy. You could get way more steam over a sink with a towel  or bowling water in a bowl with a towel.  Waste of money and space.</li>
            <li> I get razor bumps on the side of my face but this really targets the front of my face and not the sides. I have to modify to make it work</li>
            <li> this thing works great its very refreshing for ur skin..after using the sauna wash ur face with ur fav face wash and see how soft and clean ur face feels and looks afterwords..</li>
            <li> very fast delivery, like it. :)</li>
            <li> Small cup holder but steam is ok. Glad it has aut-shutoff feature.</li>
            <li> This item works great on my face and nostrils. I don&#x27;t have to use this more than ten minutes and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This little sauna works perfectly and makes a lot of steam.  My skin felt great after using it!!</li>
            <li> If you are not used to a facial steamer of this sort, it will take some time to adjust to the temperature but I think it works wonders in softening the skin before you remove any blackheads etc.</li>
            <li> Loved this! Great product very stable and easy to work. I&#x27;ve bern using it twice a day fir months and my face looks great. Use a towel over your head to help get more moisture. Overall great price and great product</li>
            <li> Works great for what I need it for. The extension that comes with the one I got is great for sinus issues (mine came with that little cylinder extension and a rotating scrub brush). Also the directions say not to use it with anything but water but I used it today with a little bit of Lush&#x27;s facial stuff that you put in a pot for steaming and it worked just fine; no damage to the unit. Great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing steamer! Great price!</li>
            <li> The steam output is so low...you can get more steam from a pot of boiling water! I kind of like the spin brush though!</li>
            <li> I love this product and quite frankly I&#x27;m kinda mad it took me this long to discover it.  I have extremely oily skin and constantly struggle with acne. With this product I am able to get a deeper clean for my skin and improve my complexion. It is very relaxing as well. I play some soothing music in the background and I feel like I&#x27;m at the spa! Excellent way to end a busy day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews and price. I had to make a choice between this one and the Secura Hot/Cold Steamer. Price won out... When I received my steamer, yesterday, I was excited to be able to test it out. I have to admit that I have never used a steamer before and was a little disappointed in the amount of steam the product produced. However, I figured out that the best approach to using it was to put a towel over my head, and the steamer, and put the timer on 15 minutes. This allowed the steam to build up and it did a much better job. But, honestly, that is what I was doing with my hot water in the sink, prior to purchase, and it did just as good of a job. I guess having the steam does save money on my water bill though. I am not sure that the Secura would have had better steam but I am a little nervous about having boiling (may not be boiling but is definitely hotter than my faucet) water so close to my face when I am using the Conair. My only big concern is that I might accidentally bump the machine (especially since I am also using a towel) and the water will splash up into my face. Overall, I think this is a good steamer for the price. Just be careful using it!</li>
            <li> The facial sauna is great for steam but the add-ons like the exfoliating brush and sponge for moisturizer are not useful. The bristles of the rotating brush were bent and worn out just after using it twice. The sponge felt rough on my exfoliated skin. The battery operated rotating machine works well on 2 AA batteries. The steamer is light-weight and compact (easy to store). Overall, I think it is great for sauna but not as a facial tool.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of reading of reviews with different steamers such as vicks etc. I finally purchased this one and I have not one thing negative to say. I purchased this mainly for sinus relief but tried out all attachments and this thing performs! It does everything it says it does and does it well. It has great steam output and if you put a towel over your head, it really makes you sweat! After a little experimenting, My favortite thing to do is take a plastic cap from a small water bottle and put just a small dab of vicks in it. After the unit is fully warmed up and ready to go, I place it in the bottom of whichever attachment you choose(Not in the water), and it feels great and leaves you feeling cool and refreshed after use!&lt;br /&gt;  My only complaint is that I did not buy it sooner because of reading the negative reviews. The negative reviews are probably by those who did not read the directions or poured other ingredients besides plain water in the heating cup. I will buy this same one again if mine ever breaks down the road. A+++++</li>
            <li> My new moisturizing mist facial sauna system is awesome. I love everything about it. I will be giving these as Christmas gifts this year. What an amazing system.</li>
            <li> The face mask on this product fits awkwardly, I wish it was a little more comfortable since you really need to keep it on for awhile to work well. Other than that I am completely happy with it. The price is right! The timer is a great feature because I can just relax and let the stream do the trick. The temperature is borderline too hot, but it is tolerable and hasn&#x27;t caused any burns . I use it with my Rose hydroxyl added to the water, it is a great way to deliver those benefits. I haven&#x27;t used the facial brush yet, I didn&#x27;t make this purchase for that part of the product. The sinus attachment will get a lot of use in this household this winter!</li>
            <li> I love it!! It is very convenient and shipping was fast. This product is a great investment. On Saturdays I turn my home into a spa and pamper myself...:d</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly. It&#x27;s great for a facial sauna but even greater for allergy and sinus congestion. Placed a small cotton pad above steam chamber with just a drop of peppermint oil. Smells wonderful and really opens the sinuses</li>
            <li> I wish the opening for your facial was actually shaped like a face but otherwise it does the job.</li>
            <li> Does not produce enough steam. Use a pot of boiling water and it would be better than this lousy system. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I love this, my mom purchased it for my birthday. I use it when I want to give my face special treatment. It also help to open up my sinuses, it&#x27;s nice to have this on hand!</li>
            <li> Gift for daughter-in-law who says it works great on her oily face and opens her pores.  She is recommending it to everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> I live up north, and my skin and sinuses get very dry. This is a great machine for moisturizing. It heats up very fast and a little water makes steam for a long time. Getting the rotating brush was a plus.</li>
            <li> I have used steamers for facials before, cheap ones too, but this one was the most disappointing of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The steam is too gentle and the water quantity it can hold is too less.. To get some effect, you have to hold it too close to your face and of course, have a towel.. The brushes and the massaging pad are too harsh for your skin and it stops rotating by little pressure... Overall, its okay if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t want too much steam.</li>
            <li> I recently had a sinus infection that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  The steam from this felt great and cleared up my headache when nothing else was working.  It makes your skin look/feel great!</li>
            <li> I think if you want a gentle steaming this is ok, but I think just boiling a pot of water is better.  I was glad that it came with some accessories that I ended up having a use for.  Its cheaper than the spa so I mean it pays for itself but I don&#x27;t see this as a regular treatment for me.</li>
            <li> Best Investment Ever!!!!!! My face feels fresh, and looks amazing. Try using the towel over your head that makes a big difference..</li>
            <li> need to have for every woman, after you use it, your skin fresh like a baby skin,</li>
            <li> awesome and inexpensive...great facial and helped me through the allergies I suffer with here in the Ohio Valley!!</li>
            <li> This product is so good! It cleared up my acne in a day! I recommend this steamer over a sauna anyday because the steam is more concentrated. Its amazing! Best steamer i have tried</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it cleaned up my face or not as I am really lazy and don&#x27;t use it as often as I should but I love the feeling of the steam on my skin when I am using it.  Also good for clearing up your nose.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit flimsy and sketchy when using it but it&#x27;s cheap and does open up my pours. I highly recommend it just use with caution and be careful</li>
            <li> I Was looking for something like this, its really nice and relaxing.... And fast shipped... With some extras for facial caer.</li>
            <li> Steam almost non existent</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not great because it didn&#x27;t give enough steam as I expected from the facial sauna but for the money you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and i&#x27;m in love. Is like a real sauna for your face, ill use once in a week&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this product :)</li>
            <li> Its very useful and simple to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steamer is useful for face and neck. If you have cold or head ache the nose steamer is also helpful.&lt;br /&gt;The scrubber and sponge are fine. On time delivery.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, Good Deal !!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, right off the bat, this thing is tiny. I have seen something bigger than this and I had that size in mind while ordering this.&lt;br /&gt;It takes only 30ml water at a time, however it runs for a good 10 minutes or so with just that much water.&lt;br /&gt;Just good enough for home/ personal use.&lt;br /&gt;I have a big face and it doesn&#x27;t fit in properly. I kept the product after using it twice as it worked and I didn&#x27;t find anything bigger.</li>
            <li> Great for sinus issues, or common cold too.... great for skin and clearing blemishes, blackheads and whiteheads buy with tool to extract blackheads</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I had one for years and used it weekly until it died. I saw it while browsing Amazon and immediately ordered it. It came with a battery powered facial brush thing for exfoliating, which I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I&#x27;m curious to see if I like it.</li>
            <li> Works great for an at home facial!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and the water in my building doesnt get hot enough to really clean your face.  Also I work in a kitchen and we are always frying stuff, so I use this everyday, for 10 minutes, less blackhead, less oily skin, and my skin looks brighter and people have been giving me compliments, I put a towel over my head when I use it, and I use it before I give myself a home facial.  very happy about this buy and it wasnt that expensive</li>
            <li> Bought it for my BFF in Jamaica she loves it</li>
            <li> Awesome buy and an even awesome seller. Got a free gift as well. I Was very surprise and got beyond what was expected. I will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Great for steaming your face before a mask for Spa Saturday with girlfriends &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;The built in timer is easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Conair facial sauna w/timer does not put out enough steam even after 15 minutes. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is perfect when I have a stuffy nose, works really great. I still have not used it for facial</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it all that helpful.  I think using a washcloth and washing your face twice a day is just as effective... this product takes up a lot of space and I am contemplating throwing it out... wish I didn&#x27;t spend money on it.</li>
            <li> Works really well to open your pores up so you can clean them out when done. I haven&#x27;t used it yet when sick, but I can see that it will really help to open your sinuses.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Did not steam enough at all. Not powerful. Not good.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help with my dry eye issue....even though it says to use with your eyes closed, I&#x27;ve been using it with my eye open with no issues.  My daughter, unfortunately, has decided to take it over for her &amp;#34;facials&amp;#34;...she loves it.  Might have to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> purchased it 2 years back and still runs well. my wife and i use this regularly to keep our face clean</li>
            <li> It worked well for about a month and then whenever I turned it on and let it start up, it shuts down automatically before the water even heats up. Really disappointed because it&#x27;s not cheap in our currency(MYR). Thought of returning it but the shipping process is too troublesome so I threw it away. If you&#x27;re looking to use a facial steamer for a long time, personally I suggest you should consider investing in a better model or something.</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up in no time!</li>
            <li> steamer is ok.  I think you can get the same results with hot water running in a sink, lowering your head with a towel over your head....oh well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item back in October 2014. I&#x27;ve only used it three times becasue I literally have to wait 20 minutes after I plug it in for it to turn on. I can press the power button over and over again and nothing happens until after almost half an hour of it being plugged in . This was the biggest waste of money . Please spare your self. If I could have I would have given it zero stars</li>
            <li> Awesome price for an awesome steamer.  Worked wonders on my skin.  I had been looking for a good steamer for months. I love this one.</li>
            <li> This is so perfect. It&#x27;s great for relaxing at home on a budget. I use it as often as I like, but I don&#x27;t use the exfoliater all the time. It&#x27;s great for clearing up your sinuses as well. Must have!</li>
            <li> Produced minimal steam.</li>
            <li> Works well . Worth the price</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed by my ENT doctor for my dry membranes. I live in Colorado (very dry), so I use it religiously and even take it on trips if I am going to another dry location or a very cold destination where the hotel heaters further dry the air. VERY helpful for nose and throat &amp;#34;issues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Incredible product for the price. Good construction, simple use and clean up plus includes a battery powered facial brush. Excellent price and has a dual purpose use. Facial and lungs alone (Asthma &amp; Breathing)&lt;br /&gt;All in all its a top contender when price is also included.</li>
            <li> It helped my very much when I had a cold to use the steam vapors.  It also has a great facial attachment.</li>
            <li> This is great for steaming your face when you are congested or for a facial. Heats up quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> This product works well at steaming your face to open up your pores.  It is easy to use.  One thing I would say is a con is that it does not seem to get your forehead very well.  I liked the microderm brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. First time trying this type of product and I like it. It gets very hot, but it works.</li>
            <li> This product was so mediocre that I gave it away. As a huge fan of taking care of my skin through natural means, I was really looking forward to this product but it let me down. The level of steam is so low, so small and the overall setup is so ineffective that you are better off just using a regular but good quality humidifier and sticking your head down where the steam comes off (within a few inches so you don&#x27;t burn your skin or anything). I think the idea is good but the concept was not very well implemented in this product. I&#x27;m afraid I had to really work hard to give it a 2-star.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for months now and love it. Great for steaming my face and was priced right. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Using to clean my sinuses and especially around this time of year it&#x27;s a life saver.  Everything was delivered on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Great product -- especially good for breathing steam to clear up a cough or congestion in your chest</li>
