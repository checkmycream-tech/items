            <li>Was happy to see it in a tube for your lips.</li>
            <li>and it was great...</li>
            <li>I bought this lip balm because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Great to put in your pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>Great all-purpose beauty balm</li>
            <li>Amazon gives great review of Rosebud salve</li>
            <li>THis salve is great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is GREAT.</li>
            <li>This one is great.</li>
            <li>Great to travel with-</li>
            <li>There are petroleum based ingredients in it as they are great occlusives- which means that they do not allow water from the lips to escape.</li>
            <li>Its great for chapped lips..</li>
            <li>If it has it in there and the product works, that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Petroleum jelly is very effective for chapped lips, but if you are looking for an all-natural product, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>And to make it even better, it smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>When applying, this salve has a pleasant but never overpowering rosy smell.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great product even better!</li>
            <li>but I endured it for its superior quality.</li>
            <li>Have received some good reviews via snail mail, they like it</li>
            <li>Oh , so good; My wife uses it all of the time.</li>
            <li>The tube is nice for your purse and the tin is great for home.</li>
            <li>, I was thrilled amazon had it, it stays and has great texture.</li>
            <li>Might be good for hand or foot moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The metal tubs are nice but they don&#x27;t do well in heat, happy to have the convenient tube.</li>
            <li>But it will be good for summer days when my lips won&#x27;t be as chapped as in the winter months.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff</li>
            <li>This light lip tint and excellent moisturizer is probably one of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The tube is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers, but the tins are also good.</li>
            <li>It has a mild rose smell that is delightful and soothing.</li>
            <li>Now that I have it in a tube, I love the product even more!!</li>
            <li>The smell is also very nice, which makes it better than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this product!</li>
            <li>Life is so much better with Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve in a tube!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more, just in case they stop making these - it happens!</li>
            <li>Love this versatile product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li>so I love this instead!</li>
            <li>I get that reaction from a number of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and ELF cosmetics as well, so if you get a reaction from those it may not be for you, but if you don&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll probably love it like everyone else!</li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>and i LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing &amp; feels like butter on the lips, but I had an allergic reaction to something in it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to come across this Rosebud Salve and after reading all of the reviews I knew I had to give it a try (why not</li>
            <li>rose-scented (the rose is my birth month flower (June)).</li>
            <li>I like smelling nice, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li>I probably own 10+ tubes of this scattered all over my house, office, and car.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the one in the tub.</li>
            <li>The slanted applicator is nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any ingredient that would provide any kind of miraculous healing</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll stick with the rose.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice.</li>
            <li>rose smell...</li>
            <li>Somehow the Rose smell is cloying</li>
            <li>It is basically petroleum jelly with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>As much as I liked it, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and my hands stay clean.</li>
            <li>This salve&#x27;s fragrance is very light and nice.</li>
            <li>but I love the rose scent of this.  </li>
            <li>I always liked Rosebud Salve in the tin, but this one is even better.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and hydrating.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like the rose smell is just a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - not sticky, very smooth.</li>
            <li>The lovely rose scent is very pleasant, but the color is so light that you can barely see it after applying to the lips.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I still use the tin but mostly at night.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this salve.  </li>
            <li>Blistex, Chap Stick, Burts Bees and more...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>The salve is ok.</li>
            <li>It smells better than vaseline</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve for many years now.</li>
            <li>And I love anything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they have these in tubes now</li>
            <li>which makes it more hygienic but thsit</li>
            <li>I love using it on my uticles and over my lip stains.  </li>
            <li>Makes you shiny and glossy without a bunch of goo that most glosses give you.</li>
            <li>but I think the smell could be better.</li>
            <li>I love this salve.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be better to carry in my purse than the tin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and was pleased to try it in the tube dispenser.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li>Lovely light rose scent, no color or tint to it.  </li>
            <li>so quicky i just love the way it feels</li>
            <li>I love Rosebud Salve.</li>
            <li>but this is the one I reach for the most</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm of all time.  </li>
            <li>I found this lip gloss in California at an Anthropologia store, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it anywhere else</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love not having to use the tin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li>The product was properly packaged and promptly shipped, arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I love Rosebud Salve -</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t found anything better</li>
            <li>and I love the subtle-barely-there fragrance when applying.</li>
            <li>More convenient for men and children to take everywhere .</li>
            <li>Love this lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is more on the oily side though.</li>
            <li>It is more on the gloss side.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, purchase the tin version which is more like a salve.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with rose scent (it&#x27;s also slightly pink), but since that was what I was looking for, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Also it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li>but I will have to get more soon.</li>
            <li>The Rosebud Salve in the tin works better.</li>
            <li>And about the perfume, the rose scent on lips to me would have to be the sweet rich kind, not powdery.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice but the balm itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li>It feels good on, smells nice, but did not keeps my lips soft, made them peel more.  </li>
            <li>I love this rosebud salve, it smells great and leaves my lips really soft, I have lip blams everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances, but not this one, which is nice and mild.</li>
            <li>WE all just love how it it keeps our lips smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like most products do.</li>
            <li>Gives a great gloss &amp; it&#x27;s great to tame fly-aways too!</li>
            <li>Tried and True!</li>
            <li>I love the original Rosebud salve in a tin - but that seems unsanitary</li>
            <li>Although I love the convenience and the cleanliness of having a tube-version of their product on-the-go, it just does not work quite as well as the original version that comes in the pot.  </li>
            <li>The tube applicator makes it really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, moisturizing as always.</li>
            <li>The smell is perfect-not too strong.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfectly fine and the applicator is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use tube, makes your lips soft, and has a very light rose smell.</li>
            <li>but I have a huge thing of that already which wasn&#x27;t working for me, which is probably why this isn&#x27;t working that well.</li>
            <li>And the salve goes smoothly on your lips, no stickiness.</li>
            <li>My lips are always baby-soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It can get REALLY liquid-y if you leave it in a warm place.</li>
            <li>This is easier to use than the tin one, I enjoy both them.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a natural rose scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rosebud Salve in a Tube is a very nice lip balm - a gentle, subtle, natural-smelling rose scent, and a pleasant texture and feel on the lips.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on my lips, and think its a pretty good ointment.  </li>
            <li>and you take off the top and squeeze enough on your lips so you can smack and rub them together - lovely!  </li>
            <li>Def worth keeping in your purse!</li>
            <li>First, the Rosebud Salve is fantastic and NOW!</li>
            <li>Rosebud Salve stays on better, absorbs better and definitely moisturizes better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with my chapped lips without rose balm.</li>
            <li>Or  a baby who needs special skin care?</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I found they now have it in a convenient tube.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, very floral and pretty.</li>
            <li>Initially I was looking for a good lip treatment for the coming winter months.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it&#x27;s like vaseline and that holds true for me, as well.</li>
            <li>The Amazon.com product description really does provide you with an idea of the many uses of this salve.</li>
            <li>Love this lip salve, much moister that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always had the soft, soothing rose scent.  </li>
            <li>tube rosebud is not as good as the regular?</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s rose scent is subtle and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>My wife had been using this in the tin and decided she would love it even more if it came in a different package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products, and this one is among the top few.</li>
            <li>my mother loved it and it goes a long ways.....</li>
            <li>Price is good for how long it lasts .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the tin for years and just love the new tube.  </li>
            <li>like they were constantly with Chapstick (which I&#x27;ve learned was a result of an additive Chapstick deliberately adds, to keep you using more!).</li>
            <li>The feel of it on your lips is very silky and smooth and it has no color to it.  </li>
            <li>However, upon receiving it I realized that it is actually just petroleum jelly (Vaseline) with a rose scent.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and leaves your lips smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to replace my Sugar lip treatment from Fresh.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s not what I would call a classic or old fashioned rose scent, though I do like it.</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Which was more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return, since I love the stuff anyway.</li>
            <li>and that is important as I live in AZ</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Okay, bought it for lips, ended up using it on hands (especially the rough cuticle areas that seem to split in very dry weather) and it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so my lips end up pretty chapped during the day.  </li>
            <li>And I totally agree with many of these reviewers.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot because its so hydrating but the only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>and I have smooth soft lips in the morning.</li>
            <li>The tube works better for application but the product is different than the tin.</li>
            <li>(Not all at the same time:)</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth and soothed lips were now painlessly attached to my face.  </li>
            <li>it is safely tucked away in my purse until next time.</li>
            <li>I wear it to bed at night and wake up with my lips feeling soft and smooth, not waxy or sticky.</li>
            <li>clears up fast!</li>
            <li>It seems like they cut back on the amount of petrolatum that goes into the formula in order to have it more easily squeeze out of the the little hole at the top perhaps?  </li>
            <li>I saw a lot of positive ratings for this, so I grabbed a tube.</li>
            <li>At first, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my lips.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product is far from the superior salve Smith&#x27;s puts in the tin.</li>
            <li>That might work to protect me from the elements but it certainly won&#x27;t repair any damage that&#x27;s already been done.    </li>
            <li>I use as an everyday lip balm and love it!</li>
            <li>so I find it effective but the scent very off-putting and feels odd applied to the lips.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and isn&#x27;t hard like the lip balms!</li>
            <li>nothing really seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>Also it has petroleum jelly in it, which I really should have avoided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this salve.</li>
            <li>I prefer the tubes to the little tins because the squeeze tubes make it so you can apply it without touching your mouth with your hands when they are grimy (for instance right after riding the subway).</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell nice but keeps my lips moisturized for a long time</li>
            <li>i love this lip baim it is not long lasting and moisterizing ...</li>
            <li>Then after a week, my lips started to get smooth but not necessarily soft.</li>
            <li>I far prefer this tube to the tub because I can leave it in hot places like my car without worrying about it leaking everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; rose fragrance that is never overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I found an old tube of Chapstick that was pure punishment to rake over my sore lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As it wore off I applied a little more for about 4 hour and by then</li>
            <li>This is very convenient in the tube and is not messy .  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and keeps my lips so soft.</li>
            <li>I actually dabbed a tiny bit on the bottom of my nose since I didn&#x27;t have petroleum jelly handy, and it helped instantly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the rosebud salve in the tin for a while, i love it, but it can get so messy, and you&#x27;re hands get all sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li>so i had to find a new one</li>
            <li>We have purchased a tin in the past, but not dipping our fingers in the salve day after day seems much more hygienic.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently and carry it with me at all times!</li>
            <li>but this is a far better product than petroleum - I used to spread Vaseline on my hands at night after a long dry day in the field and &#x27;it&#x27; did help BUT NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT).</li>
            <li>Rosebud salve will help to protect and clear up that skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt as if it were not just sitting on my lips, but absorbing in.  </li>
            <li>After repeated use my lips were always soft and protected.</li>
            <li>Soft lips.</li>
            <li>i developed an allergic reaction to an all natural lip balm i had been using for years</li>
            <li>I tore open the package ready to do anything to soothe my throbbing lips.  </li>
            <li>i keep it near my bed and put it on every night.</li>
            <li>, I am kind of addicted to them</li>
            <li>nothing else works nearly as well or as quickly on healing my chapped lips, especially during long winters.  </li>
            <li>I am a nurse and was looking for a high quality lip balm to keep in my pocket, unfortunately this is unusable to me because the tin is messy, large and, most importantly, could cause contamination issues in my place of work because of the need to put your fingers in the product.</li>
            <li>Youll find a million uses for it, it smellls lovely, and it&#x27;s small enough to carry every day in any bag.</li>
            <li>I checked out some lip treatment reviews and most of them were designer make up brands, pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li>I love Rosebud Salve, and the tube is so much handier &amp; less messy than the tin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend that you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>I get extremely dry lips all year round, and more so in the winter time.</li>
            <li>I hated the waxy feeling most lip treatments felt, as if they weren&#x27;t really penetrating the skin at all and just sitting on top.  </li>
            <li>Good product, a little pricey but the little tin goes a long way</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re driving down the road in your car and your lips are dry, you can&#x27;t fumble with the lid on the original tin.  </li>
            <li>(The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, I just prefer unscented products in general).</li>
            <li>And the soft moist lips last all day.</li>
            <li>Subtle scent, glides on smooth, and heals cracked lips.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the description describes this as being free of petrochemicals.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and it felt like I put the wrong type of product on.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for a fraction of the cost of other more expensive options.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate my lips with a soft, dry toothbrush morning &amp; night, and follow with Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and other cheaper drug store brands, as well as Fresh (by sugar), and other more expensive options.</li>

            <li> I bought this lip balm because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Great to put in your pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Great all-purpose beauty balm</li>
            <li> Amazon gives great review of Rosebud salve</li>
            <li> THis salve is great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT.</li>
            <li> This one is great.</li>
            <li> Great to travel with-</li>
            <li> There are petroleum based ingredients in it as they are great occlusives- which means that they do not allow water from the lips to escape.</li>
            <li> Its great for chapped lips..</li>
            <li> If it has it in there and the product works, that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Petroleum jelly is very effective for chapped lips, but if you are looking for an all-natural product, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> And to make it even better, it smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li> When applying, this salve has a pleasant but never overpowering rosy smell.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great product even better!</li>
            <li> but I endured it for its superior quality.</li>
            <li> Have received some good reviews via snail mail, they like it</li>
            <li> Oh , so good; My wife uses it all of the time.</li>
            <li> The tube is nice for your purse and the tin is great for home.</li>
            <li> , I was thrilled amazon had it, it stays and has great texture.</li>
            <li> Might be good for hand or foot moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The metal tubs are nice but they don&#x27;t do well in heat, happy to have the convenient tube.</li>
            <li> But it will be good for summer days when my lips won&#x27;t be as chapped as in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff</li>
            <li> This light lip tint and excellent moisturizer is probably one of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The tube is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers, but the tins are also good.</li>
            <li> It has a mild rose smell that is delightful and soothing.</li>
            <li> Now that I have it in a tube, I love the product even more!!</li>
            <li> The smell is also very nice, which makes it better than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this product!</li>
            <li> Life is so much better with Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve in a tube!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more, just in case they stop making these - it happens!</li>
            <li> Love this versatile product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> so I love this instead!</li>
            <li> I get that reaction from a number of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and ELF cosmetics as well, so if you get a reaction from those it may not be for you, but if you don&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll probably love it like everyone else!</li>
            <li> i love this!</li>
            <li> and i LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This smells amazing &amp; feels like butter on the lips, but I had an allergic reaction to something in it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to come across this Rosebud Salve and after reading all of the reviews I knew I had to give it a try (why not</li>
            <li> rose-scented (the rose is my birth month flower (June)).</li>
            <li> I like smelling nice, but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li> I probably own 10+ tubes of this scattered all over my house, office, and car.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the one in the tub.</li>
            <li> The slanted applicator is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any ingredient that would provide any kind of miraculous healing</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll stick with the rose.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice.</li>
            <li> rose smell...</li>
            <li> Somehow the Rose smell is cloying</li>
            <li> It is basically petroleum jelly with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> As much as I liked it, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and my hands stay clean.</li>
            <li> This salve&#x27;s fragrance is very light and nice.</li>
            <li> but I love the rose scent of this.  </li>
            <li> I always liked Rosebud Salve in the tin, but this one is even better.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and hydrating.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like the rose smell is just a bit too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Love this product - not sticky, very smooth.</li>
            <li> The lovely rose scent is very pleasant, but the color is so light that you can barely see it after applying to the lips.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I still use the tin but mostly at night.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this salve.  </li>
            <li> Blistex, Chap Stick, Burts Bees and more...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> The salve is ok.</li>
            <li> It smells better than vaseline</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve for many years now.</li>
            <li> And I love anything</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they have these in tubes now</li>
            <li> which makes it more hygienic but thsit</li>
            <li> I love using it on my uticles and over my lip stains.  </li>
            <li> Makes you shiny and glossy without a bunch of goo that most glosses give you.</li>
            <li> but I think the smell could be better.</li>
            <li> I love this salve.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be better to carry in my purse than the tin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and was pleased to try it in the tube dispenser.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li> Lovely light rose scent, no color or tint to it.  </li>
            <li> so quicky i just love the way it feels</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve.</li>
            <li> but this is the one I reach for the most</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time.  </li>
            <li> I found this lip gloss in California at an Anthropologia store, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it anywhere else</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love not having to use the tin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> The product was properly packaged and promptly shipped, arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve -</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found anything better</li>
            <li> and I love the subtle-barely-there fragrance when applying.</li>
            <li> More convenient for men and children to take everywhere .</li>
            <li> Love this lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is more on the oily side though.</li>
            <li> It is more on the gloss side.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, purchase the tin version which is more like a salve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with rose scent (it&#x27;s also slightly pink), but since that was what I was looking for, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Also it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> but I will have to get more soon.</li>
            <li> The Rosebud Salve in the tin works better.</li>
            <li> And about the perfume, the rose scent on lips to me would have to be the sweet rich kind, not powdery.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice but the balm itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li> It feels good on, smells nice, but did not keeps my lips soft, made them peel more.  </li>
            <li> I love this rosebud salve, it smells great and leaves my lips really soft, I have lip blams everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances, but not this one, which is nice and mild.</li>
            <li> WE all just love how it it keeps our lips smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like most products do.</li>
            <li> Gives a great gloss &amp; it&#x27;s great to tame fly-aways too!</li>
            <li> Tried and True!</li>
            <li> I love the original Rosebud salve in a tin - but that seems unsanitary</li>
            <li> Although I love the convenience and the cleanliness of having a tube-version of their product on-the-go, it just does not work quite as well as the original version that comes in the pot.  </li>
            <li> The tube applicator makes it really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, moisturizing as always.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect-not too strong.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s perfectly fine and the applicator is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tube, makes your lips soft, and has a very light rose smell.</li>
            <li> but I have a huge thing of that already which wasn&#x27;t working for me, which is probably why this isn&#x27;t working that well.</li>
            <li> And the salve goes smoothly on your lips, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> My lips are always baby-soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It can get REALLY liquid-y if you leave it in a warm place.</li>
            <li> This is easier to use than the tin one, I enjoy both them.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a natural rose scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rosebud Salve in a Tube is a very nice lip balm - a gentle, subtle, natural-smelling rose scent, and a pleasant texture and feel on the lips.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my lips, and think its a pretty good ointment.  </li>
            <li> and you take off the top and squeeze enough on your lips so you can smack and rub them together - lovely!  </li>
            <li> Def worth keeping in your purse!</li>
            <li> First, the Rosebud Salve is fantastic and NOW!</li>
            <li> Rosebud Salve stays on better, absorbs better and definitely moisturizes better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with my chapped lips without rose balm.</li>
            <li> Or  a baby who needs special skin care?</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I found they now have it in a convenient tube.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, very floral and pretty.</li>
            <li> Initially I was looking for a good lip treatment for the coming winter months.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it&#x27;s like vaseline and that holds true for me, as well.</li>
            <li> The Amazon.com product description really does provide you with an idea of the many uses of this salve.</li>
            <li> Love this lip salve, much moister that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always had the soft, soothing rose scent.  </li>
            <li> tube rosebud is not as good as the regular?</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s rose scent is subtle and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this in the tin and decided she would love it even more if it came in a different package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many products, and this one is among the top few.</li>
            <li> my mother loved it and it goes a long ways.....</li>
            <li> Price is good for how long it lasts .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the tin for years and just love the new tube.  </li>
            <li> like they were constantly with Chapstick (which I&#x27;ve learned was a result of an additive Chapstick deliberately adds, to keep you using more!).</li>
            <li> The feel of it on your lips is very silky and smooth and it has no color to it.  </li>
            <li> However, upon receiving it I realized that it is actually just petroleum jelly (Vaseline) with a rose scent.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and leaves your lips smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to replace my Sugar lip treatment from Fresh.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s not what I would call a classic or old fashioned rose scent, though I do like it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Which was more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return, since I love the stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> and that is important as I live in AZ</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, bought it for lips, ended up using it on hands (especially the rough cuticle areas that seem to split in very dry weather) and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so my lips end up pretty chapped during the day.  </li>
            <li> And I totally agree with many of these reviewers.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot because its so hydrating but the only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> and I have smooth soft lips in the morning.</li>
            <li> The tube works better for application but the product is different than the tin.</li>
            <li> (Not all at the same time:)</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth and soothed lips were now painlessly attached to my face.  </li>
            <li> it is safely tucked away in my purse until next time.</li>
            <li> I wear it to bed at night and wake up with my lips feeling soft and smooth, not waxy or sticky.</li>
            <li> clears up fast!</li>
            <li> It seems like they cut back on the amount of petrolatum that goes into the formula in order to have it more easily squeeze out of the the little hole at the top perhaps?  </li>
            <li> I saw a lot of positive ratings for this, so I grabbed a tube.</li>
            <li> At first, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my lips.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product is far from the superior salve Smith&#x27;s puts in the tin.</li>
            <li> That might work to protect me from the elements but it certainly won&#x27;t repair any damage that&#x27;s already been done.    </li>
            <li> I use as an everyday lip balm and love it!</li>
            <li> so I find it effective but the scent very off-putting and feels odd applied to the lips.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and isn&#x27;t hard like the lip balms!</li>
            <li> nothing really seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li> Also it has petroleum jelly in it, which I really should have avoided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this salve.</li>
            <li> I prefer the tubes to the little tins because the squeeze tubes make it so you can apply it without touching your mouth with your hands when they are grimy (for instance right after riding the subway).</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell nice but keeps my lips moisturized for a long time</li>
            <li> i love this lip baim it is not long lasting and moisterizing ...</li>
            <li> Then after a week, my lips started to get smooth but not necessarily soft.</li>
            <li> I far prefer this tube to the tub because I can leave it in hot places like my car without worrying about it leaking everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; rose fragrance that is never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I found an old tube of Chapstick that was pure punishment to rake over my sore lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As it wore off I applied a little more for about 4 hour and by then</li>
            <li> This is very convenient in the tube and is not messy .  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and keeps my lips so soft.</li>
            <li> I actually dabbed a tiny bit on the bottom of my nose since I didn&#x27;t have petroleum jelly handy, and it helped instantly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rosebud salve in the tin for a while, i love it, but it can get so messy, and you&#x27;re hands get all sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> so i had to find a new one</li>
            <li> We have purchased a tin in the past, but not dipping our fingers in the salve day after day seems much more hygienic.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently and carry it with me at all times!</li>
            <li> but this is a far better product than petroleum - I used to spread Vaseline on my hands at night after a long dry day in the field and &#x27;it&#x27; did help BUT NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT).</li>
            <li> Rosebud salve will help to protect and clear up that skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I definitely felt as if it were not just sitting on my lips, but absorbing in.  </li>
            <li> After repeated use my lips were always soft and protected.</li>
            <li> Soft lips.</li>
            <li> i developed an allergic reaction to an all natural lip balm i had been using for years</li>
            <li> I tore open the package ready to do anything to soothe my throbbing lips.  </li>
            <li> i keep it near my bed and put it on every night.</li>
            <li> , I am kind of addicted to them</li>
            <li> nothing else works nearly as well or as quickly on healing my chapped lips, especially during long winters.  </li>
            <li> I am a nurse and was looking for a high quality lip balm to keep in my pocket, unfortunately this is unusable to me because the tin is messy, large and, most importantly, could cause contamination issues in my place of work because of the need to put your fingers in the product.</li>
            <li> Youll find a million uses for it, it smellls lovely, and it&#x27;s small enough to carry every day in any bag.</li>
            <li> I checked out some lip treatment reviews and most of them were designer make up brands, pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve, and the tube is so much handier &amp; less messy than the tin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend that you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry lips all year round, and more so in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I hated the waxy feeling most lip treatments felt, as if they weren&#x27;t really penetrating the skin at all and just sitting on top.  </li>
            <li> Good product, a little pricey but the little tin goes a long way</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re driving down the road in your car and your lips are dry, you can&#x27;t fumble with the lid on the original tin.  </li>
            <li> (The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, I just prefer unscented products in general).</li>
            <li> And the soft moist lips last all day.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, glides on smooth, and heals cracked lips.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the description describes this as being free of petrochemicals.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and it felt like I put the wrong type of product on.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for a fraction of the cost of other more expensive options.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my lips with a soft, dry toothbrush morning &amp; night, and follow with Rosebud Salve.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and other cheaper drug store brands, as well as Fresh (by sugar), and other more expensive options.</li>
            <li> It feels very oily and slick actually, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve read the small print, it really works well on cuts and scrapes too.  </li>
            <li> And I definitely will be using this tube as long as this company keeps on making this salve in a tube.</li>
            <li> Yikes, this stuff is very heavily scented and smells a very \\&quot;grandma/popurri-ish\\&quot; to me.</li>
            <li> Was sent the wrong from of this product, instead of an easy to use tube lip balm I received a tin of the product.</li>
            <li> I especially use it for bedtime so that I don&#x27;t have dry lips!</li>
            <li> Sure i saw the other reviewers who warned that this was just expensive, colored vaseline, but did I listen?</li>
            <li> Have been waiting a long time for RoseBud in the tube.  </li>
            <li> The product is smoothing also, helping my lips stay hydrated/preventing them from getting dry from lipstick use and weather.</li>
            <li> It helps dry cuticles and hands</li>
            <li> which is a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I loooove rosebud salve for every dry and/or irritated skin issue.</li>
            <li> Rosebud keep my lips from getting dry during winter and summer .</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry chapped lips</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well on my cracked and dry winter lips.</li>
            <li> They feel dry all the time.</li>
            <li> I cannot and will not live without this lip balm!</li>
            <li> I use it nightly, sometimes morning and night on my hands, lips and other parts of my face that feel dry.</li>
            <li> Originally used the Rosebud salve in the round tins but at times they&#x27;re impossible to open, especially after moisturizing your hands, so these tubes have made things easier.</li>
            <li> Spending money on Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is money well spent, because there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this salve in a tube will be used.</li>
            <li> Not really a rosebud salve like c.o.bigelow.</li>
            <li> 5 days of lip suffering a distant memory.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, and already I notice my lips aren&#x27;t peeling,</li>
            <li> I tried it again a few weeks later in case it was something else, but it was this.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on rough knees and heels and it will still be moist in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Not only can you use it for lip gloss/lip conditioner, you can use this thing to apply on small cuts on your skin, dry cuticles and dry-looking areas on your skin, etc.</li>
            <li> Buy it if your lips are not super dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> The sticker makes it more difficult to remove the already kind of difficult to remove shrink wrap and the part that isn&#x27;t on the shrink wrap stays on the tube and looks bad.</li>
            <li> Like the other Amazon.com reviewers/customers who have posted comments on this salve, I used the tin as well over the years.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews on the Amazon website, you know I have this thing for multi-functional stuff.</li>
            <li> due to that won&#x27;t buy anymore of it.</li>
            <li> I understand they also make other &#x27;flavors&#x27; like strawberry</li>
            <li> I have pulled it out for all sorts of chafing and other difficulties.</li>
            <li> I am using the one in the small, round container (substitution but same product).</li>
            <li> my lips always had a dry spot (bottom lip, center) that i could not get rid of no matter how hard i tried.</li>
            <li> Nothing clears up chapped lips like this salve, but I have also used it on burns, sunburn, and any other skin that need a little pampering.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this little tube lasts!</li>
            <li> The tube seems to be a slightly less goopy than the tin, which is easier to get out of the tube, but I like the goop.</li>
            <li> Subtle fragrance, color, and shine and doesn&#x27;t dry you out like other lipbalms.</li>
            <li> being in a tube now is less messy....</li>
            <li> A little cosmetic bag life saver.</li>
            <li> this little tube is sooo convenient for on-the-go use, as opposed to the little tins</li>
            <li> Easier to use than in the little pot.</li>
            <li> My grandfather use to bring this to me in the little tins when I was a little girl in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> What is really weird is that the package arrived with a single tube (which is what I was expecting), but it had a sticker on the back saying that it was to be sold as part of a set?</li>
            <li> It has a petroleum base but the cotton seed oil (first ingredient) and essential oils seem &amp;#34;less gooey&amp;#34; than plain Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I will admit the little round tins are cuter.  </li>
            <li> The tins are messy.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the baby powder</li>
            <li> Just like the other customers have posted, I, too, apply this lip salve on overnight during the cold weather season and wake up with soft moist lips.</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed and don&#x27;t want to risk getting another tin to order again.</li>
            <li> The seller sticks this large annoying sticker partially over the shrink wrap</li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest (Illinois) and the cold weather during the Winter season can sometimes be brutal to the lips leaving your lips very cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> Yay to no more messing with a tin and sticky fingers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when it arrived it was the traditional tin.</li>
            <li> The taste is not overwhelming, and it works.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours I got small bumps all over my lips that took over a week to fade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick but still hydrating.  </li>
            <li> It does have a very subtle scent, and I mean subtle.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Was not happy...</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is petrolatum, cotton seed and secret perfume.  </li>
            <li> As a plus since it&#x27;s petroleum based you can also use this salve for minor scrapes/tiny annoying cuts.  </li>
            <li> Heck, I have a terrible cold and my nose was raw from constantly using tissues...</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the effect.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird.</li>
            <li> I might bw crazy, but is it me or does it feel like</li>
            <li> I was in dire need of lip balm during a cold snap.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Disappointed because I wanted a salve in a tube to take to work with me.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with my order.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the fact that it has petroleum in it :(</li>
            <li> I always hated the tin packaging in came in</li>
            <li> I used to use my Rosebud Salve in a tin, but hated that I had to use my finger to put it on.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor &amp; buy, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>

            <li> A little cosmetic bag life saver. Youll find a million uses for it, it smellls lovely, and it&#x27;s small enough to carry every day in any bag. Don&#x27;t leave home without it</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I did purchase before in the tin.  I still use the tin but mostly at night.  This is very convenient in the tube and is not messy .  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great for your lips or your cuticles.  Convenient tube to keep in your purse.  I often use it before putting on lip gloss...makes the application easier</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this salve.  Initially I was looking for a good lip treatment for the coming winter months.  I&#x27;m also a mouth breather at night (darn sinus problems) so my lips end up pretty chapped during the day.  I&#x27;ve tried everything. Blistex, Chap Stick, Burts Bees and more...nothing really seemed to work.  I hated the waxy feeling most lip treatments felt, as if they weren&#x27;t really penetrating the skin at all and just sitting on top.  That might work to protect me from the elements but it certainly won&#x27;t repair any damage that&#x27;s already been done.    I checked out some lip treatment reviews and most of them were designer make up brands, pretty expensive.  I was thrilled to come across this Rosebud Salve and after reading all of the reviews I knew I had to give it a try (why not, it&#x27;s so affordable!).    When applying, this salve has a pleasant but never overpowering rosy smell.  The feel of it on your lips is very silky and smooth and it has no color to it.  I definitely felt as if it were not just sitting on my lips, but absorbing in.  You can feel the difference right away.  After repeated use my lips were always soft and protected. As a plus since it&#x27;s petroleum based you can also use this salve for minor scrapes/tiny annoying cuts.  Heck, I have a terrible cold and my nose was raw from constantly using tissues...I actually dabbed a tiny bit on the bottom of my nose since I didn&#x27;t have petroleum jelly handy, and it helped instantly!  I love this stuff it&#x27;s great and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this salve for years. I always hated the tin packaging in came in but I endured it for its superior quality. Apply at night before bed and your lips are still moisturized when you wake up. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> The salve is ok. What is really weird is that the package arrived with a single tube (which is what I was expecting), but it had a sticker on the back saying that it was to be sold as part of a set? Kinda weird. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Gave these as gifts and kept one myself. WE all just love how it it keeps our lips smooth. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it&#x27;s like vaseline and that holds true for me, as well. It smells better than vaseline but I don&#x27;t notice any tint, which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s perfectly fine and the applicator is easy.</li>
            <li> If you like Rosebud Salve for your lips, this is an excellent way to use it.  If you&#x27;re driving down the road in your car and your lips are dry, you can&#x27;t fumble with the lid on the original tin.  This comes in a tube and you take off the top and squeeze enough on your lips so you can smack and rub them together - lovely!  Soft lips.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product! The smell is amazing, very floral and pretty. And, it works incredibly well. It keeps my lips moisturized, but isn&#x27;t sticky or waxy. I don&#x27;t need to constantly reapply it like some lip balms. The tube applicator makes it really easy to use. A really great find!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am using the one in the small, round container (substitution but same product). I use it nightly, sometimes morning and night on my hands, lips and other parts of my face that feel dry. It has a mild rose smell that is delightful and soothing. The product is smoothing also, helping my lips stay hydrated/preventing them from getting dry from lipstick use and weather. Highly recommend that you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this product - not sticky, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I received the tin.  I ordered the tube.  Disappointed that I did not get what I ordered. Only gave 1 star because I don&#x27;t like lip products I have to put my finger in.</li>
            <li> I have used Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve for many years now. Like the other Amazon.com reviewers/customers who have posted comments on this salve, I used the tin as well over the years. And I totally agree with many of these reviewers. Life is so much better with Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve in a tube! I live in the Midwest (Illinois) and the cold weather during the Winter season can sometimes be brutal to the lips leaving your lips very cracked and dry. Just like the other customers have posted, I, too, apply this lip salve on overnight during the cold weather season and wake up with soft moist lips. And the soft moist lips last all day. I don&#x27;t need to reapply the salve. And I love anything rose-scented (the rose is my birth month flower (June)). This product&#x27;s rose scent is subtle and pleasant smelling. I like smelling nice, but not in an overpowering way. This salve&#x27;s fragrance is very light and nice. And the salve goes smoothly on your lips, no stickiness. And if you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews on the Amazon website, you know I have this thing for multi-functional stuff. And Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is multi-functional. Not only can you use it for lip gloss/lip conditioner, you can use this thing to apply on small cuts on your skin, dry cuticles and dry-looking areas on your skin, etc. The Amazon.com product description really does provide you with an idea of the many uses of this salve. This Christmas, I bought a lot of these tubes as stocking stuffers for my co-workers, and put them in all the Christmas gift bags for my family and friends. Spending money on Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is money well spent, because there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that this salve in a tube will be used. And I definitely will be using this tube as long as this company keeps on making this salve in a tube. Yay to no more messing with a tin and sticky fingers. And yay to beneficial products that come in a tube!</li>
            <li> Love this lip salve, much moister that a chap stick like product.  Very soothing and keeps my lips so soft. Smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Rosebud Salve for years - it&#x27;s the best for keeping our lips unchapped in our Wisconsin winters.     This tube packaging is great! We have purchased a tin in the past, but not dipping our fingers in the salve day after day seems much more hygienic. Makes a great product even better!</li>
            <li> It was tiny! Said it was going to be one size and then when it came it was a sample size! Ugh! Was not happy...😡</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  I put it on my lips and immediately wiped it off.  (Perhaps, it is not meant for lip use?)  The scent is very strong and it felt like I put the wrong type of product on.</li>
            <li> I probably own 10+ tubes of this scattered all over my house, office, and car. It&#x27;s simply the best. Subtle fragrance, color, and shine and doesn&#x27;t dry you out like other lipbalms. I far prefer this tube to the tub because I can leave it in hot places like my car without worrying about it leaking everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this on cuts and burns in a pinch too, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as the one in the tub.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Very similar to aquaphor in terms of uses (I use it on everything), but I love the rose scent of this.  I&#x27;m so glad they have these in tubes now which makes it more hygienic but thsit stuff is amazing.  I love using it on my uticles and over my lip stains.  It&#x27;s not too thick but still hydrating.  It feels very oily and slick actually, but it does work.  One con though, I do find myself reapplying it 3-4 times a day, but it&#x27;s not too bothersome.  Def worth keeping in your purse!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff. It helps dry cuticles and hands and it is all I use on my lips. Makes you shiny and glossy without a bunch of goo that most glosses give you. I have one in every room and bag! Great for burns and bug bites in a pinch. The tube is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers, but the tins are also good.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot because its so hydrating but the only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is the fragrance. I like the idea but I think the smell could be better.</li>
            <li> I love this salve. Even though at its essence it&#x27;s just Vaseline it does a great job of protecting and moistening your lips.</li>
            <li> Yikes, this stuff is very heavily scented and smells a very \\&quot;grandma/popurri-ish\\&quot; to me. It is basically vaseline (and I like vaseline on my lips) so I find it effective but the scent very off-putting and feels odd applied to the lips.</li>
            <li> Have always used Rosebud salve in the tin. Was happy to see it in a tube for your lips. Love it.</li>
            <li> The slanted applicator is nice. Other than that, this product is far from the superior salve Smith&#x27;s puts in the tin. I bought this thinking it would be better to carry in my purse than the tin. It isn&#x27;t. It felt like runny petroleum jelly. Stick to the tin.</li>
            <li> First, the Rosebud Salve is fantastic and NOW! PORTABLE! I bought three of these, one for the handbag, one for the bedside stand and one for the coat for walking the dog. The tube seems to be a slightly less goopy than the tin, which is easier to get out of the tube, but I like the goop. It still gives you the perfect, perfect rosy tint to your lips and cheeks. I&#x27;m going to buy more, just in case they stop making these - it happens!</li>
            <li> It clears up coldsores within hours.  I  was recommended this by a friend and wanted to stock up on it.</li>
            <li> i developed an allergic reaction to an all natural lip balm i had been using for years so i had to find a new one and this is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love this versatile product! I&#x27;ve used it for years and was pleased to try it in the tube dispenser. Great to keep on hand! Tried and True!</li>
            <li> The Rosebud Salve arrived on time, and in perfect condition.  I absolutely love Rosebud Salve.  I would purchase this item again :)</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about this salve and decided to try it.  Not only does it smell nice but keeps my lips moisturized for a long time and that is important as I live in AZ which is a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Lovely light rose scent, no color or tint to it.  Originally used the Rosebud salve in the round tins but at times they&#x27;re impossible to open, especially after moisturizing your hands, so these tubes have made things easier. I will admit the little round tins are cuter.  Same product just differently packaging.</li>
            <li> i love this lip baim it is not long lasting and moisterizing ... it absorbs in your lips so quicky i just love the way it feels</li>
            <li> This smells like powder potpourri.  It is petrolatum, cotton seed and secret perfume.  It is made in the usa.  I don&#x27;t see any ingredient that would provide any kind of miraculous healing and I prefer perfume on my wrist vs. lips.  And about the perfume, the rose scent on lips to me would have to be the sweet rich kind, not powdery.  It does have the cutest packaging ever.</li>
            <li> Got an itch you can&#x27;t get rid of?  Or  a baby who needs special skin care? Rosebud salve will help to protect and clear up that skin irritation. Want your lips to look luscious? Put Rosebud on your lips before your lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve. I was super excited when I found they now have it in a convenient tube. Unfortunately when it arrived it was the traditional tin. Which was more trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return, since I love the stuff anyway. I was super disappointed and don&#x27;t want to risk getting another tin to order again.</li>
            <li> I used this salve when I was growing up and it was great...my mother loved it and it goes a long ways.....being in a tube now is less messy....even though it works, every time I use it my eyes water and I start sneezing....guesss I&#x27;m allergic to the perfumed fragrance....due to that won&#x27;t buy anymore of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s cruelty-free!!  I&#x27;ve used the tin for years and just love the new tube.  I keep tins in every room and now I can keep a tube in my purse.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  Now that I&#x27;ve read the small print, it really works well on cuts and scrapes too.  This product is an all around wonderful addition to any household.  And to make it even better, it smells wonderful!  It&#x27;s always had the soft, soothing rose scent.  I understand they also make other &#x27;flavors&#x27; like strawberry but I&#x27;ll stick with the rose.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm because of the great reviews. However, upon receiving it I realized that it is actually just petroleum jelly (Vaseline) with a rose scent. If you like that type of lip balm, this is the balm for you. The scent is nice but the balm itself is nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY balm from $1 to $50 and this is the best.  I have constantly chapped lips and this works and is in my possession at all times!</li>
            <li> I love this rosebud salve, it smells great and leaves my lips really soft, I have lip blams everywhere, I am kind of addicted to them but this is the one I reach for the most</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time.  I&#x27;ve used it all my life and I am 68.  My whole family uses it.  Now I can carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li> I loooove rosebud salve for every dry and/or irritated skin issue. this little tube is sooo convenient for on-the-go use, as opposed to the little tins</li>
            <li> I buy these to send to American women troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Have received some good reviews via snail mail, they like it and I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Oh , so good; My wife uses it all of the time.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the product though. Maybe be just a personal thing but I won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> This moisturizes and does not contain anything that irritates my lips. It has a petroleum base but the cotton seed oil (first ingredient) and essential oils seem &amp;#34;less gooey&amp;#34; than plain Vaseline. The tube is nice for your purse and the tin is great for home.</li>
            <li> I might bw crazy, but is it me or does it feel like tube rosebud is not as good as the regular?</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it around my eyes my where my crows feet are and it gives a GLOW!</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve, and the tube is so much handier &amp; less messy than the tin.  I exfoliate my lips with a soft, dry toothbrush morning &amp; night, and follow with Rosebud Salve.  My lips are always baby-soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered the tube and received the metal tin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because everyone raves about this stuff. I think it&#x27;s slippery and slimy and not all that moisturizing. Also it has petroleum jelly in it, which I really should have avoided. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  I know why it has a cult following now.  The smell is perfect-not too strong. It glides on smoothly and leaves your lips smooth and soft.  Definitely prefer this tube to a tin as well.  Will most definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and isn&#x27;t hard like the lip balms! A little goes a long way so this little tube lasts!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I used to buy the tins and did not know that this came in a tube.  The tins are messy.  I apply this to my lips every night and I have smooth soft lips in the morning.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to replace my Sugar lip treatment from Fresh. Doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all. Feels greasy and dries my lips out because of the petrolatum.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Sure i saw the other reviewers who warned that this was just expensive, colored vaseline, but did I listen? No.  This one is a over-hyped skip in my books.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Moisturizes my lips so well.</li>
            <li> I found this lip gloss in California at an Anthropologia store, I&#x27;ve never been able to find it anywhere else, I was thrilled amazon had it, it stays and has great texture. The best lip product I&#x27;ve ever used. Price is good for how long it lasts .</li>
            <li> The tube works better for application but the product is different than the tin. I prefer the tin but this works when I am on the go.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on eyelids, cheeks &amp; lips. (Not all at the same time:) Great to put in your pocket or purse. I&#x27;ve purchased several tubes. It does have a very subtle scent, and I mean subtle. Gives a great gloss &amp; it&#x27;s great to tame fly-aways too!</li>
            <li> It feels good on, smells nice, but did not keeps my lips soft, made them peel more.  Might be good for hand or foot moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rosebud balm for years.  I love it.  The metal tubs are nice but they don&#x27;t do well in heat, happy to have the convenient tube.</li>
            <li> Rosebud keep my lips from getting dry during winter and summer . I love it</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> Great all-purpose beauty balm</li>
            <li> I cannot and will not live without this lip balm! Do yourself a favor &amp; buy, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rosebud salve in the tin for a while, i love it, but it can get so messy, and you&#x27;re hands get all sticky afterwards. Well this tube solves all of that! It&#x27;s great, and my hands stay clean. Win!</li>
            <li> Love this. I use this every day.  I can&#x27;t live with my chapped lips without rose balm. Love not having to use the tin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for your lips, wish they made body lotion that was as good for my body. Purchased extras for stocking stuffers so my family would stay kissable.</li>
            <li> I love the original Rosebud salve in a tin - but that seems unsanitary so I love this instead! Note - only one comes with this even though the picture shows two</li>
            <li> Easier to use than in the little pot. Smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Like having in the tube for my purse!</li>
            <li> This light lip tint and excellent moisturizer is probably one of the best on the market and the price is very reasonable. I have them stashed everywhere, home, purse, office, etc...</li>
            <li> Not really a rosebud salve like c.o.bigelow. Pass on this one. Disappointed because I wanted a salve in a tube to take to work with me.</li>
            <li> Amazon gives great review of Rosebud salve so I thought I should give it a try. The lovely rose scent is very pleasant, but the color is so light that you can barely see it after applying to the lips. Same thing happens when you try to put a bit on your face. I am a little disappointed in the effect.</li>
            <li> It can get REALLY liquid-y if you leave it in a warm place. I respect that it&#x27;s been around for ages but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the baby powder rose smell... I was expecting more of a natural rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not horrible so I still use it.</li>
            <li> Been using Rosebud Salve for years. I especially use it for bedtime so that I don&#x27;t have dry lips! It never dries out my lips or becomes cakey. It has a &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; rose fragrance that is never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I was in dire need of lip balm during a cold snap.  My lips were sore, throbbing, and beckoning my tongue to keep licking them.  I found an old tube of Chapstick that was pure punishment to rake over my sore lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve and it arrived in two days.  I tore open the package ready to do anything to soothe my throbbing lips.  I applied a generous squeeze to the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate relief, I kid you not.  5 days of lip suffering a distant memory.  Soft, smooth and soothed lips were now painlessly attached to my face.  As it wore off I applied a little more for about 4 hour and by then, I didn&#x27;t need it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is safely tucked away in my purse until next time.</li>
            <li> The best salve in the world and it will heal chapped lips in 2 uses!!!!</li>
            <li> I always liked Rosebud Salve in the tin, but this one is even better. No need to dip your finger.</li>
            <li> Somehow the Rose smell is cloying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and really like it. I prefer the tubes to the little tins because the squeeze tubes make it so you can apply it without touching your mouth with your hands when they are grimy (for instance right after riding the subway). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the packaging. The seller sticks this large annoying sticker partially over the shrink wrap the manufacturer always has on there. The sticker makes it more difficult to remove the already kind of difficult to remove shrink wrap and the part that isn&#x27;t on the shrink wrap stays on the tube and looks bad. Wish they would get rid of that sticker!</li>
            <li> Easy to use tube, makes your lips soft, and has a very light rose smell.</li>
            <li> Rosebud Salve was recommended by Dr. Oz so I decided to try it, found it satisfactory.  The product was properly packaged and promptly shipped, arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Salve - nothing else works nearly as well or as quickly on healing my chapped lips, especially during long winters.  Although I love the convenience and the cleanliness of having a tube-version of their product on-the-go, it just does not work quite as well as the original version that comes in the pot.  It seems like they cut back on the amount of petrolatum that goes into the formula in order to have it more easily squeeze out of the the little hole at the top perhaps?  That&#x27;s my theory anyways...haven&#x27;t found anything better and I love the subtle-barely-there fragrance when applying.</li>
            <li> Rosebud Salve in a Tube is a very nice lip balm - a gentle, subtle, natural-smelling rose scent, and a pleasant texture and feel on the lips. I wear it to bed at night and wake up with my lips feeling soft and smooth, not waxy or sticky. My only complaint is that the description describes this as being free of petrochemicals. It is basically petroleum jelly with a nice scent. Petroleum jelly is very effective for chapped lips, but if you are looking for an all-natural product, this isn&#x27;t it. I am disappointed. As much as I liked it, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> THis salve is great.  i was buying it somewhere else and they quit carrying it.  i use it for cuts and acne.  clears up fast!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, and already I notice my lips aren&#x27;t peeling, like they were constantly with Chapstick (which I&#x27;ve learned was a result of an additive Chapstick deliberately adds, to keep you using more!). The smell is wonderful, and I like that it&#x27;s in a tube...I&#x27;m in the medical field, so I prefer not to touch my face while at work whenever possible. I&#x27;m a convert for life!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff, feels so creamy on. My grandfather use to bring this to me in the little tins when I was a little girl in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Have been waiting a long time for RoseBud in the tube.  More convenient for men and children to take everywhere .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to carry around and use especially for traveling.  The smell is also very nice, which makes it better than Vaseline.  I use it frequently and carry it with me at all times!</li>
            <li> Love this lip moisturizer. I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Did not receive this In a tube it came in th tin! And it feels like I could just rub petroleum jelly on my lips and get the same result doesn&#x27;t not feel nourishing.</li>
            <li> Was sent the wrong from of this product, instead of an easy to use tube lip balm I received a tin of the product. I am a nurse and was looking for a high quality lip balm to keep in my pocket, unfortunately this is unusable to me because the tin is messy, large and, most importantly, could cause contamination issues in my place of work because of the need to put your fingers in the product. I am extremely disappointed with my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a chap stick or a gloss that gives my lips the moisture and prevents chipped lips. I get extremely dry lips all year round, and more so in the winter time. I think I finally found the product that works. This product works really well for a fraction of the cost of other more expensive options. I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and other cheaper drug store brands, as well as Fresh (by sugar), and other more expensive options. This one is great. The taste is not overwhelming, and it works.</li>
            <li> Nothing clears up chapped lips like this salve, but I have also used it on burns, sunburn, and any other skin that need a little pampering.  Great to travel with- I have pulled it out for all sorts of chafing and other difficulties.</li>
            <li> I used to use my Rosebud Salve in a tin, but hated that I had to use my finger to put it on. Now that I have it in a tube, I love the product even more!!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing &amp; feels like butter on the lips, but I had an allergic reaction to something in it. Within 24 hours I got small bumps all over my lips that took over a week to fade. They also felt like pins and needles for hours. I tried it again a few weeks later in case it was something else, but it was this. So unfortunate because I know this is a cult favorite. I get that reaction from a number of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and ELF cosmetics as well, so if you get a reaction from those it may not be for you, but if you don&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll probably love it like everyone else!</li>
            <li> Okay, bought it for lips, ended up using it on hands (especially the rough cuticle areas that seem to split in very dry weather) and it is excellent. Those who call this &#x27;Vaseline&#x27; are misleading you (yeah, it has petroleum in the makeup but this is a far better product than petroleum - I used to spread Vaseline on my hands at night after a long dry day in the field and &#x27;it&#x27; did help BUT NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT). Rosebud Salve stays on better, absorbs better and definitely moisturizes better. I have also used it on rough knees and heels and it will still be moist in the morning. Good product, a little pricey but the little tin goes a long way so I suspect the tube will last longer.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my lips, and think its a pretty good ointment.  Sometimes I feel like the rose smell is just a bit too strong for me.  If this was unscented, I would give it 5 stars.  (The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, I just prefer unscented products in general).</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance. It is more on the oily side though. I tend to have dry chapped lips so sometimes it is not enough. It is more on the gloss side. But it will be good for summer days when my lips won&#x27;t be as chapped as in the winter months. Buy it if your lips are not super dry and chapped. Otherwise, purchase the tin version which is more like a salve. There are petroleum based ingredients in it as they are great occlusives- which means that they do not allow water from the lips to escape.</li>
            <li> i love this! i keep it near my bed and put it on every night. my lips always had a dry spot (bottom lip, center) that i could not get rid of no matter how hard i tried. this took care of it and i LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well on my cracked and dry winter lips. I&#x27;ve tried many, many products, and this one is among the top few.</li>
            <li> Someone is using the same tube to sell an inferior product, it is not the same in color, consistency, and smell.  Shame on you!</li>
            <li> My family and I keep this on hand all the time!! Its great for chapped lips..wind burn..sun burn..fever blisters and so on. I use as an everyday lip balm and love it!</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this in the tin and decided she would love it even more if it came in a different package.  Lo and behold here it is...  She doesn&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I really like this salve. It&#x27;s just petroleum jelly with rose scent (it&#x27;s also slightly pink), but since that was what I was looking for, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of fragrances, but not this one, which is nice and mild. That being said, it&#x27;s not what I would call a classic or old fashioned rose scent, though I do like it.</li>
            <li> This is easier to use than the tin one, I enjoy both them. The product arrived on time and it was sealed. Easy to apply, moisturizing as always.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm out there! Subtle scent, glides on smooth, and heals cracked lips. Also it is cruelty free!</li>
            <li> this was just what I needed I got the tube but I will have to get more soon. I have used it on my face. and lips. Good Stuff</li>
            <li> The Rosebud Salve in the tin works better. This is thin and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My lips have never been softer. It is light, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like most products do.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of positive ratings for this, so I grabbed a tube. At first, I really didn&#x27;t see a difference on my lips. They feel dry all the time. Then after a week, my lips started to get smooth but not necessarily soft. I also saw some shine. I reapply the salve around three to four times a day. Then there&#x27;s the fact that it has petroleum in it :( If it has it in there and the product works, that&#x27;s great but I have a huge thing of that already which wasn&#x27;t working for me, which is probably why this isn&#x27;t working that well. So the petroleum and application factor is why I only gave it three stars. It does work for a while, but I need to find something that keeps my lips moisturized longer.</li>
