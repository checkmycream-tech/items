            <li>Really great product!</li>
            <li>over all it was perfect, and</li>
            <li>It is perfectly matte and still allows your hair to be pliable and touchable.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>Thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>I feel this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>best thing about it,</li>

            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy, stays in all day!</li>
            <li>Gatsby is a very good brand.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD BUY.</li>
            <li>Words cannot even describe how good Gatsby products work!</li>
            <li>Great product but not for me.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again (great for &amp;#34;anime&amp;#34; hairstyles)</li>
            <li>I am so happy.</li>
            <li>Either way, its definitely a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>After trying most of the Gatsby Moving Rubber products, I found this one worked best to shape and hold my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, hold, light, matte, awesome.  </li>
            <li>everything is good about this product</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend and he liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Either way if your trying to get a spiky look then this is your product but honestly...</li>
            <li>Good product like most</li>
            <li>Having used many hair products I can safely say this is the best one for my hair (soft/medium/) and full to medium volume.</li>
            <li>But this is a good thing you get a nice strong hold, no greasy look, and you don&#x27;t need a lot at all.</li>
            <li>Product is a bit sticky for my liking, but on the positive side it does leave your hair looking great.</li>
            <li>I can get wonderful rock and roll/anime hair looks with Technical Clay.</li>
            <li>This one seems the most wind resistant as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much and it does a great job holding your hair.</li>
            <li>I love Moving Rubber</li>
            <li>(this stuff is more for texture, I doubt its for spiking).</li>
            <li>It works better then</li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>like this product better than gels, mouse.</li>
            <li>I have super-thick hair, and most products just can&#x27;t help me style it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better and doubt I will anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Very friendly service</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for styling really short hair, and the pink one is perfect for mid-length hair.</li>
            <li>Gatsby gives me excellent hold without using a hair dryer or any other product on top of it.</li>
            <li>Perfect hold and no shine, just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Easy to style and manipulate.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread easily on your hands.</li>
            <li>Fairly strong hold, but</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always searching for super-extra strong styling creams/pomades/waxes/gels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for fine tuning your hairdo</li>
            <li>It smells nice and works to a certain extend but it does not hold my hair the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>Best if used after a shower with towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought it was a light &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; type scent</li>
            <li>This is meant primarily for the tips of your hair.</li>
            <li>Right now, between this and the Sebastian Craft Clay Remoldable Matte Texturizer, they are my top products thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely perfect for any style that doesn&#x27;t require an extremely stiff hold.</li>
            <li>and it is super strong.  </li>
            <li>But the product does leave the hair soft and touchable with exceptional hold.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews, but  this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I first tested it out at the japanese supermarket, Marukai and loved it!  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat thick, medium fine hair and this stuff works great!  </li>
            <li>Gatsby is more gooey with a stick-to-anything kind of texture, especially your hair.</li>
            <li>But this by far is the best I have ever used, my hair always tends to fall flat regardless of which paste, pomade, mousse, gel, etc..</li>
            <li>too much made flakes in my hair as you end up putting clay on top of clay...</li>
            <li>Good for next day look.</li>
            <li>I guess it is a bit thicker than the regular wax, but he says its good.</li>
            <li>This product works great w/ any of the other Gatsby products.</li>
            <li>It creates really good spikes and I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to people with long hair unless your using this on top of another product like Gatsby Air Rise.</li>
            <li>i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced</li>
            <li>I was recommended it by a friend after they said my previous clay product didn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>This clay holds strong all day and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I was actually quite impressed that this did indeed hold throughout a rather long (10+ hours) and humid day.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a larger version because I use so much more of it at a time!</li>
            <li>THANKS A LOT!!</li>
            <li>because if it were the travel size, I wouldn&#x27;t expect to pay more than $5 for it.&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is a bit crazy, I think this is the best clay Gatsby has.</li>
            <li>If you want something matte with pliability, this is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I use this extensively and find the hold and texture excellent; however, be sure you don&#x27;t use too much, else it becomes heavy.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is no where near as good as Moving Rubber.</li>
            <li>it stays as if you just put it in fresh.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is strong but not in a obviously \\&quot;over done\\&quot; way .. it leaves your hair looking light and airy.  </li>
            <li>absolutely no shine has a pretty strong hold which is perfect for that messy unkempt look</li>
            <li>It applies to dry or wet hair (dampened with hot water is best).</li>
            <li>I can definitely see it being handy during the really hot/humid tropical summer weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for over a year now to style my undercuts and although it was meant for Asian hair types, it is without a doubt my favorite product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I think this product is really great but for someone who has a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li>, although I think the latter has a better balance of holds-steady-and-easy-to-rinse.</li>
            <li>The only wax that comes close to this is Gatsby perfect hold ultra hard wax.</li>
            <li>The stuff smells just as great as all the other Gatsby products, which is such a plus.</li>
            <li>.. if you&#x27;ve used other products similar, you know it holds great</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have that wonderful green apple smell other Gatsby products have.</li>
            <li>Let it dry and restyle without more product.  </li>
            <li>This specific product has a strong duration effect.</li>
            <li>and i have no idea of what hair products to get for a certain look.</li>
            <li>I have short to medium Asian hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very still and feels caked on.</li>
            <li>the wax does its job very well.</li>
            <li>My son has straight hair and he needs hair cream that will put body and well as style to his hair.</li>
            <li>straight up</li>
            <li>The Gatsby Perfect Hold Wax Extra Hard is water soluble and washes out easy but not very strong and mainly used for texture.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s lots of other products better then this.</li>
            <li>Smells great but its such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and this stuff is able to hold its shape very well and is also reshapeable.</li>
            <li>when i got this wax all i did was take a small amount, warm it up in my hands by rubbing in between my palms and then just worked it into my hair.</li>
            <li>The normal sized Gatsby doesn&#x27;t even cost this much yet this one is also the mini-travel size.</li>
            <li>I live by this stuff!</li>
            <li>After searching for some decent hair clay I decided to try this stuff out.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very natural look and holds styling very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product, I am sold</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Hair Wax.</li>
            <li>so I use a little of this to fix it and use another more relaxed gel for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>so I had to shampoo my hair when I normally wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The green bottle seems to be my favorite out of all the others.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super tacky and a pain to wash out, but if you really need something to stick and not look &#x27;wet&#x27;</li>
            <li>and when I got home that night it was right where I left it.  </li>
            <li>I rated it three stars because I gave it to a friend and they seem to enjoy it, but prefer other clays.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new product to use that</li>
            <li>Personally I didn&#x27;t really like this product that much..</li>
            <li>I should have double checked the size, but for the price I was paying I expected more.</li>
            <li>very natural feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The thing i love about this stuff though is very little is required to hold your hair ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d obviously need to use a little more product, but it&#x27;s very versatile.)  </li>
            <li>What I liked much less - and I expected this the moment I put my hand into this product</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong enough to finally get my hair to stay up the entire day with a lil help from hairspray.  </li>
            <li>At the time of this review, size wasn&#x27;t clearly specified.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size (mistake on my part)</li>
            <li>Sebastian Craft Clay is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>It looks and feel like your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wild and spiky</li>
            <li>rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;</li>
            <li>Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li>If you are looking to try Gatsby products this one is amazing, not too much hold, not too little, no shine, and only need a little bit to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe that I cannot find Gatsby in any store, I was a little skeptical at first because I have tried several different brands before Gatsby that also had very good reviews.</li>
            <li>I can take my helmet off, and if it doesnt bounce right back up it only takes a second to fix without needing to add anymore</li>
            <li>This particular Gatsby product gives the natural messy hair look, their is absolutely zero indication that any product was in my hair after I used it.</li>
            <li>I guess the habits from other product lead me to abuse this one at first &#x3D;</li>
            <li>Half size to full size of a dime was plenty enough.</li>
            <li>Being Asian this helps him to keep his style the way he wants it so it does not stay flat and falls on his face.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick and straight Asian hair, so even though this is a &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; clay, I use this as a normal molder for my entire head instead of just the tips.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used clay in the past and it was the only thing strong enough to hold my medium-short hair)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I can do everything I need to as far as styling goes even when it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li>and it was much smaller than expected, but the seller clearly states the size on description and it is as described.</li>

            <li> I think this product is really great but for someone who has a thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> , although I think the latter has a better balance of holds-steady-and-easy-to-rinse.</li>
            <li> The only wax that comes close to this is Gatsby perfect hold ultra hard wax.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells just as great as all the other Gatsby products, which is such a plus.</li>
            <li> .. if you&#x27;ve used other products similar, you know it holds great</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have that wonderful green apple smell other Gatsby products have.</li>
            <li> Let it dry and restyle without more product.  </li>
            <li> This specific product has a strong duration effect.</li>
            <li> and i have no idea of what hair products to get for a certain look.</li>
            <li> I have short to medium Asian hair and this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very still and feels caked on.</li>
            <li> the wax does its job very well.</li>
            <li> My son has straight hair and he needs hair cream that will put body and well as style to his hair.</li>
            <li> straight up</li>
            <li> The Gatsby Perfect Hold Wax Extra Hard is water soluble and washes out easy but not very strong and mainly used for texture.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s lots of other products better then this.</li>
            <li> Smells great but its such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this stuff is able to hold its shape very well and is also reshapeable.</li>
            <li> when i got this wax all i did was take a small amount, warm it up in my hands by rubbing in between my palms and then just worked it into my hair.</li>
            <li> The normal sized Gatsby doesn&#x27;t even cost this much yet this one is also the mini-travel size.</li>
            <li> I live by this stuff!</li>
            <li> After searching for some decent hair clay I decided to try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very natural look and holds styling very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product, I am sold</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Hair Wax.</li>
            <li> so I use a little of this to fix it and use another more relaxed gel for the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> so I had to shampoo my hair when I normally wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The green bottle seems to be my favorite out of all the others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super tacky and a pain to wash out, but if you really need something to stick and not look &#x27;wet&#x27;</li>
            <li> and when I got home that night it was right where I left it.  </li>
            <li> I rated it three stars because I gave it to a friend and they seem to enjoy it, but prefer other clays.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new product to use that</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t really like this product that much..</li>
            <li> I should have double checked the size, but for the price I was paying I expected more.</li>
            <li> very natural feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The thing i love about this stuff though is very little is required to hold your hair ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d obviously need to use a little more product, but it&#x27;s very versatile.)  </li>
            <li> What I liked much less - and I expected this the moment I put my hand into this product</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong enough to finally get my hair to stay up the entire day with a lil help from hairspray.  </li>
            <li> At the time of this review, size wasn&#x27;t clearly specified.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size (mistake on my part)</li>
            <li> Sebastian Craft Clay is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> It looks and feel like your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wild and spiky</li>
            <li> rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;</li>
            <li> Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li> If you are looking to try Gatsby products this one is amazing, not too much hold, not too little, no shine, and only need a little bit to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe that I cannot find Gatsby in any store, I was a little skeptical at first because I have tried several different brands before Gatsby that also had very good reviews.</li>
            <li> I can take my helmet off, and if it doesnt bounce right back up it only takes a second to fix without needing to add anymore</li>
            <li> This particular Gatsby product gives the natural messy hair look, their is absolutely zero indication that any product was in my hair after I used it.</li>
            <li> I guess the habits from other product lead me to abuse this one at first &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Half size to full size of a dime was plenty enough.</li>
            <li> Being Asian this helps him to keep his style the way he wants it so it does not stay flat and falls on his face.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick and straight Asian hair, so even though this is a &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; clay, I use this as a normal molder for my entire head instead of just the tips.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used clay in the past and it was the only thing strong enough to hold my medium-short hair)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can do everything I need to as far as styling goes even when it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li> and it was much smaller than expected, but the seller clearly states the size on description and it is as described.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t knowif I like clay as much as wax but this small thing will last forever.</li>
            <li> I spike my hair and it looks natural but as it gets 5 inches long, the pink gatsby itself doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Matte color and not super glossy to sticky to work with, very natural to use.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s okay in terms of hold and smell and such but its really really hard to wash off your hair especially if you use like a dime sized amount.</li>
            <li> when my hair gets slightly too long for normal gels to give lift, this stuff seals the deal.</li>
            <li> This product hold my hair up but for only so long.</li>
            <li> it would just look flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out, but it gives me any style I want and holds it while being very workable and re-workable throughout the day if necessary.  </li>
            <li> He spent a few years in Korea and he really like the hair products from there</li>
            <li> The more expensive alternative is the craft clay by Sebastian, but you can definitely save a few bucks and go with this product for very similar results.  </li>
            <li> The product makes your hair a little ore voluminous and textured while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> That I have used in the past, I purchaed the technical design clay and the moving rubber wild shake.</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey ---</li>
            <li> (close to 3 inches long)</li>
            <li> A smal amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy for such a small container, but you need less than a dime size and it will hold for about 36-48 HRS (depending on how much you use).</li>
            <li> wet / Blue --- Wet / Medium long to long</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve used other wax before, it&#x27;s all the same.</li>
            <li> Tried several other products before using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than other Gatsby products at 1.8oz</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium</li>
            <li> Just like other colors, it has the green apple aroma and performs excellent without making your hair looks disgustingly sticky like pomade.</li>
            <li> a Caucasian male with thicker, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up receiving half of what I expected, which is similar to being charged twice.</li>
            <li> I just use this to style my entire hair though because I got thick Asian hair that just lies flat with every other product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So I recomend you too put only a little in your hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to fluff up my textured layers and shape the ends to points.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit harder to wash out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a ridiculous amount of products - everything from Hanz de Fuko to Murray&#x27;s to American Crew - and this is the one thing I always come back</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have on this is that it is a little hard to wash out, to really get it all out maybe shampoo twice in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Again, use sparingly, a little but goes A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to be a &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; clay, they only offer it in a small package.</li>
            <li> Be extremely cautious about who is selling it and confirm the unit size.  </li>
            <li> Use after other gatsby products for definition</li>
            <li> However that is a small price to pay for finally getting something that can style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Gatsby products and they work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below are other Gatsby products that I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just make sure to keep this stuff at room temperature because if you let it get cold, it&#x27;s way too hard to scrape out and to mold.</li>
            <li> - is that it was really, really hard to wash off (think multiple shampoo-rinse runs).</li>
            <li> Plus, it was expensive for how much you get.</li>
            <li> the negative side, Technical Clay is also the hardest to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake, its not the real Gatsby .. .</li>
            <li> it holds up my hair quite firmly without any shine.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the wax pomade because it had such a greasy feel, and it lacked the holding strength.</li>
            <li> Can style you hair without that heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it with the pink gatsby which I&#x27;ve used for at least 5 years now.</li>
            <li> but you do need to put effort to break down it hard but holds well without any hardness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use with my thick hair and the hold seems pretty weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but they either have a weak hold, make my hair to shiny, or a combination of both, so instead of a messy look</li>
            <li> The container is also so small that I keep one in my bag all the time just in case</li>
            <li> However the larger &amp;#34;Moving Rubber Hair Wax&amp;#34; tends to be sticky and difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> And the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This product is very heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have like this stupid bang thing only on the left side of my hair</li>
            <li> The clay is a bit hard and you do NOT need a lot.</li>
            <li> It is hard and a bit crumbly, and when you scrub it to your hair, a lot of the stuff remains on your palm and fingers.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting something that makes your hair hard, this is not the product to choose.</li>
            <li> If your girl loves running her fingers through your hair be prepared to get negative feedback on your hair.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something similar clay to the discontinued Matrix Dirty Trixx product.</li>
            <li> it can create edgy spiky clumps.</li>
            <li> I also find it looses its luster if your hair is too thick because of amount required.</li>
            <li> A very small amount will add volume and texture.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sort of ridiculous</li>
            <li> It is definitely tough stuff and hard to get out of my hair when washing.</li>
            <li> but too much is very hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to wash out.  </li>
            <li> I got this after teh american crew molding clay horrible dissapointed.   </li>
            <li> it was  a  bit expensive and never taught i would find it on amazon.   </li>
            <li> (i may be wrong on how to use this stuff).</li>
            <li> Maybe im using it wrong?</li>
            <li> i like the not shiny texture but, sometime it gave me alot of flake, attract alot of dirt and powder, since i work in a enviroment that has a lot of powder flying around, it attract them all. :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Leaves hair very still and feels caked on. Also doesn&#x27;t seem to be water soluble so I had to shampoo my hair when I normally wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Gatsby is a very good brand. This specific product has a strong duration effect. So I recomend you too put only a little in your hair.</li>
            <li> Product is a bit sticky for my liking, but on the positive side it does leave your hair looking great. Leaves a very natural look and holds styling very well. If your girl loves running her fingers through your hair be prepared to get negative feedback on your hair. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is strong but not in a obviously \\&quot;over done\\&quot; way .. it leaves your hair looking light and airy.  I got this after teh american crew molding clay horrible dissapointed.   I first tested it out at the japanese supermarket, Marukai and loved it!  it was  a  bit expensive and never taught i would find it on amazon.   How luck i was!  The clay is a bit hard and you do NOT need a lot. Half size to full size of a dime was plenty enough. For my short finger length hair.   I found putting too much made flakes in my hair as you end up putting clay on top of clay... You just need enough to coat the hair one time. I guess the habits from other product lead me to abuse this one at first &#x3D;P. But this is a good thing you get a nice strong hold, no greasy look, and you don&#x27;t need a lot at all.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick and straight Asian hair, so even though this is a &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; clay, I use this as a normal molder for my entire head instead of just the tips. The stuff smells just as great as all the other Gatsby products, which is such a plus. I have been using Gatsby for about 4 years now and they are still my number 1 brand. Right now, between this and the Sebastian Craft Clay Remoldable Matte Texturizer, they are my top products thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to keep this stuff at room temperature because if you let it get cold, it&#x27;s way too hard to scrape out and to mold. Also, using this regularly will help it from getting &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is supposed to be a &amp;#34;technical&amp;#34; clay, they only offer it in a small package. I wish there was a larger version because I use so much more of it at a time!</li>
            <li> After trying most of the Gatsby Moving Rubber products, I found this one worked best to shape and hold my hair. I can get wonderful rock and roll/anime hair looks with Technical Clay. I use it to fluff up my textured layers and shape the ends to points. This one seems the most wind resistant as well.</li>
            <li> im not a hair stylist or anything and i have no idea of what hair products to get for a certain look. when i got this wax all i did was take a small amount, warm it up in my hands by rubbing in between my palms and then just worked it into my hair. a hair stylist once told me that the style of my hair that i wanted, when i described it to her, it was called a fohawk. the wax does its job very well. it holds up my hair quite firmly without any shine. it does not hold spikes together like the hair gel ice spiker but holds up the hair to have a sort of rugged look (i may be wrong on how to use this stuff). this stuff is very good, epecially if you want a fohawk!</li>
            <li> Not water soluble, so it&#x27;s tough to wash out.  Fairly strong hold, but I&#x27;ve found that it wilts under heat/humidity.</li>
            <li> The only wax that comes close to this is Gatsby perfect hold ultra hard wax. The thing i love about this stuff though is very little is required to hold your hair ALL DAY. It works wonderfully. Be warned however, this is actual microcrystalline WAX.. if you&#x27;ve used other products similar, you know it holds great but too much is very hard to wash out. Again, use sparingly, a little but goes A LONG WAY. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough if you rock that bed head look.</li>
            <li> THANKS A LOT!! This is awesome for my azn hair ^_^ Arrived before the estimated date as well. Very happy with the product. &#x3D;^D</li>
            <li> Words cannot even describe how good Gatsby products work! I cannot believe that I cannot find Gatsby in any store, I was a little skeptical at first because I have tried several different brands before Gatsby that also had very good reviews. But this by far is the best I have ever used, my hair always tends to fall flat regardless of which paste, pomade, mousse, gel, etc.. That I have used in the past, I purchaed the technical design clay and the moving rubber wild shake. Gatsby gives me excellent hold without using a hair dryer or any other product on top of it. This particular Gatsby product gives the natural messy hair look, their is absolutely zero indication that any product was in my hair after I used it. I highly recommend using this product, I am sold I cannot believe that I haven&#x27;t found this earlier. 5 out of 5 stars.  Tip: Best if used after a shower with towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I feel tricked buying this product since nowhere on the amazon page does it say the sizing. The normal sized Gatsby doesn&#x27;t even cost this much yet this one is also the mini-travel size. That&#x27;s sort of ridiculous because if it were the travel size, I wouldn&#x27;t expect to pay more than $5 for it.&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is a bit crazy, I think this is the best clay Gatsby has. I usually use it with the pink gatsby which I&#x27;ve used for at least 5 years now. I spike my hair and it looks natural but as it gets 5 inches long, the pink gatsby itself doesn&#x27;t cut it. It cant hold my hair up all day but when I use it in addition to the technical design clay, my hair will stay up all day even through a workout or wearing a bike helmet for 6 hours. I can take my helmet off, and if it doesnt bounce right back up it only takes a second to fix without needing to add anymore wax.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit harder to wash out but if you&#x27;ve used other wax before, it&#x27;s all the same. Once shampoo hits it, its coming out.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said though, I can sweat during a 2 hour workout/ 6 hour bike ride or even walk around in the rain and my hair is going to stay up.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash out, but it gives me any style I want and holds it while being very workable and re-workable throughout the day if necessary.  Wind?  No problem!  Rain?  Let it dry and restyle without more product.  Heat? No problem!  Sweat? Same as rain.  I do two shampoos to get it out, and clarify once or twice a week.  I love this product. I HIGHLY recommend this product.  (Oh, I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, and I occasionally let it grow out to a medium-long length. I can do everything I need to as far as styling goes even when it&#x27;s long.  You&#x27;d obviously need to use a little more product, but it&#x27;s very versatile.)  The more expensive alternative is the craft clay by Sebastian, but you can definitely save a few bucks and go with this product for very similar results.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I received a 1.06 oz for the same price Amazon is charging for the 2.2 oz.  Be extremely cautious about who is selling it and confirm the unit size.  Because it is coming from Asia there may be confusion over oz to gram conversion, item itself may be mismarked.  I ended up receiving half of what I expected, which is similar to being charged twice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t knowif I like clay as much as wax but this small thing will last forever. You don&#x27;t need to use much and it does a great job holding your hair.</li>
            <li> I have like this stupid bang thing only on the left side of my hair so I use a little of this to fix it and use another more relaxed gel for the rest of my hair. VERY GOOD BUY.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick, medium fine hair and this stuff works great!  I used to use American Fiber.  This stuff is my go to product now!</li>
            <li> My son has straight hair and he needs hair cream that will put body and well as style to his hair. Being Asian this helps him to keep his style the way he wants it so it does not stay flat and falls on his face. He spent a few years in Korea and he really like the hair products from there so I decided to purchase him a bottle and he claims it works like a gem.</li>
            <li> Great product but not for me. Use after other gatsby products for definition</li>
            <li> Gatsby hair products are the only stuff that works in my hair. Will continue to buy as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> Have used a LOT of hair products over the years. Gatsby is THE S***. This one is perfect for styling really short hair, and the pink one is perfect for mid-length hair. Cannot praise this brand enough.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Perfect hold and no shine, just as I expected. I was surprised by the size (mistake on my part) and it was much smaller than expected, but the seller clearly states the size on description and it is as described. over all it was perfect, and I will be buying this again (great for &amp;#34;anime&amp;#34; hairstyles)</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something similar clay to the discontinued Matrix Dirty Trixx product. Sebastian Craft Clay is the closest I&#x27;ve found so far. I was hoping this one would be closer, but no dice. I used it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> This product was made to be used after already styling your hair with a different product.  It&#x27;s for fine tuning your hairdo and it is super strong.  I just use this to style my entire hair though because I got thick Asian hair that just lies flat with every other product I have ever used.  This stuff is strong enough to finally get my hair to stay up the entire day with a lil help from hairspray.  It is definitely tough stuff and hard to get out of my hair when washing. However that is a small price to pay for finally getting something that can style my hair.  I am so happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a ridiculous amount of products - everything from Hanz de Fuko to Murray&#x27;s to American Crew - and this is the one thing I always come back to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Caucasian male with thicker, slightly wavy hair. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for over a year now to style my undercuts and although it was meant for Asian hair types, it is without a doubt my favorite product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is perfectly matte and still allows your hair to be pliable and touchable. Plus it smells awesome! I&#x27;ve always thought it was a light &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; type scent but nobody ever seems to agree with me on that. Either way, its definitely a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely perfect for any style that doesn&#x27;t require an extremely stiff hold. If you want something matte with pliability, this is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to another clay after this. I was recommended it by a friend after they said my previous clay product didn&#x27;t smell great. This clay holds strong all day and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done. The container is also so small that I keep one in my bag all the time just in case I want to take a shower at work before I go out.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works to a certain extend but it does not hold my hair the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Good for next day look. Lasts all day. Easy to style and manipulate. Tried several other products before using this. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i like this good quality ship very fast and it is same as introduced everything is good about this product</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend and he liked it a lot. I guess it is a bit thicker than the regular wax, but he says its good.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and this stuff is able to hold its shape very well and is also reshapeable. Thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> when my hair gets slightly too long for normal gels to give lift, this stuff seals the deal. you just apply a tiny amount so it goes a long way</li>
            <li> This product is very heavy and sticky. It will stay in your hair for days even if you use a ton of shampoo. Maybe im using it wrong?</li>
            <li> After searching for some decent hair clay I decided to try this stuff out. I was tired of the wax pomade because it had such a greasy feel, and it lacked the holding strength. (I&#x27;ve used clay in the past and it was the only thing strong enough to hold my medium-short hair)&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has plenty of holding strength. It&#x27;s basically a matte finish, and ads volume to hair. It applies to dry or wet hair (dampened with hot water is best). It&#x27;s pricy for such a small container, but you need less than a dime size and it will hold for about 36-48 HRS (depending on how much you use).</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t really like this product that much.. I mean it&#x27;s okay in terms of hold and smell and such but its really really hard to wash off your hair especially if you use like a dime sized amount. It creates really good spikes and I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this to people with long hair unless your using this on top of another product like Gatsby Air Rise. Either way if your trying to get a spiky look then this is your product but honestly...there&#x27;s lots of other products better then this. I give this a 6.5/10.</li>
            <li> Good product like most but you do need to put effort to break down it hard but holds well without any hardness. Leave in for days and it just needs a dab to keep working</li>
            <li> I use this extensively and find the hold and texture excellent; however, be sure you don&#x27;t use too much, else it becomes heavy. I also find it looses its luster if your hair is too thick because of amount required.</li>
            <li> i like the not shiny texture but, sometime it gave me alot of flake, attract alot of dirt and powder, since i work in a enviroment that has a lot of powder flying around, it attract them all. :(</li>
            <li> I love Moving Rubber so I thought I would try Gatsby&#x27;s clay too. Wow, this is no where near as good as Moving Rubber. It&#x27;s difficult to use with my thick hair and the hold seems pretty weak. Also, this stuff does not want to wash out. I&#x27;d expect something this difficult to wash out to have a much better hold. It also doesn&#x27;t have that wonderful green apple smell other Gatsby products have. Plus, it was expensive for how much you get. I should have double checked the size, but for the price I was paying I expected more. I rated it three stars because I gave it to a friend and they seem to enjoy it, but prefer other clays.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this. I have short to medium Asian hair and this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve used other Gatsby products and they work well on my hair. However the larger &amp;#34;Moving Rubber Hair Wax&amp;#34; tends to be sticky and difficult to wash out. The Gatsby Perfect Hold Wax Extra Hard is water soluble and washes out easy but not very strong and mainly used for texture. I feel this product is perfect. A very small amount will add volume and texture. If you use it on the ends of your hair (edges) it can create edgy spiky clumps. The product makes your hair a little ore voluminous and textured while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> Having used many hair products I can safely say this is the best one for my hair (soft/medium/) and full to medium volume. Matte color and not super glossy to sticky to work with, very natural to use.</li>
            <li> I think this product is really great but for someone who has a thick head of hair. Im not bald or anything but my hair is alot thinner than before. This product hold my hair up but for only so long. Smells great but its such a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews, but  this stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s smaller than other Gatsby products at 1.8oz but a little goes a long way. it gives hair absolutely no shine has a pretty strong hold which is perfect for that messy unkempt look (this stuff is more for texture, I doubt its for spiking). I&#x27;ve tried other products but they either have a weak hold, make my hair to shiny, or a combination of both, so instead of a messy look it would just look flat and greasy. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> At the time of this review, size wasn&#x27;t clearly specified. Be aware that this is not the usual regular size 80g container but 30g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all the colors of Gatsby products. Technical Clay provides the strongest hold. It can shape your hair the way you want it. Just like other colors, it has the green apple aroma and performs excellent without making your hair looks disgustingly sticky like pomade. It looks and feel like your natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, Technical Clay is also the hardest to apply. It doesn&#x27;t spread easily on your hands. It is hard and a bit crumbly, and when you scrub it to your hair, a lot of the stuff remains on your palm and fingers. It is also hardest to shampoo, which is understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about it, even if your hair got messed up in the middle of the day, you don&#x27;t have to re-apply it. Just fix it and the \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot; still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are other Gatsby products that I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product / Container Color --- Style / Hair length&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Spiky Edge/Red --- Spiky and stirring / Very short to short hair&lt;br /&gt;Wild shake/Purple --- Wild and spiky / short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Air rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey --- Matte / Short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Cool wet / Blue --- Wet / Medium long to long</li>
            <li> This is a great product, hold, light, matte, awesome.  Was looking for a new product to use that did all these things and that I wouldn&#x27;t have to put a lot in my hair to get results, this nails it.  Also if you shape hair, and decide you want to play with it at some point in the day just reach up, move it around, and bam it stays as if you just put it in fresh.  The only complaint I have on this is that it is a little hard to wash out, to really get it all out maybe shampoo twice in the shower.  This product also is matte, and won&#x27;t start sagging through the day, just as a test i spiked my hair (close to 3 inches long) straight up and when I got home that night it was right where I left it.  If you are looking to try Gatsby products this one is amazing, not too much hold, not too little, no shine, and only need a little bit to get the job done.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super tacky and a pain to wash out, but if you really need something to stick and not look &#x27;wet&#x27; it works great.</li>
            <li> This product works great w/ any of the other Gatsby products. This is meant primarily for the tips of your hair. I highly recommend using this product with the Gatsby Moving Rubber Hair Wax. The green bottle seems to be my favorite out of all the others. This product line is the best hair product I have found. And the price is unbelievable. It works better then the salon stuff I have purchased in the salons for $30 plus dollars.</li>
            <li> Thank u.. Love the product.. Very friendly service</li>
            <li> Can style you hair without that heavy feeling.  very natural feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product better than gels, mouse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake, its not the real Gatsby .. . .. . . .. . . . . .  .</li>
            <li> I have super-thick hair, and most products just can&#x27;t help me style it - let alone hold the style... So I&#x27;m always searching for super-extra strong styling creams/pomades/waxes/gels. I was actually quite impressed that this did indeed hold throughout a rather long (10+ hours) and humid day. What I liked much less - and I expected this the moment I put my hand into this product - is that it was really, really hard to wash off (think multiple shampoo-rinse runs). It just stuck to my hair too well, even when I wanted to get rid of it! In case you&#x27;re wondering, I&#x27;d say the hold is probably comparable to [[ASIN:B00999CJES Star Wax Clay by Star Pro Line | 5 fl. oz. Jar]], although I think the latter has a better balance of holds-steady-and-easy-to-rinse. Gatsby is more gooey with a stick-to-anything kind of texture, especially your hair. I can definitely see it being handy during the really hot/humid tropical summer weather.</li>
            <li> Product holds well and hair can be molded and reshaped. This product gives off a medium shine and is not considered matte. A smal amount goes a long way. If you are wanting something that makes your hair hard, this is not the product to choose. But the product does leave the hair soft and touchable with exceptional hold.</li>
            <li> I live by this stuff! I&#x27;ve went through countless amounts of different gels, clays, fibers, goops, glues and who knows what else. Then I found this. Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy, stays in all day! I haven&#x27;t found anything better and doubt I will anytime soon.</li>
