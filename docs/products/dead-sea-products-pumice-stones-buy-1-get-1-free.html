            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good texture.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t try this product yet, I am very pleased with the size and texture of the stone.</li>
            <li>This works great to smooth out the skin and get my feet presentable for summer sandals.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly.</li>
            <li>But this seems really nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years and this one is my favorite and a good product for the price as well.</li>
            <li>the buy one get one free line was the part that convinced me, i love free stuff!!!</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Works great on my very calloused feet!</li>
            <li>Still useful but not as pleasant to the touch as the finer grained pumice.  </li>
            <li>They have many crevices</li>
            <li>What a deal- Buy 1 get 1 free!?</li>
            <li>looks the way you want and is more comfortable!</li>
            <li>they shipped fast which is also great.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many products for bottoms of your feet, most not working.  </li>
            <li>Healthy Feet foot cream  </li>
            <li>Much more textured than most I&#x27;ve bought in stores which I like.</li>
            <li>This truly is the real thing and words great after a shower.</li>
            <li>These work great, was used to the square shape pumice stones, but these are much nicer to use in the shower or tub.</li>
            <li>Why do most of the reviews comment about not being like the picture?</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>It is a must for all women even men to help in foot care, I was looking for something better than what is available in the stores.</li>
            <li>Product works fine.  </li>
            <li>A really real pumice stone that gets the job done and fits nicely into the hand for use.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the soles of my feet feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>this was buy one get one free.</li>
            <li>I use this  from time to time to clean my feet, my elbows, ankles, any body areas that need it.</li>
            <li>and so you can be more gentle when using them.</li>
            <li>stores sell similar items but they are not as good and gentle,and can really work well on your skin compare to this, even those famous brand products .</li>
            <li>These are fairly big and fit nicely in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>Will buy again in 15 years when I need a new pumice stone. :)</li>
            <li>And the fact that you buy one and get one free makes it a real bargain.</li>
            <li>on my way to purchasing this product for my self will give my own personal feedback soon!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(I rarely wear shoes.)</li>
            <li>For me tho I&#x27;ll stick to good (old fashioned) natural occurring ROCK.</li>
            <li>The other looks more like the picture, is flatter, with more holes.  </li>
            <li>One area on my right foot would</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap, I loose more change in my car than the price of this rock.</li>
            <li>buy a decent sized container and add salt (normally for swimming pools), stir the salt, let it melt; add your garments, let soak 2-5 days depending on how many garments are soaking (use rocks, bricks,etc.</li>
            <li>#34;This reviewer said that!?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Looks a bit creepy, but so wonderful on the feet.</li>
            <li>Pumice stones do their job....and are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This pumice stone was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Because they seem more porous they do clean up easier after use than stones I have had previously.  </li>
            <li>to remove the captured air in certain garments by helping sink them below the water).</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>I saw a big difference after one use and a huge difference after two.</li>
            <li>Not that you don&#x27;t get 1 for buying 1, but really this is 2 for the price listed.  </li>
            <li>That is different than buying 1 and getting 1 for free.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to soak your feet in Epson salt water  (really Warm)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I really, really like this pumice stone.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;sometimes feel very tender just from walking in leather shoes.  </li>
            <li>Besides making the surfaces of these calloused area much smoother, there has also been&lt;</li>
            <li>this has really helped heal my foot</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Also if it hurts your feet then maybe you don&#x27;t need a REAL pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Better than last pumice stones.&lt;br /&gt;If not boiled they will smell after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but even one use is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It has a flat surface but larger holes than a synthetic pumice stone, so it scrapes better.</li>
            <li>I use it for weight lifting to smooth my hands a bit, but I gave the other one to my girlfriend</li>
            <li>Not really experienced with the stones, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>If your feet are sensitive then buy a concrete manufactured one.</li>
            <li>Used for first time last night.</li>
            <li>These pumice stones are very odd looking, but really do work better than a regular pumice stone.</li>
            <li>This pumice is very coarse (large holes).  </li>
            <li>This is simply a scam to charge you twice as much.</li>
            <li>, i got it for my mom for mothers day since she had her old pumice stone for years</li>
            <li>Calloused areas developed and remained on the pressure points on the front of both my feet over the years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second one had much finer holes and works quite well.</li>
            <li>This product works better with less mess, and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>last pumice stone I bought that just cracked was five or six years old).</li>
            <li>I walk alot and have developed callouses especially in the area just below the &amp;#34;big toe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(Btw: first review I cared to write because none of the previous ones helped me make a decision.)</li>
            <li>I received a mix of small too large it is very efficient compared to your standard white pumice stone</li>
            <li>But it was not until I began to get much older that the areas, one on particular, began to become excessively sore.  </li>

            <li> Now that I am looking back at one of the product photos - it looks like what you get (or one of them): a pumice rock with very large exposed air holes (like a half inch across) with razor sharp jagged edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large and heavy and solid, and seems like it will last a long time...and a bonus one?  </li>
            <li> Not the tiny almost flat pumace stones you find at the stores...</li>
            <li> Must let it dry out before next use</li>
            <li> Let dry outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> (2nd or 3rd soaking add some bleach if you are not pleased with the affect thus far -stir</li>
            <li> well spent</li>
            <li> I kept one and gave the other to my mother.</li>
            <li> I kept one and gave the other as a gift.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned that this was not good enough or to rough.</li>
            <li> but instead the real rough stone you wanted.</li>
            <li> I have dry feet and always get hard skin.</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, has very few holes and is very much egg-shaped (much larger than a chicken&#x27;s egg though!).  </li>
            <li> they give you two one has small porous size holes and the other</li>
            <li> They e-mailed me saying it was going to take a little longer because of all the snow storms .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward and I feel like it really isn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for scrubbing dead skin from my FEET.</li>
            <li> Finally something rough enough to attack the nasty dead skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rock hopefully (at least that is what the product is advertised as).</li>
            <li> If I took this to my skin it wold seriously lacerate me.</li>
            <li> Only painful if used improperly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside a lot, hate wearing shoes in the summer</li>
            <li> Who could go wrong?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are fairly big and fit nicely in the palm of your hand. Not the tiny almost flat pumace stones you find at the stores... and you get TWO of them. They have many crevices and so you can be more gentle when using them. They are great!</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and I think i got a great deal for my money! Both stones are quality items and do the job they are intended.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t try this product yet, I am very pleased with the size and texture of the stone. And the fact that you buy one and get one free makes it a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Another great product, I would order it again!</li>
            <li> Perfect pumice stone.  Works well and does its job.  Must let it dry out before next use</li>
            <li> am so happy I found this product here, I don&#x27;t need to go to another country to purchase this. I use this  from time to time to clean my feet, my elbows, ankles, any body areas that need it. It is a choice piece in my bath tub and shower.&lt;br /&gt;other stores sell similar items but they are not as good and gentle,and can really work well on your skin compare to this, even those famous brand products .</li>
            <li> Not that you don&#x27;t get 1 for buying 1, but really this is 2 for the price listed.  That is different than buying 1 and getting 1 for free.  If you go into a physical store and find a buy 1, get 1, you need to put 2 items in your cart.  Otherwise, you only get 1 for the listed price.  Here, placing 2 in your cart generates a double charge and gives you 4 items.  This is simply a scam to charge you twice as much.</li>
            <li> One of the best pumice stones that I&#x27;ve every used. I&#x27;m outside a lot, hate wearing shoes in the summer so this is a must have for me. I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years and this one is my favorite and a good product for the price as well.</li>
            <li> What a deal- Buy 1 get 1 free!? And the price point is perfect! If you wish to stress some of your dungarees/coarse jackets/shorts, etc. buy a decent sized container and add salt (normally for swimming pools), stir the salt, let it melt; add your garments, let soak 2-5 days depending on how many garments are soaking (use rocks, bricks,etc. to remove the captured air in certain garments by helping sink them below the water). Remove your garment and use the pumice stones on the ares you want stressed. Re-soak. Use the pumice stones again until you are happy with the effect. Let dry outside in the sun. Wash in load w/extra softner and your garment looks the way you want and is more comfortable! (2nd or 3rd soaking add some bleach if you are not pleased with the affect thus far -stir well, add garments)</li>
            <li> the buy one get one free line was the part that convinced me, i love free stuff!!!, i got it for my mom for mothers day since she had her old pumice stone for years, she says they work great. they shipped fast which is also great. im on my way to purchasing this product for my self will give my own personal feedback soon!! have a great day ! :)</li>
            <li> Finally something rough enough to attack the nasty dead skin on my heels. Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best pumice stone I&#x27;ve ever used! I agonized over which one to buy (why is it when I get on amazon, everything seems like a life or death decision? &amp;#34;This reviewer said this...&amp;#34; &amp;#34;This reviewer said that!?&amp;#34;). Anyway, I finally settled on this one. It has a flat surface but larger holes than a synthetic pumice stone, so it scrapes better. It&#x27;s not jagged at all, though, which is what I was worried about. The shape and holes are quite uniform. It&#x27;s reddish, but its color doesn&#x27;t run or stain. It has worked wonders on my feet. I saw a big difference after one use and a huge difference after two. The packaging was unimpressive, but I don&#x27;t think I would have noticed if others hadn&#x27;t said something. It just seemed like they were trying to get it in the smallest package possible. Will buy again in 15 years when I need a new pumice stone. :)</li>
            <li> These pumice stones are very odd looking, but really do work better than a regular pumice stone. I kept one and gave the other to my mother.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I just don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s like rubbing a rock on your feet. It&#x27;s awkward and I feel like it really isn&#x27;t doing anything. I got caught up in the 2 for 1.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  We have tried so many products for bottoms of your feet, most not working.  We also bought cream called O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27; s Healthy Feet foot cream  to work with the stones.  Don&#x27;t forget to soak your feet in Epson salt water  (really Warm)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck  windchimes</li>
            <li> A really real pumice stone that gets the job done and fits nicely into the hand for use.  This is *not* on of those plastic deals covered in sandpaper but instead the real rough stone you wanted.</li>
            <li> These things are great!</li>
            <li> I really, really like this pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Looks a bit creepy, but so wonderful on the feet. Finally tossed my regular pumice after this.</li>
            <li> Unlike others I have tried, this works.</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, has very few holes and is very much egg-shaped (much larger than a chicken&#x27;s egg though!).  The other looks more like the picture, is flatter, with more holes.  Eh, won&#x27;t buy this one again when I need another pumice stone if it&#x27;s still offered (last pumice stone I bought that just cracked was five or six years old).</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it for weight lifting to smooth my hands a bit, but I gave the other one to my girlfriend and she loves it also!</li>
            <li> Calloused areas developed and remained on the pressure points on the front of both my feet over the years.  But it was not until I began to get much older that the areas, one on particular, began to become excessively sore.  One area on my right foot would&lt;br /&gt;sometimes feel very tender just from walking in leather shoes.  Decided to give the pumice stones a try after reading about various treatments for callouses.  Must confess that after two weeks of periodic rubbing with a stone after taking a shower has made&lt;br /&gt;a great difference in how my feet feel.  Besides making the surfaces of these calloused area much smoother, there has also been&lt;br /&gt;a lessening in the tenderness as well, almost to the point of no discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time and doesnt break apart. so far so good!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a pumice stone!  But it&#x27;s nice, and works very well.  Much more textured than most I&#x27;ve bought in stores which I like.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed and it works great! It is a must for all women even men to help in foot care, I was looking for something better than what is available in the stores. This product works better with less mess, and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The photo makes it look a bit rougher.  But this seems really nice.  It&#x27;s large and heavy and solid, and seems like it will last a long time...and a bonus one?  Who could go wrong?</li>
            <li> Better than last pumice stones.&lt;br /&gt;If not boiled they will smell after multiple uses. Over all great stone.</li>
            <li> this has really helped heal my foot</li>
            <li> Works great on my very calloused feet! (I rarely wear shoes.)</li>
            <li> This truly is the real thing and words great after a shower. I kept one and gave the other as a gift.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned that this was not good enough or to rough. I have dry feet and always get hard skin. This did the trick.</li>
            <li> This pumice is very coarse (large holes).  Still useful but not as pleasant to the touch as the finer grained pumice.  I&#x27;m using them in the kitchen instead of on my skin.</li>
            <li> These work great, was used to the square shape pumice stones, but these are much nicer to use in the shower or tub.</li>
            <li> Product works fine.  Not really experienced with the stones, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> these are very good they give you two one has small porous size holes and the other I received a mix of small too large it is very efficient compared to your standard white pumice stone I think it was money well spent</li>
            <li> Pumice stones do their job....and are exactly as described. Because they seem more porous they do clean up easier after use than stones I have had previously.  They are generously sized yet not cumbersome. I would recommend them!</li>
            <li> This pumice stone was exactly what I was looking for. Great customer service. They e-mailed me saying it was going to take a little longer because of all the snow storms . Thank you!</li>
            <li> Keeps the soles of my feet feeling smooth. It works really well. Just spend time using it and it will work well after some time. Don&#x27;t expect instant results.</li>
            <li> I walk alot and have developed callouses especially in the area just below the &amp;#34;big toe&amp;#34;. This works great to smooth out the skin and get my feet presentable for summer sandals.</li>
            <li> Good thing this was buy one get one free. Now that I am looking back at one of the product photos - it looks like what you get (or one of them): a pumice rock with very large exposed air holes (like a half inch across) with razor sharp jagged edges. If I took this to my skin it wold seriously lacerate me. I think I&#x27;ll throw it in the aquarium as an interest piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one had much finer holes and works quite well. Its definitely lava rock it arrived with lots of silty grit, so I soaked and rinsed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rock hopefully (at least that is what the product is advertised as). Why do most of the reviews comment about not being like the picture? It&#x27;s for scrubbing dead skin from my FEET. I do not care what it looks like. Also if it hurts your feet then maybe you don&#x27;t need a REAL pumice stone. If your feet are sensitive then buy a concrete manufactured one. For me tho I&#x27;ll stick to good (old fashioned) natural occurring ROCK. Think about it. They sell BOGO because one has a chance of being softer/harder. Besides if it doesn&#x27;t work for your feet find a different use. It&#x27;s so cheap, I loose more change in my car than the price of this rock. (Btw: first review I cared to write because none of the previous ones helped me make a decision.) Will update after 1st use. Used for first time last night. Only painful if used improperly. Works amazingly. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but even one use is good enough for me. It&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> great product - does its job well</li>
            <li> Large. Good texture. Recommend</li>
