            <li>It is the most sweet fragance that I have ever experienced in my life.</li>
            <li>Masculine but elegant in fragrance!!!</li>
            <li>Diesel line of cologne&#x27;s never fail they smell great</li>
            <li>Most of my family and friends want to know how to get it.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend says this is her favorite of the colognes I have.</li>
            <li>I also like it the most.</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>They say it really smells good on me.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, the cool structure of the bottle!</li>
            <li>not too strong</li>
            <li>Personally, given the &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; undertone, I would suggest Fall and Winter as ideal - but the fragrance is so unique, I could argue that Tattoo could be worn during any season, but preferably at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In Europe its available.</li>
            <li>to Tattoo, Only the Brave.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the (original) &amp;#34;big brother&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The original OTB is my #1 fragrance  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the Only the Brave fragrances, and Tattoo offers a uniqueness that the original does not have.  </li>
            <li>Diesel, Only the Brave Tattoo is highly underrated..!!  </li>
            <li>I did not like at all, but if you are into sweet extravaganza</li>
            <li>vanilla,and sweet tobacco w/ licorice.</li>
            <li>Item arrived rather quick.</li>
            <li>Probably will recommend better the Only the Brave edition which has a more profound and lasting effect, but for the ones into sweet fragances you can give a try.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;enjoyed the Only the Brave fragrances, and Tattoo offers a uniqueness that the original does not have.  </li>
            <li>Very different - and being different is OK..!!  </li>
            <li>The packaging is sufficient, but I will add that I do keep the boxes (that added security while traveling) and this box came &amp;#34;un-glued&amp;#34;, literally, the first day I wore it.  </li>
            <li>While the initial blast of spice notes may be overwhelming, the dry down and thereafter is seductively attractive.  </li>
            <li>While no compliments wearing today, this fragrance has a certain &amp;#34;dark confidence&amp;#34; that will gain attention.  </li>
            <li>Very well done.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The only thing good about this cologne is the package and design because it smells terrible. It is the most sweet fragance that I have ever experienced in my life. I did not like at all, but if you are into sweet extravaganza armoas, well I suggest you go for it.</li>
            <li> Great bottle!!! Masculine but elegant in fragrance!!! Third one I&#x27;ve bought already.  Worth it!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance fits my body chemistry.  Most of my family and friends want to know how to get it.  They say it really smells good on me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don&#x27;t sell this in most retailers in NY or in the country. In Europe its available. It smells like cherry. vanilla,and sweet tobacco w/ licorice. not too strong but you notice it. I had complements on it.</li>
            <li> Diesel, Only the Brave Tattoo is highly underrated..!!  While the initial blast of spice notes may be overwhelming, the dry down and thereafter is seductively attractive.  The initial notes are a mix of apple, benzoin, pepper, and tobacco.  Tattoo then settles into a blend of patchouli, tobacco, and woodsy notes.  Do yourself a favor - wait for the dry down..!!  I am a huge fan of the (original) &amp;#34;big brother&amp;#34; to Tattoo, Only the Brave.  The original OTB is my #1 fragrance  in a collection that is increasing toward 500 bottles (wouldn&#x27;t be so bad but I struggle on which one to wear and dusting the &#x27;dog gone&#x27; bottles is a pain in the ___ ..!!)  Tattoo may have similar notes as the original, but the fragrance is different.  Very different - and being different is OK..!!  It is a &amp;#34;dark different&amp;#34; that is spicy - it adds to the mystique of Tattoo.. It is what it is - a great fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo has plenty of &amp;#34;Wow Factor&amp;#34; (compliments from the opposite sex) potential.  While no compliments wearing today, this fragrance has a certain &amp;#34;dark confidence&amp;#34; that will gain attention.  The versatility of this fragrance is a topic of debate.  Personally, given the &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; undertone, I would suggest Fall and Winter as ideal - but the fragrance is so unique, I could argue that Tattoo could be worn during any season, but preferably at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a piece of art, classically designed to mirror that of the &amp;#34;big brother&amp;#34; with the addition of a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; finish that compliments the fragrance.  Very well done.  The packaging is sufficient, but I will add that I do keep the boxes (that added security while traveling) and this box came &amp;#34;un-glued&amp;#34;, literally, the first day I wore it.  It will be our secret that - &amp;#34;duck tape&amp;#34; fixed it up.  A check of online pricing shows that Tattoo is moderately (or average) priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo&#x27;s final tally is 4.5 stars out of a possible 5 stars.  I have enjoyed the Only the Brave fragrances, and Tattoo offers a uniqueness that the original does not have.  It is this &amp;#34;dark side&amp;#34; that has a seductively attractiveness about it that warrants adding to your collection. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily I.M. - Borrowing a quote from James Dean, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t sweat the small stuff - you are who you are meant to be..&amp;#34;enjoyed the Only the Brave fragrances, and Tattoo offers a uniqueness that the original does not have.

            <li> This edtion of the Only the Brave has a sweet scent, and at least on myself the odor lasts long hours before vanishing. Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because is not the best perfume I&#x27;ve tried. Probably will recommend better the Only the Brave edition which has a more profound and lasting effect, but for the ones into sweet fragances you can give a try.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wonderful son. Although frangrancenet.com overprices, it was the only retailer I found in the US selling this item. Item arrived rather quick.</li>
            <li> is very good fragrance, I&#x27;m loving this perfume and much else besides the amount that comes is good and go nuy scented, and how I came up with the estimated time are excellent and timely. I like this delivery</li>
            <li> Diesel line of cologne&#x27;s never fail they smell great and Amazon has the best price for it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says this is her favorite of the colognes I have. I also like it the most. Just wish it lasted a bit longer. Will likely grab the body wash as well when it comes out</li>
            <li> As a woman, I absolutely love the fragrance of this awesome cologne. I&#x27;ve bought this cologne for my boyfriend numerous times, and never has it failed me. This makes for a wonderful gift! ... Not to mention, the cool structure of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Very good, excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> Im not sure about the smell.</li>
