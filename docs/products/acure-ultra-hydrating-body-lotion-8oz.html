            <li>This stuff is amazing though!</li>
            <li>This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, best I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>Love it best in the unscented version.</li>
            <li>So this one is perfect, nice and creamy, soaks in and does what it is supposed to do, softens my hands and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance of any kind that I can tell.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion after reading a recommendation from the Gimme the Good Stuff blog.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I loved the way that it smelled.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s from a good company.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Her skin as well as mine feels so lovely!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Acure has the best ingredients for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I want to make my own lotions, but in the meantime I am buying.</li>
            <li>but after applying this twice a day, it had faded into a nice tan in just three days.</li>
            <li>It has really great ingredients, and is fair trade, which I really like.</li>
            <li>acure body lotion has a really nice scent and it is very light on skin.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrances and don&#x27;t like putting chemicals on your skin, this is one of the best options out there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to go organic on most things but am reluctant to give up having some kind of scent.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a lotion lover, so I&#x27;m an experienced tester when it comes to this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very light scent.</li>
            <li>It is very light, however it takes a while to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful to make my skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>but then again I love all of Acure&#x27;s items....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to many things,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and nothing comes close to Acure&#x27;s quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Why do so many lotions contain alcohol?</li>
            <li>Love this brand and this lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed most all of their products,  but this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>my skin needed even more moisture.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, they will not change their products like most companies have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nice, light lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this company and this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li>The finish/absorption on the Aubrey also isn&#x27;t quite a nice and hydrating as the Acure, but the difference isn&#x27;t huge.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love, Love the ingredents in this product...</li>
            <li>it more than delievers everything it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the Aveeno lotion is more sticky.  </li>
            <li>and I think that this lotion makes my skin softer, more moisturized, and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works well and the non-scented works great with my sensitive cat.</li>
            <li>Besides that, this is a great natural nongreasy body lotion.</li>
            <li>A great product for those with sensitive skin or who can&#x27;t stand added fragrances/perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly sensitive to gluten and I never have experienced a problem with these lotions.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very mild and it goes away.</li>
            <li>Quick drying!</li>
            <li>My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.</li>
            <li>In the summer I was using the lavender lotion which I really like,  the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill,  will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky without the petroleum products or chemicals.  </li>
            <li>so much I haven&#x27;t told my daughter about it and have it in my own bedroom.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic day-to-day moisturizer that will keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>but this brand is really good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have found in a very long time that does not irritate my skin and feels wonderful on my body.  </li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li>The Ultimate Moisturizing Lotion by Aubrey is another good option, while is has no added scent, the lotion ingredients themselves have a pleasant sweet scent vs. this usually completely neutral-smelling Acure lotion.  </li>
            <li>The texture is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to start using this</li>
            <li>This is a good, light, non-greasy moisturizer for the entire body.  </li>
            <li>This will probably be a non-issue for people who don&#x27;t have excessively dry hands, as the moisturizing benefits of Acure lotion are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several Acure products to date, and so far, I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with both the value and quality of product this company provides.</li>
            <li>This lotion did nothing special or noteworthy for me.</li>
            <li>they were right!</li>
            <li>Not as great as their citrus, not sure if the ingredients are different (other than the smell), but it is not as good, though still a wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li>good, too watery and didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I read great reviews on other websites and that is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for a great price, and it works for dry skin - especially needed in a desert climate where I live.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, this cream is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;ve given it as a gift often and each recipient has liked it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to go through a heap of these when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li>wife likes this lotion because its scent free and it really makes her legs smooth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily and breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>I understand this lotion is unscented and natural, but I am not a fan of the way it smells, however I will keep using it due to how awesome it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this cream when I run out!</li>
            <li>It now feels watery and is not well absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a truly natural healthy lotion.  </li>
            <li>However, it neutralized once the lotion absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It actually isn&#x27;t greasy to begin with, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>You have to give it quite a good rub before it sinks in.</li>
            <li>Works extremely well and very light scented, which I love because it&#x27;s fragrance does not overwhelm you as some brands do.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all, and is just the right thickness.  </li>
            <li>Very Gentle.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>This brand of lotion is really good, I&#x27;ve tried a few of them now</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put it right against your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good value, I only wish they make a big one with a pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a replacement for Alba Botanica Natural Very Emollient Body Lotion Unscented Original.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>So for my hands I need to supplement this moisturizer with something heavier--either pure jojoba oil or Alba Botanicals lotion.  </li>
            <li>and they are all very high quality in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t burn on very dry skin like many lotions do) and on fresh/healing tattoos (again, doesn&#x27;t burn).   </li>
            <li>But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>This one really gets in and moisturizes</li>
            <li>but this Acure product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and I really like Acure lotion products.  </li>
            <li>It is so creamy, and absorbs really well, leaving no greasiness.</li>
            <li>perfectly, even against cold induced eczema.  </li>
            <li>This does really work well on the skin.</li>
            <li>Good for three seasons, but a bit thick for summertime.</li>
            <li>When I shower I don&#x27;t have that slimy residue that other lotions have (those just sit on top of skin).</li>
            <li>We have so many so called natural products that are not really natural or organic</li>
            <li>have only tried one lotion - will purchase several more products tomorrow.</li>
            <li>have noticed a big imporovement on how smooth and soft her skin is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This formula is just a little greasy, but not too greasy like so many others, and the ones that weren&#x27;t too greasy didn&#x27;t do a lot of</li>
            <li>It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream.</li>
            <li>Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so non-greasy that I can go right to tasks such as typing or writing without worrying about leaving grease/lotion marks all over stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, once &#x27;winter&#x27; hit (I live in phoenix</li>
            <li>New to this product</li>
            <li>The texture is a perfect balance in that it isn&#x27;t too thick that you&#x27;ll be late for an event because you&#x27;re still rubbing lotion in, and it isn&#x27;t the runny type where you feel the need to keep applying.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt moisturize enough for me and made my keratosis pilaris flare up for the first time in months</li>
            <li>Just the right consistency (not thick but not thin), and it&#x27;s actually unscented (many products claiming that actually still have some fragrance or at least an off-putting smell from the ingredients).</li>
            <li>Works good, much better than the other artificial lotions</li>
            <li>It sinks in immediately, has no scent, and leaves my skin moist and smooth for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Never causes my face to breakout and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>It doesnt contain alcohol and seems to be completely natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but no issues with this product what so ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a biochemist and I completely approve of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Helps with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, makes my skin soft an su</li>
            <li>Maybe because natural product do have a scent?</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft .</li>
            <li>I was attracted to the natural ingredients in this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes a lot and leave a soft non greasy sensation.</li>
            <li>The Alba lotion wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and leave me with itchy skin in the middle of night even though I applied it right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands a lot because of my job, so my skin can get pretty dry by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Better still, it has a high rating from the Environmental Working Group for being without toxic or irritating substances.  </li>
            <li>do wish this came in a larger size though, because it feels pretty wasteful to go through one of these containers every month when they could just make a big 32 oz pump bottle</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is really super nice lotion without chemicals , no SLS or bad things in it that I could make out.</li>
            <li>The Acure lotion absorbs into the skin, and left the skin smooth and less sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this for dry skin, worked really well.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much to combat my dry skin in both seasons.</li>
            <li>And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s not lovely either.</li>
            <li>It also neutralizes quickly so there is no greasy feeling left after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve actually bought a few other products from Acure based on the quality of this lotion and am looking forward to trying more of their items.</li>
            <li>Unscented, no..it has an odd smell that is pretty undescribable.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are marked clearly--none of this guessing game complex chemicals--they let you know exactly what is going on your skin--and I love that comprehensive honesty coming from a company.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather live long with a couple of extra wrinkles than die of cancer before I ever have them.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft &amp; hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>you read my reviews of other products, you will notice that I say that I have \\&quot;very oily\\&quot; skin, but here I am saying that I have dry skin.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and nothing comes close to Acure&#x27;s quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Why do so many lotions contain alcohol?</li>
            <li> Love this brand and this lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed most all of their products,  but this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> my skin needed even more moisture.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, they will not change their products like most companies have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice, light lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this company and this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite unscented lotion.  </li>
            <li> The finish/absorption on the Aubrey also isn&#x27;t quite a nice and hydrating as the Acure, but the difference isn&#x27;t huge.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love, Love the ingredents in this product...</li>
            <li> it more than delievers everything it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the Aveeno lotion is more sticky.  </li>
            <li> and I think that this lotion makes my skin softer, more moisturized, and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works well and the non-scented works great with my sensitive cat.</li>
            <li> Besides that, this is a great natural nongreasy body lotion.</li>
            <li> A great product for those with sensitive skin or who can&#x27;t stand added fragrances/perfumes.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly sensitive to gluten and I never have experienced a problem with these lotions.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very mild and it goes away.</li>
            <li> Quick drying!</li>
            <li> My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.</li>
            <li> In the summer I was using the lavender lotion which I really like,  the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill,  will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky without the petroleum products or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> so much I haven&#x27;t told my daughter about it and have it in my own bedroom.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic day-to-day moisturizer that will keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> but this brand is really good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have found in a very long time that does not irritate my skin and feels wonderful on my body.  </li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Moisturizing Lotion by Aubrey is another good option, while is has no added scent, the lotion ingredients themselves have a pleasant sweet scent vs. this usually completely neutral-smelling Acure lotion.  </li>
            <li> The texture is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this</li>
            <li> This is a good, light, non-greasy moisturizer for the entire body.  </li>
            <li> This will probably be a non-issue for people who don&#x27;t have excessively dry hands, as the moisturizing benefits of Acure lotion are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Acure products to date, and so far, I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with both the value and quality of product this company provides.</li>
            <li> This lotion did nothing special or noteworthy for me.</li>
            <li> they were right!</li>
            <li> Not as great as their citrus, not sure if the ingredients are different (other than the smell), but it is not as good, though still a wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li> good, too watery and didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I read great reviews on other websites and that is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a great price, and it works for dry skin - especially needed in a desert climate where I live.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, this cream is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;ve given it as a gift often and each recipient has liked it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to go through a heap of these when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue on your skin.  </li>
            <li> wife likes this lotion because its scent free and it really makes her legs smooth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily and breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li> I understand this lotion is unscented and natural, but I am not a fan of the way it smells, however I will keep using it due to how awesome it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this cream when I run out!</li>
            <li> It now feels watery and is not well absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a truly natural healthy lotion.  </li>
            <li> However, it neutralized once the lotion absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It actually isn&#x27;t greasy to begin with, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> You have to give it quite a good rub before it sinks in.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and very light scented, which I love because it&#x27;s fragrance does not overwhelm you as some brands do.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, and is just the right thickness.  </li>
            <li> Very Gentle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This brand of lotion is really good, I&#x27;ve tried a few of them now</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put it right against your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good value, I only wish they make a big one with a pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a replacement for Alba Botanica Natural Very Emollient Body Lotion Unscented Original.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> So for my hands I need to supplement this moisturizer with something heavier--either pure jojoba oil or Alba Botanicals lotion.  </li>
            <li> and they are all very high quality in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t burn on very dry skin like many lotions do) and on fresh/healing tattoos (again, doesn&#x27;t burn).   </li>
            <li> But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> This one really gets in and moisturizes</li>
            <li> but this Acure product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and I really like Acure lotion products.  </li>
            <li> It is so creamy, and absorbs really well, leaving no greasiness.</li>
            <li> perfectly, even against cold induced eczema.  </li>
            <li> This does really work well on the skin.</li>
            <li> Good for three seasons, but a bit thick for summertime.</li>
            <li> When I shower I don&#x27;t have that slimy residue that other lotions have (those just sit on top of skin).</li>
            <li> We have so many so called natural products that are not really natural or organic</li>
            <li> have only tried one lotion - will purchase several more products tomorrow.</li>
            <li> have noticed a big imporovement on how smooth and soft her skin is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This formula is just a little greasy, but not too greasy like so many others, and the ones that weren&#x27;t too greasy didn&#x27;t do a lot of</li>
            <li> It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream.</li>
            <li> Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so non-greasy that I can go right to tasks such as typing or writing without worrying about leaving grease/lotion marks all over stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, once &#x27;winter&#x27; hit (I live in phoenix</li>
            <li> New to this product</li>
            <li> The texture is a perfect balance in that it isn&#x27;t too thick that you&#x27;ll be late for an event because you&#x27;re still rubbing lotion in, and it isn&#x27;t the runny type where you feel the need to keep applying.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt moisturize enough for me and made my keratosis pilaris flare up for the first time in months</li>
            <li> Just the right consistency (not thick but not thin), and it&#x27;s actually unscented (many products claiming that actually still have some fragrance or at least an off-putting smell from the ingredients).</li>
            <li> Works good, much better than the other artificial lotions</li>
            <li> It sinks in immediately, has no scent, and leaves my skin moist and smooth for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Never causes my face to breakout and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> It doesnt contain alcohol and seems to be completely natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but no issues with this product what so ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a biochemist and I completely approve of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Helps with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, makes my skin soft an su</li>
            <li> Maybe because natural product do have a scent?</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft .</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the natural ingredients in this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes a lot and leave a soft non greasy sensation.</li>
            <li> The Alba lotion wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and leave me with itchy skin in the middle of night even though I applied it right before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot because of my job, so my skin can get pretty dry by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Better still, it has a high rating from the Environmental Working Group for being without toxic or irritating substances.  </li>
            <li> do wish this came in a larger size though, because it feels pretty wasteful to go through one of these containers every month when they could just make a big 32 oz pump bottle</li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is really super nice lotion without chemicals , no SLS or bad things in it that I could make out.</li>
            <li> The Acure lotion absorbs into the skin, and left the skin smooth and less sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this for dry skin, worked really well.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much to combat my dry skin in both seasons.</li>
            <li> And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s not lovely either.</li>
            <li> It also neutralizes quickly so there is no greasy feeling left after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually bought a few other products from Acure based on the quality of this lotion and am looking forward to trying more of their items.</li>
            <li> Unscented, no..it has an odd smell that is pretty undescribable.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are marked clearly--none of this guessing game complex chemicals--they let you know exactly what is going on your skin--and I love that comprehensive honesty coming from a company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather live long with a couple of extra wrinkles than die of cancer before I ever have them.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft &amp; hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> you read my reviews of other products, you will notice that I say that I have \\&quot;very oily\\&quot; skin, but here I am saying that I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> lotion is surprisingly thick, but once absorbed, there&#x27;s no residue or greasiness.</li>
            <li> But for me, because it wasn&#x27;t helping my dry skin much (just a few hours of moisturization), I found myself wishing it was thicker and/or greasier just so it could keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> But the ingredients seem to be better and at least  less harmless than the other body lotions.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would point out is that it&#x27;s not completely unscented.</li>
            <li> A plus is the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have very dry hands, and the moisturizing does not last.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks dry shortly after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I Use this for extremely dry skin especially on legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never really had issues with dry skin until I had surgery last year and developed a couple of rough patches on my torso.</li>
            <li> This cream feels like it&#x27;s actually healing my skin though, and I don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> To clarify: I have very oily skin on my face, but the skin on the rest of my body is actually very dry :/</li>
            <li> First of all, this lotion is supposed to be unscented, however, there is a faint smell (not a frangrance, just a smell that I believe is probably from the natural ingredients).</li>
            <li> Very thankful for the fact that it does not contain sulfates, paraben, and other harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive &amp; I was looking for a healthier alternative to the CeraVe lotion &amp; cream that I&#x27;ve been using for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews.</li>
            <li> and then my skin would be dry and ashy again!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Works great, isn&#x27;t loaded with gnarly chemicals, and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol which can be terribly drying on hands.</li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money this last time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious about how does lotion from organic ingredients compare to synthetic ones.  </li>
            <li> I usually grab this at Whole Foods for around nine dollars, a few dollars less per tube, but they were out of stock today.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and it&#x27;s hard to find lotions that are moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> No funny stuff inside whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Aside from not containing chemicals known to cause cancer or other problems, this product does not just coat the surface and clog the pores, it soaks in and the benefits are felt and are visible.  </li>
            <li> I usually add essential oils to it when I use on my body.</li>
            <li> So I applied Aveeno active naturals skin relief overnight cream on one arm, and the Acure lotion on the other arm.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way &amp; it takes a little bit of effort to rub</li>
            <li> In the past I have found that \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; usually meant alcohol was a major ingredient.</li>
            <li> Seems to be less greasy than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I previously used the lavender lotion</li>
            <li> This particular type is labeled as unscented, and every time I&#x27;ve applied it, I&#x27;ve been unable to detect a scent.</li>
            <li> It worked for a little while</li>
            <li> This arrived yesterday, and as cocky as the bottle says that &#x27;you&#x27;ll wonder where this lotion has been all your life&#x27;, you know...</li>
            <li> It appears to revive my skin without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I think a lot of creams would make me dependant on them (I guess because of their crappy ingredients), and I would feel like I&#x27;m dying if I didn&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are mostly green.</li>
            <li> I felt dry less than 1 hour later plus it smelled bad.</li>
            <li> HARD to find, until now that is.  </li>
            <li> Instructions say use it at least twice a day</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s never really that cold)</li>
            <li> Not really impressed yet.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a faint unscented smell, if that makes sense, but it g doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> However for me, this product was just mediocre.</li>
            <li> I feel bad deducting one start but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I got a really horrible sunburn a few weeks ago that I thought might even blister,</li>
            <li> The ingredients in some lotions are downright scary!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with acure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two tubes acquire a probioticy scent, which was slightly unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very faint but DOES linger</li>
            <li> Get this,  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE IT.. but then again I love all of Acure&#x27;s items....</li>
            <li> Works good, much better than the other artificial lotions I&#x27;d used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to many things, but this brand is really good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels as if the formula is thinner even though the ingredients appear to be the same.  It now feels watery and is not well absorbed.  It just sits on my skin as a white coating.  It is also not ultra hydrating.  My skin feels and looks dry shortly after applying it.  I will not continue to purchase or recommend this product.  I feel that I wasted my money this last time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and nothing comes close to Acure&#x27;s quality and effectiveness. I appreciate the natural ingredients. I like it so much I&#x27;ve given it as a gift often and each recipient has liked it as much as I do.</li>

            <li> Works well, but obviously not as well as its chemical competition. The ingredients in some lotions are downright scary! I&#x27;d rather live long with a couple of extra wrinkles than die of cancer before I ever have them.</li>
            <li> Works great, isn&#x27;t loaded with gnarly chemicals, and doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol which can be terribly drying on hands. Why do so many lotions contain alcohol? The worst.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this came in a larger size though, because it feels pretty wasteful to go through one of these containers every month when they could just make a big 32 oz pump bottle (ARE YOU LISTENING, ACURE?!??)</li>
            <li> Love this brand and this lotion</li>
            <li> Never causes my face to breakout and my skin is really sensitive. I usually grab this at Whole Foods for around nine dollars, a few dollars less per tube, but they were out of stock today.</li>
            <li> I use it after every shower. Not really impressed yet. But the ingredients seem to be better and at least  less harmless than the other body lotions.</li>
            <li> Health and Beauty)I was looking for a moisturizer to replace the Estee Lauder lotion that I was using which was discontinued recently. And I was surprised by how well this product compared to my former moisturizer. This cream is great! It is thicker than I had expected but the product is accurately described by the seller - it is a cream. Although it much more dense than the oil control hydrator I used to use, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy at all. My face feels healthy and nourished with each use and for a 1/3 of the cost too! My skins absorbs this moisturizer very well and the cream smells amazingly invigorating.I was very skeptical of the this product because it seems that there weren&#x27;t many amazon buyers submitting reviews. But I knew I had to try something fast because I was running out of product. I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this product a try. It arrived so quickly in the mail that I didn&#x27;t even run out of my previous moisturizer.In the past I have found that \\&quot;oil control\\&quot; usually meant alcohol was a major ingredient. But alcohol is so drying for my skin that it would leave my face red and irritated. Not this stuff. It doesnt contain alcohol and seems to be completely natural. I was so impressed by this cream that I didn&#x27;t even bother to finish what was left over in my Estee Lauder bottle. Instructions say use it at least twice a day but I&#x27;ve been able to get away with using it only once a day</li>
            <li> Acure has the best ingredients for a very affordable price. The texture is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. My skin absorbs the lotion almost immediately. No greasy feeling. I use it on my face too. I have sensitive skin but no issues with this product what so ever.</li>
            <li> Works well and the non-scented works great with my sensitive cat.</li>
            <li> This arrived yesterday, and as cocky as the bottle says that &#x27;you&#x27;ll wonder where this lotion has been all your life&#x27;, you know...they were right! I was instantly impressed upon application. It absorbs very well. The ingredients are marked clearly--none of this guessing game complex chemicals--they let you know exactly what is going on your skin--and I love that comprehensive honesty coming from a company. You should also try this!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to start using this but it doesnt moisturize enough for me and made my keratosis pilaris flare up for the first time in months</li>
            <li> Just the right consistency (not thick but not thin), and it&#x27;s actually unscented (many products claiming that actually still have some fragrance or at least an off-putting smell from the ingredients).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;m obsessed with acure! Have enjoyed most all of their products,  but this one is a favorite. In the summer I was using the lavender lotion which I really like,  the smell is amazing. However, once &#x27;winter&#x27; hit (I live in phoenix so it&#x27;s never really that cold) my skin needed even more moisture. This fit the bill,  will continue to use it.  I also have recommended this to family and friends.  Get this,  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfragranced, yes. Unscented, no..it has an odd smell that is pretty undescribable. It&#x27;s very faint but DOES linger and I wish it didn&#x27;t.   Besides that, this is a great natural nongreasy body lotion. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and silky. I like using it on my hands in the winter (it doesn&#x27;t burn on very dry skin like many lotions do) and on fresh/healing tattoos (again, doesn&#x27;t burn).   A great product for those with sensitive skin or who can&#x27;t stand added fragrances/perfumes.</li>
            <li> This seems to work without being greasy.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never really had issues with dry skin until I had surgery last year and developed a couple of rough patches on my torso. I tried a couple of different products but couldn&#x27;t find anything that actually improved the condition of my skin, until I found this lotion from Acure Organics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the title, this stuff is incredible. Literally, after one use, the condition of my skin was already improved, and even after twenty-four hours, there was still a noticeable difference in the look and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually bought a few other products from Acure based on the quality of this lotion and am looking forward to trying more of their items.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many. It sinks in immediately, has no scent, and leaves my skin moist and smooth for the entire day. When I shower I don&#x27;t have that slimy residue that other lotions have (those just sit on top of skin). This one really gets in and moisturizes deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a biochemist and I completely approve of the ingredients. No funny stuff inside whatsoever.  It&#x27;s a really good value, I only wish they make a big one with a pump.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Acure.  Aside from not containing chemicals known to cause cancer or other problems, this product does not just coat the surface and clog the pores, it soaks in and the benefits are felt and are visible.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have found in a very long time that does not irritate my skin and feels wonderful on my body.  It appears to revive my skin without being heavy or greasy.  We have so many so called natural products that are not really natural or organic but this Acure product is the real deal.  Hopefully, they will not change their products like most companies have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried one lotion - will purchase several more products tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy so I can use it as hand cream, too! I&#x27;m probably going to go through a heap of these when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.  Not greasy at all, and is just the right thickness.  I mix it with the lemon scented lotion they have.  I have it in my office, in my purse, in my bathroom, next to my bed, and next to my recliner.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading a recommendation from the Gimme the Good Stuff blog. My skin is sensitive &amp; I was looking for a healthier alternative to the CeraVe lotion &amp; cream that I&#x27;ve been using for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is surprisingly thick, but once absorbed, there&#x27;s no residue or greasiness. My skin feels soft &amp; hydrated all day long. The lotion has a faint unscented smell, if that makes sense, but it g doesn&#x27;t linger. A little goes a long way &amp; it takes a little bit of effort to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with skin allergies and contact dermitis and this product gives me zero issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this cream is seriously the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I wash my hands a lot because of my job, so my skin can get pretty dry by the end of the day. This cream feels like it&#x27;s actually healing my skin though, and I don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday to keep my skin soft. I think a lot of creams would make me dependant on them (I guess because of their crappy ingredients), and I would feel like I&#x27;m dying if I didn&#x27;t use it everyday. This stuff is superb though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of this cream when I run out!</li>
            <li> Helps with my sensitive skin. Wonderful to make my skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I have bumpy red skin so when this lotion made a massive difference in the skin appearance and overall condition I was floored. Swear by this!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion!  My daughter has eczema and takes swim lessons and a s some of you may know chlorine pools and eczema don&#x27;t mix.  This lotion has helped prevent any eczema break outs.  Her skin as well as mine feels so lovely!</li>
            <li> Nice, light lotion. Quick drying!</li>
            <li> Great value for a heavier moisturizer.  Good for three seasons, but a bit thick for summertime.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, best I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  Love it best in the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I love this company and this product.  It is smooth and silky without the petroleum products or chemicals.  Will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> forgot what purpose I bought it for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.  I&#x27;m using it on my legs and not upper body for this reason.  Does not seem fresh.  It does however moisturize as it should.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a truly natural healthy lotion.  HARD to find, until now that is.  This formula is just a little greasy, but not too greasy like so many others, and the ones that weren&#x27;t too greasy didn&#x27;t do a lot of good, too watery and didn&#x27;t last.  So this one is perfect, nice and creamy, soaks in and does what it is supposed to do, softens my hands and doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance of any kind that I can tell. :)  I am a happy camper now that I have found this.  Yes I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I Use this for extremely dry skin especially on legs. Works extremely well and very light scented, which I love because it&#x27;s fragrance does not overwhelm you as some brands do.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite unscented lotion.  It is light-weight, but hydrating.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue on your skin.  If you are sensitive to fragrances and don&#x27;t like putting chemicals on your skin, this is one of the best options out there.  I probably used 4-5 tubes of this stuff over the last year.  I&#x27;ve had two tubes acquire a probioticy scent, which was slightly unpleasant.  However, it neutralized once the lotion absorbed into the skin.  The Ultimate Moisturizing Lotion by Aubrey is another good option, while is has no added scent, the lotion ingredients themselves have a pleasant sweet scent vs. this usually completely neutral-smelling Acure lotion.  The finish/absorption on the Aubrey also isn&#x27;t quite a nice and hydrating as the Acure, but the difference isn&#x27;t huge.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have ever had. This is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there! Non greasy, makes my skin soft an su</li>
            <li> Excellent product also!</li>
            <li> This is a good, light, non-greasy moisturizer for the entire body.  Better still, it has a high rating from the Environmental Working Group for being without toxic or irritating substances.  The only problem is that I have very dry hands, and the moisturizing does not last. So for my hands I need to supplement this moisturizer with something heavier--either pure jojoba oil or Alba Botanicals lotion.  This will probably be a non-issue for people who don&#x27;t have excessively dry hands, as the moisturizing benefits of Acure lotion are great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It feels good on my skin. The only thing I would point out is that it&#x27;s not completely unscented. But it&#x27;s very mild and it goes away. Maybe because natural product do have a scent?</li>
            <li> New to this product and I love it. unscented.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very Gentle. Makes my skin soft . It is not greasy, blends well with my skin. Very light scent. It works well when I wear perfume.</li>
            <li> I want to make my own lotions, but in the meantime I am buying. This is really super nice lotion without chemicals , no SLS or bad things in it that I could make out. I like it so much I haven&#x27;t told my daughter about it and have it in my own bedroom. It also neutralizes quickly so there is no greasy feeling left after a few minutes. It actually isn&#x27;t greasy to begin with, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She found it doing research at a different website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, I have to admit that I am using the lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes this lotion because its scent free and it really makes her legs smooth (I can attest to that!).&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big imporovement on how smooth and soft her skin is.&lt;br /&gt;I think its a great product</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love, Love the ingredents in this product...it more than delievers everything it promises to do.  My skin just loves this lotiion.  this products keeps my skin looking and feeling youthful and moist!  I would recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the natural ingredients in this moisturizer.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement for Alba Botanica Natural Very Emollient Body Lotion Unscented Original.  The Alba lotion wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough and leave me with itchy skin in the middle of night even though I applied it right before I go to bed.  I&#x27;m curious about how does lotion from organic ingredients compare to synthetic ones.  So I applied Aveeno active naturals skin relief overnight cream on one arm, and the Acure lotion on the other arm.  I noticed that the Aveeno lotion is more sticky.  The Acure lotion absorbs into the skin, and left the skin smooth and less sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acure lotion even though unscented, it has hints of cocoa butter smell.  You can&#x27;t really smell it unless you put it right against your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the lotion at local supermarket for $8.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a lotion lover, so I&#x27;m an experienced tester when it comes to this stuff. The texture is a perfect balance in that it isn&#x27;t too thick that you&#x27;ll be late for an event because you&#x27;re still rubbing lotion in, and it isn&#x27;t the runny type where you feel the need to keep applying. It is a fantastic day-to-day moisturizer that will keep your skin hydrated. This particular type is labeled as unscented, and every time I&#x27;ve applied it, I&#x27;ve been unable to detect a scent. So, for me, it is truly unscented. I&#x27;ve tried several Acure products to date, and so far, I&#x27;ve been quite impressed with both the value and quality of product this company provides.</li>
            <li> I have celiac disease and I really like Acure lotion products.  I am incredibly sensitive to gluten and I never have experienced a problem with these lotions.  I previously used the lavender lotion and I loved the way that it smelled.  This time I bought the unscented lotion and I think that this lotion makes my skin softer, more moisturized, and smoother.  I understand this lotion is unscented and natural, but I am not a fan of the way it smells, however I will keep using it due to how awesome it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion. Absorbs well without greasy feeling. The ingredients are mostly green. Nothing toxic that I could tell. It&#x27;s my second favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Not as great as their citrus, not sure if the ingredients are different (other than the smell), but it is not as good, though still a wonderful lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells horrible! Though, I like that theres not alot of chemicals in it, and it isnt greasy..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I have really dry skin, and it&#x27;s hard to find lotions that are moisturizing enough. This stuff is amazing though! It is so creamy, and absorbs really well, leaving no greasiness. It has really great ingredients, and is fair trade, which I really like. I got a really horrible sunburn a few weeks ago that I thought might even blister, but after applying this twice a day, it had faded into a nice tan in just three days.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a great price, and it works for dry skin - especially needed in a desert climate where I live. Very thankful for the fact that it does not contain sulfates, paraben, and other harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Moisturizers wonderfully.  I usually add essential oils to it when I use on my body.</li>
            <li> acure body lotion has a really nice scent and it is very light on skin. Moisturizes a lot and leave a soft non greasy sensation. As always acure delivers excellent quality products.&lt;br /&gt;SAFE FOR SENSISITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily and breaks out easily.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel.  Does not aggravate my skin in any way.  Hydrates my&lt;br /&gt;skin perfectly, even against cold induced eczema.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion did nothing special or noteworthy for me. I read great reviews on other websites and that is why I purchased it. However for me, this product was just mediocre. First of all, this lotion is supposed to be unscented, however, there is a faint smell (not a frangrance, just a smell that I believe is probably from the natural ingredients). It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it&#x27;s not lovely either. I have very dry skin* so I thought this organic product would help, espeically since it has cocoa butter. It is very light, however it takes a while to absorb into the skin. You have to give it quite a good rub before it sinks in. I used it during the end of winter and during summer but it didn&#x27;t do much to combat my dry skin in both seasons. It worked for a little while and then my skin would be dry and ashy again! For some people, a pro would be that it is so light and thin. But for me, because it wasn&#x27;t helping my dry skin much (just a few hours of moisturization), I found myself wishing it was thicker and/or greasier just so it could keep my skin moisturized. One more thing - even though it wasn&#x27;t great for me as a body lotion, it worked great as a hand lotion! It&#x27;s so non-greasy that I can go right to tasks such as typing or writing without worrying about leaving grease/lotion marks all over stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you read my reviews of other products, you will notice that I say that I have \\&quot;very oily\\&quot; skin, but here I am saying that I have dry skin. To clarify: I have very oily skin on my face, but the skin on the rest of my body is actually very dry :/</li>
            <li> This lotion is not Ultra-hydrating! I felt dry less than 1 hour later plus it smelled bad. I&#x27;m trying to go organic on most things but am reluctant to give up having some kind of scent.</li>
            <li> This does really work well on the skin. I feel bad deducting one start but the smell is not good. A plus is the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!  It feels great, works well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It&#x27;s got great ingredients in it and it&#x27;s from a good company.</li>
    </ol>
