            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Plastic good quality to use with trimmer.</li>
            <li>the comb is great and works just fine...</li>
            <li>, great smooth teeth do not pull or snarl my beard.</li>
            <li>It does do a nice job on my &#x27;stache, though.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and nice craftmanship.</li>
            <li>Perfect size,no static, Smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>just right, nice and compact not bulky , great item for the man with a beard or mustache or both.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an excellent comb for the value.</li>
            <li>However, I keep it in my back pocket all day and it is flawless.</li>
            <li>A lovely well crafted comb to keep your face fur in check.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.</li>
            <li>I love Swissco Products.</li>
            <li>my favorite comb for short beards- fits perfectly in my jeans</li>
            <li>Pretty good until I lost it.</li>
            <li>Nice small teeth that are perfect for moustache/beard grooming.</li>
            <li>pocket- really strong</li>
            <li>Great little comb - particularly when using the Amish beard baum - which is also a very good product.</li>
            <li>This well-crafted little comb fits the hand well and does an excellent job of grooming my moustache.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap.</li>
            <li>the appearance of the comb is unique and gives an element of class</li>
            <li>Although its compact size and strength make for a good pocket comb, its short teeth would also restrict it to a three or four star rating.</li>
            <li>Overall seems like a good beard comb and the receiver</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Beautiful little piece of work.  </li>
            <li>Great little comb - fits in any pocket.  </li>
            <li>Nice short teeth.</li>
            <li>A pure delight!</li>
            <li>Excellent comb for trimming mustache, not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li>Hard to find a decent moustache comb, I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
            <li>Just try not to be a creep too much brushing your beard.</li>
            <li>They do make too much fuss over it being &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; however.</li>
            <li>The teeth are ridiculously smooth, to the point that you question if it&#x27;s actually combing, but it is.</li>
            <li>Its unexpected larger length and accurate posted lamentations about tooth width and spacing reduced it to three stars.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, it may not be as effective for a man with a thick beard.</li>
            <li>Look and feel remind me of a comb my father had when I was very young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what more I can say about a comb...</li>
            <li>felt that the comb was solid and will be very durable.</li>
            <li>of the advantages of a natural tonsure is not requiring a big comb.</li>
            <li>so if yours is moderately thick to thick, this is a good piece for you.  </li>

            <li> Best beard comb. Just try not to be a creep too much brushing your beard. Haah</li>
            <li> This well-crafted little comb fits the hand well and does an excellent job of grooming my moustache. I keep my beard trimmed rather short, even so I think the teeth are a bit shorter and farther apart than I would prefer but otherwise it&#x27;s an excellent tool for keeping my beard looking good. Consequently, it may not be as effective for a man with a thick beard. I do wish it came with was a sturdy carrying case however; I&#x27;m afraid to carry it my pocket for fear it might break. Overall, this is an excellent comb for the value.</li>
            <li> Great little comb - fits in any pocket.  Is rigid but seems like it would be hard to break.  I would have given it five stars if the tines were a little closer together, but it still does a good job organizing my facial hair for precision cutting and maintenance.  And I know some people have even thicker facial hair - so if yours is moderately thick to thick, this is a good piece for you.  Beautiful little piece of work.  Look and feel remind me of a comb my father had when I was very young.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb for trimming mustache, not too big, not too small. Plastic good quality to use with trimmer.</li>
            <li> This comb is definitely well made.  It&#x27;s sturdy and the teeth won&#x27;t scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> This comb is excellent. Keeps my long beard in check. Comb has a neet pattern on it. Very firm brush. Does not bend. However, I keep it in my back pocket all day and it is flawless. Don&#x27;t even feel it there. Do it!</li>
            <li> I agree with others that the teeth could be closer together. It does do a nice job on my &#x27;stache, though. It glides through the hairs whether they are waxed or not.  A little long to keep in breast pocket but durable enough to keep in back pocket. Sturdy and nice craftmanship.</li>
            <li> works great as mustache comb, as a beard comb I find I need longer teeth</li>
            <li> Pretty good until I lost it. Very small - think I used it a month.</li>
            <li> The web page cites this comb as about 4.5 inches long.  The comb I received is 5 and one-quarter inches long; three quarters of an inch makes a difference when looking for a wallet comb.    Its unexpected larger length and accurate posted lamentations about tooth width and spacing reduced it to three stars.  The teeth need to be closer and finer, to compete with standard mustache combs.  However, it is a sturdy hair comb and comes with a plastic slip cover.  Although its compact size and strength make for a good pocket comb, its short teeth would also restrict it to a three or four star rating.</li>
            <li> just right, nice and compact not bulky , great item for the man with a beard or mustache or both. He never leaves home without it</li>
            <li> A lovely well crafted comb to keep your face fur in check. Solid construction. Nice short teeth. Probably not great for really thick or long facial hair. A little pricey for what it is. But it doesn&#x27;t feel or look cheap.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a decent moustache comb, I&#x27;m happy with this one. They do make too much fuss over it being &amp;#34;hand made&amp;#34; however. It&#x27;s just a comb, people; not a Fabrege Egg.</li>
            <li> Great little comb - particularly when using the Amish beard baum - which is also a very good product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and delivered on time. Overall seems like a good beard comb and the receiver felt that the comb was solid and will be very durable.</li>
            <li> I love this comb. It works great for me.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  I use it on my thinning hair also.&lt;br /&gt;One of the advantages of a natural tonsure is not requiring a big comb.</li>
            <li> Perfectly combed beard.  Every time.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love Swissco Products. Toothbrushes, Combs, Hairbrushes all part of my daily routine. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this comb for my beard, it works as a comb should. The teeth are ridiculously smooth, to the point that you question if it&#x27;s actually combing, but it is.</li>

            <li> Great size and perfect spacing on the teeth. It feels well crafted and looks great. It feels great on my mustache. Quality item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb, and it combs.  It is quite thick and sturdy-feeling.  I&#x27;m not sure what more I can say about a comb...</li>
            <li> the comb is great and works just fine...the appearance of the comb is unique and gives an element of class</li>
            <li> Small but I like it. Seems well made.</li>
            <li> This is quite a swanky comb. Nice small teeth that are perfect for moustache/beard grooming. This comb is perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband loved it!</li>
            <li> my favorite comb for short beards- fits perfectly in my jeans pocket- really strong , great smooth teeth do not pull or snarl my beard.</li>
