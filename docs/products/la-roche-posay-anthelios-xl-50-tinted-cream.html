    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>This product does not effect my eyes and is an excellent sun block.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the tint of this product would work perfectly for those in the medium skin tone range.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used plenty.</li>
            <li>so it is perfect for those beach or boat days when I just want to go without makeup.  </li>
            <li>Coverage is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The tint is perfect so that I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
            <li>As an allergic/sensitive person, Anthelios has been great.  </li>
            <li>Great sunscreen-</li>
            <li>and this product is very good, doesn&#x27;t have any smell and neither leaves your skin like a ghost, it&#x27;s very easy to apply</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and ride a motorcycle as well as swim.</li>
            <li>I wear \\&quot;Fairly Light\\</li>
            <li>If you are fair like me, it probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sunblock under my foundation for years, even before it was popular to do it.</li>
            <li>The tint is a nice added perk since I don&#x27;t use makeup.</li>
            <li>It also rubs off very easily.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive face did not break out, and best of all, no sunburn!</li>
            <li>I use a light powder on top, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Better (and better spectrum) than any product from the USA.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and so glad that the USDA approved it for US sale and amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>After I found out about how most sunscreens sold in the US don&#x27;t protect the skin from all harmful UV rays, I searched for one that would do the job</li>
            <li>An OK cream.</li>
            <li>so we are always out enjoying the beach or water.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again :)</li>
            <li>love the cream...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working out fine, although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m diminishing the coverage from a tint standpoint (not the sun protection).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available to purchase here</li>
            <li>Goes smooth on face and many times I feel like skipping foundations when wearing this.</li>
            <li>This product may act as a good sunscreen, but to me, the tint is too much like make-up (foundation) to be considered a sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li>I get sunburn easily.  </li>
            <li>The tinted cream gave my face just the right touch of moisturizing that my dry face needs as the weather cools and the perfect amount of tint to eliminate my need for foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;no deja la piel grasoso&lt;br /&gt;and can be used with makeup smoothly</li>
            <li>As others have said, it&#x27;s probably best for those with normal to dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product because I really need a good sunscreen ( I live in Florida)</li>
            <li>I have tried many sun creams and they all effect my eyes even though I do not put the cream near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I dislike how greasy my face gets right after I put this on.</li>
            <li>and it works very, very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t use this in hot weather season.</li>
            <li>I actually like the liquid better now that I have tried that one.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice tint on your fingers but it will be completely absorbed into your skin and just leave a shine like any average sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I use it over my moisturizer, there is one  negative thing and isn&#x27;t about the product but the weather, here in Florida is so humid most of the time, specially summer season, this product is kind of too thick for this kind of humidity or just probably has to be used to go to the beach, I would better use this on winter time down here.</li>
            <li>You will probably want some sort of powder (I&#x27;ve been using a light dusting of Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil) to set it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great, but there&#x27;s no point in the tint (I have pale pale skin, so if there was a difference I would notice).</li>
            <li>it blends in well and it&#x60;s very easy to apply, it doesn&#x60;t cover well my dark spots</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x60;t really look like I have a tinned cream on my face</li>
            <li>It wears nicely under makeup almost all day and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>but I preffere it over ones that cover because its very light and other tinned creams feels like a mask on my face</li>
            <li>I like this tinted cream mainly in summer time since I have oily skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the higher price tag would mean a better look, but not so.  </li>
            <li>I live in a coastal town</li>
            <li>But it does go on  a little too dark for someone with really fair skin.</li>
            <li>, I feel much better about exposing my pale skin to the sun now!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this brand and in particular, the XL products that contain both broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li>It passes my sensitive skin test.</li>
            <li>I love how the product neither irritates my skin (which is already somewhat sensitive due to my use of retin-A), unlike a lot of other products.</li>
            <li>Luckily her daughter uses this product so will not go to waste.  </li>
            <li>The product is nice and nothing is wrong with it -</li>
            <li>&quot; (the second lightest shade) in Bare Minerals, if that helps anyone gauge the color.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have fair skin and ride a motorcycle as well as swim. I researched all kinds of products and used endless brands. For me, this is the ultimate in protection outside of a white mask of zinc. My sensitive face did not break out, and best of all, no sunburn! Better (and better spectrum) than any product from the USA.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x60;t really look like I have a tinned cream on my face it blends in well and it&#x60;s very easy to apply, it doesn&#x60;t cover well my dark spots but I preffere it over ones that cover because its very light and other tinned creams feels like a mask on my face</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years!  I would have friends purchase in Europe before it was sold in the U.S.  The product blocks UVA and UVB without irritating my skin.  The product does not leave a oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to compare it with the very similar Bioderma Photoderm Max 50+ Tinted Cream.  I thought perhaps the higher price tag would mean a better look, but not so.  The product is nice and nothing is wrong with it - but if you&#x27;re looking for a tinted sunscreen that will actually make your skin look a bit warmer, this won&#x27;t do it.  It has a nice tint on your fingers but it will be completely absorbed into your skin and just leave a shine like any average sunscreen.  I&#x27;m sure it works great, but there&#x27;s no point in the tint (I have pale pale skin, so if there was a difference I would notice).</li>
            <li> This product may act as a good sunscreen, but to me, the tint is too much like make-up (foundation) to be considered a sunscreen product.  I classify it as make-up with a UV protection factor built-in.  It also rubs off very easily.  I was not happy after seeing a ring of tan on the collar of my white shirt I wore after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife on the hopes that this would not break her out like other \\&quot;non-allergic\\&quot; products. She applied it as directed and it still broke her out. Luckily her daughter uses this product so will not go to waste.  We will keep trying other \\&quot;non-allergic\\&quot; products until we find one she is not allegic to.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I have tried many sun creams and they all effect my eyes even though I do not put the cream near my eyes.  This product does not effect my eyes and is an excellent sun block.  My husband has a sun reaction due to heart drugs and this sun cream allows him to go out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I really need a good sunscreen ( I live in Florida) and this product is very good, doesn&#x27;t have any smell and neither leaves your skin like a ghost, it&#x27;s very easy to apply I use it over my moisturizer, there is one  negative thing and isn&#x27;t about the product but the weather, here in Florida is so humid most of the time, specially summer season, this product is kind of too thick for this kind of humidity or just probably has to be used to go to the beach, I would better use this on winter time down here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sunblock under my foundation for years, even before it was popular to do it. I love this and it works very, very well. It&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> As an allergic/sensitive person, Anthelios has been great.  Since I read the NYTimes article years ago, I&#x27;ve been buying in Europe and ebay (it used to say SPF65, 60+...). Use it daily and so glad that the USDA approved it for US sale and amazon carries it.  Great sunscreen- I&#x27;ve never burned again- and the only brand containing mexoryl.  The tint is a nice added perk since I don&#x27;t use makeup.</li>
            <li> The tinted cream does melt into the skin quite well, and seems moisturizing.  As others have said, it&#x27;s probably best for those with normal to dry skin.  For me, the tint is a little too dark and has slightly pinkish undertones.  I wear \\&quot;Fairly Light\\&quot; (the second lightest shade) in Bare Minerals, if that helps anyone gauge the color.  I&#x27;d say the tint of this product would work perfectly for those in the medium skin tone range. If you are fair like me, it probably won&#x27;t work for you. To compensate (considering that I had already purchased the product), I&#x27;ve been mixing a bit of another sunscreen with this product to make it a little lighter.  It&#x27;s working out fine, although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m diminishing the coverage from a tint standpoint (not the sun protection).  Even so, I&#x27;ve been wearing it without foundation.  You will probably want some sort of powder (I&#x27;ve been using a light dusting of Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil) to set it.  Otherwise, it leaves your skin a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen! It wears nicely under makeup almost all day and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy. After 6-8 hours, you might need a dusting of powder but that&#x27;s about it. After I found out about how most sunscreens sold in the US don&#x27;t protect the skin from all harmful UV rays, I searched for one that would do the job and I found this. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available to purchase here, I feel much better about exposing my pale skin to the sun now!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand and in particular, the XL products that contain both broad spectrum protection. The tinted cream gave my face just the right touch of moisturizing that my dry face needs as the weather cools and the perfect amount of tint to eliminate my need for foundation. I use a light powder on top, and I&#x27;m good to go. I love how the product neither irritates my skin (which is already somewhat sensitive due to my use of retin-A), unlike a lot of other products. It passes my sensitive skin test. I would probably switch to something lighter in the summer. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used plenty.</li>
            <li> I like the tint color and the fact that it has SPF in it. I dislike how greasy my face gets right after I put this on. I was hoping that this product would be less greasy than regular sunblock but cheaper products seems to do the job just as well. An OK cream.</li>
            <li> I live in a coastal town so we are always out enjoying the beach or water.  This is very heavy so it is perfect for those beach or boat days when I just want to go without makeup.  Coverage is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  The tint is perfect so that I don&#x27;t have to wear any foundation.  I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I like this tinted cream mainly in summer time since I have oily skin and I can&#x27;t use this in hot weather season. Goes smooth on face and many times I feel like skipping foundations when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I get sunburn easily.  I use this product on my face too.  Never got sunburn!  I just wish it was not as thick as it is and had no shine.  I will buy again :)</li>
            <li> a non greasy product that protects my skin from harmful sun rays which I use on the golf course and at the pool</li>
            <li> love the cream... I actually like the liquid better now that I have tried that one.  I like that it has protection... But it does go on  a little too dark for someone with really fair skin.</li>
            <li> irst time on the recommendation of the dermatologist use&lt;br /&gt;no deja la piel grasoso&lt;br /&gt;and can be used with makeup smoothly</li>
