            <li>Best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are our favorites and for the price the best option out there.</li>
            <li>As a dental hygienist I have seen literally every toothbrush out there, and of all manual ones this is the best plaque remover.  </li>
            <li>It is very good to use.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this t&#x27;brush!</li>
            <li>The fine bristles on this brush feel like you&#x27;re getting a good cleaning in between teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them - my dentist is impressed with how clean my teeth are</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Love GUM products but head of brush broke off in mouth while I was brushing my teeth and scratched face.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Our hygienest gave me one, and I wanted more for my family, but couldn&#x27;t find them in stores.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush from my dentist and loved it so much I went to buy another, but could not find it anywhere!  </li>
            <li>For me really gets up under gums for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I really like the feather tips on this brush, and find that with consistent use, I am able to maintain good gum health.</li>
            <li>fortunately Amazon had them.</li>
            <li>They clean teeth and massage the gums for gum health, and they don&#x27;t scratch the gums.  </li>
            <li>We are loyal customers from this seller, who is friendly and leaves really nice and professional messages.</li>
            <li>Soft but effective.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of these!</li>
            <li>in any case, that may just be a matter of my own personal preference, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>The shaped handle is comfortable - makes it very easy to use without losing your grip or having to hold too tightly.</li>
            <li>It cleans so well but is very gentle and helps me avoid brushing too aggressively.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to clean between some of my teeth and this toothbrush is as good as floss for cleaning.</li>
            <li>The extender bristles are very gentle but effective and cause minimal abrasion.  </li>
            <li>I came across an earlier model of the Gum/Butler toothbrushes and fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>I got the first one from my dentist after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>Never was able to find them in any local store.</li>
            <li>Very soft, yet my teeth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles gently get between the teeth, and is gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>really helps with sore gums and prevents bleeding during flossing</li>
            <li>The micro tips on the bristles do a fabulous job of cleaning, especially between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Really gently get under wires and cleans.</li>
            <li>Hard to find Gum toothbrushes &amp; love them!</li>
            <li>Bought several here and will buy more - purchased for entire family.</li>
            <li>The bristles are high quality</li>
            <li>So soft - feels like Im brushing my teeth with feathers!!  </li>
            <li>Soft, and gentle.  </li>
            <li>For son newly braced he loves this.</li>
            <li>Very soft and the tapered bristles do not hurt tender gums.</li>
            <li>First found it on a trip back up north.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the brushes I bought in a drugstore, though exact same brand/type, etc.</li>
            <li>Like the the soft bristles on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Almost too soft and flimsy brush.</li>
            <li>I like the bristle design on these brushes: very thin tipped, making it easy to clean beneath the gum line.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gum for finally making a full-bodied brush, that&#x27;s soft on the enamel and sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>When the old model was discontinued I searched and searched online and finally found the replacement with this model, and no I can&#x27;t find it locally in Virginia!</li>
