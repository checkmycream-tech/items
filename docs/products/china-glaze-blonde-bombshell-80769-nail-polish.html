            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>so excited to get this color.. goes on very nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and glitter size more on the internet.</li>
            <li>By far the best glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever owned! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I just need a really nice top coat now that won&#x27;t chip it.</li>
            <li>I wear the polish as a top coat</li>
            <li>It bothers me when I rub the top of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and it was such a great price!</li>
            <li>Or I can use it over top of another color to add some sparkle:)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I like a more smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Super easy to touch up and has pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li>I want smooth nails and this polish was not for me</li>
            <li>it is such a great nail polish.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok though, hopefully no one spends too much time inspecting them!</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and the order was problem free.</li>
            <li>A bit thinner than expected, but a lovely color and good glitter spread.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy since it was free shipping and such a low price.</li>
            <li>It is such a nice formula and 2 coats</li>
            <li>This is a true gold glitter polish, which is exactly what I was looking for in a polish.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant when I purchased it but after receiving it and using it, I knew I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, long lasting wear, can be used as an accent or on all nails</li>
            <li>This polish is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a glitter polish.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to build upon, and get a nice thick layer of gold nailpolish.</li>
            <li>it does take a few coats to get it to look gold, but it also looks great just over a solid color.</li>
            <li>It really sparkles and I have gotten a ton of compliments when ever I wear it.</li>
            <li>Also works great when using a thin coat on top of other colors to  &amp;#34;dress them</li>
            <li>but it is less true to the gold color than I thought it would be and the sparkles were smaller and not varied in size.</li>
            <li>One coat will go nice over a color base coat for some speckles of glitter, or you could do two coats and have a full glitter nail.</li>

            <li> I liked the color and glitter size more on the internet. I wear the polish as a top coat but it is less true to the gold color than I thought it would be and the sparkles were smaller and not varied in size. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that you can feel the gold flecks.  It bothers me when I rub the top of my hands.  I like a more smooth finish.  If you don&#x27;t mind feeling the gold glitter -  then this polish might be for you.  I want smooth nails and this polish was not for me</li>
            <li> Perfect for the holidays!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that sparkles and shines during the holidays. I&#x27;m glad I bought this, everyone loved my nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Blonde Bombshell and I have to say, it is such a great nail polish. I was a bit hesitant when I purchased it but after receiving it and using it, I knew I made the right choice.If you&#x27;re looking for a glittery gold nail polish, this is the one you should consider buy. Not to mention it arrived very quickly. I attached a picture in case you wanted to know what it looks like once its applied.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, long lasting wear, can be used as an accent or on all nails</li>
            <li> Beautiful,gold,sparkly nails</li>
            <li> This polish is so amazing and sparkly! It is such a nice formula and 2 coats it&#x27;s opaque! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and it was such a great price! By far the best glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever owned! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Nice quality. I think the sparkles help this polish last longer. Recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous nail polish, use it alone or over another color.  I received it quickly and the order was problem free.</li>
            <li> This color is soo beautiful!! It really sparkles and I have gotten a ton of compliments when ever I wear it. I also like that it&#x27;s buildable, you can do one coat over color, or make it solid gold sparkles. With that said, this stuff is so freaking hard to get off! I&#x27;ve  tried scrubbing with every fabric and nail polish remover possible and even  filing it off. You end up with partial chunks stuck (if you&#x27;re lazy like me) for days!!</li>
            <li> This polish is exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a glitter polish. One coat will go nice over a color base coat for some speckles of glitter, or you could do two coats and have a full glitter nail.</li>

            <li> A bit thinner than expected, but a lovely color and good glitter spread. Better application with sponge, I think!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Gorgeous gold color. Takes a little longer to remove than regular polish, so don&#x27;t try to remove it if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  Just rest your cotton ball soaked with remover on each nail for a minute before rubbing--lot easier to remove that way.  Also works great when using a thin coat on top of other colors to  &amp;#34;dress them up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it does take a few coats to get it to look gold, but it also looks great just over a solid color.</li>
            <li> This is a different take on gold. It has a bit less yellow to it than you may be expecting. However, it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. It&#x27;s a very heavy glitter; one coat is almost enough, two coats will totally cover your nail. Super easy to touch up and has pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li> so excited to get this color.. goes on very nice. great for designs. all the clients pick this color. perfect.</li>
            <li> It was great! I loved it. It was a great buy since it was free shipping and such a low price. I just need a really nice top coat now that won&#x27;t chip it.</li>
            <li> This is a true gold glitter polish, which is exactly what I was looking for in a polish. I like glitter on my toes because it usually covers up a bruise I get under my big toenail. Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t. My one toe looks like it has purple polish underneath. That&#x27;s ok though, hopefully no one spends too much time inspecting them!</li>
