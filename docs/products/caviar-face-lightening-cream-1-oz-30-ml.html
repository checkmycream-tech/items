    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Hope everyone has a happy holiday season, and good luck to those that are using the cream!    </li>
            <li>and I got VERY NICE results..</li>
            <li>I am of a fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li>Thank goods suitable for me has been a lot of them Astvdh</li>
            <li>for the Oralight pills which work much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure Ponds also have something to do with it.</li>
            <li>Loved it, and was worth the price tag.     </li>
            <li>Bought this because of all the praise about Makari being so great that it will really lighten well.</li>
            <li>I will try to keep this review updated as I notice more results with the cream.    </li>
            <li>I had also been applying it to my toes to even out their color too, and that is where I&#x27;ve seen the most difference in lightening.</li>
            <li>12/9/10 - Okay, another update.  </li>
            <li>and I want to continue taking them for my body to even out a bit more, and hope they can assist with the lightening around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it will make your skin smoother and more moisturized, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it because I needed another moisturizer.</li>
            <li>the only good thing is that  it smells  good.  </li>
            <li>I have no zit or pimples for now and am fine with the product.</li>
            <li>I would rather be dark and have flawless skin than to be to be light with bumps all over my face...</li>
            <li>Someone I know even said she had to stop using it because it was making her too light.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had smooth, bump-free skin</li>
            <li>So far the cream is working fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky not to suffer any acne breakouts, either.</li>
            <li>I have been getting more rest and exercise these days, so that might be a contributing factor to my looking more youthful, but those embarssing dark areas on my face are definitely significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>It is scented, but I find it to be a light, pleasant scent and not strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and finally my skin look nice again...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to give another update in a month and hope to be able to give this product at least one more star when I see more lightening.    </li>
            <li>but the breaks just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a difference the first week with regards to skin clarity, pore refinement and suppleness.  </li>
            <li>I remember when Makari first came out.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to buy more Oralight pills and will take themtwice daily for the next 45 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the pills are what caused the lightening that I was getting earlier, and will stick with them if I get the same or better results as before.  </li>
            <li>I did not see any results when using this product consistently, even every day.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the oralight pills a while ago and can&#x27;t wait till I get the extra money to buy some more of those because they really worked well for me</li>
            <li>A large area of my face was affected.</li>
            <li>It really works ...</li>
            <li>I recommend the Oralight pills that really do do the lightening and add energy (because of the vitamins).</li>
            <li>and I want some thing with reasonable price..</li>
            <li>Makari worked for me once, but I really don&#x27;t understand why it no longer works on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be a good idea at least keep me from getting any darker.</li>
            <li>** - 9/23/10 - So I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a little over a month now, mostly around my eyes to lighten the dark circles, and I can honestly say I have seen changes.  </li>
            <li>I hope these updates are helpful to those considering the cream, as most people only use it for a short period of time before review and others</li>
            <li>About the product, I was hesitant to pay so much for only 1 ounce of cream, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li>I am of African descent and my skin is very prone to hyper-pigmentation at the slightest chance, especially my face; right now, my face is about 4 shades darker than the rest of my body!</li>
            <li>I am in agreement with avidreader&#x27;s long review (thanks for the input!)</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it works fast.  </li>
            <li>One \\&quot;finger dip\\&quot; is enough to cover my whole face.  </li>
            <li>but mine is plastic and not heavy at all.    </li>
            <li>and I was like wow</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, and a dab does yield good coverage on the face, but 30ml is too little for nearly $60, and even that tiny dab feels like $2 down the pores!</li>
            <li>I previously used the body beautifying milk which really gave my complexion a healthy glow and lightened it but the downside was the breakouts I had after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I would say it is a good moisturizer, when you first put it on, but about a half an hour later, my skin actually feels dry and tight.    </li>
            <li>but then when I purchased a new product it suddenly no longer worked.</li>
            <li>As I stated further above, I can&#x27;t use it on my whole face b/c</li>
            <li>If I spent too much time in the sun, I would purchase the caviar cream to get my face to match the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I tried it until the jar was empty and my skin has a much smoother appearance, but I did not notice any lighter appearance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say this is worth it, instead of buying costly make up to cover the uneven skin tone I&#x27;ve always had.</li>
            <li>The only cons are the products contains fragrance (reconsider if you have scent sensitivities) and the containers are glass (very pretty) which makes for heavy traveling.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the cream primarily to help even my color and to fade the embarrassing hereditary dark circles around my eyes that I&#x27;ve had since I was little</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And hopefully you don&#x27;t get new dark spots in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I did have a few people to compliment me on my skin, but I think  the product is priced way too high for what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> 2x a day to completely clear the dark spots.</li>
            <li> It works pretty slowly but it does appear to be working.  </li>
            <li> It will leave your skin shiny with a slight greasy feeling (my skin is normal to dry), so if you have oily skin this may give you breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Makari for a month and a half or so and the dark areas are much, much lighter.</li>
            <li> I still have plenty of the product left and will use it on other parts of my body where I might need extra moisturization.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is only 1 oz and it will probably last about a month for the dark spots I&#x27;m trying to remove.</li>
            <li> The minimal results do not last.</li>
            <li> I think there are definitely less costly products out there that will do the same work or do it faster for about the same price.</li>
            <li> : this cream is too expensive to not yield quick and lasting results.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman who has had problems with melasma and brown spots due to sun exposure for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I only recommend products to my friends that have worked for me &amp; not based on what other people say.</li>
            <li> I have tried another less expensive product for fading black spots and pigmentations on skin and it works much better for only 1/4 of the price of this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried it for left over dark spots from acne</li>
            <li> and I see that it can work - slowly, but it would take at least 6 months of dedicated, consistent daily use of it</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t mention that it is for dark skin,, and I have white skin,, but since there were dark area on my face which bothered me</li>
            <li> I have about a half jar of the cream left as it really only takes a small amount for me.  </li>
            <li> which I really hate b/c it did give my skin a soft and supple feel and was working really quickly in evening out the color of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> the cream  leaves my face rather tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> , ON THE OTHER HAND, I don&#x27;t know what they did, but I think they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> when I recieved it and read the instructions I knew that it is for the dark skin,, but i used it anyway..</li>
            <li> all the dark area and the sun burns had GONE..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned African-American.  </li>
            <li> There was a dark mark that I wanted to lighten and it did not happen for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price, gave me break outs.</li>
            <li> The skin is still dark but has lightened about half a shade.  </li>
            <li> I used the body beautifying lotion for about six months previously</li>
            <li> I may be imagining things, but it seems the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, as well.</li>
            <li> I just put a little on each scar twice a day.</li>
            <li> The face caviar on the other hand did nothing for me and is quite small for what it costs.</li>
            <li> but in a few weeks my face broke out so severe which scared the heck out of me.</li>
            <li> (seriously), with dark patches on some parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Results usually showed within a week.</li>
            <li> And the breakouts left ugly little black dots on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that it is still working, but very slowly.  </li>
            <li> this  product  failed  to deliver  results.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product worked for me in 2 weeks and it is just big change and difference. It really works ...I have no zit or pimples for now and am fine with the product. I will come back to update the product.</li>
            <li> So far the cream is working fairly well.  Purchased to get rid of facial scars.  It works pretty slowly but it does appear to be working.  I just put a little on each scar twice a day. Its not too greasy and the scars are blending in.</li>
            <li> for the Oralight pills which work much better. I am in agreement with avidreader&#x27;s long review (thanks for the input!): this cream is too expensive to not yield quick and lasting results. It moisturizes well, and a dab does yield good coverage on the face, but 30ml is too little for nearly $60, and even that tiny dab feels like $2 down the pores! I recommend the Oralight pills that really do do the lightening and add energy (because of the vitamins).</li>
            <li> I am of a fair complexion.  I have for quite sometime being battling with under eye shadows until I started using Makari for about two weeks now.  My under eye shadows have literally disappeared.  In all fairness I mix it with Ponds B3 and I&#x27;m sure Ponds also have something to do with it. I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at this product.  Not only does it work, but it works fast.  I started noticing a difference the first week with regards to skin clarity, pore refinement and suppleness.  After ONE WEEK, I&#x27;m having to scale back on my applications from twice a day to once a day. The only cons are the products contains fragrance (reconsider if you have scent sensitivities) and the containers are glass (very pretty) which makes for heavy traveling.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I remember when Makari first came out. If I spent too much time in the sun, I would purchase the caviar cream to get my face to match the rest of my body. Results usually showed within a week. Efficient, and produced results. Loved it, and was worth the price tag.     *NOW*, ON THE OTHER HAND, I don&#x27;t know what they did, but I think they changed the formula. Rapid results, gone. The minimal results do not last. I think my face lifted half a shade or so, but was back to normal halfway through the jar.    I would say it is a good moisturizer, when you first put it on, but about a half an hour later, my skin actually feels dry and tight.    Very disappointed. This was my go-to beauty product. Search continues.</li>
            <li> Ordered  this for a friend  as gift  and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the praise about Makari being so great that it will really lighten well. Someone I know even said she had to stop using it because it was making her too light. Well, I tried it for left over dark spots from acne and I see that it can work - slowly, but it would take at least 6 months of dedicated, consistent daily use of it 2x a day to completely clear the dark spots. The bottle is only 1 oz and it will probably last about a month for the dark spots I&#x27;m trying to remove. You do the math. And hopefully you don&#x27;t get new dark spots in the meantime. I think there are definitely less costly products out there that will do the same work or do it faster for about the same price.</li>
            <li> There was only one thing I didn&#x27;t like it with this product.. In the product details on amazon.com they didn&#x27;t mention that it is for dark skin,, and I have white skin,, but since there were dark area on my face which bothered me I was looking for some thing with caviar ((since it is recommended for whitning)) and I want some thing with reasonable price.. and I found this makari caviar cream.. when I recieved it and read the instructions I knew that it is for the dark skin,, but i used it anyway.. and I got VERY NICE results.. all the dark area and the sun burns had GONE.. and finally my skin look nice again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this  product on september 25th  and received  the cream in  two days. I  couldn&#x27;t wait.  so I  immediately  start using the face cream  and continued to use it  every morning after washing my face. after using this product for about 3  weeks, I  am somewhat displeased  with my purchase!  the cream  leaves my face rather tight and dry.  the only good thing is that  it smells  good.  but that&#x27;s  not why I  bought it. I  wanted  to  lighten my complexion  about  one to two  shades ( nothing  drastic). this  product  failed  to deliver  results. I  am going to continue  to use until the product  is  done.</li>
            <li> Makari worked for me once, but I really don&#x27;t understand why it no longer works on my skin. I am of African descent and my skin is very prone to hyper-pigmentation at the slightest chance, especially my face; right now, my face is about 4 shades darker than the rest of my body! (seriously), with dark patches on some parts of my face. My friends and family have noticed the darker shade of my face. I used the body beautifying lotion for about six months previously and I saw some change but then when I purchased a new product it suddenly no longer worked. I was getting progressively darker so I purchased the caviar cream, exfoliating soap, clarifying glycerin and night treatment cream all at once and faithfully applied them but did not see any difference. This is 2months later and I am still searching for a product to help with my hyper-pigmentation. Someone please help me!</li>
            <li> I tried it until the jar was empty and my skin has a much smoother appearance, but I did not notice any lighter appearance. I did have a few people to compliment me on my skin, but I think  the product is priced way too high for what it claims to do. I have tried another less expensive product for fading black spots and pigmentations on skin and it works much better for only 1/4 of the price of this product. If you want an overpriced moisterizer this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman who has had problems with melasma and brown spots due to sun exposure for a number of years. A large area of my face was affected. I have been using Makari for a month and a half or so and the dark areas are much, much lighter. I may be imagining things, but it seems the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, as well. Overall my skin looks great. I have been getting more rest and exercise these days, so that might be a contributing factor to my looking more youthful, but those embarssing dark areas on my face are definitely significantly lighter. I was lucky not to suffer any acne breakouts, either.</li>
            <li> I only recommend products to my friends that have worked for me &amp; not based on what other people say. I tried this one with the Makari whitening pills &amp; the pills worked for my body &amp; this cream helped a lot making my face lighter and even-toned. I can now go out without make up on sometimes and I&#x27;d say this is worth it, instead of buying costly make up to cover the uneven skin tone I&#x27;ve always had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this caviar cream for about 2 weeks.  About the product, I was hesitant to pay so much for only 1 ounce of cream, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it. One \\&quot;finger dip\\&quot; is enough to cover my whole face.  It will leave your skin shiny with a slight greasy feeling (my skin is normal to dry), so if you have oily skin this may give you breakouts.  It is scented, but I find it to be a light, pleasant scent and not strong or overpowering.  And the jar is not glass, maybe they changed the packaging but mine is plastic and not heavy at all.    I&#x27;m a dark skinned African-American.  I use the cream twice a day, under my makeup in the morning and at night after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face.  I&#x27;ve always had smooth, bump-free skin so I bought the cream primarily to help even my color and to fade the embarrassing hereditary dark circles around my eyes that I&#x27;ve had since I was little (I just turned 30).  In the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve used the cream I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks even smoother and is softer, but no lightening just yet and I understand it takes time to see those results, if any.  In the meantime, I ordered the Oralight pills to see if that will do anything for my body, especially my rear end and my knees.  I will try to keep this review updated as I notice more results with the cream.    **UPDATE** - 9/23/10 - So I&#x27;ve been using the cream for a little over a month now, mostly around my eyes to lighten the dark circles, and I can honestly say I have seen changes.  The skin is still dark but has lightened about half a shade.  I had stopped using the cream twice a day and was only applying it at night before bed, but I will resume the twice a day routine to see if I get results faster.  I had also been applying it to my toes to even out their color too, and that is where I&#x27;ve seen the most difference in lightening. I&#x27;m hoping that by Christmas the skin around my eyes will have lightened enough that I won&#x27;t have to wear makeup anymore. Oh, and I stopped using the creamall over my face b/c it was breaking me out, which I really hate b/c it did give my skin a soft and supple feel and was working really quickly in evening out the color of my cheeks.  I&#x27;ll try to give another update in a month and hope to be able to give this product at least one more star when I see more lightening.    **UPDATE** - 12/9/10 - Okay, another update.  Still using the cream, morning and night if I don&#x27;t forget to apply it in the mornings.  I can tell that it is still working, but very slowly.  I thought I would be to the point of not having to wear any makeup (foundation) now, but the area around my eyes hasn&#x27;t lightened up to my satisfaction and I still have the \\&quot;racoon\\&quot; look, just a lighter version.  I ran out of the oralight pills a while ago and can&#x27;t wait till I get the extra money to buy some more of those because they really worked well for me and I want to continue taking them for my body to even out a bit more, and hope they can assist with the lightening around my eyes.  I have about a half jar of the cream left as it really only takes a small amount for me.  I will update again when and if I reach my desired goal.  I hope these updates are helpful to those considering the cream, as most people only use it for a short period of time before review and others don&#x27;t follow up.  Hope everyone has a happy holiday season, and good luck to those that are using the cream!    **UPDATE** - 1/10/11 - After another month of using this cream on my face, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s just not for me.  Yes, it will make your skin smoother and more moisturized, but I didn&#x27;t purchase it because I needed another moisturizer. I still have plenty of the product left and will use it on other parts of my body where I might need extra moisturization.  As I stated further above, I can&#x27;t use it on my whole face b/c it breaks me out.  And the breakouts left ugly little black dots on my forehead.  I was finally able to buy more Oralight pills and will take themtwice daily for the next 45 days.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the pills are what caused the lightening that I was getting earlier, and will stick with them if I get the same or better results as before.  I will not be purchasing anymore caviar cream.</li>
            <li> Thank goods suitable for me has been a lot of them Astvdh&lt;br /&gt;Greetings to you&lt;br /&gt;best regard and thank you</li>
            <li> I was working in Afghanistan and i notice that my face gotten three shades darker. Well I order this product because I did the research and I thought it would be a good idea at least keep me from getting any darker. Well while using this product my face got about two shades lighter and I was like wow but in a few weeks my face broke out so severe which scared the heck out of me. I give it a three, because it work but the breaks just isn&#x27;t worth it. I would rather be dark and have flawless skin than to be to be light with bumps all over my face...just a thought.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as advertised .</li>
            <li> I did not see any results when using this product consistently, even every day.  There was a dark mark that I wanted to lighten and it did not happen for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price, gave me break outs. I should have just saved my money for Elizabeth Arden products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have not seen any difference in my skin texture&lt;br /&gt; I previously used the body beautifying milk which really gave my complexion a healthy glow and lightened it but the downside was the breakouts I had after a few weeks of using it. The face caviar on the other hand did nothing for me and is quite small for what it costs. Really disappointed :(</li>
