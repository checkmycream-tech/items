    <ol>
            <li>IT IS GREAT!</li>
            <li>Great for people on the run!!</li>
            <li>So for now I am using this product, and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe it, my hair has not looked this good in thirty years!</li>
            <li>This product allows it to be a beautiful blondish matte color.</li>
            <li>This is a really great rinse for when your permanent color starts to fade and roots begin to show.</li>
            <li>I would have been happy if it just covered my gray, so I could get away from permanent color.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting the great results.</li>
            <li>Just a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for ever and love it!!  </li>
            <li>Great for quick touch-ups and a beautiful color!!</li>
            <li>This is how it gets gorgeous for me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this stuff because I&#x27;ve decided to grow out my gray after years of dyeing my hair and this looked like the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t take any time to apply!!  </li>
            <li>On the bright side it gives my hair a nice texture and it is non-damaging.</li>
            <li>More than enhancing the color, it also is a great \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Is amazing how this product makes my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my head felt sore, when my hair moved it felt sore at the roots and my scalp felt warm to the touch.</li>
            <li>You do need to play around with the application to suit your own lifestyle.</li>

            <li>It is easy to use and colors nicely.</li>
            <li>I know this product has been around for many, many years.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t advertise it as a conditioner (do they?), but I find my hair to have more body and manageability after I apply it.</li>
            <li>I was distressed by the condition of my hair, after coloring it for so many years.</li>
            <li>Came to Amazon for independent reviews and was impressed.</li>
            <li>I love this product I hope they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product I hope they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This rinse seems to cover better and leaves my hair softer like it has been conditioned.</li>
            <li>Since it does not oxidize like permanent hair color, I assume it is more like a temporary coating rather than penetrating the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased.  </li>
            <li>My husband said I look so much better with the toner on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full) until I can safely recolor my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my hair reddish or ashy, and I always seem to get this with many boxed hair colors.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be concerned that there aren&#x27;t more colors available.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s so reasonable and gives great results.....is a win, win.&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention it turns my silver gray/white hair blonde.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s so reasonable and gives great results.....is a win, win.&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention it turns my silver gray/white hair blonde.</li>
            <li>So I search Google and was directed to the Fanci Full site, it sounded plausible.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting a huge difference since it&#x27;s a color rinse</li>
            <li>My hair was highlighted and it turned out way too light.  </li>
            <li>This temporary hair rinse is ideal, but eventually with my own hair growing back when the highlights grow out, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to have the same color.  </li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;m good to go the next day.</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;m good to go the next day.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Frivolous Fawn was one of the colors they carried.</li>
            <li>Luckily, Frivolous Fawn was one of the colors they carried.</li>
            <li>but it barely shows up on my neutral level 7 light brown hair even after super saturating my hair with it.  </li>
            <li>so I recommend doing a skin test first</li>
            <li>I use a makeup sponge for the crown and temples, it seems to hold more of the liquid, it&#x27;s small and easy to control.</li>
            <li>I pour a little on the sponge and dab it on my hair, paying special attention to the area around my temples which seems to show the most gray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but have settled on this one because the color is subtle, it blends in with my dark hair beautifully, and the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Once it grows longer I will probably return to my hairdresser, but for now this is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This temporary hair product also makes my hair shine and much softer.  </li>
            <li>Just the color I need to cover my short thin gray hair...looks marvelous!</li>
            <li>It is so subtle that any color close will give good results.</li>
            <li>It goes on wet hair so it is easy to blend through for even distribution.</li>
            <li>Once I just covered the temple hair without having washed my hair, or it being wet, it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Once I just covered the temple hair without having washed my hair, or it being wet, it seemed to work fine.  </li>
            <li>For as watery as it is, it covers really well, but no one will ever know that you&#x27;ve added color because it just looks natural.</li>
            <li>One bottle should last me about 2 months, it&#x27;s well worth the $.</li>
            <li>One bottle should last me about 2 months, it&#x27;s well worth the $.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it will work when all my gray hair growns in, right now I only have 1/2 inch of gray roots.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how it will work when all my gray hair growns in, right now I only have 1/2 inch of gray roots.</li>
            <li>My wife canÂ´t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed professionally and used the at-home stuff, plus I&#x27;ve used the Roux tween time color stick and never had any reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>One day I woke up and thought &amp;#34;an old fashion temporary rinse&amp;#34; ....</li>
            <li>but I went for the Frivolous Fawn - since my concern was to only cover the gray - not so much the brown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I pour the liquid into a old plastic coffee can lid and soak the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I only have subtle highlights and my hair is not so bright but a medium blonde....</li>
            <li>I wanted my normal hair texture back, even if was gray!</li>
            <li>A true waste of money.</li>
            <li>If you towel dry your hair in the shower really well, then rub it through your hair thoroughly</li>
            <li>I combed out the excess with a large wide tooth comb and hair dryed.  </li>
            <li>I  do not have any gray hair and natural color of my hair is dark-dark or deep brown.</li>
            <li>Using this product after each shampoo makes sure you never have roots showing or tired looking color.  </li>
            <li>The entire process, right after my shampoo, takes me less then 5 min.</li>
            <li>The entire process, right after my shampoo, takes me less then 5 min.</li>
            <li>The last thing I wanted was weighed down muddy hair - so this is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>I have very dull-gray streaks in my hair and this product toned down the grey to a honey-ish color which blends in very naturally with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and really don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; stage I am in now.  </li>

            <li> : I use it when my hair is still wet, after towel, and I don&#x27;t rinse it.</li>

            <li> Since the color of the product is fawn, it should show on my dark hair, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also bought a dark brown color for my family member with gray hair.</li>
            <li> I did not want to add a boxed hair color to my hair to tone it down, so I grabbed the bottle of Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full) and soaked my hair with it.  </li>
            <li> this stuff did not cover the gray at all, it seemed to disappear after it had dried</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding it in drugstores, so had to order online.</li>
            <li> even though the mousse isn&#x27;t as messy to apply.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t that messy.</li>
            <li> I have used a few of the (Fanci-Full) foams in the past for touch ups, but for the all over toning, I prefer the liquid, like #23 Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full).</li>
            <li> I was done with limp processed hair!</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to apply and leave on without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> , the product arrived very late, after sending an inquiry to the seller.</li>
            <li> A secret</li>
            <li> The fact that after only 3-4 shampoos my silver gray would show on my temples, was annoying.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Using this product after each shampoo makes sure you never have roots showing or tired looking color.  IT IS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and really don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; stage I am in now.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products but have settled on this one because the color is subtle, it blends in with my dark hair beautifully, and the price is outstanding.  My gray hair looks like sandy beige highlights and I have been asked several times where I get my hair colored!  The only problem is that it is watery and I find it difficult to apply and leave on without making a mess.  I solved this by using a make-up sponge to apply it.  I pour a little on the sponge and dab it on my hair, paying special attention to the area around my temples which seems to show the most gray.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this stuff because I&#x27;ve decided to grow out my gray after years of dyeing my hair and this looked like the perfect solution. I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed professionally and used the at-home stuff, plus I&#x27;ve used the Roux tween time color stick and never had any reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this stuff did not cover the gray at all, it seemed to disappear after it had dried and I tried it again, with no luck. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my head felt sore, when my hair moved it felt sore at the roots and my scalp felt warm to the touch. Then I washed my hair and the soreness went away and when I tried the fanci-full again it came back and I realized it must be the fanci-full. then I noticed redness on my scalp. Threw the stuff away! I do not have sensitive skin and have never had any reactions to other dyes so I recommend doing a skin test first (they recommend this on the bottle). But as I said it didn&#x27;t work for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for ever and love it!!  Great for quick touch-ups and a beautiful color!! It&#x27;s easy and doesn&#x27;t take any time to apply!!  Great for people on the run!!</li>
            <li> I lost my hair during chemotherapy and when it started to grow back in there was a lot of gray. I could not see paying a hairdresser to color my hair until it gets longer. So for now I am using this product, and it is wonderful. It is easy to use and colors nicely. I simply apply it every time I wash my hair. My hair is still very short. Once it grows longer I will probably return to my hairdresser, but for now this is very helpful.</li>
            <li> this product does nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every time I shampoo.  It give me the color I like without the adverse effects of permanent color products.</li>
            <li> My wife canÂ´t live without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could try a hair dye before actually using a permanent one... Well, it looks like a colored water, does not do anything to my hair. I  do not have any gray hair and natural color of my hair is dark-dark or deep brown. The product did not even show on my hair. Since the color of the product is fawn, it should show on my dark hair, but it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a dark brown color for my family member with gray hair. it did not do anything on her hair either. Her gray hair just stayed the same after using the product. Complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product arrived very late, after sending an inquiry to the seller. I will not recommend.</li>
            <li> Roux&#x27;s website said Frivolous fawn was a level 4 but it barely shows up on my neutral level 7 light brown hair even after super saturating my hair with it.  I&#x27;m not expecting a huge difference since it&#x27;s a color rinse but I feel like if something is 3 shades darker than your hair, even a rinse should be noticeable.  On the bright side it gives my hair a nice texture and it is non-damaging.</li>
            <li> Just the color I need to cover my short thin gray hair...looks marvelous!</li>
            <li> Is amazing how this product makes my hair shiny. I have white hair. This product allows it to be a beautiful blondish matte color. A secret: I use it when my hair is still wet, after towel, and I don&#x27;t rinse it. This is how it gets gorgeous for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I know this product has been around for many, many years. I hope it is never discontinued. I have trouble finding it in drugstores, so had to order online. I was encouraged (about the continuation of the product) by seeing that the bottle has been redesigned. This is a really great rinse for when your permanent color starts to fade and roots begin to show. For as watery as it is, it covers really well, but no one will ever know that you&#x27;ve added color because it just looks natural. My only problem is that \\&quot;watery\\&quot; factor: it is a little drippy during application. More than enhancing the color, it also is a great \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioner. They don&#x27;t advertise it as a conditioner (do they?), but I find my hair to have more body and manageability after I apply it. It goes on wet hair so it is easy to blend through for even distribution. Don&#x27;t be concerned that there aren&#x27;t more colors available. It is so subtle that any color close will give good results.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have very dull-gray streaks in my hair and this product toned down the grey to a honey-ish color which blends in very naturally with the rest of my hair. It also leaves my hair super shiny and healthy looking. It doesn&#x27;t stain skin or the sink.</li>
            <li> I was distressed by the condition of my hair, after coloring it for so many years. The fact that after only 3-4 shampoos my silver gray would show on my temples, was annoying. I switched to just doing the roots every four weeks and that was a hassle! Two shampoos later my temples were gray again! I&#x27;m in my late sixties, my hair was limp, dull and would not hold a style for more then two hours. I wanted my normal hair texture back, even if was gray! I was done with limp processed hair! One day I woke up and thought &amp;#34;an old fashion temporary rinse&amp;#34; .... So I search Google and was directed to the Fanci Full site, it sounded plausible. Came to Amazon for independent reviews and was impressed. Decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My hair color is medium brown but I went for the Frivolous Fawn - since my concern was to only cover the gray - not so much the brown.&lt;br /&gt;I read through all of the comments and helpful hints. Here are some:&lt;br /&gt;1. I use a makeup sponge for the crown and temples, it seems to hold more of the liquid, it&#x27;s small and easy to control. I pour the liquid into a old plastic coffee can lid and soak the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;2. For the back of my hair ( it&#x27;s just above shoulder length) I pour a little on, directly from the bottle, and work it through.&lt;br /&gt;3. One reviewer said that her hair felt muddy after the application. So she started towel drying, her hair, after applling the rinse. The last thing I wanted was weighed down muddy hair - so this is exactly what I did. The color seems to stay intact. One day I&#x27;ll try it without towel drying to see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;4. Assuming cream rinse will only weigh my hair down, I never use it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Remeber to not rinse hair after applying the color rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Now for my results:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it, my hair has not looked this good in thirty years! It&#x27;s shiny! It feels thicker and has body! I would have been happy if it just covered my gray, so I could get away from permanent color. I was not expecting the great results. As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t use cream rinse but this rinse seems to have a similar quality without weighting down my hair. Then I stated to panic.....what if they stop making this product? So I search drugstores in my area, a few had the product but in limited color selections. Luckily, Frivolous Fawn was one of the colors they carried. I picked up 2 on sale at the Rex store for $3.50 (on sale). I wanted to try the blonde colors (hard to find)  as I&#x27;m only concerned in covering the gray.&lt;br /&gt;Called Sally Beauty Supply store and they carry all the colors for six dollars and change, so I bought 2 different blonde shades. One bottle should last me about 2 months, it&#x27;s well worth the $. The entire process, right after my shampoo, takes me less then 5 min. I do not wash my hair daily, and yet I&#x27;m good to go the next day. Now it&#x27;s not as shiny the next day because of pillow tossing. Once I just covered the temple hair without having washed my hair, or it being wet, it seemed to work fine.  I have no idea how it will work when all my gray hair growns in, right now I only have 1/2 inch of gray roots. I love this product I hope they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the mousse version, only the liquid rinse. It does not come off on my pillow and doesn&#x27;t smell. You do need to play around with the application to suit your own lifestyle. For me the price was never the issue, it was just the results. The fact that it&#x27;s so reasonable and gives great results.....is a win, win.&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention it turns my silver gray/white hair blonde. It looks like I have blonde highlights.great results. As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t use cream rinse but this rinse seems to have a similar quality without weighting down my hair.

            <li> even though the mousse isn&#x27;t as messy to apply. This rinse seems to cover better and leaves my hair softer like it has been conditioned. I just tried it, so I don&#x27;t know how well it rinses out. Since it does not oxidize like permanent hair color, I assume it is more like a temporary coating rather than penetrating the hair shaft. I don&#x27;t think it will leave roots or look phony. I stay away from permanent hair color because I don&#x27;t like the root touch ups and color fading. If you towel dry your hair in the shower really well, then rub it through your hair thoroughly it isn&#x27;t that messy.</li>
            <li> Horrible! A true waste of money. Don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full) was a life saver for my hair.  My hair was highlighted and it turned out way too light.  I did not want to add a boxed hair color to my hair to tone it down, so I grabbed the bottle of Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full) and soaked my hair with it.  I combed out the excess with a large wide tooth comb and hair dryed.  I was so pleased.  Now I only have subtle highlights and my hair is not so bright but a medium blonde....not ashy and not red.  My husband said I look so much better with the toner on my hair.  I will continue to use Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full) until I can safely recolor my hair.  Now that I like the color of Frivolous Fawn, I wish I could find a permanent hair color to match the color of Frivolous Fawn.  I don&#x27;t want my hair reddish or ashy, and I always seem to get this with many boxed hair colors.  This temporary hair rinse is ideal, but eventually with my own hair growing back when the highlights grow out, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to have the same color.  This temporary hair product also makes my hair shine and much softer.  Just a great product.  I have used a few of the (Fanci-Full) foams in the past for touch ups, but for the all over toning, I prefer the liquid, like #23 Frivolous Fawn (Fanci-Full).</li>
