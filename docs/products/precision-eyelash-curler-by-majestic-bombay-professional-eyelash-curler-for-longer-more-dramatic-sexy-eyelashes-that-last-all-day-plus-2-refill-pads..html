            <li>Works amazing for all eye shapes and sizes to capture every lash.&lt;br /&gt;•MORE</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t pull out what remaining lashes I have.</li>
            <li>The company sent me this as a sample to get my honest and unbiased feedback from it.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I now have beautiful and full lashes on both eyes.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice</li>
            <li>and I got a nice email from the company.</li>
            <li>, they have a nice curl</li>

            <li>Your lashes will be nice and curled to your liking and they will stay that way.</li>
            <li>(I received this product to review, but my opinions are my own).</li>

            <li>Wow are these awesome!</li>

            <li>A good curler is definitely worth spending on, and this one is it!</li>
            <li>If you have never used an eyelash curler before, a very detailed set of instructions comes with this product.</li>
            <li>Using this eyelash curler is easy and effective.</li>
            <li>I curl my lashes before applying mascara and love the outcome.</li>
            <li>This is such an awesome Curler.</li>
            <li>The handle has much more force than most others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Coming with 2 extra pads is a wonderful plus, just for the fact that you will never want to use another lash curler after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it allows for better lift and beauty to your lashes</li>
            <li>I was especially impressed with how the curler worked on my left eye.</li>

            <li>How cute is this Precision Eyelash Curler that Majestic Bombay sent me to review for them?  </li>
            <li>I love the look and feel of this curler.  </li>
            <li>I’m really excited with the results!</li>
            <li>I love this brand because first of all, I have tried so many of their products with amazing results.</li>
            <li>Great looking lashes complete a makeup look.</li>
            <li>leaving you with flirty sexy lashes.&lt;br /&gt;•ERGONOMIC CUSHION HANDLE is easy to grip and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>This one is gentle and the most effective.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys good looking lashes without the pain.</li>
            <li>NO PAIN DESIGN makes curling your eyelashes easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>It helps the curl stay longer and also seems to curl more quickly.</li>
            <li>Not to mention they are fantastic to use.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle makes for a comfortable grip almost cushioned like.</li>
            <li>It allows the flirt and feisty side of you free to be shown with a squeeze of the handle.</li>
            <li>Your fingers are gonna thank you for these ultra comfortable cushion</li>
            <li>The cushion kind of feels like plastic which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>You also get two extra replacement pads (with a think is a great plus).  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use, and I think the head of the curler really did fit my eye shape</li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; handles, because they&#x27;re super easy to grip, which prevents the likelihood of pinching yourself as you curl your lashes.</li>
            <li>There is a significant curl to my lashes after using the Precision Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li>FRIENDLY -</li>
            <li>but maybe that makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I finally gave it a try and loved it.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Our new designed curler is safe and user friendly.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so cute and what I love is that it gives you extra cushions so if one breaks or gets damaged, you have a backup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With the beautiful sleekness and bold and bright color scheme of black and neon pink.</li>
            <li>and I am able to get grab all of my lashes so they all get a nice little curl to them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loving this and would totally recommend these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>It’s very easy to use, and it definitely curls your lashes with an all-day curl.</li>
            <li>but I just wish there was a latch or something that could keep it closed and fit in my make up case better.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast too.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be much different than the others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Especially with so many people in and out the house of mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having used many different eyelash curlers over the years, I have NEVER encountered the nightmare this curler created for me.  </li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good products.</li>
            <li>Pushing hard on a drugstore lash curler only to end up with a perfect 90 degree angle!</li>
            <li>The design of this curler will get every single lash and make sure that every one is evenly curled.</li>
            <li>think curling the eyelashes is one of those parts of a makeup routine that doesn&#x27;t get much credit but when done correctly can really change your whole look.  </li>
            <li>but these are the absolute cutest.</li>
            <li>I really have to build mine up, and this will help you do that.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really grip my lashes very well</li>
            <li>The stainless steel makes for ease of cleaning the product and shine that no one can deny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The metal on the top did not align with the pink bottom pad causing it to basically be metal on metal.</li>
            <li>I am extremely gentle but I can see where it could bother some people&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>A well made eyelash curler and a very speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the simple instructions in the free MANUAL, enclosed in your package.&lt;br /&gt;•COMFORT</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look so much fuller and healthier since using this because they arent getting pulled out anymore, and even by the end of the day my lashes have still held their curl.</li>
            <li>It fits my eye shape really well</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>First time to try it, and it cut a chunk right out of the middle of my eyelashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t particularly like, however, was the rubber pads.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, my lashes have straightened out.</li>
            <li>A properly curled eyelash can make your lashes look longer, thicker, fuller, and the eyes themselves appear larger and more awake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this at a high discount because I reviewed it on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and my blog</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I you highly recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>I own two other eyelash curlers from different brands and they didn&#x27;t curl my lashes in any way.</li>
            <li>and I naturally have straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried and loved a lot of their grooming products in the past and this Eyelash Curler is no different.</li>
            <li>The Precision Eyelash Curler completely solved that problem!</li>
            <li>I tried to bend the top metal enough to have it align with the pad with really no success.</li>
            <li>I love the look of my lashes with a little extra curl now that I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>However, with a different pad, this eyelash curler would be absolutely perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a big difference</li>
            <li>30 years old and have NEVER used one of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it is about having such cute eyelash curlers</li>
            <li>This attribute is great because beauty does not have to be painful.</li>
            <li>It BARELY makes it to the pad now, but I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my left eyelashes are wonky and tend to clump up easily.</li>
            <li>My lashes are usually long and soft.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I love was that it comes with two extra pads so that if your other gets dirty or for some reason gets too compressed (which I don&#x27;t anticipate happening), then you can replace it.</li>

            <li> This attribute is great because beauty does not have to be painful.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about having such cute eyelash curlers but these are the absolute cutest. Not to mention they are fantastic to use. No pinching, no tugging, no tears. Pulling your eyelashes is the worst feeling one could have sometimes so it&#x27;s nice to have beautifully gorgeous lashes without the pain. I have extremely fragile eyelashes after going through cancer twice so it&#x27;s nice to have something that won&#x27;t pull out what remaining lashes I have. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys good looking lashes without the pain.</li>
            <li> Wow are these awesome! I was sent this eyelash curler for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and they are the bomb!! I HAVE to curl my eyelashes just about everyday because I have extremely long and straight eyelashes and I wear glasses. I hate when my lashes touch my glasses! These are the best ever! I hardly had to push the ends together and I got a perfect curl! Who knows about your lashes being a 90 degree angle? I know I do! Pushing hard on a drugstore lash curler only to end up with a perfect 90 degree angle! Not with this pair!! I have been using this about a week and I haven&#x27;t had a 90 degree lash yet! Loving this and would totally recommend these! Plus it comes with 2 extra pads! How great is that! Any beauty Queen would love to get these in their stocking!</li>
            <li> I have read many review saying that  this curler pulled out the lashes and for that reason I was afraid to use it. I finally gave it a try and loved it. I own two other eyelash curlers from different brands and they didn&#x27;t curl my lashes in any way. This curled my lashes, didn&#x27;t pull put any lashes, and comes with 2 packs of refills which is amazing. I curl my lashes before applying mascara and love the outcome. I wear false lashes on a daily basis but always curl my real ones so they blend flawlessly and this tool does just that. The price is also great given the fact that you get 2 refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me for free/discounted price for review purposes. All opinions are 100% mine and unbiased</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome Curler. I have short eyelashes and refuse to wear fake ones. I really have to build mine up, and this will help you do that. The first thing I love was that it comes with two extra pads so that if your other gets dirty or for some reason gets too compressed (which I don&#x27;t anticipate happening), then you can replace it. The handle has much more force than most others I have tried. This allows you to curl your lashes without having to squeeze your fingers together until they hurt. I love it. The handles are also cushioned so your fingers don&#x27;t feel a thing. This one also does pinch your eyelid skin which has always bothered me about other brands.  The company sent me this as a sample to get my honest and unbiased feedback from it. I&#x27;m so glad they did because my honest opinion is...IT IS AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be much different than the others I&#x27;ve used but this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  This curls my lashes and doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids like the others have and I was starting to think that I was a gluten for punishment until I used this one that does what I wanted, it curls my lashes without punching my eyelid.  Bonus that it looks good so if I leave it sitting out I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler is well-designed, and durable. I like the &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; handles, because they&#x27;re super easy to grip, which prevents the likelihood of pinching yourself as you curl your lashes. What I didn&#x27;t particularly like, however, was the rubber pads. They didn&#x27;t really grip my lashes very well (mine are extremely short). However, with a different pad, this eyelash curler would be absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great looking lashes complete a makeup look. In my experience, a good pair of Eyelash Curlers is imperative in achieving great looking lashes. I love this brand because first of all, I have tried so many of their products with amazing results. Needless to say, I am not a &amp;#34;Majestic Bombay&amp;#34; newbie. I have tried and loved a lot of their grooming products in the past and this Eyelash Curler is no different. I love it! It is lightweight and it curls my lashes with no problems! Well made and well priced. I think y&#x27;all would like it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

            <li> It was working well but then it chopped off all of my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I just tried the precision eye lash curler and I am amazed. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a big difference but I was corrected. My eye lash was so long people thought I put on false lashes. The packaging is so cute and what I love is that it gives you extra cushions so if one breaks or gets damaged, you have a backup. I would recommend getting it. I would give it a 10 out of 10. It&#x27;s an amazing product I am so astonished that I didn&#x27;t get it sooner. I got this at a high discount because I reviewed it on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and my blog</li>
            <li> Majestic Bombay has designed a ergonomically made lash curler that no only does not pinch but grabs every lash evenly so that no lashes are left behind. The design of the handle makes for a comfortable grip almost cushioned like. Coming with 2 extra pads is a wonderful plus, just for the fact that you will never want to use another lash curler after this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the beautiful sleekness and bold and bright color scheme of black and neon pink. It allows the flirt and feisty side of you free to be shown with a squeeze of the handle. The stainless steel makes for ease of cleaning the product and shine that no one can deny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one problem, that is the pop back reflex on the handle. I know it allows for better lift and beauty to your lashes but I just wish there was a latch or something that could keep it closed and fit in my make up case better. That way I do not have to have it somewhere else and forget that I have it or in a rush and cannot find it when I need it. Especially with so many people in and out the house of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> There is a significant curl to my lashes after using the Precision Eyelash Curler. I found it very easy to use, and I think the head of the curler really did fit my eye shape well. I was especially impressed with how the curler worked on my left eye. For some reason, my left eyelashes are wonky and tend to clump up easily. The Precision Eyelash Curler completely solved that problem! I now have beautiful and full lashes on both eyes. I’m really excited with the results! All in all, I highly recommend this eyelash curler. It’s very easy to use, and it definitely curls your lashes with an all-day curl.</li>
            <li> This thing is being sent back immediately!  I liked the way it looked, and it has great reviews, so I decided it was time to upgrade.  Having used many different eyelash curlers over the years, I have NEVER encountered the nightmare this curler created for me.  Do not buy this!  First time to try it, and it cut a chunk right out of the middle of my eyelashes on both eyes.  In fact, all of my lashes feel crispy and damaged now.  My lashes are usually long and soft.  I am horrified, and now have an emergency appointment for eye lash extensions!!!  Most regretted purchase ever!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> UGH I should have listened to the other one star review. I too was a victim of this eyelash curler cutting my eyelashes. Not as bad as the other review, but it took a chunk out of 3 eyelashes and I barely pressed it down. The metal on the top did not align with the pink bottom pad causing it to basically be metal on metal. I might as well tried to curl my lashes with a pair of scissors. I tried to bend the top metal enough to have it align with the pad with really no success. It BARELY makes it to the pad now, but I don&#x27;t trust it. Needless to say I am going to look like a goon going out with the girls tonight.  Update: The same day I posted the review, Majestic Bombay emailed me and refunded my money without me asking (and without returning the product). I believe this is a good product, but I just got a faulty pair. Shipping was super fast too. I will still purchase from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> 30 years old and have NEVER used one of these. I got one to try and love it. I use it before my mascara even though my lashes are already curled. I love the look of my lashes with a little extra curl now that I&#x27;ve used it. I am extremely gentle but I can see where it could bother some people&#x27;s eyes. The packaging was nice and I got a nice email from the company. I&#x27;m completely satisfied and would reorder again or buy as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and it works so well</li>
            <li> A well made eyelash curler and a very speedy delivery.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try the Precision Eyelash Curler by Majestic Bombay. I like how my eyelashes look after using this, they have a nice curl and I naturally have straight eyelashes. This eyelash curler comes with two refill pads, which I think is nice. I like to apply heat (about 5 seconds) from my hairdryer to the curler before curling my eyelashes. It helps the curl stay longer and also seems to curl more quickly. Here are the instructions from the back of the box, Ensure that the lash cushion is in place. Bring Precision up to the eyelid, closest to the eyelash roots. Slowly press your thumb and finger together and hold for 5 to 10 seconds, repeat until desired curl is achieved. I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good products.</li>
            <li> NO PAIN DESIGN makes curling your eyelashes easy and pain free. Just follow the simple instructions in the free MANUAL, enclosed in your package.&lt;br /&gt;•COMFORT FRIENDLY - Our new designed curler is safe and user friendly. Works amazing for all eye shapes and sizes to capture every lash.&lt;br /&gt;•MORE CONTROLLED FORCE creates gorgeous curled lashes that stay curled all day with out your lashes losing its radiance........, leaving you with flirty sexy lashes.&lt;br /&gt;•ERGONOMIC CUSHION HANDLE is easy to grip and comfortable to hold.

If these are not the very best EYELASH CURLER you&#x27;ve ever owned, we will refund your money within 90 days. That&#x27;s how sure we are in our product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny! Cheaper curlers have pulled out my eyelashes or not given a good curl. This one is gentle and the most effective. My eyelashes look so much fuller and healthier since using this because they arent getting pulled out anymore, and even by the end of the day my lashes have still held their curl. A good curler is definitely worth spending on, and this one is it!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler I have ever owned!  Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, my lashes have straightened out. I am amazed by this product!!</li>
            <li> The best eyelash curlers that I have used and I have used them all.</li>
            <li> Handles are helpful and makes it so it doesn&#x27;t slip. The cushion kind of feels like plastic which I don&#x27;t really like but maybe that makes it easier to clean. Comes with two extra cushions.</li>
            <li> Use this for about 7 seconds every morning and you are good for the day. Your lashes will be nice and curled to your liking and they will stay that way. Definitely try this curler out and see the difference from the one you got at forever 21.&lt;br /&gt;full review on my blog:  https://lifestyledashbyash.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/precision-eyelash-curler-by-majestic-bombay-review/</li>
            <li> Chopped off some of my eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li> Using this eyelash curler is easy and effective. There is no pinching and pulling of your eyelashes. This attribute is great because beauty does not have to be painful. The design of this curler will get every single lash and make sure that every one is evenly curled. The cushioned handles allows your comfort while applying as much pressure as you need to make sure you have the perfect curls. If you have never used an eyelash curler before, a very detailed set of instructions comes with this product. You also get two extra replacement pads (with a think is a great plus).  I you highly recommend buying this product. (I received this product to review, but my opinions are my own).</li>
            <li> How cute is this Precision Eyelash Curler that Majestic Bombay sent me to review for them?  I love the look and feel of this curler.  It fits my eye shape really well and I am able to get grab all of my lashes so they all get a nice little curl to them.&lt;br /&gt;I think curling the eyelashes is one of those parts of a makeup routine that doesn&#x27;t get much credit but when done correctly can really change your whole look.  A properly curled eyelash can make your lashes look longer, thicker, fuller, and the eyes themselves appear larger and more awake.&lt;br /&gt;I love having the Precision Eyelash Curler by Majestic Bombay as part of my beauty tool arsenal!</li>
