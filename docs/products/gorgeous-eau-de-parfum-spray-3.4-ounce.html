            <li>, so happy I bought this since V.S. doesn&#x27;t sell this perfume anymore.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love this parfume, I can not use it, it&#x27;s great.it&#x27;s the best parfum, i love it, Victoria&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li>Perfume smells good</li>
            <li>here and the PRICE WAS RIGHT!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance, was packaged well and works fine , my girlfriend was very pleased with the purchase !</li>
            <li>What more can I say!</li>
            <li>I love fragrance - good yummy</li>
            <li>one had been discontinued and I was able to find&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Have to unscrew top and dab perfume on in order to use it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but this bottle fell apart.</li>
            <li>When I had the tester, the scent was wonderful and lasted all day long.</li>
            <li>On this bottle of Gorgeous, however, I very, VERY easily was able to twist the neck right off and could pour the perfume right out if I wanted to.. or pour some out and fill it up the rest of the way with water.. which is what I think somebody did.</li>
            <li>With the spray bottle, and applying a fine mist, it&#x27;s a lovely addition to the makeup table.</li>
            <li>Love to smell sexy...makes me feel pretty...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t agree with this at first because mine sprayed and seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>However, that was just a quick test.</li>
            <li>The scent also quickly fades away.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great Customer Service Victoria&#x27;s Secret, you just lost my sales for good.</li>
            <li>How do they mail it out in the first place then?</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a large bottle of it like this at such a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My wife found a sampler of this, and it seems to be a scent that drives me wild!</li>
            <li>Smells great, but when i opened the box the bottle was almost completely empty and perfume wasted everywhere and the box it came in was saturated, bottle was poorly designed</li>

            <li> Smells great, but when i opened the box the bottle was almost completely empty and perfume wasted everywhere and the box it came in was saturated, bottle was poorly designed</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seen to last long which is odd.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from the store a few years ago and the smell would last all day.</li>
            <li> Sprayer doesn&#x27;t work had to empty bottle into another container.</li>
            <li> I always felt that Victoria&#x27;s Secret was a reputable Co. that stood behind their products.</li>
            <li> Upon actually using it regularly this past week, I&#x27;ve noticed that it really only sprays out in drizzly, little, messy spurts.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about the bottle/spray function being faulty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to purchasing expensive fragrances, I&#x27;ve purchased many perfumes from Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the past, along with Lancome, Estee Lauder, Guess, etc.</li>
            <li> I had this fragrance in a small tester bottle, directly from the Victoria&#x27;s Secret store.</li>
            <li> When I say quickly, I seriously mean within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let them know I had a damaged product, they never even bothered to say sorry for the bad experience, only to tell me we can&#x27;t allow you to return the item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> the VS label came off and the pump no longer works hat a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> When you buy an expensive bottle like that, you cannot twist off the neck of the bottle and take out the spray pump.</li>
            <li> I like it, but very uncomfortable to have to unscrew the bottle to use/dab perfume now.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for the price I paid.</li>

            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t seen to last long which is odd. I received a sample from the store a few years ago and the smell would last all day. Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t spray correctly.</li>
            <li> Shipped priority mail and box/perfume in perfect condition. Smells great, so happy I bought this since V.S. doesn&#x27;t sell this perfume anymore. Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM!!! It is one of my favorites from Victoria Secrets! Love to smell sexy...makes me feel pretty...</li>

When I say quickly, I seriously mean within 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the fact that I am not the only person complaining of a faulty bottle, I believe they have been tampered with. I&#x27;m not new to purchasing expensive fragrances, I&#x27;ve purchased many perfumes from Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the past, along with Lancome, Estee Lauder, Guess, etc. When you buy an expensive bottle like that, you cannot twist off the neck of the bottle and take out the spray pump. On this bottle of Gorgeous, however, I very, VERY easily was able to twist the neck right off and could pour the perfume right out if I wanted to.. or pour some out and fill it up the rest of the way with water.. which is what I think somebody did.</li>
            <li> I love fragrance - good yummy ones!!!&lt;br /&gt;this one had been discontinued and I was able to find&lt;br /&gt;it here and the PRICE WAS RIGHT!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend a while back and she loves this stuff.  There have been problems known with the sprayer breaking though.  Idk how it is currently though.</li>
            <li> Twisted top as instruction but the pump spray does not work. Turned both ways and it still does not work. Have to unscrew top and dab perfume on in order to use it. Very disappointed for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this bottle fell apart. the VS label came off and the pump no longer works hat a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present! Hope it&#x27;s great. It is what she wanted. What more can I say! It&#x27;s Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> I always felt that Victoria&#x27;s Secret was a reputable Co. that stood behind their products. When I ordered this I had no reason to think it would not spray or work properly, that was not a question. I was unaware that it was considered. \\&quot;Hazerdous Material\\&quot; and could not be returned. I let them know I had a damaged product, they never even bothered to say sorry for the bad experience, only to tell me we can&#x27;t allow you to return the item! How do they mail it out in the first place then? I have to eat the cost and have a bottle of purfume that I can never use, wonderful!!! Thanks for the great Customer Service Victoria&#x27;s Secret, you just lost my sales for good. Ladies beware.</li>
            <li> One of my fav scents! Must have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance, was packaged well and works fine , my girlfriend was very pleased with the purchase !</li>
            <li> The product is great! My wife loves it!  It is discontinued in the store and she loves this perfume. Happy, happy happy....</li>
            <li> My wife found a sampler of this, and it seems to be a scent that drives me wild! With the spray bottle, and applying a fine mist, it&#x27;s a lovely addition to the makeup table.</li>
            <li> Eventually my pumper broke.i have to unscrew the bottle to use it now. Perfume smells good I like it, but very uncomfortable to have to unscrew the bottle to use/dab perfume now.</li>
            <li> I love this parfume, I can not use it, it&#x27;s great.it&#x27;s the best parfum, i love it, Victoria&#x27;s the best!</li>
