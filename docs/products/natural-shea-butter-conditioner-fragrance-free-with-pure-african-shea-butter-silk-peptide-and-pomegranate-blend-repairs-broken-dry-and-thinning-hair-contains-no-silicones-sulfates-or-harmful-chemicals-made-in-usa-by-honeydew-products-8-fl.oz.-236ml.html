            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent which I like my hair to have a nice smell to it</li>
            <li>I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and worth buying again!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and made my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>Awesome to have a fragrance-free conditioner for those who are sensitive to fragrance!</li>
            <li>but because it&#x27;s such a great product and works great I will sacrifice the fruity smell.</li>
            <li>This is a very light conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair smell and feels.</li>
            <li>You have to use it and you&#x27;ll love it too..not greasy and leaving my hair healthy and shiny.</li>

            <li>love it</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>the best thing i like the most is that it&#x27;s sulfate free with all natural  ingredients</li>
            <li>This light conditioner works nice and I love the ingredients,  </li>
            <li>but the thing that I appreciate most is that, now, my hair doesn&#x27;t have to suffer because of the sulfate.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great conditioner!  </li>

            <li>You will love this product</li>
            <li>Feels more like a body lotion than conditioner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling smooth and healthy with a wonderful shine</li>
            <li>This conditioner is nice and light for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This was such a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li>full looking !  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of perfumy stuff, just clean, shiny, moisturized and healthy curls.</li>
            <li>Works well, rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>My curls are very shiny,fluffy, nicely clumped, moisturized, and more defined.</li>
            <li>Rinses out easy and also helps frizziness.</li>
            <li>I have fine, 3a/3b curls</li>
            <li>Smells really good and leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>The best part is it really makes shiny to your hair and give it a nice black shiny look.</li>
            <li>.. felt like hand lotion and did not leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>I enjoy this conditioner.</li>
            <li>After researching sulfate free shampoos, found this conditioner to match.</li>
            <li>This product is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I thought this would fit the bill.</li>
            <li>but I would not call this fragrance free.</li>
            <li>A great daily conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair felt full fresh and healthy, not oily</li>
            <li>leaves the hair soft and tangle free love it!</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this replacement--and my hair is much happier for it!</li>
            <li>so the first couple times I tried this I was not to pleased.</li>
            <li>Shea Butter is natural and I feel very comfortable while using it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was able to find this product at a promotional price for testing purposes and this is my honest opinion of it after actually using it.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Soft and Lovely !</li>
            <li>Shea butter is a nice hydrator and leaves our hair soft and NO frizzies.</li>
            <li>Good price for such a product.</li>
            <li>It is good to use on a day that you are adding heavier leave in products such as a curl activator.  </li>
            <li>I used plenty of product and left in my hair a good 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this conditioner to those with curly hair, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this conditioner will also work great for those with wavy or straight hair.</li>
            <li>It is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Love Natural Shea Butter Conditioner the best part of this conditioner is it stood thick and rich in my hair and did not become watery after i put the shower cap on and set under the dryer.</li>
            <li>This is more like a mask than a daily conditioner, which I love.  </li>
            <li>After I apply this conditioner my hair is knot free and feels really soft it also adds volume and it shapes my curls they are bouncy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great on my daughter&#x27;s curly long hair and makes brushing her hair and getting the knots out much easier.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the ingredients, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>I have dry, very curly hair and this worked great for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with chemical filled product.</li>
            <li>so I am very in tune with fragrance free products.</li>
            <li>I love Natural Conditioners for my hair</li>
            <li>I love that its made with all natural products that wont damage your hair.</li>
            <li>And the fact that we can get it for this price is a pretty sweet deal.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and smooth and no frizz!</li>
            <li>But after a few more times it has made a nice difference.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell but it is very moisturizing and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I tend to process my hair a lot so need a conditioner that will bring it back to that silky smooth hair that we all love so much.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing and left my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has argan oil in it, so you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out very easily and left my hair very soft and super moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair pretty much ate it up!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product leaves my hair feeling healthy!</li>
            <li>Love this product for my daughters curly hair, It gives her that extra hydration that she needs!</li>
            <li>Therefore, it definitely looks better now.</li>
            <li>I been using this product for like 2 months now since I bought it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels more light weight and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>great for dry hair, especially on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I found this Shea Butter Conditioner to be super moisturizing for my long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, baby fine hair that has been bleached, colored, and pretty much over processed.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li>It has a very neautral scent to it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like much, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I have grown to really like this cin\conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a shampoo companion, but with my regular fragrance free shampoo this works well.</li>
            <li>Its is very moisturizing for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and smooth, and not as heavy as I expected, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>and I really want to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and it has strengthen my hair so my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much as it use to my hair</li>
            <li>also looks nourished and so much healthier my hair also doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as it use to.</li>
            <li>I have tried 2 other times thinking it would be better and it has not.</li>
            <li>For being shea butter, I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly, but it definitely does.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>I was surprised after my first use (keep in mind</li>
            <li>Curly hair can be very dry, and I used this as a leave-in after showering and my hair was easy to comb, and my curls are controlled and aligned and there is no frizz.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying to find that one product that I can&#x27;t live without and this conditioner has become one of them!</li>
            <li>Hair was very soft and silky!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Oh Wow !  Heavenly Fragrance !</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft and shining!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for natural product with no chemicals!!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft for days without getting oily!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how it feels and looks during the dry months</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Shea Butter conditioner, It helps to lessen my hairfall, ill continue using it as my regular conditioner, What i love most to this product is that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is very sensitive to new products</li>
            <li>very soft hair.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Oh wow!  </li>
            <li>Love my hair is never better</li>
            <li>My hair has been color treated for many years in the past</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft after applying it, however I did not like its smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used nearly as much as I do with budget commercial conditioners, so that helps with my budget as well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so hydrated and so soft.  </li>
            <li>Made it so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, after using this for a week or so, I realized the itching had almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and helps with those frizzies.</li>
            <li>my hair actually felt more dried out and tangled.</li>
            <li>Made my baby fine hair too limp!</li>
            <li>Tampered bottle and a smell is not a good indication that it will be safe to use.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair very manageable and my hair is very long</li>
            <li>I mean that it is sooooo fragrance free that if someone held it directly under your nose, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li>I could immediately notice that it left my hair smooth,and soft!  </li>
            <li>;) It did however leave my hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>My son is mixed and has very curly hair but not the texture so this conditioner helps with his curls and tangles without being too much, too heavy, or oily.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair that is also colored, so moisturization is at the top on my list when looking for a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Natural made conditioner works well at moisturizing my dry and frizzy hair.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product would be good</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent which I like my hair to have a nice smell to it</li>
            <li> I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and worth buying again!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and made my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> Awesome to have a fragrance-free conditioner for those who are sensitive to fragrance!</li>
            <li> but because it&#x27;s such a great product and works great I will sacrifice the fruity smell.</li>
            <li> This is a very light conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair smell and feels.</li>
            <li> You have to use it and you&#x27;ll love it too..not greasy and leaving my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> My scalp skin also looks better because of the shea butter component.</li>
            <li> I love that I</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> the best thing i like the most is that it&#x27;s sulfate free with all natural  ingredients</li>
            <li> This light conditioner works nice and I love the ingredients,  </li>
            <li> but the thing that I appreciate most is that, now, my hair doesn&#x27;t have to suffer because of the sulfate.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> You will love this product</li>
            <li> Feels more like a body lotion than conditioner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling smooth and healthy with a wonderful shine</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and light for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> This was such a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> full looking !  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of perfumy stuff, just clean, shiny, moisturized and healthy curls.</li>
            <li> Works well, rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> My curls are very shiny,fluffy, nicely clumped, moisturized, and more defined.</li>
            <li> Rinses out easy and also helps frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have fine, 3a/3b curls</li>
            <li> Smells really good and leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> The best part is it really makes shiny to your hair and give it a nice black shiny look.</li>
            <li> .. felt like hand lotion and did not leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> I enjoy this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After researching sulfate free shampoos, found this conditioner to match.</li>
            <li> This product is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I thought this would fit the bill.</li>
            <li> but I would not call this fragrance free.</li>
            <li> A great daily conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair felt full fresh and healthy, not oily</li>
            <li> leaves the hair soft and tangle free love it!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this replacement--and my hair is much happier for it!</li>
            <li> so the first couple times I tried this I was not to pleased.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter is natural and I feel very comfortable while using it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was able to find this product at a promotional price for testing purposes and this is my honest opinion of it after actually using it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Soft and Lovely !</li>
            <li> Shea butter is a nice hydrator and leaves our hair soft and NO frizzies.</li>
            <li> Good price for such a product.</li>
            <li> It is good to use on a day that you are adding heavier leave in products such as a curl activator.  </li>
            <li> I used plenty of product and left in my hair a good 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this conditioner to those with curly hair, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this conditioner will also work great for those with wavy or straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Love Natural Shea Butter Conditioner the best part of this conditioner is it stood thick and rich in my hair and did not become watery after i put the shower cap on and set under the dryer.</li>
            <li> This is more like a mask than a daily conditioner, which I love.  </li>
            <li> After I apply this conditioner my hair is knot free and feels really soft it also adds volume and it shapes my curls they are bouncy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great on my daughter&#x27;s curly long hair and makes brushing her hair and getting the knots out much easier.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the ingredients, it&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> I have dry, very curly hair and this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with chemical filled product.</li>
            <li> so I am very in tune with fragrance free products.</li>
            <li> I love Natural Conditioners for my hair</li>
            <li> I love that its made with all natural products that wont damage your hair.</li>
            <li> And the fact that we can get it for this price is a pretty sweet deal.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and smooth and no frizz!</li>
            <li> But after a few more times it has made a nice difference.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is natural</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell but it is very moisturizing and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I tend to process my hair a lot so need a conditioner that will bring it back to that silky smooth hair that we all love so much.  </li>
            <li> This smells amazing and left my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has argan oil in it, so you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out very easily and left my hair very soft and super moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair pretty much ate it up!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product leaves my hair feeling healthy!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my daughters curly hair, It gives her that extra hydration that she needs!</li>
            <li> Therefore, it definitely looks better now.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for like 2 months now since I bought it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels more light weight and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> great for dry hair, especially on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I found this Shea Butter Conditioner to be super moisturizing for my long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, baby fine hair that has been bleached, colored, and pretty much over processed.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a smell to it.</li>
            <li> It has a very neautral scent to it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like much, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I have grown to really like this cin\conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a shampoo companion, but with my regular fragrance free shampoo this works well.</li>
            <li> Its is very moisturizing for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and smooth, and not as heavy as I expected, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> and I really want to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and it has strengthen my hair so my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much as it use to my hair</li>
            <li> also looks nourished and so much healthier my hair also doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as it use to.</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other times thinking it would be better and it has not.</li>
            <li> For being shea butter, I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly, but it definitely does.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> I was surprised after my first use (keep in mind</li>
            <li> Curly hair can be very dry, and I used this as a leave-in after showering and my hair was easy to comb, and my curls are controlled and aligned and there is no frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am always trying to find that one product that I can&#x27;t live without and this conditioner has become one of them!</li>
            <li> Hair was very soft and silky!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Oh Wow !  Heavenly Fragrance !</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft and shining!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural product with no chemicals!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft for days without getting oily!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how it feels and looks during the dry months</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Shea Butter conditioner, It helps to lessen my hairfall, ill continue using it as my regular conditioner, What i love most to this product is that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is very sensitive to new products</li>
            <li> very soft hair.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Oh wow!  </li>
            <li> Love my hair is never better</li>
            <li> My hair has been color treated for many years in the past</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft after applying it, however I did not like its smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used nearly as much as I do with budget commercial conditioners, so that helps with my budget as well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so hydrated and so soft.  </li>
            <li> Made it so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, after using this for a week or so, I realized the itching had almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and helps with those frizzies.</li>
            <li> my hair actually felt more dried out and tangled.</li>
            <li> Made my baby fine hair too limp!</li>
            <li> Tampered bottle and a smell is not a good indication that it will be safe to use.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair very manageable and my hair is very long</li>
            <li> I mean that it is sooooo fragrance free that if someone held it directly under your nose, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
            <li> I could immediately notice that it left my hair smooth,and soft!  </li>
            <li> ;) It did however leave my hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My son is mixed and has very curly hair but not the texture so this conditioner helps with his curls and tangles without being too much, too heavy, or oily.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is also colored, so moisturization is at the top on my list when looking for a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Natural made conditioner works well at moisturizing my dry and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle is a bit small and with my type of hAir I need to use quite bit more conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have such frizzy dry hair that needs constant moister, and this product does just that!</li>
            <li> I will try this on my daughter&#x27;s wavy waist-length hair next, combing out her hair can be painful and if it works to help that process, it will be amazing.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter has very long,</li>
            <li> I even used it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair is colored, but this leaves it dry and fly-away.  </li>
            <li> I have dry damage hair that is always breaking this conditioner has helped my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> It left my hair heavy and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t detangle as well as expected</li>
            <li> This is not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> so I do add a few drops of essential oil but</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply a small amount and leave in for 1-2 minutes, but I applied a lot (about a handful) and I left it in for about 45 minutes with a cap and no heat.</li>
            <li> My hair still feels moisturized after rinsing and I don&#x27;t feel the need to add additional leave in conditioners like I do with some other products.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> THICK hair and this conditioner works equally well for both of us.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that this weighed it down at all.  </li>
            <li> I mean, you can use it daily</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy like other hair conditioners that leave residue and weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> but it still has that slight brittle feeling but not after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry lately, but you&#x27;d never know it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, thick, heavy, frizzy, it does what it wasn&#x27;t hair.</li>
            <li> I use a little as a leave in as well.</li>
            <li> a little on the ends</li>
            <li> I like that it also has aloe vera juice, green tea and argan oil in it.</li>
            <li> but I noticed much less breakage and shedding than usual.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be shocked at how much it helps!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair less dull looking.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is often dry, and I&#x27;ve been very unhappy with the last conditioner I picked up.</li>
            <li> i did not have a hard time untangling my hair with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> i have colored treated hair and the color looks vibe rent after  using and dull like some</li>
            <li> It is hard to find products I can use.</li>
            <li> Have complicated hair, but with this a little less complicated.</li>
            <li> I hate using chemicals in my hair and am trying to go all natural.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.....  </li>
            <li> My daughter has crazy curly hair and this does not quite work for us.</li>
            <li> The one I got must a bad batch or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cannot wait to receive this.  I love Natural Conditioners for my hair</li>
            <li> Love how my hair smell and feels.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I honestly love  this conditioner!! I use a little as a leave in as well. Fantastic product and a great find!</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!!! No residue.... Hair was very soft and silky! My daughters love it too!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft after applying it, however I did not like its smell.</li>
            <li> This is a very light conditioner. It leaves hair feeling weightless. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell to it. It worked well on my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> You have to use it and you&#x27;ll love it too..not greasy and leaving my hair healthy and shiny. I even used it on dry hair. .just a little on the ends</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My hair feels softer since I started using it. I love that its made with all natural products that wont damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner for the hair.  My hair pretty much ate it up!</li>
            <li> Great product! Wife loves how her hair feels and smells.</li>
            <li> This conditioner definitely pulls its weight with my hair. I have very long, fine hair and my daughter has very long, THICK hair and this conditioner works equally well for both of us. Shea butter is a nice hydrator and leaves our hair soft and NO frizzies. The only thing I would change is the smell, and that&#x27;s because there isn&#x27;t one. I mean that it is sooooo fragrance free that if someone held it directly under your nose, you wouldn&#x27;t even notice it. So, it could be a good thing if you have allergies or if you like to add your own EO to it. I wish it smelled like something, honestly, but that isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for this conditioner. And the fact that we can get it for this price is a pretty sweet deal. This conditioner has argan oil in it, so you don&#x27;t have to use very much. I haven&#x27;t used nearly as much as I do with budget commercial conditioners, so that helps with my budget as well. I was able to find this product at a promotional price for testing purposes and this is my honest opinion of it after actually using it.</li>
            <li> Oh Wow !  Heavenly Fragrance !v just like a trip to the spa. Soft and Lovely !</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Leaves the hair very healthy and shiny. My scalp skin also looks better because of the shea butter component. Good price for such a product.</li>
            <li> Loves it! It leaves my hair so hydrated and so soft.  I love that I i did not have a hard time untangling my hair with this conditioner.  It has a very neautral scent to it however I do prefer a fruity smell but because it&#x27;s such a great product and works great I will sacrifice the fruity smell. Thank you!</li>
            <li> just recieved today. will give it a shot</li>
            <li> Smells really good and leaves my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> This is amazing on my curly hair.  Curly hair can be very dry, and I used this as a leave-in after showering and my hair was easy to comb, and my curls are controlled and aligned and there is no frizz.  I will try this on my daughter&#x27;s wavy waist-length hair next, combing out her hair can be painful and if it works to help that process, it will be amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like much, which is a plus.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of perfumy stuff, just clean, shiny, moisturized and healthy curls.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and tried it this morning and omg!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it my hair is so soft and shining!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, thick, heavy, frizzy, it does what it wasn&#x27;t hair. I&#x27;m always looking for natural product with no chemicals!! This stuff smells great for being fragrance free. I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I do with chemical filled product. My hair feels more light weight and less frizzy. I&#x27;ve only used a few times. I&#x27;m excited to see how it feels and looks during the dry months</li>
            <li> Oh wow!  This conditioner feels amazing!  I could immediately notice that it left my hair smooth,and soft!  Only downside is that it&#x27;s fragrance fee.  Other than that, this product leaves my hair feeling healthy!</li>
            <li> love this product. very soft hair.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and left my hair super soft! My hair has been dry lately, but you&#x27;d never know it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m totally loving this conditioner this leaves my hair feeling so soft&lt;br /&gt;and full looking !  i have colored treated hair and the color looks vibe rent after  using and dull like some&lt;br /&gt;conditioners do !  the best thing i like the most is that it&#x27;s sulfate free with all natural  ingredients&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this  product in return for my reviw</li>
            <li> Love this product for my daughters curly hair, It gives her that extra hydration that she needs!</li>
            <li> My son is mixed and has very curly hair but not the texture so this conditioner helps with his curls and tangles without being too much, too heavy, or oily.</li>
            <li> This light conditioner works nice and I love the ingredients,  It is good to use on a day that you are adding heavier leave in products such as a curl activator.  I would have given this 4 stars but it had no fragrance.  The highlight of my shower is the various fragrances of the products that I use.  Updated 6-22-15 I just upgraded this ton 5 starts.  I have grown to really like this cin\conditioner.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sons hair. Made it so soft.</li>
            <li> did not like this product.. felt like hand lotion and did not leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling smooth and healthy with a wonderful shine</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair very manageable and my hair is very long</li>
            <li> Love this product and the smell is great</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling conditioner. Works great too. I love this! Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  I tend to process my hair a lot so need a conditioner that will bring it back to that silky smooth hair that we all love so much.  This is more like a mask than a daily conditioner, which I love.  I mean, you can use it daily but if you want it to last awhile, put it in your hair for five minutes, twice a week.  I think you&#x27;ll be shocked at how much it helps!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes your hair look!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> Natural made conditioner works well at moisturizing my dry and frizzy hair.  I like that this product has no harmful chemicals or sulfates.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner. Fast shipping. Will be ordering again! !!!!</li>
            <li> I have fragrance and chemical sensitivities. It is hard to find products I can use. Makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I enjoy this conditioner. Have complicated hair, but with this a little less complicated.</li>
            <li> After researching sulfate free shampoos, found this conditioner to match. It perfroms well but the thing that I appreciate most is that, now, my hair doesn&#x27;t have to suffer because of the sulfate. Therefore, it definitely looks better now.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t agree with this product. It dries it out and hardened it.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! Keeps my hair soft for days without getting oily!!</li>
            <li> Awesome to have a fragrance-free conditioner for those who are sensitive to fragrance! I found this Shea Butter Conditioner to be super moisturizing for my long fine hair. I like that it also has aloe vera juice, green tea and argan oil in it. A great conditioner for anyone!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and made my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> Kinda make my hair oily but if still feels great. Makes my hair less dull looking. I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels good after using it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. For me, it did not help with tangles but I attribute that to my curly hair syndrome. ;) It did however leave my hair soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair felt full fresh and healthy, not oily</li>
            <li> Helps control frizz too</li>
            <li> I really like this. I wish it had a shampoo companion, but with my regular fragrance free shampoo this works well. This product is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. Its is very moisturizing for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Works well, rinses out easily. would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.....  Did nothing for my skin...</li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice and light for my fine hair. This conditioner is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I just love this conditioner! It leaves my hair feeling so soft and smooth and no frizz! I am always trying to find that one product that I can&#x27;t live without and this conditioner has become one of them! I have such frizzy dry hair that needs constant moister, and this product does just that!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel like corn silk. Love it. Item arrived on time in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I have fine, 3a/3b curls and this did a great job at moisturizing my hair. It is very creamy and smooth, and not as heavy as I expected, which is a good thing. It has no fragrance at all and I absolutely love the ingredients, it&#x27;s very natural. The directions say to apply a small amount and leave in for 1-2 minutes, but I applied a lot (about a handful) and I left it in for about 45 minutes with a cap and no heat.It didn&#x27;t detangle as well as expected but I noticed much less breakage and shedding than usual. It rinsed out very easily and left my hair very soft and super moisturized. My curls are very shiny,fluffy, nicely clumped, moisturized, and more defined.</li>
            <li> This is such a great conditioner!  For being shea butter, I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly, but it definitely does.  I have long, baby fine hair that has been bleached, colored, and pretty much over processed.  I didn&#x27;t feel that this weighed it down at all.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and glides on smoothly. My hair still feels moisturized after rinsing and I don&#x27;t feel the need to add additional leave in conditioners like I do with some other products.</li>
            <li> Love Natural Shea Butter Conditioner the best part of this conditioner is it stood thick and rich in my hair and did not become watery after i put the shower cap on and set under the dryer. My hair felt amazing after I styled it.  I will make this conditioner part of my hair care products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it. Best conditioner I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  It works great for detangling my hair. My only complaint is the bottle is a bit small and with my type of hAir I need to use quite bit more conditioner.</li>
            <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for all hair types. This doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell but it is very moisturizing and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> leaves the hair soft and tangle free love it!</li>
            <li> Great product... Leaves your happy nice and silky smooth..  Will def buy again</li>
            <li> I been using this product for like 2 months now since I bought it for the first time.  You will love this product it is none sticky to your hands after you apply it to your hands compare to different products!  The best part is it really makes shiny to your hair and give it a nice black shiny look. And it doesn&#x27;t have a smells all naturals. The way it cames is just perfect!</li>
            <li> Made my baby fine hair too limp!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! For weeks and weeks I had severely itchy scalp and nothing would help it. I got this product just because I like shea butter, not thinking anything of the itching. Lo and behold, after using this for a week or so, I realized the itching had almost completely disappeared. This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This is an all organic conditioner that is great for all kinds of hair. It makes your hair soft and helps with those frizzies. Loving this.</li>
            <li> Got the item today and it was leaking when I pulled it out from the brown envelope. Got a towel and wiped around the neck of the bottle. Then, I noticed a fishy smell. Turns out, it&#x27;s the actual conditioner that smells fishy. When I unscrew the cap, the bottle has been tampered and that&#x27;s why it was leaking all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll definitely return it. Tampered bottle and a smell is not a good indication that it will be safe to use. I will be contacting the seller too to have it replaced. I&#x27;m sure the product would be good and I really want to try it. However, not with a tampered bottle with a smell. The one I got must a bad batch or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just added pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 4/25: The tampered one got picked up by Amazon and they just delivered me another bottle. Great customer service from the seller and Amazon.*****</li>
            <li> Feels more like a body lotion than conditioner.</li>
            <li> My pricey Aveda conditioner was about gone when I got the opportunity to try this Shea Butter conditioner. I have long thick hair that is also colored, so moisturization is at the top on my list when looking for a conditioner. I thought this would fit the bill. I was surprised after my first use (keep in mind I used plenty of product and left in my hair a good 10 minutes) my hair actually felt more dried out and tangled. It was a struggle to get my hairbrush through my hair. I have tried 2 other times thinking it would be better and it has not. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair is colored, but this leaves it dry and fly-away.  won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It&#x27;s a great product and worth buying again!</li>
            <li> Love my hair is never better</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok. dont think i will be buying this again</li>
            <li> This is not as moisturizing as I expected. It also has a scent to it. It didn&#x27;t bother me but I would not call this fragrance free. I do have MCS and allergies etc. so I am very in tune with fragrance free products.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Not too heavy or greasy like other hair conditioners that leave residue and weigh your hair down. I use it on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great on my daughter&#x27;s curly long hair and makes brushing her hair and getting the knots out much easier.</li>
            <li> great for dry hair, especially on the ends.  Rinses out easy and also helps frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have dry damage hair that is always breaking this conditioner has helped my hair a lot. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and it has strengthen my hair so my hair doesn&#x27;t break as much as it use to my hair also looks nourished and so much healthier my hair also doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as it use to. After I apply this conditioner my hair is knot free and feels really soft it also adds volume and it shapes my curls they are bouncy and more manageable. I would definitely recommend this conditioner to those with curly hair, I&#x27;m pretty sure that this conditioner will also work great for those with wavy or straight hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  I have curly hair that is often dry, and I&#x27;ve been very unhappy with the last conditioner I picked up. I was glad to find this replacement--and my hair is much happier for it!</li>
            <li> I received this discounted item for product testing. My number one problem with my hair is hairfall. I cannot stand to see my hair all over the house. Thanks to Shea Butter conditioner, It helps to lessen my hairfall, ill continue using it as my regular conditioner, What i love most to this product is that it&#x27;s all natural. I have been using it for more than 2 weeks and I am happier now with my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very sensitive to new products so the first couple times I tried this I was not to pleased. It left my hair heavy and dry. But after a few more times it has made a nice difference. It&#x27;s not my every day conditioner but I do use it on the weekends to mix things up a bit.</li>
            <li> This was such a pleasant surprise! A great daily conditioner. I have dry, very curly hair and this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> My daughter has crazy curly hair and this does not quite work for us.</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, and it smells amazing! It is so hard to find good organic products that actually work for my skin and hair. Shea Butter is natural and I feel very comfortable while using it!</li>
            <li> Works well enough.  Scentless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase n with the product it&#x27;s a great conditioner for my hair</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I love the fact that it is natural I hate using chemicals in my hair and am trying to go all natural. My hair has been color treated for many years in the past it&#x27;s been a while since I colored it but it still has that slight brittle feeling but not after using this conditioner. My hair is no longer brittle. It is nice and soft. My hair now has a beautiful healthy shine. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent which I like my hair to have a nice smell to it so I do add a few drops of essential oil but my husband who also uses it on his curly thinning hair says he enjoys it unscented so he doesn&#x27;t have a girly scent. We like it and it&#x27;s well worth the price! I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
