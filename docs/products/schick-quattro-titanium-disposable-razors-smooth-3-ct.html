            <li>Otherwise this model has proven to be the best disposable, multi-blade razor that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best razor ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor in the Market</li>
            <li>I use shave oil and that may help but I was still impressed and will buy them again.</li>
            <li>Schick makes a very good razor.</li>
            <li>Very good blade quality, lubrication, ergonomics, and durability.  </li>
            <li>Very good razor.  </li>
            <li>The Quattro razor is superior to any disposable razor I have ever shaved with.</li>
            <li>To me they are superior in every respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These razors are a good bargain, a good razor, and I shop around to get the best price on Amazon, this time it was Schick, next?.....</li>
            <li>Very good and fast ,thank you</li>
            <li>Best razors ever, the small metal guard wires work great</li>
            <li>something better comes along.</li>
            <li>The free sample was amazing</li>
            <li>razor works a lot better with a gel type cream than foam, but does not work well at all with shaving soap and a brush.</li>
            <li>I get these for my husband they are his favorite razors, they shave close and don&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>They work nicely, don&#x27;t resharpen perfectly using the denim method, possibly due to the wires over the blades, but it does work somewhat.</li>
            <li>They were nothing like the free sample.</li>
            <li>It glided smoothly with or against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it lasted well and gave great shaves every time.</li>
            <li>, it still produces a smooth clean feel.</li>
            <li>Of course, all but the most cheaply manufactured razors can do their job the first time, I tend to gauge quality by consistency and the disposable Quattro gets the results I like to see and feel.  </li>

            <li>The reverse side trimmer blade is excellent for shaving hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but for those of us with the combination of tough beards and sensitive skin, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>About as good as it gets for a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>Overall, though, a really good wet-dry electric will provide the closest, face-saving shave.</li>
            <li>My Husband really likes these fine razors for his face.</li>
            <li>I cannot say much for trimmer blade - if I ever use it, it&#x27;s mostly to maintain my sideburns or shave under my nose but could easily do that with using the general shaving area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>(it becomes more apparent over time).</li>
            <li>(I suppose that is my tolerance for discomfort or pain) and up the last shave, it still produces a smooth clean feel.</li>

            <li>These are my favorite razors and the only ones I have used for years now.</li>
            <li>I was surprised-for some reason they worked even better than the regular blade/handle combination.</li>
            <li>The male reader might be able imagine what that is like and how a razor has a tendency to pull skin when you are trying to shave off three or four days stubble.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00AGEW0AI Gillette Fusion]], it was the first to irritate my skin</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00AGEW0AI Gillette Fusion]], it was the first to irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first one.</li>
            <li>As a Mexican-American male (or maybe it is just the genetics of my family) with healthy skin, I can grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li>Great product, last twice as other brands</li>
            <li>Based on overall performance this razor easily earns a five star rating.</li>

            <li>but the Quattro really stood out from all them.</li>
            <li>and I never really felt confident about handling it, which is compounded by handling the razor contrary to its ergonomic design (which is maybe contributed to why I felt the skin irritation).</li>

            <li>/&gt;It was not much more effective than shaving with a pocket knife.  </li>
            <li>A decent price and no shipping charges made the decision to buy a no brainer.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, the Schick Quattro is great razor for the average man and should be of consideration for woman - apart from the careful repackaging, is there really a difference?  </li>

            <li>these take a strong stream of water to clean, which is the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t dull easily IMO.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Mach 3, these are: (1) not nearly as smooth a shave, (2) wear out/dull much more quickly, and (3) CLOG and will not come clean.</li>
            <li>I shave regularly but not everyday.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head ensures complete skin contact to all but the strangest ways you can hold it and its open cartridge design rinses out well if it can make my stubble disappear from between the blades.  </li>

            <li> Note that if you are a wet shaver who is looking for a travel razor or an occasional multi-blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Typically one razor will last 3-4 weeks.</li>

            <li> One will last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I thought that a little odd, but the shave left my face the smoothest it had been since I can remember, and with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I am not much for brand loyalty but after going through six of these razors, I am seriously considering sticking to the Quattro series for as long as Schick will make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After going though my set of Quattro razors, I noticed less razor burn in both frequency and severity and any bleeding has almost been eliminated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, there was a little learning curve.</li>
            <li> The schick quattro razors are my fave and not readily available....</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure what is happening -</li>
            <li> I absolutely would never buy these again nor what I recommend these to anybody they happen to be the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life</li>
            <li> hard to beat the price</li>
            <li> Well I have to say I am disappointed in this razor I had high hopes for it</li>
            <li> I have no doubt the wires prevent the blades from cutting deeper into the skin, cutting larger areas of skin, (or stop skin from being drawn into the blades as they dull), resulting in dramatically reduced razor burn and similar skin</li>
            <li> All points combined: pretty awful.</li>
            <li> Usually I hate disposable razors-they have never matched up to the handle and disposable blades.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re terrible.</li>
            <li> This is arguably the worst razor I have used in years.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Schick makes a very good razor. I highly recommend them, Probably will continue using the Quatro&lt;br /&gt;until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> These razors are great and last a long time also.</li>
            <li> Schick always produces a quality product. The price on Amazon was less than at the local WalMart so I bought it here.</li>
            <li> Ouch! I bought these because I got a sample Quattro in a package of razors I purchased. Well long story short. The free sample was amazing but when purchasing a three pack of these razors? They were nothing like the free sample. They&#x27;re terrible. When using a new one for the first time it&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s already been used and about time to discard. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors and the only ones I have used for years now. Close shave, mustache hair trimmer, and almost never nicks.</li>
            <li> The schick quattro razors are my fave and not readily available....hard to beat the price</li>
            <li> The Quattro razor is superior to any disposable razor I have ever shaved with. Typically one razor will last 3-4 weeks. The reverse side trimmer blade is excellent for shaving hard to reach areas. Based on overall performance this razor easily earns a five star rating.</li>
            <li> This is arguably the worst razor I have used in years. My basis for comparison for the following is the Mach 3 (either the disposable variety or not; they are comparable). Compared to the Mach 3, these are: (1) not nearly as smooth a shave, (2) wear out/dull much more quickly, and (3) CLOG and will not come clean. That last point is not a multiblade razor issue in general, in my experience... it is specific to these. All points combined: pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I normally wet shave with shaving soap and an old school safety razor, but when I am in a hurry (or lazy) I use multi-blade disposables. When I ran out of Mach 3s a week ago I grabbed a pack of these on sale locally on a whim. To me they are superior in every respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there was a little learning curve. For some reason when I was doing my first shave with these there was a little resistance going with the grain, but not against. I thought that a little odd, but the shave left my face the smoothest it had been since I can remember, and with no razor burn. Apparently the razors need breaking in because subsequent use did not have the resistance problem. It glided smoothly with or against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works a lot better with a gel type cream than foam, but does not work well at all with shaving soap and a brush. Note that if you are a wet shaver who is looking for a travel razor or an occasional multi-blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note: these take a strong stream of water to clean, which is the only complaint I have. Otherwise this model has proven to be the best disposable, multi-blade razor that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very good and fast ,thank you</li>
            <li> Best razor ever. One will last me a few months. They don&#x27;t dull easily IMO. I have thick hair and sensitive skin and these are the gentlest I have ever used. I hope they never change this product.</li>
            <li> I get these for my husband they are his favorite razors, they shave close and don&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor in the Market and they last a lot.Highly recommended.I wished  it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> Best razors ever, the small metal guard wires work great</li>
            <li> About as good as it gets for a traditional razor.  Very good blade quality, lubrication, ergonomics, and durability.  Schick&#x27;s protective wire system helps keep the blades from digging in too much.  Nothing&#x27;s perfect, but for those of us with the combination of tough beards and sensitive skin, this is a good choice.  Overall, though, a really good wet-dry electric will provide the closest, face-saving shave.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say I am disappointed in this razor I had high hopes for it but  I absolutely would never buy these again nor what I recommend these to anybody they happen to be the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life</li>

            <li> These were on sale at my local grocery store - buy one get one free (so 6 razors for 8 bucks).  So I gave them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not much more effective than shaving with a pocket knife.  4 or 5 strokes, from different directions, needed to shave one spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and frustration.  These are horrible.</li>
            <li> I forgot my Schick Quattro handle on a recent trip and bought these as a substitute. Usually I hate disposable razors-they have never matched up to the handle and disposable blades. I really didn&#x27;t want another handle and when considering the price it was much cheaper. I was surprised-for some reason they worked even better than the regular blade/handle combination. Overall it lasted well and gave great shaves every time. I use shave oil and that may help but I was still impressed and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> My Husband really likes these fine razors for his face. The blades are sharp and last a good while.</li>
            <li> These razors are a good bargain, a good razor, and I shop around to get the best price on Amazon, this time it was Schick, next?.....</li>
            <li> I bought one of these disposable razors on impulse when I found a two-for-one coupon in the local Sunday paper. I am not much for brand loyalty but after going through six of these razors, I am seriously considering sticking to the Quattro series for as long as Schick will make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Quattro is another entry of multi-bladed razor for men and [[ASIN:B0007OES3O women]] that sets itself apart with a five blade design - four blades for large area shaving and one that is a trimmer of sorts for the small and specific areas like under the nose or maintaining sideburns.  While this is nothing new, Schick further distinguishes its Quattro line by incorporating tiny wires spaced every 5mm (approx. 3/16th of an inch) of the 3.6mm (1 7/16th Inch) of the blades.  I am not exactly sure what is happening - I have no doubt the wires prevent the blades from cutting deeper into the skin, cutting larger areas of skin, (or stop skin from being drawn into the blades as they dull), resulting in dramatically reduced razor burn and similar skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through razor designs that range from the two to five blades but the Quattro really stood out from all them. As a Mexican-American male (or maybe it is just the genetics of my family) with healthy skin, I can grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  I shave regularly but not everyday. The male reader might be able imagine what that is like and how a razor has a tendency to pull skin when you are trying to shave off three or four days stubble.  When I shave, I go with and against the grain so I shave an area almost four ways which can lead to some bleeding and razor burn (it becomes more apparent over time). After going though my set of Quattro razors, I noticed less razor burn in both frequency and severity and any bleeding has almost been eliminated.  The razor tends to last about two or three months (I suppose that is my tolerance for discomfort or pain) and up the last shave, it still produces a smooth clean feel. The pivoting head ensures complete skin contact to all but the strangest ways you can hold it and its open cartridge design rinses out well if it can make my stubble disappear from between the blades.  I cannot say much for trimmer blade - if I ever use it, it&#x27;s mostly to maintain my sideburns or shave under my nose but could easily do that with using the general shaving area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the Schick Quattro is great razor for the average man and should be of consideration for woman - apart from the careful repackaging, is there really a difference?  Of course, all but the most cheaply manufactured razors can do their job the first time, I tend to gauge quality by consistency and the disposable Quattro gets the results I like to see and feel.  About the only flaw is the trimmer blade - on both this and [[ASIN:B00AGEW0AI Gillette Fusion]], it was the first to irritate my skin and I never really felt confident about handling it, which is compounded by handling the razor contrary to its ergonomic design (which is maybe contributed to why I felt the skin irritation). Nevertheless, I like the Quattro and I think it presents the latest lasting change in personal shaving since the introduction of the [[ASIN:B0090U8T0O Gillette Mach 3]].y tolerance for discomfort or pain) and up the last shave, it still produces a smooth clean feel.

            <li> Great product, last twice as other brands</li>
            <li> They work nicely, don&#x27;t resharpen perfectly using the denim method, possibly due to the wires over the blades, but it does work somewhat. I&#x27;m still on my first one.</li>
            <li> Arrived as displayed...no issues</li>
