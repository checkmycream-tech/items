            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it and I don&#x27;t love it. Lasts a long time. Not too strong which is good for an office environment.</li>

            <li> I get more compliments on this fragrance every time I wear it! It has now become my &amp;#34;signature scent!&amp;#34;  Love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this without smelling it.  When Michael Strahan commented about it when Sophia was on the show, I thought I would trust his judgement.  I love it.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume. I fell in love with the scent. I receive compliment all the time. Every women should own this bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not what I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s way too sweet and the scent is not long lasting.  I should have tested it at a store before I spent the $50.00 on this order.</li>

            <li> what a delicious scent.  Spicy but not too powerful.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Got this set for Christmas. Because I&#x27;m curious and she&#x27;s my favorite actress&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with the scent! It&#x27;s not overly strong &amp; stinky like that high priced crap at Dillards.&lt;br /&gt;This has a fruity &amp; lightly floral scent to it. Can&#x27;t believe it last long all day &amp; night.&lt;br /&gt;I only sprayed it on my arms &amp; chest and I can still smell it on me once I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is just as good as the perfume! Also it&#x27;s shimmery.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that&#x27;s lasts longer &amp; that is not strong. I suggest you pick this one up. I&#x27;m getting a bigger bottle since they&#x27;re selling like hot cakes.</li>
            <li> My MOM loves the smell.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I have ever received compliments on! I finally found my signature perfume that I love that is not overpowering! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.üëç</li>
