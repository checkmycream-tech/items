    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great for my beach wave look.</li>
            <li>I know this won&#x27;t be the best product for everybody</li>
            <li>My hair feels wonderful</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great as an alternative to [[ASIN:B00CMLJGI2</li>
            <li>so when I am on the washer think that I am on a deserted island LOL</li>
            <li>It works great on my frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair was softer for it, but if you can count the hair loss from ripping it out trying to comb it as a good pay off then by all means...  </li>
            <li>A good thing.  </li>
            <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll see!no issues, then OGX is a good product line for you.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does smell good.</li>
            <li>I vary purchases between salon and drugstore shampoos in an effort to find superior products with good value.</li>
            <li>The smell is sooo good, its like coconut</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, lathers nicely, and my hair feels hydrated versus stripped when the shampoo is rinsed out.</li>
            <li>the kind that i have had every hair dresser</li>
            <li>and therefore you end up using a huge amount just to get a good lather.  </li>
            <li>While it may indeed do that, I was barely able to comb my hair out after washing it.  </li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve had over an inch of my hair cut off, I&#x27;ll soon be getting more cut since I still have so many split ends.</li>
            <li>but it works so much better</li>
            <li>However, if you have any damage, then SM is the better choice.  </li>
            <li>SM is a much better line than OGX.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have any damage, then SM is the better choice.  </li>
            <li>SM is a much better line than OGX.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>i would suggest using this shampoo and then the keratin conditioner or the vitamin E conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;ogx is my favorite brand because many of the shampoos are sulfate free which is nice for dyed hair.</li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo --</li>
            <li>Very rich and moisturizing</li>
            <li>I am able to easily rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found all the products I&#x27;ve tried from the OGX product line to be very good, and this Kukui Oil Shampoo is no different.</li>
            <li>Many sulfate free shampoos don&#x27;t lather well</li>
            <li>A much better sulfate free brand is Shea Moisture, which contains no silicone or paraben and is cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>They keep my hair supple, strong and silky.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal hair with no issues, then OGX is a good product line for you.  </li>
            <li>shampoo goes on easily and comes to a quick, full lather...one of the things that I love most about OGX shampoos.  </li>
            <li>have fine, curly hair...</li>
            <li>a LOT of fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I have EXTREMELY fine blond hair.</li>
            <li>And anyone with fine hair knows what a pain knots are.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and have to use a sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>100% frizz free</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>My hair is SUPER shiny and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>everyday is a good hair day!</li>
            <li>It removes all traces of styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it smells really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that is sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair light and bouncy and really shiny.  </li>
            <li>Gradually over time ,the more I used this shampoo the more my hair deteriorated and became tangled, frizzy and devoid of shine.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo so far.  </li>
            <li>it made my hair really soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I brought this really hoping i&#x27;d love this brand and would have found my new go to brand.</li>
            <li>It does preserve my color and it smells great and is very thick and rich, which I like.  </li>
            <li>the Tahitian Noni formula and both keep my hair healthy looking despite regular coloring and heat styling.  </li>
            <li>but it really has made a difference for me!</li>
            <li>i would really recommend giving this shampoo a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other OGX shampoos and conditioners and have liked all of them except this one.  </li>
            <li>the kind that i can&#x27;t even wash it two days in a row without it becoming a tangly coarse mess.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this, because it was safe for color treated hair, and I had read reviews showing that it worked well for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>ok so i have dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned so much from using this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply a basic sulfate free formula.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo (and conditioner) have absolutely changed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was even able to comb it wet without leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Well, I used to really like this brand.</li>
            <li>Everytime I  use their shampoos, my hair gets more knotted and harder to brush.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I rinse</li>
            <li>I am so annoyed by this shampoo (that promises, quote :- &amp;#34;to make every day a *good hair* day&amp;#34;) that I have devoted my time to write this review ;something quite out of character for me.</li>
            <li>I live in a VERY humid area and my hair has been all but unmanageable until now.  </li>
            <li>i love this shampoo and have not had any of the problems of the previous poster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t be trying this particular product again</li>
            <li>but OGX found another .the theory is the more expensive it is the better &amp;#34;yea right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It may cost a little more that the brands I used to use (Herbal Essences, Garnier Fructise, etc)</li>
            <li>Rich texture - works well on my dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I normally use WEN.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally (</li>
            <li>People with fine hair should use it sparingly and avoid adding other oils to their hair until they know how this one affects their hairstyle.</li>
            <li>The other OGX products have worked ok in the past but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and actually calmed the frizz and made it seem hydrated right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent years getting my hair long and healthy and can&#x27;t believe that one shampoo with this product could do so much damage.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very soft but not.</li>
            <li>At first the results were pleasing although I was concerned at the residue left in my hair.</li>
            <li>I tend to  alternate between letting it style itself, which I call my &#x27;wild and free&#x27; days, and flat ironing it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes our hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just getting the wrong ones, or they changed the product, but I&#x27;m not as impressed as I used to be.</li>
            <li>and good for your hair in general because it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy fake &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34</li>
            <li>product is very useful to me during periods of high humidity as the kukui oil hydrates and slightly weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>They simply clean the hair and leave a heavy silicone coating, which certainly weighs the hair down to some degree.  </li>
            <li>The treatment ingredients in SM formulas actually do resolve dryness and damage and completely eliminate frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have thick waist length hair and it turns it from a frizzy mess to gentle soft waves that are not heavy or oily but wonderfully fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I actually apply a dime size of the curl cream to my ends and whats left to the rest of my hair and blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>Since there is such a wide disparity of reviews and since kukui oil is supposed to be so good for your hair and skin, I&#x27;m wondering if something went wrong in the manufacturing process.  </li>

            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed the past few ones I&#x27;ve tried, have kind of dried out my hair a bit.</li>
            <li> More disturbingly my hair was both dry and yet somehow sticky at the same time.</li>
            <li> you have coarse dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and I need moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair and even conditioning shampoos make it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> hair is so dry you need moisturizing hair shampoo to fix this&amp;#34; even though i had been using every single hair product i could and has just settled into thinking</li>
            <li> It rinses well, but it does leave the hair slightly weighed down, albeit soft.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair and this shampoo works wonders.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and thin about a 2c and my daughter&#x27;s hair is 3b, we both suffer from dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> In my semi-educated opinion, if you are combing your hair wet then you are just begging for breakage.  </li>
            <li> So lathering is a minimal needs</li>
            <li> My naturally wavy hair is now a curious combination of lank and stringy with oddly buoyant tufts and I am so mortified by my appearance that I feel uncomfortable visiting my local store to buy milk without an enormous hat.</li>
            <li> Once I rinse it out I slick just a pea-sized amount back over my hair for a bit of added condition and leave it in.</li>
            <li> Over a three week period my hair now looks as if I have been partying hard for several days and nights without sleeping or washing which is not the look I hoped to achieve and in no way represents my life style.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and can be purchased at walmart, the down size of this is the size.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a bit pricier than typical drugstore hair care lines.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dull and appears dry in appearance.</li>
            <li> just wish the scent was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I let the conditioner sit in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY wet.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months and now it is time to repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is significantly worse after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I mean, my hair does feel softer, but it is somehow drying it out where us harder to brush.</li>

            <li> This may well be the worst shampoo I have ever used. At first the results were pleasing although I was concerned at the residue left in my hair. Gradually over time ,the more I used this shampoo the more my hair deteriorated and became tangled, frizzy and devoid of shine. More disturbingly my hair was both dry and yet somehow sticky at the same time.Over a three week period my hair now looks as if I have been partying hard for several days and nights without sleeping or washing which is not the look I hoped to achieve and in no way represents my life style. My naturally wavy hair is now a curious combination of lank and stringy with oddly buoyant tufts and I am so mortified by my appearance that I feel uncomfortable visiting my local store to buy milk without an enormous hat. If I comb or brush my hair the taming effect last for nano seconds...any movement, even simply breathing or stepping away from the mirror causes my hair to revert back to a state that I imagined could only be achieved by pushing my head into a shrub waving it about,tangling it in the twigs and exiting at an obscure angle...however I achieved this look simply by washing my hair with Kuku oil shampoo. As you may have gathered I am not happy .In fact I am so annoyed by this shampoo (that promises, quote :- &amp;#34;to make every day a *good hair* day&amp;#34;) that I have devoted my time to write this review ;something quite out of character for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. My hair got so hard. Also after using it had dandruff. It damage lot. I would definitely not recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I normally use WEN. I have dry hair and even conditioning shampoos make it dry and brittle. I havent noticed that when I use this. Ill always use WEN but Id use this alternately.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this, because it was safe for color treated hair, and I had read reviews showing that it worked well for dry scalp.  While it may indeed do that, I was barely able to comb my hair out after washing it.  I used both the conditioner and a spray in conditioner and it was very difficult.  My hair was softer for it, but if you can count the hair loss from ripping it out trying to comb it as a good pay off then by all means...  But I won&#x27;t be trying this particular product again</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo ever. I brought this really hoping i&#x27;d love this brand and would have found my new go to brand. After 2 washes my hair started falling out and my scalp itched like CRAZY. My hair has thinned so much from using this. I&#x27;m praying that i can reverse this damage and regain the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo and have not had any of the problems of the previous poster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, curly hair...a LOT of fine curly hair.  My hair is also color-treated.  I am also a daily shampoo&#x27;er.  Yes, I know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;...but my hair is doing just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo goes on easily and comes to a quick, full lather...one of the things that I love most about OGX shampoos.  I am able to easily rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow with  the Kukui oil conditioner.  I let the conditioner sit in for a few minutes.  Once I rinse it out I slick just a pea-sized amount back over my hair for a bit of added condition and leave it in. My hair is SUPER shiny and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit this....I do not comb my hair.  ESPECIALLY wet.  In my semi-educated opinion, if you are combing your hair wet then you are just begging for breakage.  I finger comb and work my products through with my hands.  I have zero problems with breakage.  Zip.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a negative 5 rating, I would.  I&#x27;ve spent years getting my hair long and healthy and can&#x27;t believe that one shampoo with this product could do so much damage.  Since there is such a wide disparity of reviews and since kukui oil is supposed to be so good for your hair and skin, I&#x27;m wondering if something went wrong in the manufacturing process.  I&#x27;ve tried other OGX shampoos and conditioners and have liked all of them except this one.  Even though I&#x27;ve had over an inch of my hair cut off, I&#x27;ll soon be getting more cut since I still have so many split ends.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair and this shampoo works wonders.  It may cost a little more that the brands I used to use (Herbal Essences, Garnier Fructise, etc) but it works so much better and it is thicker, so I don&#x27;t have to use as much. It&#x27;s especially great for my beach wave look.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and have to use a sulfate free shampoo.  My hair is very long and I need moisturizing ingredients.  This shampoo cleanses well but it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all for frizz.  It&#x27;s simply a basic sulfate free formula.  It does preserve my color and it smells great and is very thick and rich, which I like.  Many sulfate free shampoos don&#x27;t lather well and therefore you end up using a huge amount just to get a good lather.  This shampoo lathers well and I don&#x27;t need a ton of it.  A good thing.  However, the oil in the formula doesn&#x27;t really moisturize because the silicone coats the hair shaft, making it impossible for the oil to penetrate.  OGX shampoos, regardless of the formula, are silicone heavy and therefore don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; dryness or damage. They simply clean the hair and leave a heavy silicone coating, which certainly weighs the hair down to some degree.  A much better sulfate free brand is Shea Moisture, which contains no silicone or paraben and is cruelty free.  The treatment ingredients in SM formulas actually do resolve dryness and damage and completely eliminate frizz.  I use both the Manuka Honey formula (only at Target) and the Tahitian Noni formula and both keep my hair healthy looking despite regular coloring and heat styling.  I also use the SM masks, namely the Manuka Honey and the 10 in 1 Renewal formulas, for 45 minutes with a heat cap once a week or so.  They keep my hair supple, strong and silky.  SM is still a drugstore product line (at Walgreens, CVS, Ulta, Target and Sally&#x27;s) although it&#x27;s a bit pricier than typical drugstore hair care lines.  However, it&#x27;s well worth the price.  One of my favorite SM shampoos is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying formula that is sulfate free and safe for color treated hair.  It removes all traces of styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar and it smells really clean and fresh.  It leaves my hair light and bouncy and really shiny.  If you have normal hair with no issues, then OGX is a good product line for you.  However, if you have any damage, then SM is the better choice.  I switched to SM about a year ago and have never been happier.  My hubby uses the Hibiscus formula for his coarse, curly hair and he loves it.  SM is a much better line than OGX.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see!no issues, then OGX is a good product line for you.  However, if you have any damage, then SM is the better choice.

            <li> Very rich and moisturizing</li>
            <li> I use this on me and my daughter&#x27;s hair african american hair. My hair is straight and thin about a 2c and my daughter&#x27;s hair is 3b, we both suffer from dry frizzy hair. I have used multiple sulfate-free shampoos and this is one of my favorites. It is affordable and can be purchased at walmart, the down size of this is the size. I wish they would make a larger jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes our hair soft and manageable. I have used it for a few months and now it is time to repurchase. I will repurchase this and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo (and conditioner) have absolutely changed my hair.  I never thought it would be possible!  I live in a VERY humid area and my hair has been all but unmanageable until now.  The other OGX products have worked ok in the past but this is by far my favorite.  I have thick waist length hair and it turns it from a frizzy mess to gentle soft waves that are not heavy or oily but wonderfully fresh feeling.  I know this won&#x27;t be the best product for everybody but it really has made a difference for me!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, bleached hair. After I bleached this last time, my hair was dying for moisture so I picked this up on a whim in the drug store. My hair is normally (even when not color treated) very hard to comb when wet, I have to use spray in conditioner. I used this shampoo along with ogx biotin &amp; collagen conditiner and it feels amazing! I was even able to comb it wet without leave in conditioner. This combo rocks!</li>
            <li> Hundreds of shampoo&#x27;s on market what makes this different &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; marketing techniques surround packaging .looks different . So lathering is a minimal needs a lot dispensed to get to that point .oils used is another gimmick ,they are running out of types of oils in the Industry but OGX found another .the theory is the more expensive it is the better &amp;#34;yea right&amp;#34; like Paul Mitchell another gimmick but  market advertising&lt;br /&gt;Works .Believe it or not  VO5, White Rain. Are comparable .and 1/5 the price</li>
            <li> Well, I used to really like this brand. Especially the coconut and the Ginger one. However, I&#x27;ve noticed the past few ones I&#x27;ve tried, have kind of dried out my hair a bit. Everytime I  use their shampoos, my hair gets more knotted and harder to brush. However, I have EXTREMELY fine blond hair. It&#x27;s so thin, that I can&#x27;t really straighten it without worrying about damaging it bad. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just getting the wrong ones, or they changed the product, but I&#x27;m not as impressed as I used to be. I mean, my hair does feel softer, but it is somehow drying it out where us harder to brush. And anyone with fine hair knows what a pain knots are. On the plus side, it does smell good. And it just may not be for me, but could work on you hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo so far.  I also use their conditioner and Curl cream.  I actually apply a dime size of the curl cream to my ends and whats left to the rest of my hair and blow dry it straight. I have received a lot of compliments about the shine in my hair and it helps keep the frizz away on humid days.</li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderful</li>
            <li> Rich texture - works well on my dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had with any shampoo. I vary purchases between salon and drugstore shampoos in an effort to find superior products with good value. There was nothing of value in this shampoo. My hair is significantly worse after only two weeks. Sticky residue no matter how much I rinse. My hair is dull and appears dry in appearance. I&#x27;ve switched to a salon cleansing shampoo and high end restorative conditioner in the hopes of correcting what&#x27;s gone very wrong. I have my hair regularly colored with my stylist and may need additional treatments. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, kinky head of hair.  So far so good.  My hair is very soft but not. 100% frizz free lol.  Love this product just wish the scent was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found all the products I&#x27;ve tried from the OGX product line to be very good, and this Kukui Oil Shampoo is no different. Pleasant scent, lathers nicely, and my hair feels hydrated versus stripped when the shampoo is rinsed out. Having it be sulfate-free is just a bonus, but it&#x27;s not why I bought this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My forty-something hair is about 40% gray and I color it. It&#x27;s also very thick and curly, with a semi-course texture. I tend to  alternate between letting it style itself, which I call my &#x27;wild and free&#x27; days, and flat ironing it. I tend to alternate hair products too, as the health of my hair (hormone issues have an affect on my hair)  and weather changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very useful to me during periods of high humidity as the kukui oil hydrates and slightly weighs down my hair. It&#x27;s also great as an alternative to [[ASIN:B00CMLJGI2 OGX  Shampoo, Hydrating Macadamia Oil, 13oz]], which I use on days when I don&#x27;t want or need the additional oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to others with unruly hair who need to manage frizz. It rinses well, but it does leave the hair slightly weighed down, albeit soft. People with fine hair should use it sparingly and avoid adding other oils to their hair until they know how this one affects their hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The smell is sooo good, its like coconut so when I am on the washer think that I am on a deserted island LOL</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It works great on my frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> ok so i have dry frizzy hair. the kind that i can&#x27;t even wash it two days in a row without it becoming a tangly coarse mess. the kind that i have had every hair dresser i go to say &amp;#34;your hair is so dry you need moisturizing hair shampoo to fix this&amp;#34; even though i had been using every single hair product i could and has just settled into thinking this was just my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this hair product literally changed my life. i could tell from day one i used it that it was different. it made my hair really soft and smooth! and actually calmed the frizz and made it seem hydrated right out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is that the conditioner kinda has a smokey nut smell, and if you don&#x27;t use a brush in the shower it makes it tangled? i would suggest using this shampoo and then the keratin conditioner or the vitamin E conditioner with it.&lt;br /&gt;ogx is my favorite brand because many of the shampoos are sulfate free which is nice for dyed hair. and good for your hair in general because it doesn&#x27;t have that greasy fake &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have coarse dry hair i would really recommend giving this shampoo a try!</li>
            <li> everyday is a good hair day!</li>
