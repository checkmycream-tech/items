            <li>Has a fragrance, but I find it pleasant.</li>
            <li>Loved it from the moment I got it.</li>
            <li>As with all Clarins products, quality is superior.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and I woke up in the morning with more radiant skin :)</li>
            <li>Just wish it&#x27; be more of a moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>but I love these products of CLARINS</li>
            <li>Love this cream, I buy it all the time, makes my skin glow and look rested in the morning.</li>
            <li>It is to strong for me.</li>
            <li>On the rest of my skin it works fine and truly seems to improve fine wrinkles and make pores appear finer.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was just what my wife was hoping for, at a better price.</li>
            <li>but this is a fabulous moisturizer that is definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more refreshed and soft in the morning</li>
            <li>The delivery was right on time, and the price was convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating without feeling greasy</li>
            <li>Quit fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that this may exacerbate it, however it kind of bypasses the acne issue and hydrates and plumps my face without affecting the oil overproduction negatively.</li>
            <li>All says its a high class product (inside and outside the container).</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  My skin feels more refreshed and soft in the morning and I feel that it has evened out my skin tone.</li>

            <li> Personally I did not like the smell. It is to strong for me. but I love these products of CLARINS I just made a mistake choosing the cream I like. One of them has no smell.</li>
            <li> Great castumer service hight recommended</li>
            <li> My wife says that it is a perfect night cream for winter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clarins for over 20 years. The fragrance drew me to the product at the start, but my skin kept me there. I tried other &amp;#34;good quality&amp;#34; brands and keep coming back to Clarins. Always purchased at the department store before but I my work schedule made the trip impossible. Amazon made it convenient to but it online.</li>
            <li> Although just using it for a few days I already see some results. Really like and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have recently attained a horrible adult hormone related acne problem. I was concerned that this may exacerbate it, however it kind of bypasses the acne issue and hydrates and plumps my face without affecting the oil overproduction negatively. so thumbs up</li>
            <li> fast shipping. great product</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was just what my wife was hoping for, at a better price. Words words words words words.</li>
            <li> As with all Clarins products, quality is superior. The delivery was right on time, and the price was convenient. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this cream, I buy it all the time, makes my skin glow and look rested in the morning.</li>
