            <li>It worked great</li>
            <li>great quality.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Plus it really is great for eczema in myself and my kids.</li>
            <li>and this does a great job of not reacting with his skin and giving him a rash.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job doing what it&#x27;s made to do... keeping the sun off his skin.  </li>
            <li>California Baby sunscreen is great, I can get it rubbed in and on evenly.  </li>
            <li>For a squirming kid it is a very nice thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and am allergic to many fragrances and dyes.</li>
            <li>loved it, baby wasn&#x27;t bothered by it and he hasn&#x27;t been sunburned once.</li>
            <li>Use it for the beach mostly and it works great.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this sun block!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with great coverage.  </li>
            <li>Its great if you&#x27;re going to the beach or any place with strong sun rays.</li>
            <li>Effectively waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found that Amazon offered it in a 6 ounce tube as I had been buying the 2.9ounce tubes for some time.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it kills me every time I have to reorder this for my two kids.</li>
            <li>Natural, no fragrance, perfect!</li>
            <li>My family has been using this product for many years, mostly for my kids&#x27; outdoor sports activity.</li>
            <li>But I love how it protects them</li>
            <li>and I love the satisfaction of KNOWING what is in the product.</li>
            <li>However, she plays in the sun for hours on most days.  </li>
            <li>There are more and more chemicals making their way into all products, even ones for baby.</li>
            <li>As a result, I probably will not purchase any more California Baby products.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works well and gives me a piece of mind that we are using safe stuff.</li>
            <li>Love CA baby products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My kids don&#x27;t even get a suntan with this product I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Got to get the best for our only son :)</li>
            <li>I like that this sun screen does not contain chemicals, and I use it most of the time on both of my children, but if they will be swimming I have to use something else.  </li>
            <li>Safe son</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy we live where there are 4 seasons</li>
            <li>the California Baby products are great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s far safer than most of the sunscreens out there!</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t want to sound cheap by complaining about wasting liquid gold in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>I also like that is fragrance and chemical free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and has a good rating with the EWG.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice consistency, easy to apply, works fine, and leaves both my and baby&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and are willing to pay for a product that does what it is supposed to do well and is safe...</li>
            <li>Although priced on the higher end, their stuff is top of the line and never disappoints.</li>
            <li>so that was less of an issue, but she like my son is very fair.</li>
            <li>It does cost more then most but the quality is high and is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>California Baby SPF30 is the ONLY sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn my clothes bright orange.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it has minimal ingredients, works great to protect my baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s fair skin and blonde.</li>
            <li>Our baby has no bad reactions to it and appears to protect his skin well.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried other organic sunscreens and haven&#x27;t been happy.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my 4 year old and 2 year old...</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a must for me in summer, as I tend to sunburn quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back to buy more soon!</li>
            <li>The extra cost is worth the peace of mind knowing that we&#x27;re putting a safe sunscreen on our kids!</li>
            <li>For that, it was worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>this came right away.</li>
            <li>Makes my mature skin look great, soaks in readily so nothing left on surface of skin, yet protects if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun all day.  </li>
            <li>both with fair sensitive Asian skin.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a good rating from the Environmental Working Group as having less toxins.</li>
            <li>Not cheap and pasty white but does an excellent job of sun protection and stays on even in the ocean.</li>
            <li>Ranked very high on EWG 2011 sunscreen ranking too!</li>
            <li>It is very pricey!</li>
            <li>My wife is allergic to something in \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sunscreen and after many trials and errors, we finally found this product that she can use.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but you do need to reapply it regularly.</li>
            <li>I wish they had sow,thing higher than 30 SPF though.</li>
            <li>Protected our son in hot outer banks sun.....</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and am so spoiled by the lack of smelly chemicals in it that I could never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different sunscreen for my infant.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it seems to have a positive effect in hydrating my skin and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Love the concept of all natural, Love California Baby in general, we use many products from them...but just too thick for us.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, it is not coming off easily.</li>
            <li>Tip, I ordered a large tube and a travel size</li>
            <li>and I refill travel tube as need it, that way I dont have to carry a large tube everywhere.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for sending it</li>
            <li>I really needed it for my baby.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works really well and lasts well In and out of the water, along with being highlynrated for safety by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
            <li>tube is much handier than the 2.9 oz.</li>
            <li>We go to the water park a lot and using it before we go and once during lunch protects them the whole time we are there.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has never burned with it, I am very persistent with applying it too.</li>
            <li>My sons never have a reaction to their products like so many other baby products.</li>
            <li>My two years old has bumps coming out all over his face and neck in the evening of the first day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I should have known better--nonchemical sunscreens are typically heavy--so I didn&#x27;t complain to the manufacturer, but I did email them about my experience (per the instructions on their website) and asked if another of their products would be more suitable for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>but I do find that less is often more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high health ratings and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I like it very much as it has physical filter instead of chemical one and it works very well</li>
            <li>With two kids (2 and 4) who need to be coated in sunscreen from nose to toes everyday before they go to preschool, I was glad to find a fragrance-free sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain concerning chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Came highly recommended from a very health conscious friend who uses it or their young kids.</li>
            <li>When you put it on and you go in the water, you can see the water bead up on your skin like water beads on a newly waxed car.</li>
            <li>My kid has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than other sunscreens but is worth it for a safe natural product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not easily found in our local shops so ordering it on amazon is nice and conveinent.</li>
            <li>Leaves some white streaks but works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using long enough for detailed comments</li>
            <li>but we weren&#x27;t sure how it would stand up on the beach in SC with all the salt water, getting wet an dry all the time and so</li>
            <li>So, you may want to look into something else if you plan on using this at the beach or pool, otherwise, for everyday use it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Most of the have been so hard to get rubbed in, I end up leaving layers on her.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is the top rated for having the least toxins, which is why I bought it for my 18 month old.</li>
            <li>your kids have eczema or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is a very think sunscreen but it&#x27;ll last for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this since my six year old was a baby.  </li>
            <li>good product but expensive.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a little pricey, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 6 month old for a vacation in Key West.  </li>

            <li> But a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit on the expensive side, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, so I was very careful when trying sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves marks on clothing, car seats, car doors, etc.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other products that didn&#x27;t protect as well as this one.</li>

            <li> Was looking for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have a long list of questionable toxic chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> That said, it is very thick and paste-like and can be difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Looking for product that would not irritate my child, sorry....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My two years old has bumps coming out all over his face and neck in the evening of the first day I put this sunscreen on him. I do not know whether it can block the sun properly for I do not have a chance to find out.</li>
            <li> Use it for the beach mostly and it works great. Great ingredients and perfect for my baby&#x27;s skin. Tip, I ordered a large tube and a travel size and I refill travel tube as need it, that way I dont have to carry a large tube everywhere.</li>
            <li> I sent this to daycare for my daughter and they go outside almost every day. No burns yet and she&#x27;s fair skin and blonde.</li>
            <li> After reading EWG&#x27;s report of sunscreens, I sought out products with Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide, like this product.  Easy to apply with great coverage.  Effectively waterproof.  Goes on slightly white, but cancer-prevention isn&#x27;t a fashion show!</li>
            <li> My family has been using this product for many years, mostly for my kids&#x27; outdoor sports activity. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 4 year old and 2 year old... both with fair sensitive Asian skin.  Ranked very high on EWG 2011 sunscreen ranking too!</li>
            <li> This it one of the greatest baby sunscreens in existence! We knew it worked well from using it when we took our child to the pool in Ohio but we weren&#x27;t sure how it would stand up on the beach in SC with all the salt water, getting wet an dry all the time and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great. No burns and great coverage. I am not sure if this is an intended feature or not but when you put it on the baby it stays white so you can see what is covered and what was not. For a squirming kid it is a very nice thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside of this product is the cost. The stuff is like liquid gold. If you are like me and are willing to pay for a product that does what it is supposed to do well and is safe... then I will suggest that you pick some of this stuff up.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have a long list of questionable toxic chemicals in it. After lots of research I found this. My family has been using it for 2 years now and there have been no skin irritations. It does cost more then most but the quality is high and is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> California Baby SPF30 is the ONLY sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn my clothes bright orange. In addition, it seems to have a positive effect in hydrating my skin and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.  SRB</li>
            <li> We bought this sunscreen and loved it!  It is a little bit on the expensive side, but well worth the price. We went to the beach over the summer and used this, and when we got back my dad said he couldn&#x27;t even tell our son went to the beach</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 6 month old for a vacation in Key West.  It worked great, he didn&#x27;t get any sun and the product didn&#x27;t cause any rashes or irritation.  It is more expensive than other sunscreens but is worth it for a safe natural product.  A very small amount goes a long way also.</li>
            <li> Looking for product that would not irritate my child, sorry....this was not it....it contains methy( almost everything does)....I will keep looking</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended it, one tube lasted us an entire summer and no sunburn</li>
            <li> It doesnt rub in easily and leave all my kids looking ghostly with a white film on them that appears HORRIBLE in pics. But I love how it protects them and I love the satisfaction of KNOWING what is in the product. It is very pricey! But a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair skinned child with a family history of melanoma.  We LOVE this sun block! It is goes on really thick, which can be a challenge, but it stays on a long time even in the water.  Our pediatrician compliments us on keeping our daughter out of the sun at each yearly check-up.  However, she plays in the sun for hours on most days.  We sun block her up with CA Baby in the morning before she heads outside.  Unless she swim, I don&#x27;t usually have to reapply.</li>
            <li> this came right away. thank you so much for sending it I really needed it for my baby. I am very happy. great quality.</li>
            <li> There are more and more chemicals making their way into all products, even ones for baby. I am not an overly paranoid parent but I do find that less is often more. I like this product because it has minimal ingredients, works great to protect my baby&#x27;s skin and she has no reaction to it.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause our kids to break out with a rash. That is why we can justify the price. This stuff is expensive, really expensive. When friends come over and ask to use some on their kids we cringe when they waste it and squirt it on the ground. But don&#x27;t tell them to be careful, you don&#x27;t want to sound cheap by complaining about wasting liquid gold in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your kids have eczema or sensitive skin this product will not bother them. Its good!</li>
            <li> My wife is allergic to something in \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sunscreen and after many trials and errors, we finally found this product that she can use. It works great and it&#x27;s water resistant. It is a very think sunscreen but it&#x27;ll last for quite a while. When you put it on and you go in the water, you can see the water bead up on your skin like water beads on a newly waxed car. It&#x27;s also not easily found in our local shops so ordering it on amazon is nice and conveinent. The main downside to using this product is that it is expensive so keep that in mind but we like it.</li>
            <li> Works great and no allergic reaction!  Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Came highly recommended from a very health conscious friend who uses it or their young kids. Our baby has no bad reactions to it and appears to protect his skin well.</li>
            <li> loved it, baby wasn&#x27;t bothered by it and he hasn&#x27;t been sunburned once.</li>
            <li> Love the concept of all natural, Love California Baby in general, we use many products from them...but just too thick for us.</li>
            <li> I use this for the safety reviews. I love the product, but you do need to reapply it regularly. I will be buying it again. I wish they had sow,thing higher than 30 SPF though.</li>
            <li> Protected our son in hot outer banks sun.....good product but expensive.  Then again how can u put a price on your child&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen since last summer when I found it listed as one of the 30 approved sunscreens on the EWG&#x27;s list.  I was thrilled when I found that Amazon offered it in a 6 ounce tube as I had been buying the 2.9ounce tubes for some time.  With two kids (2 and 4) who need to be coated in sunscreen from nose to toes everyday before they go to preschool, I was glad to find a fragrance-free sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain concerning chemicals.  It goes on white but will fade out as it gets rubbed in and as it dries.  I&#x27;ll be back to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and am allergic to many fragrances and dyes. This sunscreen is a must for me in summer, as I tend to sunburn quickly. I wear it daily instead of regular lotion on any exposed skin. It is not at all greasy, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and protects for a long time. I also love that it&#x27;s far safer than most of the sunscreens out there!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it kills me every time I have to reorder this for my two kids. The price is outrageous. BUT...both my kids have eczema and I am a mom worried about chemicals that would sit on their skin every day for the entire summer. My kids go to daycare and have sunscreen applied twice a day. That&#x27;s three months of twice daily application of something that I would like to think isn&#x27;t hurting them. This sunscreen has a good rating from the Environmental Working Group as having less toxins. My son had terrible eczema as a toddler (its milder now). He would have skin breakage on his wrists, inner elbows and inner knees to the point where he was treated with antibiotics several times. This sunscreen NEVER exacerbated his condition. For that, it was worth its weight in gold. My daughter had less sensitive skin so that was less of an issue, but she like my son is very fair. This sunblock has prevented both from getting even the faintest of tans, despite being outside hours each day. My only complaint is that it leaves marks on clothing, car seats, car doors, etc. Small price to pay I guess. Overall, great product. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and am so spoiled by the lack of smelly chemicals in it that I could never go back to anything else. It&#x27;s expensive but a little goes a long way and skin is left feeling nice. Plus it really is great for eczema in myself and my kids.</li>
            <li> Leaves some white streaks but works pretty well. Its great if you&#x27;re going to the beach or any place with strong sun rays.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 3 years now and have no complaints except for the cost. I&#x27;m happy we live where there are 4 seasons and I dont have to use this year round</li>
            <li> I bought this for everyday use on exposed skin--arms and sometimes legs.  Bad choice.  It&#x27;s very thick and sits on the surface of the skin for a long time after it&#x27;s been applied.  So, after several weeks of use, there is a layer of sunscreen on my car seats, my car door, some of my purses, and some of my work clothes--including those that are dry-clean-only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should have known better--nonchemical sunscreens are typically heavy--so I didn&#x27;t complain to the manufacturer, but I did email them about my experience (per the instructions on their website) and asked if another of their products would be more suitable for everyday use.  No response.  As a result, I probably will not purchase any more California Baby products.</li>
            <li> My kid has very sensitive skin and this does a great job of not reacting with his skin and giving him a rash.  It also does a great job doing what it&#x27;s made to do... keeping the sun off his skin.  That said, it is very thick and paste-like and can be difficult to apply.  Also, if you get it on your clothes or your kid&#x27;s clothes while applying it, it will stain.</li>
            <li> I like it very much as it has physical filter instead of chemical one and it works very well (my child never got any sunburn). The only problem is, it is not coming off easily. We have a bit drama at home when I want to wash her face and hands?!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well and gives me a piece of mind that we are using safe stuff. It is very white and thick so hard to spread.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works really well and lasts well In and out of the water, along with being highlynrated for safety by the Environmental Working Group. Rub it in well. The 6 oz. tube is much handier than the 2.9 oz.</li>
            <li> Love CA baby products.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is white and smeary as can be expected for a zinc-based sunscreen. It is a nice consistency, easy to apply, works fine, and leaves both my and baby&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the top rated for having the least toxins, which is why I bought it for my 18 month old. It is expensive, but out of other top rated sunscreens, this is the easiest to apply and rubs into skin without leaving a thick paste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since my six year old was a baby.  I love this product.  It&#x27;s all natural and has a good rating with the EWG.  My kids don&#x27;t even get a suntan with this product I love it.  We go to the water park a lot and using it before we go and once during lunch protects them the whole time we are there.  We&#x27;ve tried other organic sunscreens and haven&#x27;t been happy.  Will stick with California Baby.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long enough for detailed comments</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this sunscreen since discovering it based on EWG ratings. I tried a few other products that didn&#x27;t protect as well as this one. It&#x27;s quite thick which may deter a few folks initially, but I believe it&#x27;s totally worth it because of it&#x27;s high health ratings and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It is expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;All the California Baby products are great for sensitive skin.  My sons never have a reaction to their products like so many other baby products.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen we buy for our kids! It&#x27;s thick and pasty, yes, but it&#x27;s natural and it works! My son is almost four and has never had even a minor burn. The extra cost is worth the peace of mind knowing that we&#x27;re putting a safe sunscreen on our kids!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different sunscreen for my infant.  Most of the have been so hard to get rubbed in, I end up leaving layers on her.  California Baby sunscreen is great, I can get it rubbed in and on evenly.  I also like that is fragrance and chemical free.  This sunscreen is a little pricey, but definitely worth it.  My daughter has never burned with it, I am very persistent with applying it too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves products by CA Baby. Although priced on the higher end, their stuff is top of the line and never disappoints. Got to get the best for our only son :)</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, so I was very careful when trying sunscreens. She has no allergic reaction toward this one. There is no scent, which I like. Not sticky. It goes on pretty thick, so you have to rub it back and forth until the white goes away.</li>
            <li> Makes my mature skin look great, soaks in readily so nothing left on surface of skin, yet protects if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun all day.  Natural, no fragrance, perfect!</li>
            <li> I like that this sun screen does not contain chemicals, and I use it most of the time on both of my children, but if they will be swimming I have to use something else.  The sunscreen beads up and washes away as soon as they are wet.  This happens even if I leave this sunscreen on their skin for 30 minutes, as the directions state, before they enter the water.  So, you may want to look into something else if you plan on using this at the beach or pool, otherwise, for everyday use it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Not cheap and pasty white but does an excellent job of sun protection and stays on even in the ocean.</li>
            <li> My son has NEVER burned he is 5 and we use this every day. Never leave home without it! Safe son</li>
