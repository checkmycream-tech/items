            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is creamy, white in color and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly.</li>

            <li>It has a convenient push pump so you can use just the right amount and no waste.</li>

            <li>Would highly recommend to friends and family.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>The Fast Absorbing anti aging moisturizer made my face feel extremely hydrated and left it feeling very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing again as I will be trying something new.</li>
            <li>I apply this at bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores or cause any new acne or blemishes that pop up by morning.</li>
            <li>As soon as you open you can smell the peppermint oil on the first pump, it so invigorating bringing your skin alive!</li>
            <li>Winter time of coarse is even worse on dry skin, so getting this when it&#x27;s been 3 degrees outside was a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>THAT WAS COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that my skin is soft and feels tighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The moisturizer contains all natural ingredients and can be used on all skin types.  </li>
            <li>Well normally when I apply a moisturizer to freshly washed skin, it takes a little bit to absorb fully into my skin.</li>
            <li>All around I can feel that my skin is more hydrated, not dry and dull like it used to be.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any anti aging, but I am very hopeful!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>it does not take much so the bottle should last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I felt like it continued to keep my skin soft throughout the day and that continuous use improved the overall smoothness and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, this product works as well as a similar product offered by Vernal which cost me double the amount I had paid for  this item.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin that is also very sensitive and reacts to just about anythjng I put on my face.</li>
            <li>After using the moisturizer for a very short period of time I felt a big difference, my face and neck no longer felt dry and felt very soft.  </li>

            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND IT IS NOT GREASY, GOES ON VERY EASY.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE BEEN USING IT BEFORE BED AND UNDER MY MAKEUP ...EVEN AFTER EIGHT HOURS UNDER MAKEUP THERE IS NO OILY FILM.  I WAS HAVING SOME DRYNESS ON MY CHEEKS AND CHIN, AFTER A FEW DAYS THAT WAS COMPLETELY GONE.  I WILL BUY THIS MOISTURIZER AGAIN, VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> its OK but I want more than what it is giving me.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using products that do what they say they are going to do. I have only got to use this product for 3 days and I really like it!! I use it at night before bed and in the morning after I shower and before I put on make up. I have extremely dry skin and have to moisturize daily or my face will literally crack it gets so dry. Winter time of coarse is even worse on dry skin, so getting this when it&#x27;s been 3 degrees outside was a wonderful thing.&lt;br /&gt;Fast-absorbing Anti-Aging Moisturizer came on time and package to be durable during shipping. It goes on smooth and does not leave my skin greasy and left with a film. I can tell that my skin is soft and feels tighter and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I can not wait till I see the results after using this product long term.  I received this product from a promotion and at a great price. I am providing my experience with this product .This is based solely on my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, i can&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it on my skin all day, but I can tell that it does last. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any anti aging, but I am very hopeful!</li>
            <li> As a woman in my mid 40&#x27;s I am obsessed with trying new creams, serums and lotions for my face to keep the wrinkles away.  That&#x27;s why I was glad I was given the opportunity to purchase this Kiss the Sun moisturizer at a special price to test for quality.  I like that the product comes in a pump bottle, I prefer that to a jar with a lid.  It took 2 pumps to cover my face and neck.  The product is white when dispensed and has a peppermint smell, I assume from the witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbed easily into my skin and did not leave it feeling greasy or oily.  I did not notice an immediate tightening, but my face felt moisturized.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles so I cannot attest to wrinkle reduction.  The moisturizer contains all natural ingredients and can be used on all skin types.  I gave 4 stars vs. 5 stars because the scent did not dissipate after I put it on.  I prefer unscented products for my face, just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product zombie and am always looking for that next great thing to help my aging skin look young. I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, I&#x27;m not seeing any real significant results after using it for two months everyday. It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer - my skin is left nicely moisturized without feeling greasy. But in terms of improving skin tone and texture, I just haven&#x27;t see it. I will not be purchasing again as I will be trying something new.</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells like peppermint. You can feel the tightening effect.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this is such a fantastic moisturizer.  It is not heavy or greasy, has a nice fragrance and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth.  The peppermint oil and green tea extract wake my skin up!  I also use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by the same Skin Care company - also a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to be so happy with it. It has a light mint scent that feels really refreshing. It dries quickly and does not feel overly moisturized...I don&#x27;t like it when my skin feels weird afterward. it does not take much so the bottle should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> My winter-dry skin is craving all the moisture it can get, and I found this anti-aging moisturizer from Kiss the Sun to be the perfect soothing balm. It comes in an attractive, easy to use pump bottle. I prefer this to open-mouthed jars where you&#x27;re constantly transferring bacteria by dipping your fingers in. The lotion is creamy but not heavy or greasy and absorbed quickly into my skin. My face immediately felt softer and less itchy-tight- this may be from the peppermint oil it contains. I felt like it continued to keep my skin soft throughout the day and that continuous use improved the overall smoothness and brightness of my skin. I would recommend this! **I received this cream in exchange for my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped with the fine lines. Love the fresh mint scent.  Would highly recommend to friends and family.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far, this product works as well as a similar product offered by Vernal which cost me double the amount I had paid for  this item.  I&#x27;m pleased with it and will be a regular customer up ahead.  I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST SHIPPING! Bought this for my MIL and she&#x27;s loves it. Says it&#x27;s lightweight and not greasy</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is packed full of some of my favorite skincare ingredients: witch hazel, Matrixyl, Shea Butter, Peppermint Oil, Green tea extract, Vitamin C and Vitamin E.  These ingredients work together to create the perfect daily moisturizer. Matrixyl helps to increase collagen production which increases skins elasticity and minimizes wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is creamy and white, and it comes in a handy pump, and one press releases the perfect amount to smooth onto my face.  The peppermint oil smells incredibly, and helps to instantly wake me up when I apply it in the am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Received in 2 days and well packaged. I am always trying new face products and trying to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; that works for me! I have been using Kiss The Sun for almost and week and I know it will take longer to see the fine line results but I love how it makes my skin feel. Some ingredients by themselves are great products so when you put together I can see why I like the cream so well. It has a convenient push pump so you can use just the right amount and no waste. It smells of the peppermint oil and I love me some peppermint. I apply this at bedtime and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores or cause any new acne or blemishes that pop up by morning. I have had a problem with other products doing that in the past. Thank you Kiss The Sun for such a great product! I was able to buy this product at a discount during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, it goes on smooth and blends it without looking shiny. It also feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> The Fast Absorbing anti aging moisturizer made my face feel extremely hydrated and left it feeling very smooth.  After using the moisturizer for a very short period of time I felt a big difference, my face and neck no longer felt dry and felt very soft.  I definitely loved the smoothness it left and enjoyed the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel the greasy feeling on my face that I have felt with other products. I will continue using this and will recommend it to my sister as she&#x27;s been looking for something to help her with increasing the moisture on her face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and awesome moisturizer!  The cream has a silky non-greasy texture.  My skin feels really nice and hydrated after applying it!  I&#x27;d recommend and buy again! Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand, and I find that it is well worth the money!! I like this product because it feels good on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and it&#x27;s light and glides very smoothly. Fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. This product is wonderful!  I have dry skin that is also very sensitive and reacts to just about anythjng I put on my face. I was so happy to find that this moisturizer not only had no adverse affects but it made my skin feel soft and look &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; without being tacky. It goes on so smooth and a little goes a long way.  I wear it at night after cleansing my face and during the day under my makeup. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with the Vitamin C eye gel and Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I love that it has witch hazel extract and makes my skin tingle and feel silky at the same time.  I love the smell when I put it on!!</li>
            <li> This anti-aging moisturizer is made with a lot of natural and safe products. Some of them are shea butter, green tea, vitamin C &amp;E and peppermint oil, which is my all time favorite! It also contains matrixyl, which doubles the protein to restore your skin tones. I love the consistency of this moisturizer, it&#x27;s light to the skin, and it&#x27;s creamy texture is smooth as it&#x27;s applied without greasy residue! As soon as you open you can smell the peppermint oil on the first pump, it so invigorating bringing your skin alive! It goes on very smooth and spreads evenly for a fresh and soft feel! This can also be applied prior to makeup! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and cause ti to turn red and flakey like the other ones I have tried! I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.*Note: my body&#x27;s reaction may differ from that of another using this product. I love the way my face and neck feel and look after just a few days of use, I love applying it before and after a long day at the beach! I would recommend this fast absorbing anti aging moisturizer to anyone that wants a healthier softer looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Kiss the Sun Anti Aging Moisturizer is a versatile moisturizing cream with amazing ingredients: Matrixyl, witch hazel, shea butter, peppermint oil and green tea extract. All of the ingredients work together to make a great moisturizer and anti aging cream. I use this moisturizer twice a day and love the way it makes my skin look and feel. My eye area feels more toned. All around I can feel that my skin is more hydrated, not dry and dull like it used to be. This moisturizer is creamy, white in color and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly. The peppermint smell is mild and invigorating. My sensitive skin loves this moisturizer and I have not experienced and irritation with the moisturizer. If you are looking for a great, reliable  moisturizer at a great price, then you have to try this product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Living in Hawaii for most of my life, my skin has gotten some sun damage. My areas of concern would be my face and chest areas. I was offered this Fast-absorbing Anti Aging Moisturizer from Kiss The Sun for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try. As soon as it arrived, I opened the box and it says to apply to clean skin. So I waited till after my shower to apply. Well normally when I apply a moisturizer to freshly washed skin, it takes a little bit to absorb fully into my skin. This one was different. It was absorbed very quickly which allowed me to go ahead with whatever else I needed to do without worrying that it  would rub off onto my clothes. I definitely recommend this Fast-absorbing Anti Aging Moisturizer from Kiss The Sun for anyone who wants a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I am very glad I decided to give this moisturizer a try! It is delivering everything it said it would. After just a week of use I feel that it is already improving my skin tone. I love the hint of peppermint smell I get as I put it on, but I am also glad the smell does not linger. It certainly is fast-absorbing, and does not feel greasy during the day even in spite of the rising summerish temperatures we&#x27;re having here in the south. I&#x27;m very glad to have found a moisturizer that works well on my sensitive skin and I am looking forward to more improvements to my skin as I continue to use it!</li>
