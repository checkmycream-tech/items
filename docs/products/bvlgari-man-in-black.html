            <li>I am very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>Definitely perfect for spicy fragrance lovers...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great scent with longevity.  </li>
            <li>Great product and great service.</li>
            <li>This parfum is amazing!</li>
            <li>Wonderful, really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>The scent blooms throughout the day, mixes and mingles like a good parfum should, and blends out into the evening.</li>
            <li>Always had good luck buying from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>she said OMG you smell good.</li>
            <li>I loved this cologne.</li>
            <li>Exotic fragrance really good price</li>
            <li>Nice package.</li>
            <li>Awesome new scent...bold and daring. .sexy</li>
            <li>One of the best perfumes i&#x27;ve ever had, simple and Delicious, Very misterious, powerful and attractive.</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>The prominent woody notes are balanced by the barest tinge of citrus peel, and there&#x27;s a leathery-cigar lingering note sweetened by vanilla-bean, toasted sugar notes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I finally bought it as a valentines gift and am very happy</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what being top dog is all about.</li>
            <li>It holds onto the woodsy tones and looses most of the softer florals by evening.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Fahrenheit by C. Dior Awesome smell but and only reason why not 5 stars is bcuz</li>
            <li>so I was pleased with the pricing.</li>
            <li>At first it kind of reminded of a nice pipe tobacco smell.</li>
            <li>Very happy with Amazon customer service with a minor issue.</li>
            <li>I echo one of the reviewers here that it smells very manly, in a good way.</li>
            <li>The product was genuine product, was delivered on time and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this vendor to anybody looking for genuine fragrances at discount prices.</li>
            <li>Is it genuine?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many scents and Bulgari for me is just so fresh and cool.</li>
            <li>the bootle has some problem ,and the smell is not like the original stuff..</li>
            <li>Original men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very nice long staying parfum</li>
            <li>fast delivery, 100% authentic</li>
            <li>Smells good but its duration is only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>And he claims that women in check out lanes at stores or in other lines tend to stand closer to him when he wears it.&lt;br /&gt;He would tell you that this is a great &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>Vendor shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Smell just super.</li>
            <li>Smells nice for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>Reason I gave 4 stars because the smell is too strong and old.</li>
            <li>This cologne is sexy, woodsy, almost cigar-like.&lt;br /&gt;There is no possible way to mistake this as a woman&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>the first time I wore it around her</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and it is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Its rare that men get to smell like men, musky, heady, yummy men.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m old school.</li>
            <li>I can HIGHLY recommend this parfum!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t describe it very well here</li>
            <li>Just as describe,  thanks</li>
            <li>was okay but does not last long at all.</li>
            <li>He wears it very nearly every day.</li>
            <li>Have also used it during the day and could be a little strong.  </li>
            <li>wears it to work nearly every day</li>
            <li>Not for young one.</li>
            <li>fixed well.</li>
            <li>As it dried down the fragrance became soft and sexy!</li>

            <li> The product was genuine product, was delivered on time and was as advertised. I would recommend this vendor to anybody looking for genuine fragrances at discount prices.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Was a bday gift! Was well received and a hit! Yummy scent!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it! On the box is written 25$ ,but i give 56$.. the bootle has some problem ,and the smell is not like the original stuff..ai,i think is fake</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and excellent product</li>
            <li> This Eau de Parfum is simply yummy. Overall, this is a &amp;#34;dark,&amp;#34; complex scent. The prominent woody notes are balanced by the barest tinge of citrus peel, and there&#x27;s a leathery-cigar lingering note sweetened by vanilla-bean, toasted sugar notes. I echo one of the reviewers here that it smells very manly, in a good way. It is a long-lasting scent, too. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it. Winner.</li>
            <li> Awesome new scent...bold and daring. .sexy and dark a must have. .</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance.  I have not yet opened the package.</li>
            <li> Its rare that men get to smell like men, musky, heady, yummy men.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m old school. I like my man sweaty, bulging, and smelly. This cologne is sexy, woodsy, almost cigar-like.&lt;br /&gt;There is no possible way to mistake this as a woman&#x27;s cologne. This is a man&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;My husband mulled over purchasing it for almost a month because it is a heavy scent and he was worried it would be over powering at work. I finally bought it as a valentines gift and am very happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;He wears it to work nearly every day and he says that while it might drown out the other guys and their CK- that&#x27;s what being top dog is all about. He is often asked what cologne he is wearing. And he claims that women in check out lanes at stores or in other lines tend to stand closer to him when he wears it.&lt;br /&gt;He would tell you that this is a great &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Its been over a year and he still has this bottle. He wears it very nearly every day. My husband has now expanded his Bvlgari collection and remains partial to Man in Black. The scent blooms throughout the day, mixes and mingles like a good parfum should, and blends out into the evening. Even though he puts it on in the morning, I can smell it as we climb into bed- it changes throughout the day. It holds onto the woodsy tones and looses most of the softer florals by evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many scents and Bulgari for me is just so fresh and cool. I had to have it.</li>
            <li> The product arrives timely and as I expected</li>
            <li> Exotic fragrance really good price</li>
            <li> fast delivery, 100% authentic</li>
            <li> Always had good luck buying from Amazon.  This product has absolutely no scent!  Alcohol and water!!  Then nothing!!  Do not waste your hard earned money!!</li>
            <li> This parfum is amazing! At first it kind of reminded of a nice pipe tobacco smell. As it dried down the fragrance became soft and sexy! I didn&#x27;t tell my wife I bought it and the first time I wore it around her she said OMG you smell good. It was delivered on time and it is the real deal! I am getting 7 to 8 hours however the last two hours are closer to the skin. I can HIGHLY recommend this parfum!</li>
            <li> Great scent with longevity.  It is NOT a knockoff.  Would buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. I like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Vendor shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Fahrenheit by C. Dior Awesome smell but and only reason why not 5 stars is bcuz I don&#x27;t like the spray on bottle</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes i&#x27;ve ever had, simple and Delicious, Very misterious, powerful and attractive.</li>
            <li> Original men&#x27;s fragrance. I loved this cologne.Smell just super.I am very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance in my world of Bvlgari.  Can&#x27;t describe it very well here but it is suited for evening and last long enough.  Have also used it during the day and could be a little strong.  Very happy with Amazon customer service with a minor issue.</li>
            <li> Very nice long staying parfum</li>
            <li> was okay but does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Nice package. Smells nice for a fairly long time. Is it genuine? I don&#x27;t know how to determine that.</li>
            <li> I got the cologne 4 days after ordering. Macy&#x27;s wanted $90 for this so I was pleased with the pricing. Definitely an attention grabber and panty dropper.</li>
            <li> Reason I gave 4 stars because the smell is too strong and old. Not for young one.</li>
            <li> Smells good but its duration is only 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, really enjoyed it. fixed well.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Definitely perfect for spicy fragrance lovers...</li>
            <li> Just as describe,  thanks</li>
