            <li>Good value for me.</li>
            <li>You have to use a lightening product along with exfoliation in order to get a good result to treat problems like that (many great lightening/vitamin C products on the market).</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a great moisteriser it put on after.</li>

            <li>Smells kind of like pumpkin pie.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, but it was almost twice the price to buy it at the salon.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>I used it for a while on its own, three days in a row and each time leaving it on for about twenty min.  </li>
            <li>I want to give a very strong caution to people in terms of expectations.  </li>
            <li>This peel is amazing, your skin is so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li>I am experienced with face/skin products, have tried almost all of them on the market that are worth trying.</li>
            <li>and I do not think it suitable me.</li>
            <li>The micro-crystals do a wonderful job of exfoliating, and my skin feels heavenly soft when I rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice and pumpkiny :)</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use is twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I purcased this products after reading so many favorable online reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good exfoliator, but I dont know if its worth the price.</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This item is priced great and would cost significantly more at high end retailers.</li>
            <li>First the smell is really good.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean and well buffed !</li>
            <li>It smells lightly spicy and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy enough with the results and happy it has never broken me out.</li>
            <li>excellent scrub for sensitive, aging skin with large pores.  </li>
            <li>I use soak in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very mildly abrasive peel with a pumpkin fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use all of the other Peter Thomas Roth products, primarily for anti-aging, but also for brightening, and this \\&quot;peel and reveal\\&quot; with pumpkin enzymes is the best thing I&#x27;ve used yet!  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth and clean my face feels immediately after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It provide a light peel -</li>
            <li>There is a pumpkin enzyme in the product, which I enjoy</li>
            <li>if pumpkin pie lol I&#x27;m not a fan of crystals, I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the Peter Thomas firming gel which is amaze balls!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, especially with Amazon&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li>I get chemical peels from a local day spa, but this is great for in between appointments.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after using.</li>
            <li>Smells great and your skin is left clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really like PTR products, having great experience with the &amp;#34;pro strength&amp;#34; 40% triple acid peel, which oddly, is not sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This product really leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>No real scent so great for men too.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>I also use it in the evening if I&#x27;ve gone full makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Peter Thomas Roth products and have been happy with them</li>
            <li>does not irritate, smells fantastic and leaves my skin soft and smooth, pores clean and fine lines reduced.  </li>
            <li>Had received a sample of this product and liked the way it left my face feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>It goes on grainy and starts like a scrub, but when you leave it on it acts like a mild peel.  </li>
            <li>It is just strong enough, causes no irritation but gives smooth skin and a lovely fresh glow.</li>
            <li>This is not a deep exfoliation yet Gentle and effective!</li>
            <li>If i use it on my face too often though it does seem a bit strong, but for the tougher spots is great for daily or several times a week use.</li>
            <li>Gross&#x27; retinol plus ferulic acid product is phenomenal and quite mild for those with sensitive skin but wonderfully effective.  </li>
            <li>Really simple to use and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>pricy but worth it</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about two months now, and believe it is far better than any pricey peel I have had.  </li>
            <li>nothing spectacular, but the next day when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li>my skin was fresh and glowing.  </li>
            <li>So far I love the exfoliation and smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I rarely leave reviews, so for me to even take the time to write</li>
            <li>Maybe mild improvements when I first began using it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>My face is absolutely glowing, and I hardly ever wear make up anymore for fear of covering my wonderful, natural glow.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.....left skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 53, I can&#x27;t say my skin looks fresh and glowing very often these days)  </li>
            <li>The 2nd day my skin looked even better.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Enjoying it while I have it but likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Really good at-home peel to remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it made my skin feels soft and clean but</li>
            <li>smells good, not very effective for my skin</li>
            <li>but this product makes my skin super soft and smooth, and the exfoliating beads really help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and it wasn&#x27;t irritating at all to my 54 year old face, was hoping to see a change after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The scrub beads are plentiful and small for a good faux microderm.</li>
            <li>It helps with the texture and certainly makes your skin super soft and very receptive to moisturizers and serums.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products in addition to having had laser resurfacing but this peel deliveries great results with little pain.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a gentle and effective way to rid your skin from dead skin cells and exfoliate at home this product works wonders.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>Evens out any dullness and really makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li>However, nothing much has happened with regard to fading of age spots.</li>
            <li>using this product alone will probably not do anything in terms of fast fading.  </li>
            <li>Its a gentle exfoliator for the face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Let me just say this stuff is really gentle and leaving it on for longer than the recommended time is not going to burn you.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle, but always read the instructions and follow them</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if I can see any difference in my face, but at my age, I&#x27;m happy if it doesn&#x27;t make me look any worse.  </li>
            <li>So I had high expectations...</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews, I think this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product with several different \\&quot;peel</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong pumpkin smell and it&#x27;s got a slight grit to the wash.</li>
            <li>I do two major peels a week and use much milder exfoliation products during the week</li>
            <li>Let me be very clear about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin was very sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Even the 40% PTR peel is super gentle and I can leave that stuff on for a half hour</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews (and after discovering a few other fantastic PTR products).</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>Be careful, only use 2x a week, maybe 3x because it is strong.</li>
            <li>The PTR clinical peel and reveal is very yummy on its own, as the scrubbing particles are strong enough to buff dead skin and, if left on for a long time, can &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the dead skin gently.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but had no issues.</li>
            <li>Maybe a wee bit pricey, but much cheaper than a spa facial</li>
            <li>and you do not have to use much at all to cover the entire face, plus no peeling which is a downside to a chemical peel.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh and does not burn or &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much of my skin is actually &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; but I do like the way my face feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the product once and my skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I DO NOT have sensitive skin and my face is used to being washed with salicylic acid/scrubbing beads every day in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I used an entire tube of this resurfacer (scrub) and didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and seems even to rid my face of the coarseness I have from so much past sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I had 2 VI Peels, 8 Revitalizing Peels and a few other glycolic peels, and by far this is the better product.  </li>
            <li>But the point I&#x27;m making is that for TOUGH PROBLEMS, you will need to do more than an exfoliation like</li>
            <li>Generally I use it once a week and smooths and cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing again and am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of this one.  </li>
            <li>And what is amazing is that only a thin layer is needed per application, which means it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product especially when used in conjunction with other PTR products.  </li>

            <li> I am in love with this PTR product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful face scrub for several years.</li>
            <li> THERE ARE SO MANY PRODUCTS AND</li>
            <li> that products works so much better, I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping it gets better.</li>
            <li> I love anything pumpkin and pumpkin facials are usually my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the  fragrance; it reminds me of nut meg.</li>
            <li> hope when I use more , It would be better,</li>
            <li> i just LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is really potent and makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> It helps products penetrate much better, and you get a quicker result that way.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and all Peter Thomas Roth Products....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use is twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I purcased this products after reading so many favorable online reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good exfoliator, but I dont know if its worth the price.</li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This item is priced great and would cost significantly more at high end retailers.</li>
            <li> First the smell is really good.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and well buffed !</li>
            <li> It smells lightly spicy and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy enough with the results and happy it has never broken me out.</li>
            <li> excellent scrub for sensitive, aging skin with large pores.  </li>
            <li> I use soak in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very mildly abrasive peel with a pumpkin fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I use all of the other Peter Thomas Roth products, primarily for anti-aging, but also for brightening, and this \\&quot;peel and reveal\\&quot; with pumpkin enzymes is the best thing I&#x27;ve used yet!  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth and clean my face feels immediately after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It provide a light peel -</li>
            <li> There is a pumpkin enzyme in the product, which I enjoy</li>
            <li> if pumpkin pie lol I&#x27;m not a fan of crystals, I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the Peter Thomas firming gel which is amaze balls!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again, especially with Amazon&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li> I get chemical peels from a local day spa, but this is great for in between appointments.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Smells great and your skin is left clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like PTR products, having great experience with the &amp;#34;pro strength&amp;#34; 40% triple acid peel, which oddly, is not sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This product really leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> No real scent so great for men too.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> I also use it in the evening if I&#x27;ve gone full makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Peter Thomas Roth products and have been happy with them</li>
            <li> does not irritate, smells fantastic and leaves my skin soft and smooth, pores clean and fine lines reduced.  </li>
            <li> Had received a sample of this product and liked the way it left my face feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> It goes on grainy and starts like a scrub, but when you leave it on it acts like a mild peel.  </li>
            <li> It is just strong enough, causes no irritation but gives smooth skin and a lovely fresh glow.</li>
            <li> This is not a deep exfoliation yet Gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> If i use it on my face too often though it does seem a bit strong, but for the tougher spots is great for daily or several times a week use.</li>
            <li> Gross&#x27; retinol plus ferulic acid product is phenomenal and quite mild for those with sensitive skin but wonderfully effective.  </li>
            <li> Really simple to use and makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> pricy but worth it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two months now, and believe it is far better than any pricey peel I have had.  </li>
            <li> nothing spectacular, but the next day when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li> my skin was fresh and glowing.  </li>
            <li> So far I love the exfoliation and smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews, so for me to even take the time to write</li>
            <li> Maybe mild improvements when I first began using it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> My face is absolutely glowing, and I hardly ever wear make up anymore for fear of covering my wonderful, natural glow.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice.....left skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 53, I can&#x27;t say my skin looks fresh and glowing very often these days)  </li>
            <li> The 2nd day my skin looked even better.  </li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Enjoying it while I have it but likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Really good at-home peel to remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it made my skin feels soft and clean but</li>
            <li> smells good, not very effective for my skin</li>
            <li> but this product makes my skin super soft and smooth, and the exfoliating beads really help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent and it wasn&#x27;t irritating at all to my 54 year old face, was hoping to see a change after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The scrub beads are plentiful and small for a good faux microderm.</li>
            <li> It helps with the texture and certainly makes your skin super soft and very receptive to moisturizers and serums.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products in addition to having had laser resurfacing but this peel deliveries great results with little pain.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a gentle and effective way to rid your skin from dead skin cells and exfoliate at home this product works wonders.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> Evens out any dullness and really makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> However, nothing much has happened with regard to fading of age spots.</li>
            <li> using this product alone will probably not do anything in terms of fast fading.  </li>
            <li> Its a gentle exfoliator for the face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Let me just say this stuff is really gentle and leaving it on for longer than the recommended time is not going to burn you.  </li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle, but always read the instructions and follow them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I can see any difference in my face, but at my age, I&#x27;m happy if it doesn&#x27;t make me look any worse.  </li>
            <li> So I had high expectations...</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I think this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product with several different \\&quot;peel</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a strong pumpkin smell and it&#x27;s got a slight grit to the wash.</li>
            <li> I do two major peels a week and use much milder exfoliation products during the week</li>
            <li> Let me be very clear about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin was very sensitive to sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Even the 40% PTR peel is super gentle and I can leave that stuff on for a half hour</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews (and after discovering a few other fantastic PTR products).</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Be careful, only use 2x a week, maybe 3x because it is strong.</li>
            <li> The PTR clinical peel and reveal is very yummy on its own, as the scrubbing particles are strong enough to buff dead skin and, if left on for a long time, can &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the dead skin gently.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but had no issues.</li>
            <li> Maybe a wee bit pricey, but much cheaper than a spa facial</li>
            <li> and you do not have to use much at all to cover the entire face, plus no peeling which is a downside to a chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh and does not burn or &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of my skin is actually &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; but I do like the way my face feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> So far I have used the product once and my skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I DO NOT have sensitive skin and my face is used to being washed with salicylic acid/scrubbing beads every day in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I used an entire tube of this resurfacer (scrub) and didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and seems even to rid my face of the coarseness I have from so much past sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I had 2 VI Peels, 8 Revitalizing Peels and a few other glycolic peels, and by far this is the better product.  </li>
            <li> But the point I&#x27;m making is that for TOUGH PROBLEMS, you will need to do more than an exfoliation like</li>
            <li> Generally I use it once a week and smooths and cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again and am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of this one.  </li>
            <li> And what is amazing is that only a thin layer is needed per application, which means it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product especially when used in conjunction with other PTR products.  </li>
            <li> I have smoother skin after using it and it helps a bit with blackheads, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that much better than some less expensive products available at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> After it the skin feels soft and my impression was that it helps when combined to other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aha products since the early 90s when Alpha Hydroxy products came to market, along with other exfoliation methods.  </li>
            <li> For example, I exfoliate much more aggressively than the average person because I&#x27;ve been doing it for 20 years and have tough skin.  </li>
            <li> I left it on 10 minutes without problems, but for anyone with sensitive skin and/or virginal skin, I would suggest less time.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh for people who are new to peels, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have seen a small difference in the overall tone of my face although I&#x27;ve only used it a short time and only once a week</li>
            <li> No matter how long I leave it on, nothing gets &amp;#34;revealed&amp;#34; after washing it off.</li>
            <li> I use a product like this, and then do an AHA peel right behind it.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with other daily peels and skin treatments.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day as a part of my regular beauty regimen.  </li>
            <li> this provides because it will take a very, very, very, long time, to see results.  </li>
            <li> I use quite a few natural products (you can see my reviews), as well as other products (matrixyl, plant stem cell products, etc....).  </li>
            <li> BUT be careful of you have dry skin, as it seems it dries it out.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very dry this winter and after one use it is noticibly softer and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer to cover the small area!!</li>
            <li> have had no trouble with any negative reaction on my face.  </li>
            <li> Have seen a big difference just using it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 3 minutes the first time, afraid it might burn or make my face peel, but it did neither.  </li>
            <li> use it every other day</li>
            <li> I use a small amount with liquid facial wash every morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other exfoliators and they don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I recommend the PTR FirmX Exfoliating Gel....</li>
            <li> It actually works trying to scrub away the dead skin cells!</li>
            <li> I started using it once a week and gradually built up to every other day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, it&#x27;s much like Kate Somerville&#x27;s Exfolixate, but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> and i can use this every other day while using other PTR peel products on the off days so its not too harsh at all!</li>
            <li> (Shea Terra black soap).  </li>
            <li> A little about my background.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have use it a few times</li>
            <li> I also thought it was a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Sadly, after using the entire tube, I did not see any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this item here on Amazon for a 1/3 of the price it usually sells for in spas.&lt;br /&gt;$60?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to exfoliation, using Retin A and at-home glycolic peels in the past, so leaving stuff on longer is just my thing.  </li>
            <li> Not as dramatic a result as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have tough-as-nails skin, so this doesn&#x27;t irritate me in the least; I leave it on for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The negative-</li>
            <li> If you have serious hyperpigmentation, age spots, etc....</li>
            <li> I AM A BIT CONFUSED</li>
            <li> My skin normally randomly breaks out across my cheeks</li>
            <li> Ill buy it over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin with a lot of acne and scars.  </li>
            <li> I have bad hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and can see some lightening on those areas.</li>
            <li> but boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the product because I hate to be wasteful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved the scent and it wasn&#x27;t irritating at all to my 54 year old face, was hoping to see a change after reading so many positive reviews.  Sadly, after using the entire tube, I did not see any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> smells good, not very effective for my skin</li>
            <li> My complexion feels like it has been thoroughly cleansed! and is brighter after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had known this product earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommends it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!  It makes my skin feel good and clean, the smell is so delicious!!!  :-)  I would totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love it! Leaves your skin so smooth and refreshed. I have sensitive skin but had no issues. I will definitely buy it again! BUT be careful of you have dry skin, as it seems it dries it out. I believe this product works the best for oily or combination type of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product. I&#x27;ve a blemish prone skin and this product helped a lot to control it. It provide a light peel - I started using twice a week. After it the skin feels soft and my impression was that it helps when combined to other products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product especially when used in conjunction with other PTR products.  This product really leaves your skin feeling very clean and smooth.  I have very sensitive skin and i can use this every other day while using other PTR peel products on the off days so its not too harsh at all!</li>
            <li> excellent scrub for sensitive, aging skin with large pores.  does not irritate, smells fantastic and leaves my skin soft and smooth, pores clean and fine lines reduced.  pricy but worth it; does what it says and should last a while. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent</li>
            <li> Really good at-home peel to remove dead skin.  Skin feels smooth and soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Had received a sample of this product and liked the way it left my face feeling smooth.  When I received the product,&lt;br /&gt;I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Love the smell and I love the way my skin looks after I use it! Will buy again and again &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Treat yourself with this product - it is amazing.  It feels so good, it smells so good, it works so well - just get it.</li>
            <li> This scrub doesn&#x27;t feel too abrasive and does a great job in leaving you with smooth and bright skin. You only need to use it a couple of times a week for noticible results.</li>
            <li> Love this masque. Skin feels fresh and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this PTR product.  It smells lightly spicy and refreshing.  It has micro-crystals that exfoliate as you are applying it.  I left it on for 3 minutes the first time, afraid it might burn or make my face peel, but it did neither.  Then I started leaving it on for 7-10 minutes. Again, it did not make my face burn or peel. I use it 2-3 times a week. I love how smooth and clean my face feels immediately after rinsing.  It also makes the PTR Fusion and Anti-Aging cream I use soak in very quickly.  I initially bought it to help with some acne hyper-pigmentation/scar I had on my chin and after 5 uses, I already see a difference.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer to cover the small area!! Maybe a wee bit pricey, but much cheaper than a spa facial and you do not have to use much at all to cover the entire face, plus no peeling which is a downside to a chemical peel.  I think this tube will last a while and I see buying it again in my future.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two months now, and believe it is far better than any pricey peel I have had.  I had 2 VI Peels, 8 Revitalizing Peels and a few other glycolic peels, and by far this is the better product.  My skin peels well and the acne scars disappearing.  Be careful, only use 2x a week, maybe 3x because it is strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful face scrub for several years. I won&#x27;t buy anything else. It is just strong enough, causes no irritation but gives smooth skin and a lovely fresh glow. And the fragrance is ADDICTING!</li>
            <li> Bought this item here on Amazon for a 1/3 of the price it usually sells for in spas.&lt;br /&gt;$60? Puh-lease....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only need to use once a week.&lt;br /&gt;A god-send scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Clears up any blemishes that have formed or are about to.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of tingle and great pumpkin smell for every day use.  This is not a deep exfoliation yet Gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> Smells nice.....left skin soft and smooth. Not as dramatic a result as I expected. Looking forward to seeing how it works after several applications. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Peter Thomas Roth products and have been happy with them so I thought I would try this.  First the smell is really good.  Smells kind of like pumpkin pie.  The first time I applied it made my skin feels soft and clean but nothing spectacular, but the next day when I looked in the mirror my skin was fresh and glowing.  (I&#x27;m 53, I can&#x27;t say my skin looks fresh and glowing very often these days)  I also noticed that my skin was very sensitive to sunlight.  The 2nd day my skin looked even better.  I will definitely be purchasing again and am really looking forward to seeing the long term effects of this one.  I don&#x27;t expect a face lift in a bottle, but this product has definitely improved the appearance of my skin with just 2 uses!</li>
            <li> I use a small amount with liquid facial wash every morning.  I&#x27;ve used other exfoliators and they don&#x27;t work as well.  You can feel the dirt and grime come off.  I also use it in the evening if I&#x27;ve gone full makeup - it does help get all the foundation off.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a skin disorder called CARP which leaves a scale type build up on my neck and chest.  I thought this might help.  So far I love the exfoliation and smell of this product.  Have seen a big difference just using it a few times a week. My skin is much softer.  If i use it on my face too often though it does seem a bit strong, but for the tougher spots is great for daily or several times a week use.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products in addition to having had laser resurfacing but this peel deliveries great results with little pain. Generally I use it once a week and smooths and cleans my skin. There is a pumpkin enzyme in the product, which I enjoy but if you don&#x27;t like that fragrance you might want to reconsider. The texture is gritty and you will feel a tingling for the duration of the application. This item is priced great and would cost significantly more at high end retailers.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT. I THINK IT HAS BEEN HELPFUL FOR MY CHIN WHICH IS PRONE TO PIMPLES. I JUST STARTED USING PTR PRODUCTS. THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE GOOD REVIEWS. I AM A BIT CONFUSED AS TO WHAT WORKS FOR WHAT ISSUES, WHAT SKIN TYPES, WHAT AGES, ETC. THERE ARE SO MANY PRODUCTS AND THE DESCRIPTIONS ON AMAZON LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED.</li>
            <li> Had a facial done at a salon &amp; this product was used. I liked it, but it was almost twice the price to buy it at the salon. Good value for me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff! Really simple to use and makes my skin feel amazing. Evens out any dullness and really makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Best product ever used. Great for weekly at home facials. Smells great and your skin is left clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing, your skin is so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> I am experienced with face/skin products, have tried almost all of them on the market that are worth trying. I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews (and after discovering a few other fantastic PTR products). So I had high expectations...but boy was I disappointed. I honestly can&#x27;t recommend this. (But it smells wonderful.) On the other hand, I recommend the PTR FirmX Exfoliating Gel....that products works so much better, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have seen a small difference in the overall tone of my face although I&#x27;ve only used it a short time and only once a week</li>
            <li> This smells devinereminds me of thanksgiving,  I want a slice if pumpkin pie lol I&#x27;m not a fan of crystals, I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the Peter Thomas firming gel which is amaze balls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and I&#x27;m hoping it gets better. I love anything pumpkin and pumpkin facials are usually my favorite. This has caused me to break out and I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just my skin getting used to the product. There isn&#x27;t a strong pumpkin smell and it&#x27;s got a slight grit to the wash. I&#x27;m going to keep up and see how things go, but the breakouts are worrisome.</li>
            <li> I see no difference after using this product. Like, I don&#x27;t think it is doing anything to my skin. No matter how long I leave it on, nothing gets &amp;#34;revealed&amp;#34; after washing it off. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff makes my skin feel so soft! I&#x27;m so happy I read the huffington post review that talked about this. I use it with the Hydropeptide toner and La Roche Mela D Cleansing/Brightening foam.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results.  My skin seems smoother.  However, nothing much has happened with regard to fading of age spots.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if I can see any difference in my face, but at my age, I&#x27;m happy if it doesn&#x27;t make me look any worse.  I love the  fragrance; it reminds me of nut meg.</li>
            <li> I have use it a few times and I do not think it suitable me. It is not work.&lt;br /&gt;I hope when I use more , It would be better,</li>
            <li> If ur thinking of buying PTR clinical peel and reveal,do it! It works so well,i just LOVE it.Make sure you have a great moisteriser it put on after.</li>
            <li> I love the smell...pumpkin and it exfoliated well</li>
            <li> I love this product.  As others have noted, it&#x27;s much like Kate Somerville&#x27;s Exfolixate, but less expensive.  Plus this smells way yummier.  I have tough-as-nails skin, so this doesn&#x27;t irritate me in the least; I leave it on for about 15 minutes.  The micro-crystals do a wonderful job of exfoliating, and my skin feels heavenly soft when I rinse it off.  This will be a staple for me from now on.</li>
            <li> This is really potent and makes my skin glow</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Not worth the price.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.  But the frangrance is wonderful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice peel / mask. Makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth. I use it in conjunction with other daily peels and skin treatments.</li>
            <li> Been using it for two weeks and my skin is 90% cleared!! My skin normally randomly breaks out across my cheeks - i&#x27;ve been struggling with it for years but this product makes my skin super soft and smooth, and the exfoliating beads really help clear up my skin. It also smells nice and pumpkiny :) I will probably buy this product again and again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Makes my face feel clean and well buffed !</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it twice a week, and it makes my complexion glow.  I&#x27;m a product junkie, and this is an awesome exfoliator.  I would buy this again, especially with Amazon&#x27;s great price.</li>
            <li> Works great ,smells great too.</li>
            <li> A little about my background.  I&#x27;ve had bad skin with a lot of acne and scars.  I&#x27;ve been using aha products since the early 90s when Alpha Hydroxy products came to market, along with other exfoliation methods.  I&#x27;ve gotten TCA peels (in the doctor&#x27;s office), 2 rounds of laser treatements, etc....just wanted to explain where I&#x27;m coming from in this review.  Let me be very clear about this product.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product with several different \\&quot;peel sources\\&quot; used in the product.  Smells great, and gave me skin like glass.  And what is amazing is that only a thin layer is needed per application, which means it will last a very long time.  I want to give a very strong caution to people in terms of expectations.  If you have serious hyperpigmentation, age spots, etc....using this product alone will probably not do anything in terms of fast fading.  You have to use a lightening product along with exfoliation in order to get a good result to treat problems like that (many great lightening/vitamin C products on the market). For example, I exfoliate much more aggressively than the average person because I&#x27;ve been doing it for 20 years and have tough skin.  I do two major peels a week and use much milder exfoliation products during the week (Shea Terra black soap).  I use a product like this, and then do an AHA peel right behind it.  It helps products penetrate much better, and you get a quicker result that way.  However, not everyone can do that.  But the point I&#x27;m making is that for TOUGH PROBLEMS, you will need to do more than an exfoliation like this provides because it will take a very, very, very, long time, to see results.  Depending on what you want to treat, you need to use topical serum lightening products, maybe some plant stem cell products, etc.....Dr. Gross&#x27; retinol plus ferulic acid product is phenomenal and quite mild for those with sensitive skin but wonderfully effective.  I use quite a few natural products (you can see my reviews), as well as other products (matrixyl, plant stem cell products, etc....).  I rotate my products quite a bit.  Hope this helps the reader.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and all Peter Thomas Roth Products....</li>
            <li> This is a great mini peel.  It is not harsh and does not burn or &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  I get chemical peels from a local day spa, but this is great for in between appointments.  I can use it to take longer breaks in between appointments and save $$$$.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I use this scrub after at home chemical peels. It works wonders for me. The scrub beads are plentiful and small for a good faux microderm. No real scent so great for men too. The negative- it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much of my skin is actually &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; but I do like the way my face feels after I use it. I also like the pumpkin smell!</li>
            <li> Very mildly abrasive peel with a pumpkin fragrance.  Not too harsh for people who are new to peels, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product, but decided to order it on Amazon because the price was great.  So far I have used the product once and my skin feels like silk.  It goes on grainy and starts like a scrub, but when you leave it on it acts like a mild peel.  My skin has been very dry this winter and after one use it is noticibly softer and hydrated.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Its a gentle exfoliator for the face. It smells delicious and leaves your face looking softer and brighter. I use is twice a week and love the results. I rub a few drops along my face with water and gently scrub using circular motions. If you are looking for a gentle and effective way to rid your skin from dead skin cells and exfoliate at home this product works wonders. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I use all of the other Peter Thomas Roth products, primarily for anti-aging, but also for brightening, and this \\&quot;peel and reveal\\&quot; with pumpkin enzymes is the best thing I&#x27;ve used yet!  My face is absolutely glowing, and I hardly ever wear make up anymore for fear of covering my wonderful, natural glow.  I am 54 and look much younger.  Thank you PTR!!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews, so for me to even take the time to write says a lot.  This product has been very successful for me.  I have only used it twice, but have already noticed a change in texture, and I swear it has helped the creases at the corner of my mouth......&lt;br /&gt;I have had no trouble with any negative reaction on my face.  Having said that, I DO NOT have sensitive skin and my face is used to being washed with salicylic acid/scrubbing beads every day in the shower.  I left it on 10 minutes without problems, but for anyone with sensitive skin and/or virginal skin, I would suggest less time.  I put it on the back of my hands when I do my face, can only help.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  My skin feels so smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Ive never purchased Peter Thomas &amp; Roth products. This is the best mask/scrub ive ever had ! It actually works trying to scrub away the dead skin cells! I have acne prone skin &amp; this works for smoothing out complextion.Ill buy it over &amp; over again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I use it every other day as a part of my regular beauty regimen.  I started using it once a week and gradually built up to every other day. It&#x27;s a wonderful exfoliater!</li>
            <li> I really like PTR products, having great experience with the &amp;#34;pro strength&amp;#34; 40% triple acid peel, which oddly, is not sold on Amazon.  Anyway, I was looking for a prep scrub to use before the PTR 40% so I could boost the depth of the peel.  The PTR clinical peel and reveal is very yummy on its own, as the scrubbing particles are strong enough to buff dead skin and, if left on for a long time, can &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the dead skin gently.  I used it for a while on its own, three days in a row and each time leaving it on for about twenty min.  It works well and has a delicious smell too.  I&#x27;m accustomed to exfoliation, using Retin A and at-home glycolic peels in the past, so leaving stuff on longer is just my thing.  Let me just say this stuff is really gentle and leaving it on for longer than the recommended time is not going to burn you.  Even the 40% PTR peel is super gentle and I can leave that stuff on for a half hour so don&#x27;t be stressed if you buff awhile longer than the 2-5 min. they suggest.  I like to use this scrub and peel when I&#x27;m looking forward to an event and want radiant, even skin.  I&#x27;m happy enough with the results and happy it has never broken me out.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I think this product is fantastic. It makes my skin so smooth and seems even to rid my face of the coarseness I have from so much past sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see ny benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of PTR products before and have been very pleased with them and this is no exception. Used as instructed, it&#x27;ll help your skin&#x27;s texture improve over time.  It helps with the texture and certainly makes your skin super soft and very receptive to moisturizers and serums.  I really like this, it&#x27;s gentle, but always read the instructions and follow them and you&#x27;ll be quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I purcased this products after reading so many favorable online reviews. As for me, it&#x27;s been well over a month and i haven&#x27;t seen any visible results. I&#x27;ll continue to use the product because I hate to be wasteful but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used an entire tube of this resurfacer (scrub) and didn&#x27;t really notice any improvement in the tone of my skin. I also thought it was a bit harsh. Will continue using Dr Gross peel pads.</li>
            <li> You will get compliments on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. I have smoother skin after using it and it helps a bit with blackheads, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that much better than some less expensive products available at the drugstore. It&#x27;s definitely a good exfoliator, but I dont know if its worth the price. Enjoying it while I have it but likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> And I love it. I can see some results. I have bad hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and can see some lightening on those areas.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Does a great job with exfoliation and preps my skin perfectly for nightly serum and moisturizer application.  My skin feels incredibly soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is great product! I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate my skin at all. It has lightened up my old acne scars so much.. Very happy with it and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much of a difference. Maybe mild improvements when I first began using it. Since then, nothing noticeable.</li>
