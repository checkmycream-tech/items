            <li>Has great wear time, it could be used as a date cologne if your normal is nothing.</li>

            <li>If you like good fragrances try Beckham fragrances they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Strong, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>A slightly spicy scent, probably best for after 5.</li>
            <li>I wear this at work; it helps keep my coworkers from wanting to drown me in a large vat of my own stink.</li>
            <li>Advertised as Prime Free Shipping -</li>
            <li>the price here is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>My wife falls even more in love with me when I spray this all over my very obese body.</li>
            <li>Awsome smell and priced right, the ladies will love ya.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this was a knock off.</li>
            <li>I was told that if the perfume is being sold by amazon, then it is original.</li>

            <li>it nice and not loud.</li>
            <li>My son loves it, hard to find on the shelves in stores, great scent, very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>To me too many actors and singers are trying to compete in this market with fragrances that just seem way to similar.</li>
            <li>$9 savings to be exact.</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance a lot, it is exactly what I was expecting it to smell like.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fake.  </li>
            <li>but overall I am extremely satisfied based on the price point.  </li>
            <li>He really likes the scent.  </li>
            <li>but she didnt think so much of it.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Very spicy manly scent</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think is a very quality fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product arrive on time but it kind of has a strong alcohol smell to it and the fragrance does not last very long throughout the day they need to take this one back to the lab and review it again</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s potency is just as good as any other designer brand spray.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I gave it four stars because the scent fades too quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more direct, verbal compliments on it from both men and woman than with any of the other 2 dozen colognes  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as a bday present he loves it wears it all the time it came pretty fast too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and everything was too strong, or too fruity, or something.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice casual cologne.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing it, the first was after Christmas clearance from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I like the scent but all too common and has the undertones of most of the new fragrances out now.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li>I still have a little bit left in the first bottle and I confirmed with others that the contents of the bottles are obviously different.  </li>
            <li>Describing smell is very hard to do, but I have these glade aerosol room fresheners &amp;#34;Cashmere Woods&amp;#34; that I love the smell of and I was going for something like that.  </li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t exactly like that it does have a little of the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I figured I would just randomly get him something that was fairly cheap, so that if he complained it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> this is the most awkward bottle I have ever had to hold and depress a spray pump.</li>
            <li> And despite other comments, it smells the same in every bottle- from here or</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if this is original product or old product or fake immitation.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little different when I received it.</li>
            <li> Only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a positive review for the shipper/seller.  </li>
            <li> And, despite comments in other reviews-</li>
            <li> Ignore other comments questioning it&#x27;s authenticity.  </li>
            <li> 4 Stars vs. 5 stars was given due to the fact that the scent fades off by mid-day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning</li>
            <li> not sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Always get a few compliments while im out, so</li>
            <li> My husband is hard to buy for.</li>
            <li> It sucks trying to spray this on.</li>
            <li> I thought with the name behind it</li>
            <li> Bad batch maybe?</li>
            <li> Worst Smell</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cologne is niche quality, it&#x27;s elegant versatile and most important it last all day or night. Women love the scent. If you like good fragrances try Beckham fragrances they are the real deal.I own over 100 different fragrances and this one is on my top five.</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my husband, its affordable and smells marvelous!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this sight un-smelled. I&#x27;m sure Amazon will patent a click and sniff system soon but until then you&#x27;ll have to take my word when I say that this is a good cologne. I would generalize the scent as a _very_ good smelling soap (it smells 100% different when you first spray it on but quickly settles to it&#x27;s downbeat self). I wear this at work; it helps keep my coworkers from wanting to drown me in a large vat of my own stink. That would suck.</li>
            <li> One of the best cologne scents I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He really likes the scent.  We have had pretty good luck with most of the David Beckham scents.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this was a knock off. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last for longer than an hour. Not worth the hassle of returning so I consider it a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent. I like it. I must stay this is the most awkward bottle I have ever had to hold and depress a spray pump. I look at the bottle and move on to something else that I can actually hold and spray at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this needs to go back to industrial design school. It sucks trying to spray this on.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 17 year old son. He loves it!</li>
            <li> good clean fragrance. not sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but all too common and has the undertones of most of the new fragrances out now. To me too many actors and singers are trying to compete in this market with fragrances that just seem way to similar.</li>
            <li> This is my go to fragrance. Awesome fresh aroma. Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent!  This is my second time purchasing it, the first was after Christmas clearance from Walmart. They are identical in every way except the Walmart cologne smells like cologne, two spirts and I&#x27;m good for the day.  This time it smells like simple rubbing alcohol, and that scent goes away in about 30 seconds.  Even after multiple applications it never smells like it should.  Bad batch maybe? I still have a little bit left in the first bottle and I confirmed with others that the contents of the bottles are obviously different.  Looking into return...</li>
            <li> The scent could last longer</li>
            <li> I love they smell of it on my boyfriend.He wears it all the time.Cant get enough of it.to exspensive anywhere else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cologne. I thought with the name behind it it would of had a better fragrance but good nonetheless</li>
            <li> Just what my grandson wanted.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Smell so bad.&lt;br /&gt;The Worst Smell I&#x27;ve ever get.</li>
            <li> Nice men&#x27;s  perfume for a very good price.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite cologne. I tried others and now im back to this one. Ans the size is larger than the ones I used to buy at target at the same price. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Strong, but not too strong. I&#x27;ve received compliments on it after wearing it only twice, would recommend</li>
            <li> I like it but she didnt think so much of it.  A slightly spicy scent, probably best for after 5.</li>
            <li> I tried this at Target and immediatly liked it. Came home and ordered it from Amazon because I knew I would get a better price. $9 savings to be exact. The fragrence is not overpowering and smells manly. Only reason I gave it four stars because the scent fades too quick. Because of the scent (and because my wife likes it) DB&#x27;s Homme is now in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> My husband is hard to buy for. He always find SOMETHING to complain about. Especially with cologne. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands and everything was too strong, or too fruity, or something. I got him this just because he was out of cologne and I figured I would just randomly get him something that was fairly cheap, so that if he complained it didn&#x27;t cost much. Plus, David Beckham. So imagine my surprise when he actually LIKED it! Thank goodness! So I will be purchasing the hell out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Light scent and good for everyday use. It won&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> Already knew what to expect when I got this order. This stuff smells great. Not too strong of a scent and is a great cologne to use for work or play! Will order again when this runs out :)</li>
            <li> My son loves it, hard to find on the shelves in stores, great scent, very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Awsome smell and priced right, the ladies will love ya. Always get a few compliments while im out, so thankyou</li>
            <li> Great price for the size of the bottle. My son loves this spray and my local store stopped carrying it. Very happy I found it here!</li>
            <li> Ladies love the smell.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance a lot, it is exactly what I was expecting it to smell like.  Describing smell is very hard to do, but I have these glade aerosol room fresheners &amp;#34;Cashmere Woods&amp;#34; that I love the smell of and I was going for something like that.  While this isn&#x27;t exactly like that it does have a little of the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a positive review for the shipper/seller.  Advertised as Prime Free Shipping - but it took 8 days to get it.  And the box?  I needed a saw to get in the box.</li>
            <li> I smelled this at a tester in the store. It smelled a little different when I received it. The package arrived as was promised and was in great conditiont</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Got it as a Christmas present years ago and ran out.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.  I always get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled so good!</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  It&#x27;s not over-powering at all.  I&#x27;ve gotten more direct, verbal compliments on it from both men and woman than with any of the other 2 dozen colognes  Ive tried over the years.  This is now &amp;#34;my scent&amp;#34;.  And, despite comments in other reviews- it&#x27;s not fake.  This is the real thing.  Ignore other comments questioning it&#x27;s authenticity.  That&#x27;s bunk.  And despite other comments, it smells the same in every bottle- from here or anywhere else I&#x27;ve bought it- it&#x27;s the same scent.  Lastly, it&#x27;s potency is just as good as any other designer brand spray.  When I pulled out my winter coat this year I could still smell it from applying last year.  I&#x27;ll continue to order from Amazon- the price here is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> Everyone men and women compliment me on the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and awesome price</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.  Not my favorite scent ever but overall I am extremely satisfied based on the price point.  You can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a bday present he loves it wears it all the time it came pretty fast too</li>
            <li> When I first tried this cologne it was a tester or a small bottle. I&#x27;ve looked for it before and couldn&#x27;t find it until I looked on Amazon and as big as the bottle is, I thought it was worth what I paid for it. I&#x27;m very happy with the smell of it but I wish the smell of it would last longer when I have it on....</li>
            <li> 4 Stars vs. 5 stars was given due to the fact that the scent fades off by mid-day. I am accustomed to stronger and longer lasting scents (i.e. Chrome, Z-Zegna, Fahrenheit, etc.). The fragrance, however, is manly and has found itself a permanent place within my collection.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, just wish there was more staying power. Only lasts a few hours. Very spicy manly scent</li>
            <li> Very good smell. Good price. Just hope it can be last longer</li>
            <li> This is a very nice casual cologne. It meets my expectations and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I was told that if the perfume is being sold by amazon, then it is original. The product came on time and wrapped nicely with matching serial number with box case and bottle. It smells good and spray works well. But longitivity of this perfume is quite short. In an hour, nobody around me can smell it. So I&#x27;m not sure if this is original product or old product or fake immitation.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes. I use a lot because it&#x27;s so cheap and smells great. Nice size bottle too. Would recommend for any dude or man.</li>
            <li> This scent will make you feel and look like the David Beckham you&#x27;ve always wanted to feel like. My wife falls even more in love with me when I spray this all over my very obese body.</li>
            <li> David Beckham products are all great and also easy on your wallet. We love the perfume. Smells great...you will like it too.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  Good quality, great price.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. it nice and not loud. It is a very nice fragrance for a man. buy it</li>
            <li> The product arrive on time but it kind of has a strong alcohol smell to it and the fragrance does not last very long throughout the day they need to take this one back to the lab and review it again I don&#x27;t think is a very quality fragrance.</li>
            <li> Favorite fragrance ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best daily cologne, not overly strong. Has great wear time, it could be used as a date cologne if your normal is nothing. Overall its an amazing cologne.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I could find anywhere!! And it&#x27;s an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Great cologne and the seller always great to deal with.</li>
            <li> really nice, love the scent</li>
