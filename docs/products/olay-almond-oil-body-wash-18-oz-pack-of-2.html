            <li> And leaves my dry skin soft!</li>
            <li> After bathing with Dove, I might feel that for the first few minutes or so, but then I&#x27;d feel some tightness in my skin and dry ashiness if I scratched my skin.  </li>
            <li> This packaging is similar, but it has a whole new look that confused me.  </li>

            <li> A little went a LONG way in providing a thick lather for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same formula as the one I purchased in the grocery store a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and I think they formulated it with lotion as well because it&#x27;s thick and fluffy.</li>
            <li> AS THE OTHER OLAY RIBBONS</li>
            <li> and I am done with trying other kinds.  </li>
            <li> This bath soap has very little scent.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong getting the other scents.</li>
            <li> But the real game changer was after I rinsed and dried off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just obsessed with the way this body wash smells and foams up and wished Olay hadn&#x27;t changed a thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will not order again.</li>

            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS &#x27;&#x27;SILKY&#x27;&#x27; AS THE OTHER OLAY RIBBONS......BUT IT DOES SMELL GOOD.......WITH THE OTHER OLAY RIBBONS PRODUCTS YOU DONT HAVE TO USE MUCH LOTION AFTER YOU SHOWER....BUT THIS ONE, I RECOMMEND THAT U DO....</li>
            <li> Smells good, very creamy ,</li>
            <li> nice light scent and I can feel how soft my skin is after using</li>
            <li> Nice and moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get 2 bottles I only got one.</li>
            <li> I like to change the soaps around and this one smells great! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This has bee nice on my skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for the winter time! It&#x27;s very moisturizing, and I think they formulated it with lotion as well because it&#x27;s thick and fluffy. But I got a good deal on these so I am happy! And it smells fruity like shampoo :)</li>
            <li> After trying many other brands of washes just because I can, I love this one and I am done with trying other kinds.  I have always loved this one and will use it exclusively from now on.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It is the best.  It is silky smooth and the smell is wonderful.  I have it on auto delivery.  You won&#x27;t go wrong getting the other scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this online after I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, and I love it. My skin is dry and it&#x27;s very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft. I wanted to make sure I had enough for when I went to the hospital to deliver my son, I didn&#x27;t want to use anything else. I also bought the Silk Whimsy body lotion and use both every single day. The scent is just right!</li>
            <li> This bath soap has very little scent.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same formula as the one I purchased in the grocery store a few years ago.  I&#x27;m disappointed and will not order again.</li>
            <li> Really like the silky feel and mild fragrance. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I order this product from amazon all the time and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell and always leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh</li>
            <li> I ordered this item thinking that I&#x27;d be receiving \\&quot;Silk Whimsy\\&quot;, but instead, received \\&quot;Silky Berry\\&quot;.  This packaging is similar, but it has a whole new look that confused me.  Today, I confirmed with Olay that the product name and packaging has changed.  They are keeping the packaging and name to the Silk Whimsy soap bar, just the body wash has been changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also checked the ingredients on both body washes for Silky Berry and Silk Whimsy and they are the same, so why the change, Olay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old packaging was perfect and I&#x27;d rather much prefer to smell like roses and almond oil than something less sophisticated like...berries.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love berries on my pinkberry, but I can&#x27;t see why Olay would bring this product a step down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just obsessed with the way this body wash smells and foams up and wished Olay hadn&#x27;t changed a thing. More importantly, I wished I hadn&#x27;t been so quick to return the items! Oh, the drama!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Olay body wash, and this one is no exception. It smells great and it really moisturizes my skin. And the price here is SO much cheaper than in any store. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Dove user until one Christmas when my boss gave me a bottle of Olay Ribbons Body Wash. I&#x27;d never tried it before and when I&#x27;d seen it in the grocery store it was rarely on sale and approximately $2 more expensive than Dove and other body washes so I never bought it for myself.  But when I tried it - well - the difference was remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt velvety, silky and richly emollient.  A little went a LONG way in providing a thick lather for my whole body.  But the real game changer was after I rinsed and dried off.  My skin actually felt fully moisturized.  After bathing with Dove, I might feel that for the first few minutes or so, but then I&#x27;d feel some tightness in my skin and dry ashiness if I scratched my skin.  With Olay Ribbons, my skin continues to stay soft for hours after use and no ashiness. Except for rare times in the middle of winter I don&#x27;t even feel it necessary to use lotion after bathing - which had always been my ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s silky, nourishing, and delicious smelling - a WIN!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and rich, luxurious lather. Scent is almost non-existent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Best body wash ever! Have used it for years anyway, but cheaper on Amazon, of course :)) Only need a small amount on your shower scrunchy for a days worth of soft skin :))</li>
            <li> I think I received a defective piece of this product as it seemed to be too watery and wasnt consistent. I always had really good experience with Olay products however this one turned out to be a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is silky smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li> My wife has enjoyed it</li>
            <li> I loved the silky feeling on my skin and the fact that it was not to oily an rinsed easily off my body leaving a smooth finish my only complaint is that d scent could be a bit more pronounced</li>
            <li> smells so good, leaves the skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> I got to try this body wash at a girlfriend&#x27;s house and since then has been hooked to it. This body wash is rich and creamy and keeps the skin smooth. Great for winter days where the air is dry.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite one and I love the smell</li>
            <li> Superb delivery system great product.  Silky smooth, I love it.  This is my second order of this product and I will surely order another one when I ran out of this one.</li>

            <li> Great product! Fast ship, good pack &amp; delivered quick! What more can a customer ask for. I am very pleased...</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky and soft..(no film). Great for protecting your skin fron the harsh winter weather.</li>
            <li> Sweet Smelling Fragrance, and Smooth...</li>
