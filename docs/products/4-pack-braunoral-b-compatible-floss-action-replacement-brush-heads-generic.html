            <li>Perfect brushes at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>At that price it is a great savings.</li>
            <li>They work great in my Oral B Vitality</li>
            <li>Fit my braun perfectly.</li>
            <li>Have not tried them yet, but they look good.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads fit my Oral B perfectly!</li>
            <li>I suggest just waiting for a good deal of for the original Oral-B heads to come around and purchase then.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the price was very good!</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft but do a nice job cleaning.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works great, why pay extra.  </li>
            <li>I am a light brusher and had never had Oral-B branded heads break on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the gearing is of a cheaper quality than original heads.</li>
            <li>Now I guess I will be using these to clean grout.</li>
            <li>Price is right and the heads work just fine</li>
            <li>Great price, item fits just as the brand name for less.</li>
            <li>It is much rougher and HURT my mouth.</li>
            <li>These have NOT been approved by the ADA like the real Oral-B have.</li>
            <li>I really like my new brushes.</li>
            <li>I wrote a previous post stating that I was satisfied with the delivery of the brush heads.</li>
            <li>All 4 of us use the same brushing systems and enjoy brushing daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy the real thing next time.</li>
            <li>They do not fit onto my brush as the original oral-B heads.</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on the generic version again.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used the original Braun brush heads for several months and only had to throw them out when the bristles became worn.</li>

            <li> The cost savings for the generic brand is not worth the discomfort and annoyance of the oral skin tares.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it comes loose while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had seen the other bad reviews, this toothbrush head is NOT the same quality as the original OralB.</li>
            <li> Upon using them, however, the first one failed to work less than 2 weeks before the fitting stripped out and would not operate with the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> It is NOT worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the generic replacement brand &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; the inside of my upper lip causing tares.</li>
            <li> They are a firm brush.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed in the make quality of these heads.</li>
            <li> They may be somewhat &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re not great.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed</li>
            <li> Not compatible with Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from China; very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t fully attach to the base</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not compatible with Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped from China; very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr ordered. Will re order. All 4 of us use the same brushing systems and enjoy brushing daily.</li>
            <li> These are not compatible with the Oral B Pulse Sonic.  Now I guess I will be using these to clean grout.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Fit my braun perfectly. They are a firm brush. At that price it is a great savings.</li>
            <li> Great price, item fits just as the brand name for less.</li>
            <li> I really like my new brushes. They are nice and soft but do a nice job cleaning.</li>

            <li> Perfect brushes at an excellent price. They work great in my Oral B Vitality</li>
            <li> I wish I had seen the other bad reviews, this toothbrush head is NOT the same quality as the original OralB. I would not waste my money on the generic version again. It is much rougher and HURT my mouth. It is NOT worth the discomfort. So disappointed but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works great, why pay extra.  Shipping was a couple weeks though.</li>
            <li> The package arrived sooner than I expected.  There&#x27;s a problem with the brushes.  They may be somewhat &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34;, but they&#x27;re not great.  The head doesn&#x27;t fully attach to the base so sometimes it comes loose while I&#x27;m using it.  On the other hand, the price was very good!</li>
            <li> It took over a month to receive the toothbrush heads.  They do not fit onto my brush as the original oral-B heads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the brand name brush and these.  No problems.  I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Price is right and the heads work just fine</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the generic replacement brand &amp;#34;snags&amp;#34; the inside of my upper lip causing tares. This has happened several instances and the tares take over a week to heal. The cost savings for the generic brand is not worth the discomfort and annoyance of the oral skin tares.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two heads break on me within 15 brushing sessions. The electric toothbrush becomes obsolete once the gearing in the heads break. I&#x27;m assuming the gearing is of a cheaper quality than original heads. I am a light brusher and had never had Oral-B branded heads break on me. I suppose there&#x27;s a reason these are a third the price. Pretty disappointed in the make quality of these heads. Buyers beware. I suggest just waiting for a good deal of for the original Oral-B heads to come around and purchase then.</li>
            <li> These are NOT Oral-B toothbrush heads. They came from China and have nondescript German writing on them. These have NOT been approved by the ADA like the real Oral-B have.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads fit my Oral B perfectly!</li>
