            <li>It&#x27;s OK for what it was designed to do, but it does leave a funny smell on your hands.  </li>
            <li>This medicated version feels good when you put it on, and is soothing after walking around SF all day, but Lord it sho&#x27; do burn the next day!  </li>
            <li>only needed arch angel Gabriel&#x27;s help then - much more tolerable!</li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m ready to scream!</li>
            <li>Whenever I do a lot of walking my foot gets really hot.</li>
            <li>First I use a paper towel then soap &amp; water.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find this online, since local stores that used to carry it have stopped stocking it.  </li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>The next morning I take a bath and make sure I wash off really well.  </li>
            <li>Feet are pain free for the day (and sometimes several days depending on how much I am on my feet or walking).</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I applied it twice to each feet over the course of two days then washed it off really well....</li>
            <li>and it gave an intense burning that, after almost 24 hours, has not subsided.</li>
            <li>Who wants to keep washing your hands after applying..?</li>
            <li>I like it, it really relieved the pain</li>
            <li>It feels good when you put it on but the next day as soon as we were deep in the woods (naturally) and couldn&#x27;t get out very fast (naturally)</li>
            <li>For an atheist, a unique religious experience.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>So, I would say, if you have sensitive skin (or even if you don&#x27;t, really, I didn&#x27;t think my skin was \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; until this)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m praying the burning gets better after a few showers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the same stuff as muscle rub, only hopefully not as strong.</li>
            <li>Try it once and this will be the first and only thing you think of when your &#x27;dogs begin barking&#x27; keeping you awake at night or anytime.</li>
            <li>Not many stores carry this product and I am glad that it can be purchased online.</li>
            <li>Clears sinuses too so make anyone allergic to menthol is far away.</li>
            <li>Naturally my feet started hurting.</li>
            <li>For anyone who has &#x27;barking dogs&#x27;(aching feet) at the end of a long day, Pain Relieving Gold Bond Foot Cream really does relieve the pain, as stated.</li>
            <li>So now I use this instead, works just like icy hot.</li>
            <li>I could barely stand it!</li>
            <li>The pain is not worth the extremely mild relief you experience upon initial application.</li>
            <li>, I had to take my shoes off several times and even started to panic that something more serious was going on.</li>
            <li>I actually used to use icy hot, as I get a lot of aches.  </li>
            <li>Well, this works just as well as icy hot, but you get such a larger amount for the price by comparison.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my foot last night before bedtime and it felt great, however, when I took a shower my foot started burning so bad</li>
            <li>I thought taking my shoes off would help (you know, reduce the heat that was apparently inflaming the product) , but no such luck.</li>

            <li> We have been working in the woods clearing out underbrush lately and our feet were killing us at the end of the day. That pain was nothing compared to the pain we endured after using this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the same stuff as muscle rub, only hopefully not as strong. It feels good when you put it on but the next day as soon as we were deep in the woods (naturally) and couldn&#x27;t get out very fast (naturally), our feet felt like they were on fire (even though we had washed them good with soap and water before leaving the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter said we came hopping out of there like we were walking on fire...she was sure right about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use, just try a tiny dab at a time until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This product does help pain for a short time.  unlike some of the other reviewers, I had no reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> I am a barefoot runner and i bought this to put on my feet after a run and it felt okay that night, but when i went running the next morning and my legs started to sweat it burned really bad.  I cut my run short and went home and iced my legs down.</li>
            <li> I fractured my ankle a few years ago and now have arthritis in it. Whenever I do a lot of walking my foot gets really hot. So I thought this product would be great in relieving the pain and burning. I put this on my foot last night before bedtime and it felt great, however, when I took a shower my foot started burning so bad I could barely stand it! I tried and tried to wash it off but it&#x27;s not working! My foot is bunring so bad right now I&#x27;m ready to scream! I&#x27;m sitting here holding ice on my foot to help soothe it. And i haven&#x27;t even put shoes on yet! I will never use this product again!</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Pain Relieving analgesic works absolutely the best for my husband&#x27;s and neighbor&#x27;s foot pain.  My husband has burning neuropathy in both feet and this product works the best for the price.  Our neighbor had back surgery resulting in numb feet and he loves the stuff after we gave him some to try.  We try to buy it at our local Walgreens and Walmart and they are Always out of it.  If you use it for the right problems, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very soothing. Helps with pain. Gold Bomd products are amazing</li>
            <li> l had a tube of this left and it worked so l ordered one tube, then I ordered 2 more tubes!!!</li>
            <li> For anyone who has &#x27;barking dogs&#x27;(aching feet) at the end of a long day, Pain Relieving Gold Bond Foot Cream really does relieve the pain, as stated. Try it once and this will be the first and only thing you think of when your &#x27;dogs begin barking&#x27; keeping you awake at night or anytime. The worst thing about it is that it is not easy to find at my local stores so I stock up here at Amazon. Even those who have Type 2 Diabetes can find relief. Try it for yourself and you will agree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It provides the relief that I need when my feet are not keeping me to going to sleep.  Not many stores carry this product and I am glad that it can be purchased online.</li>
            <li> I love this Gold Bond ointment for my feet. Typically my toes and ball of the feet are what hurts. I put it on at night, massage the parts of feet that hurt, add a pair of socks, and then sleep. The next morning I take a bath and make sure I wash off really well.  Feet are pain free for the day (and sometimes several days depending on how much I am on my feet or walking). I&#x27;ve not found anything to do as well as this. Be sure to clean your hands well afterwards. First I use a paper towel then soap &amp; water.  If you get in your eyes off your hands (because you did not clean off well) it will burn like crazy!</li>
            <li> SO I bought this product because my feet were sore on the bottoms from being on them all day. I applied it twice to each feet over the course of two days then washed it off really well....or so I thought. It has been two days now since I stopped using it and my feet are still burning whenever I wear my socks and sneakers. The product should have been washed off and should not still be burning but yet it feels like my feet are on fire when my sneakers are on. I have not applied any more of this cream and never will again. Stay away from this product. I just hope that eventually with enough washing my feet will stop burning.</li>
            <li> I teach and am on my feet all day long. I found great relief after using this cream. It did not burn my feet at all. The only bad thing is I can&#x27;t ever find it in the store. It&#x27;s always sold out. I&#x27;ve got my sister hooked on it now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve look everywhere for this gold bond foot cream bought it once at walmart but they don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore&lt;br /&gt;thank goodness for amazon. I have a bad knee and this gold bond works wonders on my knee pain and is great on tired feet. I&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> So glad to find this online, since local stores that used to carry it have stopped stocking it.  It&#x27;s the only product that works on my &amp;#34;mystery&amp;#34; foot pain. One wish:  that it came in a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The best foot product there is for relieving pain.  It last for hours. Non greasy and absorbs into feet easily.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Pain Relieving Foot Cream has proved it&#x27;s self to be a soothing balm for my back and legs.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had used this cream a few times before after long walks through a big city and it did nothing to make my feet feel relief. This was about a year ago. Yesterday, after being on my feet all day I thought about giving the stuff another try. Big mistake!!!! When I went to bed my feet got a horrible icy cold burn to them that made it difficult to fall asleep. Then, I got up today and went into work. A few hours in, after completely forgetting about applying this stuff the night before, my toes started to burn, bad. They have been burning so bad all day, I had to take my shoes off several times and even started to panic that something more serious was going on. Then, I thought I&#x27;d turn to the internet to see if it was the cream. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews!!! I was thinking I needed to go to the hospital if it wasn&#x27;t the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it didn&#x27;t help my sore, tired feet and it gave an intense burning that, after almost 24 hours, has not subsided.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for what it was designed to do, but it does leave a funny smell on your hands.  Who wants to keep washing your hands after applying..?</li>
            <li> I like it, it really relieved the pain</li>
            <li> this cream is a wonderful relief for my feet after a long day at work. I have neuropathy and they are so sore at night. I rub Gold Bond on them and I can sleep.</li>
            <li> This is the best ,i have diabetes with foot pain so this relieves the pain ! I have tried so many creams and meds and this work best !</li>
            <li> the ahhhhhh effect. A little cream goes a long long way...Clears sinuses too so make anyone allergic to menthol is far away. I massaged it up to my knee and brought the feel of a pedicure home. And oh yes, it moisturizes. Will keep you posted as to how penetrative the moisturizer is.</li>
            <li> I just started classes again for the Fall, so I do a lot of walking around campus, and I mean A LOT. Naturally my feet started hurting. I looked online and saw that this product was rated the best in helping with the particular foot pain I was experiencing. I got it, put it on before I went to bed, and left it on overnight. My feet felt fine...at first. Then, today, I was sitting in class and suddenly my feet started burning. I thought taking my shoes off would help (you know, reduce the heat that was apparently inflaming the product) , but no such luck. The pain didn&#x27;t even lessen when my feet cooled down. When I got home, after three hours of excruciating pain (it almost became debilitating, I&#x27;m not even being dramatic, on my drive home I had to pull over and take my shoes off in hopes that the removal of heat would lessen the burning pain) I washed my feet for at least 30 minutes. They still burn, and now the burning sensation has somehow spread to my ankles (even though I didn&#x27;t apply any cream there). So, I would say, if you have sensitive skin (or even if you don&#x27;t, really, I didn&#x27;t think my skin was \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; until this) do NOT buy this product. The pain is not worth the extremely mild relief you experience upon initial application. I&#x27;m praying the burning gets better after a few showers.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering roll-on but this works well...just messier and needs gloves for application!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that relieves my foot neuropaty.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this creme. I expected the 16% menthol to soothe my feet. I felt a slight tingle, but that was all. The creme does not absorb well, left a greasy film on my feet.</li>
            <li> The non medicated version of this works wonderfully!  It&#x27;s buttery, creamy soft and moisturizing making my Type II diabetic feet feel so good.  This medicated version feels good when you put it on, and is soothing after walking around SF all day, but Lord it sho&#x27; do burn the next day!  I&#x27;m talking about after you been baptized and cleaned but you dancing around, waving your arms, shoutin&#x27; for GAWD to have Mercy kind of burn!  For an atheist, a unique religious experience.  I used it again but wore flip flops the next day...only needed arch angel Gabriel&#x27;s help then - much more tolerable! -CoCo Peru</li>

            <li> I actually used to use icy hot, as I get a lot of aches.  My dad was using this on his feet, and I tried it on mine one night.  Well, this works just as well as icy hot, but you get such a larger amount for the price by comparison.  So now I use this instead, works just like icy hot.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I have found to handle the pain in my feet and toes. I have reordered it several times. would recommend it highly.</li>
