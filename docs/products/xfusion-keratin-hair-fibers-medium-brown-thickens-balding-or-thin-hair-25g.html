            <li>but it does a good job of covering bald/thin spots</li>
            <li>The spray applicator is the best delivery method, since it distributes the fibers in a smooth even fashion, however the spray applicator does not function indefinitely.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I was able to comb my hair and feel good about myself before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure not to over apply, and make sure you seal it with a good hair spray.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything.</li>
            <li>I love this product although I thought the med.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I feel better about being &amp;#34;out in public&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They have added more color choices, but I would like to see even more color options.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel more confident and better about myself.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Probably  more appropriate for thinning hair than balding.</li>
            <li>It also helps to fill in my thinning hair at the top.  </li>
            <li>Yep, I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It will give you more precision and save on product use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Dont hesitate any longer, it truely is my miracle product!</li>
            <li>its easy to use with the puff applicator, stays on with no residue or powder on my pillow</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The color will not run when you sweat, but washes out easily with shampoo,</li>
            <li>I do not use the spray that they recommend because I use hair spray and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Its ability to \\&quot;mask\\&quot; my scalp and make me \\&quot;appear\\&quot; to have plenty of hair is a huge confidence booster.</li>
            <li>I style my hair afterwards, and use some light hairspray and away I go.</li>
            <li>In between color I use the light brown.</li>
            <li>For a person with female pattern balding, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>so light doesn&#x27;t shine off of them-</li>
            <li>This really gives you nice coverage for those thinning spots in your scalp.</li>
            <li>Tried a cheaper product, HSR, and found XFusion far superior.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the right shade for your hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Have found that a wide make up brush, (in the shape of the old fashioned shaving brushes) are the very best to put the hair fibers where you want them.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriends hairdresser applies this to his hair and showed him how it covers his bold spot and thinning areas.  </li>
            <li>Since it consists of very fine particles, they tend to fall into the sink and onto the counter and clean up is a regular chore with this product.  </li>
            <li>I think I am going to order a light brown next to get more variation in the color.</li>
            <li>If you are wondering if this product is worth the money</li>
            <li>You may have to try a couple of colors until you get it right.</li>
            <li>The product washes right out and there is no remaining residue.  </li>
            <li>I have always had thin fine hair - Xfusion is by far the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>While it works fairly well, it&#x27;s difficult to match your own color exactly.  </li>
            <li>Later on if I lose more hair......who knows.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does add some volume to the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, due to thyroid issues I&#x27;ve lost half my hair - especially on top.  </li>
            <li>It is much too expensive, but it&#x27;s an excellent  product and a godsend to the proverably bald headed woman.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for filling in thinning areas.  </li>
            <li>I bought light and medium blond because I put highlights and low lights in my hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This was the right product in the wrongly marked container  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any man or woman that has too much scalp showing.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent, natural and after sprinkling tiny fibers hair may be styled and that thin area where I coulld see scalp is gone.</li>
            <li>I have the same problem and had been using a different type of scalp cover which was okay.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for that purpose.</li>

            <li>I have thinning on the top of my head and just a few sprinkles here and there</li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t live without this product...</li>
            <li>X Fusion keratin hair fibers disguises these areas with a very natural look.</li>
            <li>It covers thinning areas of your hair as long as you match the color pretty closely to your natural color.  </li>
            <li>As a woman, it is totally unexpected to find yourself balding.  </li>
            <li>I just use a little bit in the spaces where you can see my scalp somewhat and my hair looks instantly full.</li>
            <li>Also less expensive than Toppik and just as good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also hard to tell when you&#x27;re running out of this product because the top doesn&#x27;t open, and the container is opaque.  </li>
            <li>and I have visible bare areas on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>If you are getting thin on top then this does help fill in the blanks.  </li>
            <li>My hair is somewhat thin on top.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this makes me feel confident.</li>

            <li> I have thin hair and this makes me feel confident.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair at the front and top of my head.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive that the one my friend bought and mine looks just as good the other more expensive product.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT thicken hair but it does cover up my white scalp &amp; grey grow-out growth.  </li>
            <li> The product was marked Medium Brown; however, the product inside was black..  </li>
            <li> and the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less expensive than Topik, but just as effective.  </li>
            <li> It blends so that I look like I have brown hair after my grey has grown out partially and needs re-colouring.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive item and it should last much longer.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products I have used, it does not rub off on your pillow case.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> a friend was sharing with me that her hair was falling out, or just thinning and now her scalp was showing thru her dark hair</li>
            <li> The medium brown, which I use, is fairly dark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced this item at least 5-6 times after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> and Amazon sells it for half of what he paid at the hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> Just shake a little on and you can&#x27;t tell this from your root hair.  </li>
            <li> brown would be a little bit lighter in color</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  </li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> But those are small inconveniences because this product has given me a lot of confidence in my appearance.  </li>
            <li> As a woman with very, very thin hair this product gives me back my confidence.  </li>
            <li> and I now feel and look like I have a thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Thick my hair and gives it a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about products like this, but threw caution to the wind and ordered a medium brown with the hold spray and the extra spray applicator.</li>
            <li> It helps to disguise the thin hair with help of any spray</li>
            <li> thus hiding the thin places.  </li>
            <li> I save approximately $20 by purchasing it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product covers bald spots and makes thin hair appear thicker.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been thinning since I was diagnosed with a slow thyroid.  </li>
            <li> Made me feel not so bad about my situation.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing hats</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very satisfied with delivery time and packaging.  Great product...wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to thyroid issues I&#x27;ve lost half my hair - especially on top.  This type of product is a god-send in that I shake it on, fix the hair in place, and then use hairspray to &#x27;fix&#x27; the fibers.  For now: this is the answer.  Later on if I lose more hair......who knows.  I hate wearing hats so a wig isn&#x27;t the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the bald look would be a good one for women as it is for men........</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair and need to cover the \\&quot;see through\\&quot; hair, this works wonders.  Just shake a little on and you can&#x27;t tell this from your root hair.  The only caveat is that if you scratch your head, you will get \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; fingernails.  It doesn&#x27;t drip or anything, but only comes off by washing.</li>
            <li> If you are getting thin on top then this does help fill in the blanks.  Have found that a wide make up brush, (in the shape of the old fashioned shaving brushes) are the very best to put the hair fibers where you want them.  Works better than anything.</li>
            <li> a friend was sharing with me that her hair was falling out, or just thinning and now her scalp was showing thru her dark hair and she found this terrific product \\&quot;XFusion\\&quot;  I have the same problem and had been using a different type of scalp cover which was okay.  I ordered the XFusion and am delighted....its easy to use with the puff applicator, stays on with no residue or powder on my pillow and I now feel and look like I have a thick head of hair.  It comes off only when I wash my hair</li>
            <li> As a woman who doesn&#x27;t want to wear a wig or hairpiece and doesn&#x27;t want to fool with tonics like Rogaine (don&#x27;t like the smell), this product is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;The crown part of my head is where I normally apply it.  It makes my hair look thicker. I don&#x27;t use the spray nozzle to apply it either.  I just shake the contents onto my head and that&#x27;s it!  Finally, my hair getting thinner is a genetic thing so nature is taking its course.  Someday, may be possibly wearing a wig but until then, I will continue to use this product.  Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for filling in thinning areas.  Unlike other products I have used, it does not rub off on your pillow case.  Also less expensive than Toppik and just as good!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easy ti use and stays in place wonderfully. You may have to try a couple of colors until you get it right. I bought light and medium blond because I put highlights and low lights in my hair. I blend the colors to get the color I want. I think I am going to order a light brown next to get more variation in the color. Much less expensive that the one my friend bought and mine looks just as good the other more expensive product. Also, my hairdresser recommended it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be as good as Topix at a fraction of the cost. We have purchased this 2x now and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It helps to disguise the thin hair with help of any spray</li>
            <li> I have always had thin fine hair - Xfusion is by far the best product I have ever used.  Its ability to \\&quot;mask\\&quot; my scalp and make me \\&quot;appear\\&quot; to have plenty of hair is a huge confidence booster. When I use this product I dont have to stand in the mirror and stratigically place my hair to try and cover the thinness.  It makes it possible to wear styles I never dreamed of.  If you are wondering if this product is worth the money my answer is EVERY penny!!! Dont hesitate any longer, it truely is my miracle product!</li>
            <li> I love this product although I thought the med. brown would be a little bit lighter in color it still works and definitely makes my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair at the front and top of my head. The xfusion makes my hair look fuller and you don&#x27;t see my scalp. The product washes right out and there is no remaining residue.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thin on top. I just use a little bit in the spaces where you can see my scalp somewhat and my hair looks instantly full. I style my hair afterwards, and use some light hairspray and away I go. Highly recommend it. Just make sure you use the right shade for your hair.</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully to hide my thinning hair.  As a woman, it is totally unexpected to find yourself balding.  I tried miracle shampoos.  I tried a wig.  Nothing worked until my hairdresser suggested I try  hair fibers.  Thank God!</li>
            <li> Another great product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Matches my hair color perfectly. After I color my hair I use the medium brown. In between color I use the light brown. Thick my hair and gives it a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I love this product because IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL!  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and now I couldn&#x27;t do without it.  It&#x27;s a little less expensive than Topik, but just as effective.  It covers thinning areas of your hair as long as you match the color pretty closely to your natural color.  The medium brown, which I use, is fairly dark.  You can get a trial size if you&#x27;re unsure.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a bit messy.  Since it consists of very fine particles, they tend to fall into the sink and onto the counter and clean up is a regular chore with this product.  In addition, it does come off as you sleep onto your pillow case so it has to be refreshed in the AM, and it does leave residue on the pillow case.  It&#x27;s also hard to tell when you&#x27;re running out of this product because the top doesn&#x27;t open, and the container is opaque.  But those are small inconveniences because this product has given me a lot of confidence in my appearance.  It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I was able to comb my hair and feel good about myself before I started using this product.  I use it everyday and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I highly recommend it for any man or woman that has too much scalp showing.  Easy to use and the product goes a long way. You should definitely try it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair appear full.hides my scalp.  It is much too expensive, but it&#x27;s an excellent  product and a godsend to the proverably bald headed woman.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, natural and after sprinkling tiny fibers hair may be styled and that thin area where I coulld see scalp is gone. Even after a nights sleep its still looks great. There is another brand my hair cutter used on me stating it the same thing.... It wasn&#x27;t the same at all and even to the touch I could feel it.. Not so with Xfusion... Great product and I highly reccomend it. I will try the puff applicator on my next amazon order.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of hiding scalp where hair is thinning.  Tried a cheaper product, HSR, and found XFusion far superior.</li>
            <li> recommended and used by my hairdresser.  It really makes a difference in my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT thicken hair but it does cover up my white scalp &amp; grey grow-out growth.  It blends so that I look like I have brown hair after my grey has grown out partially and needs re-colouring.</li>
            <li> For a person with female pattern balding, this is a great product.  Made me feel not so bad about my situation.Stays in.</li>
            <li> Well I wouldn&#x27;t say this &amp;#34;thickens&amp;#34; your hair...but it does a good job of covering bald/thin spots so light doesn&#x27;t shine off of them- thus hiding the thin places.  I feel better about being &amp;#34;out in public&amp;#34; that way.  Highly recommended for that purpose.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning for quite awhile and I have visible bare areas on my scalp.  X Fusion keratin hair fibers disguises these areas with a very natural look. Washes out when I shampoo.  I save approximately $20 by purchasing it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> Messy but it works so wonderfully.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market for thinning hair. They have added more color choices, but I would like to see even more color options.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but always read them before buying a product. I love Xfusion! I will never want to run out of it. It makes me feel more confident and better about myself. I have thinning on the top of my head and just a few sprinkles here and there and amazingly it&#x27;s gone. I do not use the spray that they recommend because I use hair spray and it works just fine. It does not come off on your pillow either. I also always by two 25 oz. bottles and that lasts me about 1 year. I hope that this product never goes out of business! And of course amazon delivery is the best!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this makes me feel confident. Probably  more appropriate for thinning hair than balding. I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly for thinning hair and thinning spots.</li>
            <li> The product covers bald spots and makes thin hair appear thicker.  The spray applicator is the best delivery method, since it distributes the fibers in a smooth even fashion, however the spray applicator does not function indefinitely.  I&#x27;ve replaced this item at least 5-6 times after only a few months.  This is an expensive item and it should last much longer.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis.  It definitely does add some volume to the top of my hair. It also helps to fill in my thinning hair at the top.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, I could but I don&#x27;t want to!  As a woman with very, very thin hair this product gives me back my confidence.  The only drawback is that sometimes it &amp;#34;travels&amp;#34; on to my face.  Be sure not to over apply, and make sure you seal it with a good hair spray.</li>
            <li> Yep, I love this stuff.  Works great!  I was a little skeptical at first but once I got it I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been thinning since I was diagnosed with a slow thyroid.  This is one of the products I&#x27;ve used to disguise the balding areas.  While it works fairly well, it&#x27;s difficult to match your own color exactly.  I do like it and there is nothing else that can help so I will continue to use this product and similar ones like it.</li>
            <li> This really gives you nice coverage for those thinning spots in your scalp. The color will not run when you sweat, but washes out easily with shampoo,</li>
            <li> This was the right product in the wrongly marked container  The product was marked Medium Brown; however, the product inside was black..  I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I am very skeptical about products like this, but threw caution to the wind and ordered a medium brown with the hold spray and the extra spray applicator. This stuff does NOT disappoint! It works perfect on my thinning crown. I was running out of ways to hide the obvious, and now I am back to wearing my hair any way I choose. That&#x27;s freedom you just can&#x27;t put a price on. I recommend you purchase the extra spray applicator. It will give you more precision and save on product use.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends hairdresser applies this to his hair and showed him how it covers his bold spot and thinning areas.  It covers so well, he tells people he had a hair transplant.  He can&#x27;t live without this product...and Amazon sells it for half of what he paid at the hairdresser.  Hats off to X-fusion...literally....</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
