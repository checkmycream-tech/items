            <li>It did pick up a fair amount of product on the tip, so I just wiped the tip on the rim of the container before applying.</li>
            <li>It came off fairly well with some makeup remover wipes (don&#x27;t even remember the brand).</li>

            <li>It is very light.</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t perfect is that I guess the makeup remover wipes didn&#x27;t get *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for wearing to the office; I get some color but don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m ready to go clubbing.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and I love that.</li>

            <li>/&gt;*I received a free product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee Powder â€“ aside from a natural coloring agent, coffee has incredible properties, one of which is an anti-oxidant, calms and soothes redness caused by inflammation, has anti-aging properties, and is beneficial for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells delicious, it is smudge proof, with nourishing and anti-oxidant plant extracts to prevent breaking, thinning and extra shedding.  </li>

            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>The wand does little to curl lashes, so for my best results, I&#x27;ve added a curler and made sure to do 2 coats, with a bit of drying time between coats.</li>
            <li>Excited to have such an excellent quality mascara that is cruelty free, vegan and gluten free as well.</li>
            <li>easily,...</li>
            <li>I do like this mascara, but it smudges easily after you have worn it for awhile.</li>
            <li>I also was amazed at how easily it was removed with makeup remover wipes at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>It came off easily with a Olay makeup removing toilette.  </li>
            <li>It applies and removes easily, and it doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Grapefruit- strong antibacterial and antioxidant properties that condition and stimulate lash growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it seemed to stay on fine.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite thing about this mascara though was the fact that it did not feel like I had mascara on!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this purchase, would recommend!</li>
            <li>It glided on smoothly and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is made in the US and is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mascara did go on light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara feels light and does not flake if you touch your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I was asked to review this mascara, and since it was free, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have nightmares of cheap mascaras and having them clump on and then smear all day as you wear them.  </li>
            <li>Free product provided for testing and reivew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A light coating is all I need or want.</li>

            <li>It makes you feel clean, clear and good about yourself.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in going all natural with your cosmetics, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am aware that eyelashes do go through a shedding process, but the breaking, and thinning process was sometimes so severe that I decided that it was better to have unglamorous light colored lashes, than not to have any lashes at all.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>product does have a unique smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a vegan mascara that would help strengthen my lashes-</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t have to clean up with my makeup remover pen</li>
            <li>Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is a safe and healthy alternative for fuller looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that natural makeup products are finally able to compete with the store brands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have eyelashes again and this product is easily to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pricing is fair for an all natural/organic product - I like this company&#x27;s ability and willingness to answer questions, provide ingredient lists and assure customer confidence and proper use of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It stayed put, went on smoothly, smells fresh, came off when I wanted it to with water or make up remover wipe</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly with no clumping, wore beautifully throughout the day with no smudging or flaking, and removed easily with my usual almond oil and cotton pad!</li>
            <li>It gives a more natural look and not very dramatic, in my opinion, but great for every day or sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>and I actually like it a lot more than most of the brands on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple sources on the internet, and the testing results, statements and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>love that it is 100% natural, organic, vegan and gluten free.</li>
            <li>I have recently received my third order, and the quality of the product remains wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love to treat my lashes now and then since my lashes are not thick or</li>
            <li>It stays on all day long and although my eyelashes look just as good</li>
            <li>But I love trying new cosmetic products</li>
            <li>mascara has a typical brush comparable with the one that comes with Great Lash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this mascara go one beautifully, it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>, I highly suggest this mascara!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product!!</li>
            <li>This sample was black and went on nice and smooth, no clumps!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a great everyday option that did not irritate my eyes even with pollen/allergy issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The aromatic scent (chamomile) makes you feel calm and vitamins</li>
            <li>and I love all the natural ingredients that are used in this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to change over to gentler more natural products.</li>
            <li>One thing I liked is that I did not get mascara all over the place when I used this applicator -- only on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Parabens â€“ used as preservatives, but an excess amount is absorbed and found in the skin tissue of cancerous breast</li>
            <li>In addition, this mascara has natural plant extracts for the nourishing and conditioning properties, to help stimulate healthy lash growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>When I was asked in a a followup email by the company how I liked the mascara, I felt I should tell them that I hadn&#x27;t actually received the mascara.</li>
            <li>you know how the best mascara is when it&#x27;s a few weeks old</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands and these two are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I took it with me when I went down for vacation in Florida to put it to the ultimate test and it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li>In the US, mascara is the second most favored cosmetic for everyday wear and helps boosts self-assurance.</li>
            <li>I found was that it went on dry, yet covered my lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li>if you want a heavy layered looking eye but for a pretty and real look - it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first natural mascaras that has staying power but comes off easily and does not run.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this.</li>
            <li>No weird flakes, clumps or smudges on application</li>
            <li>Made in the US, Invoketress mascara is 100% Natural, 85% organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free and cruelty free â€“ never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Made in the US, Invoketress mascara is 100% Natural, 85% organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free and cruelty free â€“ never tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>actually lashes(I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but for under $20, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>No clumping, just separated and pretty.  </li>
            <li>First time trying an organic mascara.  </li>
            <li>I only use it 1-2 times a week (most of the time just once a week).</li>
            <li>There was more than enough product on the wand to coat all my lashes evenly with just one layer.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not difficult to remove like some water resistant mascara is.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>First, the mascara:</li>
            <li>It goes on without clumping, has a short wand which gives me more control applying</li>
            <li>This mascara did as well as the high-priced brands I use normally use, if not a little better.  </li>
            <li>It does not go on heavy which is great because I am blonde with finer lashes and really like a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>e makes you feel clean and natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to get my twenty-something lashes back, but for a baby boomer this mascara worked out very well. :)</li>
            <li>When I saw the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The applicator has a fairly blunt tip and short, straight brush which inevitably left stain on my eyes that required removal each time it was applied.  </li>
            <li>My bangs kept touching my eyelid on one side and the result was that I had a swollen red eye and a highly allergic response to the chemical in every product since.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much different this mascara would be than the normal brand I use, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
            <li>As an extra bonus, it was so easy to remove.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I did not expect it to be so easy to remove: it comes off (yet doesn&#x27;t run) with water and hardly leaves any smudges.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think I may have found a new favorite without any of the yuck</li>
            <li>Being somewhat of a mascara-snob, I was skeptical of a mascara that didn&#x27;t cost very much, and though I try to use as many natural products as I can, no makeup has been as good as the department store brands--until now.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear mascara for years because my eyes are so easily irritated by the common ingredients, which includes fragrance.</li>
            <li>cosmetics such as mascara, can easily deteriorate your vision, therefore it is important to know what ingredients are in daily makeup</li>
            <li>It builds upon the last coat fine</li>
            <li>Look no further, I finely found it.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it does not irritate my eyes one bit, so I feel completely fine sleeping with it on.</li>
            <li>very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not say this thickens the lashes terribly much.</li>
            <li>There are no artificial colors, preservatives, or fragrances, therefore safer for sensitive eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li>received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple sources on the internet, and the testing results, statements and opinions are</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really add length</li>
            <li>I am trying a lash enhancer, and wanted to try a really gentle and nourishing mascara.  </li>
            <li>Another unusual tidbit is this product is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>however it was a very clumpy mascara that washed off even with laughter...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking me 4 and 5 coats to get any real build up.  </li>
            <li>Although I used lash grow serums and successfully grew them back, I still had to wait a few months for my lashes to regain some length and</li>
            <li>As you might imagine, my eyelashes are pretty short right now.  </li>
            <li>is my first time using a natural mascara</li>
            <li>lashes and my eyes are very sensative that normally if I wear eye mascara my eyelids and my eyes start to itch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have older eyes (in my 50s) and had decided to stop using mascara, despite the gray lashes coming in.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Retinyl Acetate â€“ rated as a â€˜high concernâ€™ ingredient, interferes with cellular signaling and can cause mutations in the body genes.</li>
            <li>The brush is also pretty long, which makes it easy to get all your lashes in one sweep, and helps you get to those tiny corner lashes.</li>
            <li>Right off though I did notice that the tube was smaller than a normal tube of mascara, but when I opened the tube I noticed it smelled so much nicer than what I normally use.</li>
            <li>Natural mascara gone glamorous!!</li>
            <li>The Mascara is also very light in terms of thickness, you have to apply a few coats, otherwise it is not bad, especially considering I am not putting any chemicals near my eyes.</li>
            <li>What I normally use smells like mascara</li>
            <li>After three coats my lashes still felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too.</li>
            <li>product sample received for review purposes.till felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the mascara for a few days - and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had lash extensions for the past 2 years and finally decided that as much as I loved the look, it was getting too pricey.  </li>
            <li>lashes are long but there is a lot of blonde in them, so mascara gives my eyes more definition.</li>
            <li>but I have to use it for a few more days before I can write a review about it.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t complained because it seemed like a hassle, but they were more interested in me getting the mascara than they were in haggling over where</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t run / raccoon during my workout or walk (I live in high humidity) and came off neatly with cleanser and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt ok while on, not too sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So when I was ask to try this new mascara</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I have only used it a few times since I received this mascara, but it goes on nicely and separates lashes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>applicator was pretty standard, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long lashes and rarely have issues with mascara.</li>
            <li>In less than a week, they were on it, and sent me &amp;#34;another&amp;#34; one for free.</li>
            <li>It apples easy, does not feel heavy or clumpy on lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the safety hazards, I had stopped wearing mascara except for very special occasions, due to the damage that mascara has formerly ruined my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>to apply with a fairly typical wand, the mascara coats the brush well, goes on smothly and there is an instant color difference in the lash - some lengthening with coat # 1, more with coat # 2.  </li>
            <li>I tried the product over the course of several days, hoping to like it better over time, however, I found that it did not perform well as a mascara which is typically used to color, separate, lengthen, strengthen or thicken eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>This natural mascara even made my lashes feel soft.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any clumping, flaking, or irritation (and I wear contact lenses and have sensitive eyes).</li>
            <li>All natural, goes on well and wears well.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin that&#x27;s why I ordered organic mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Invoketress Mascara does NOT contain these toxic ingredients; their mascara is 100% natural and made with 85% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I have had no adverse  reaction thus far.</li>
            <li>Have been using natural skin products</li>
            <li>Invoketress has made a product that is natural and wearable.  </li>
            <li>100 Natural and 85% Organic ingredients including Chamomile, Vitamin E, and Coffee Powder to nourish, condition and stimulate growth.</li>
            <li>I was looking for vegan and natural.</li>
            <li>and it did last me the whole</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because I wanted a natural mascara without all the chemicals, but that doesn&#x27;t smear or come off if I sweat.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>Soft yet makes my lashes look lush and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Therefore safe for everyday use, and there is no exposure to the harmful chemicals that are contained in commercial mascaras.</li>
            <li>Therefore safe for everyday use, and there is no exposure to the harmful chemicals that are contained in commercial mascaras.</li>
            <li>so my lashes can look nice and receive some vitamins and minerals because usaully my lashes are thin and</li>
            <li>When Invoketress Beauty contacted me and asked if I&#x27;d be willing to receive a sample of their mascara to try and then let people know what I thought, good or bad, I agreed to give mascara another</li>
            <li>mascara is black in color, I normally use &#x27;very black&#x27; when choosing a mascara shade, but this still goes on dark and made my eyes look great.</li>
            <li>- I am a huge fan of JET BLACK mascara - and while this states it is black, It seemed to be more dark brown to me -</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for soft smooth lashes, no more irritated eyes, and also the fact the item is vegan (no animals died for this product)</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no thick residue left on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be making this my new mascara.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, none of the natural ingredients caused an adverse reaction to my eyes or skin, something that often occurs with other mascara formulas.  </li>
            <li>The only downside would be it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>first thing I did when it arrived was look at the ingredients, because I suspect that 90%of the problems I have with other mascaras is all of the chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this mascara, and am interested in other products from seller</li>
            <li>It is not a thick coverage;also factor in that I&#x27;m very blonde with blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li>purpose of Invoketress 100% Natural Organic mascara is to provide gentle natural ingredients that have nourishing properties, instead of coating the lashes with harsh chemical elements.</li>
            <li>Adding a second, and then a third coat still did not clump up on me, and I didn&#x27;t have to use the eyelash curler either, something I normally use when applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so - blue eyes that are very sensitive with blonde (think albino) lashes</li>
            <li>Had to cut my hair really short until all the old hair had finally grown out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lashes stay thick and full all day with no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>and I have decided that I should have used natural mascara long ago!</li>
            <li>It separated a little, but then clumped and flaked in a fine mess.  </li>
            <li>perfume-y smell, and other than my seeing the color as more a dark brown than black</li>
            <li>There is virtually no scent in the Invoketress Beauty mascara, but there is also not a long lasting color.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive eyes or typically go for organic, vegan, natural mascara.</li>
            <li>And the mascara did not dry out in the tube after being open for awhile (we&#x27;re talking days/weeks, not months, but you shouldn&#x27;t keep an open mascara for months,</li>

            <li> Excited to have such an excellent quality mascara that is cruelty free, vegan and gluten free as well.</li>
            <li> easily,...</li>

            <li> I also was amazed at how easily it was removed with makeup remover wipes at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> It came off easily with a Olay makeup removing toilette.  </li>

            <li> and it seemed to stay on fine.</li>

            <li> I was asked to review this mascara, and since it was free, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nightmares of cheap mascaras and having them clump on and then smear all day as you wear them.  </li>

            <li> I am aware that eyelashes do go through a shedding process, but the breaking, and thinning process was sometimes so severe that I decided that it was better to have unglamorous light colored lashes, than not to have any lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li> product does have a unique smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a vegan mascara that would help strengthen my lashes-</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t have to clean up with my makeup remover pen</li>
            <li> Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is a safe and healthy alternative for fuller looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that natural makeup products are finally able to compete with the store brands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to have eyelashes again and this product is easily to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricing is fair for an all natural/organic product - I like this company&#x27;s ability and willingness to answer questions, provide ingredient lists and assure customer confidence and proper use of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It went on smoothly with no clumping, wore beautifully throughout the day with no smudging or flaking, and removed easily with my usual almond oil and cotton pad!</li>
            <li> It gives a more natural look and not very dramatic, in my opinion, but great for every day or sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> and I actually like it a lot more than most of the brands on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple sources on the internet, and the testing results, statements and opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> I have recently received my third order, and the quality of the product remains wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love to treat my lashes now and then since my lashes are not thick or</li>
            <li> It stays on all day long and although my eyelashes look just as good</li>
            <li> But I love trying new cosmetic products</li>
            <li> mascara has a typical brush comparable with the one that comes with Great Lash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this mascara go one beautifully, it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> , I highly suggest this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product!!</li>
            <li> This sample was black and went on nice and smooth, no clumps!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a great everyday option that did not irritate my eyes even with pollen/allergy issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The aromatic scent (chamomile) makes you feel calm and vitamins</li>
            <li> and I love all the natural ingredients that are used in this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to change over to gentler more natural products.</li>
            <li> One thing I liked is that I did not get mascara all over the place when I used this applicator -- only on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Parabens â€“ used as preservatives, but an excess amount is absorbed and found in the skin tissue of cancerous breast</li>
            <li> In addition, this mascara has natural plant extracts for the nourishing and conditioning properties, to help stimulate healthy lash growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> When I was asked in a a followup email by the company how I liked the mascara, I felt I should tell them that I hadn&#x27;t actually received the mascara.</li>
            <li> you know how the best mascara is when it&#x27;s a few weeks old</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands and these two are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I took it with me when I went down for vacation in Florida to put it to the ultimate test and it worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> In the US, mascara is the second most favored cosmetic for everyday wear and helps boosts self-assurance.</li>
            <li> I found was that it went on dry, yet covered my lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li> if you want a heavy layered looking eye but for a pretty and real look - it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first natural mascaras that has staying power but comes off easily and does not run.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this.</li>
            <li> No weird flakes, clumps or smudges on application</li>
            <li> Made in the US, Invoketress mascara is 100% Natural, 85% organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free and cruelty free â€“ never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but for under $20, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> No clumping, just separated and pretty.  </li>
            <li> First time trying an organic mascara.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 1-2 times a week (most of the time just once a week).</li>
            <li> There was more than enough product on the wand to coat all my lashes evenly with just one layer.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not difficult to remove like some water resistant mascara is.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> First, the mascara:</li>
            <li> It goes on without clumping, has a short wand which gives me more control applying</li>
            <li> This mascara did as well as the high-priced brands I use normally use, if not a little better.  </li>
            <li> It does not go on heavy which is great because I am blonde with finer lashes and really like a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> e makes you feel clean and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get my twenty-something lashes back, but for a baby boomer this mascara worked out very well. :)</li>
            <li> When I saw the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The applicator has a fairly blunt tip and short, straight brush which inevitably left stain on my eyes that required removal each time it was applied.  </li>
            <li> My bangs kept touching my eyelid on one side and the result was that I had a swollen red eye and a highly allergic response to the chemical in every product since.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much different this mascara would be than the normal brand I use, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
            <li> As an extra bonus, it was so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I did not expect it to be so easy to remove: it comes off (yet doesn&#x27;t run) with water and hardly leaves any smudges.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think I may have found a new favorite without any of the yuck</li>
            <li> Being somewhat of a mascara-snob, I was skeptical of a mascara that didn&#x27;t cost very much, and though I try to use as many natural products as I can, no makeup has been as good as the department store brands--until now.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear mascara for years because my eyes are so easily irritated by the common ingredients, which includes fragrance.</li>
            <li> cosmetics such as mascara, can easily deteriorate your vision, therefore it is important to know what ingredients are in daily makeup</li>
            <li> It builds upon the last coat fine</li>
            <li> Look no further, I finely found it.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it does not irritate my eyes one bit, so I feel completely fine sleeping with it on.</li>
            <li> very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not say this thickens the lashes terribly much.</li>
            <li> There are no artificial colors, preservatives, or fragrances, therefore safer for sensitive eyes and skin.  </li>
            <li> received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple sources on the internet, and the testing results, statements and opinions are</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really add length</li>
            <li> I am trying a lash enhancer, and wanted to try a really gentle and nourishing mascara.  </li>
            <li> Another unusual tidbit is this product is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> however it was a very clumpy mascara that washed off even with laughter...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking me 4 and 5 coats to get any real build up.  </li>
            <li> Although I used lash grow serums and successfully grew them back, I still had to wait a few months for my lashes to regain some length and</li>
            <li> As you might imagine, my eyelashes are pretty short right now.  </li>
            <li> is my first time using a natural mascara</li>
            <li> lashes and my eyes are very sensative that normally if I wear eye mascara my eyelids and my eyes start to itch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have older eyes (in my 50s) and had decided to stop using mascara, despite the gray lashes coming in.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> Retinyl Acetate â€“ rated as a â€˜high concernâ€™ ingredient, interferes with cellular signaling and can cause mutations in the body genes.</li>
            <li> The brush is also pretty long, which makes it easy to get all your lashes in one sweep, and helps you get to those tiny corner lashes.</li>
            <li> Right off though I did notice that the tube was smaller than a normal tube of mascara, but when I opened the tube I noticed it smelled so much nicer than what I normally use.</li>
            <li> Natural mascara gone glamorous!!</li>
            <li> The Mascara is also very light in terms of thickness, you have to apply a few coats, otherwise it is not bad, especially considering I am not putting any chemicals near my eyes.</li>
            <li> What I normally use smells like mascara</li>
            <li> After three coats my lashes still felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too.</li>
            <li> product sample received for review purposes.till felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the mascara for a few days - and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had lash extensions for the past 2 years and finally decided that as much as I loved the look, it was getting too pricey.  </li>
            <li> lashes are long but there is a lot of blonde in them, so mascara gives my eyes more definition.</li>
            <li> but I have to use it for a few more days before I can write a review about it.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t complained because it seemed like a hassle, but they were more interested in me getting the mascara than they were in haggling over where</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t run / raccoon during my workout or walk (I live in high humidity) and came off neatly with cleanser and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt ok while on, not too sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So when I was ask to try this new mascara</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have only used it a few times since I received this mascara, but it goes on nicely and separates lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> applicator was pretty standard, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes and rarely have issues with mascara.</li>
            <li> In less than a week, they were on it, and sent me &amp;#34;another&amp;#34; one for free.</li>
            <li> It apples easy, does not feel heavy or clumpy on lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the safety hazards, I had stopped wearing mascara except for very special occasions, due to the damage that mascara has formerly ruined my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> to apply with a fairly typical wand, the mascara coats the brush well, goes on smothly and there is an instant color difference in the lash - some lengthening with coat # 1, more with coat # 2.  </li>
            <li> I tried the product over the course of several days, hoping to like it better over time, however, I found that it did not perform well as a mascara which is typically used to color, separate, lengthen, strengthen or thicken eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This natural mascara even made my lashes feel soft.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any clumping, flaking, or irritation (and I wear contact lenses and have sensitive eyes).</li>
            <li> All natural, goes on well and wears well.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin that&#x27;s why I ordered organic mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Invoketress Mascara does NOT contain these toxic ingredients; their mascara is 100% natural and made with 85% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I have had no adverse  reaction thus far.</li>
            <li> Have been using natural skin products</li>
            <li> Invoketress has made a product that is natural and wearable.  </li>
            <li> 100 Natural and 85% Organic ingredients including Chamomile, Vitamin E, and Coffee Powder to nourish, condition and stimulate growth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for vegan and natural.</li>
            <li> and it did last me the whole</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because I wanted a natural mascara without all the chemicals, but that doesn&#x27;t smear or come off if I sweat.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> Soft yet makes my lashes look lush and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Therefore safe for everyday use, and there is no exposure to the harmful chemicals that are contained in commercial mascaras.</li>
            <li> Therefore safe for everyday use, and there is no exposure to the harmful chemicals that are contained in commercial mascaras.</li>
            <li> so my lashes can look nice and receive some vitamins and minerals because usaully my lashes are thin and</li>
            <li> When Invoketress Beauty contacted me and asked if I&#x27;d be willing to receive a sample of their mascara to try and then let people know what I thought, good or bad, I agreed to give mascara another</li>
            <li> mascara is black in color, I normally use &#x27;very black&#x27; when choosing a mascara shade, but this still goes on dark and made my eyes look great.</li>
            <li> - I am a huge fan of JET BLACK mascara - and while this states it is black, It seemed to be more dark brown to me -</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for soft smooth lashes, no more irritated eyes, and also the fact the item is vegan (no animals died for this product)</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no thick residue left on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be making this my new mascara.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, none of the natural ingredients caused an adverse reaction to my eyes or skin, something that often occurs with other mascara formulas.  </li>
            <li> The only downside would be it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> first thing I did when it arrived was look at the ingredients, because I suspect that 90%of the problems I have with other mascaras is all of the chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this mascara, and am interested in other products from seller</li>
            <li> It is not a thick coverage;also factor in that I&#x27;m very blonde with blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li> purpose of Invoketress 100% Natural Organic mascara is to provide gentle natural ingredients that have nourishing properties, instead of coating the lashes with harsh chemical elements.</li>
            <li> Adding a second, and then a third coat still did not clump up on me, and I didn&#x27;t have to use the eyelash curler either, something I normally use when applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so - blue eyes that are very sensitive with blonde (think albino) lashes</li>
            <li> Had to cut my hair really short until all the old hair had finally grown out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lashes stay thick and full all day with no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> and I have decided that I should have used natural mascara long ago!</li>
            <li> It separated a little, but then clumped and flaked in a fine mess.  </li>
            <li> perfume-y smell, and other than my seeing the color as more a dark brown than black</li>
            <li> There is virtually no scent in the Invoketress Beauty mascara, but there is also not a long lasting color.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive eyes or typically go for organic, vegan, natural mascara.</li>
            <li> And the mascara did not dry out in the tube after being open for awhile (we&#x27;re talking days/weeks, not months, but you shouldn&#x27;t keep an open mascara for months,</li>
            <li> My eyes don&#x27;t feel irritated and my lashes are not hard and brittle anymore like the previous mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, although this mascara does not give my lashes a dramatic effect that usually looks artificial, it instead provides a softer and prettier appearance; it darkens my lashes, enhances the length, and provides me with a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is a safe and healthy alternative for fuller looking lashes.</li>
            <li> other natural ingredients that I have not listed include rice powder, sunflower seed oil, lecithin, and bark extract.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the non toxic, organic, vegan make up and mascara due to my sensitive skin and problem with allergy.</li>
            <li> Normally after you apply mascara your lashes feel stiff like plastic.</li>
            <li> , this mascara comes in a tube that looks half the size of a regular mascara tube which is probably why it costs about half as much.</li>
            <li> Mascara is an instant beauty enhancer, which has the ability to transform plain, unnoticeable and drab looking lashes to a markedly stunning and dramatic appearance.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small and compact, does a big job tho and has a very natural look.</li>
            <li> Propylene Glycol â€“ causes skin irritation, accompanied with itching and minor pain.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t worn mascara in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I know my girl friends and other women out there who have the same problem that I have.</li>
            <li> The product did well for about an hour, but I did notice some flaking after that, which was very minor.  </li>
            <li> I typically applied a few coats for maximum coverage -- about the same as I would do with other mascaras (both natural ones and regular ones).</li>
            <li> Product was almost dry when it arrived.</li>
            <li> first noticeable thing concerning Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is the vanilla smell, which is so different from other unpleasant smelling commercial brands.</li>
            <li> Although, this mascara does not provide me with the true black dramatic color, it does darken my lashes, and it accentuates, lengthening and separates each eyelash hair.  </li>
            <li> * of the mascara off, because I woke the next morning with a little purple under my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> It is the only mascara I buy, and this company never lets me down!</li>
            <li> The formula in this tube is nearly empty because I have had to reapply it throughout the day, something I have not ever done.  </li>
            <li> I was treated for what appeared to be recurring pink eye over an 18 month period.</li>
            <li> I have spent years trying to find a mascara that I could wear.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and as expected.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural look that is hard to get with other mascara.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any eye irritation, and at the end of the day, it is the easiest to wash off, with no dark staining around my eyes, that requires the extra attention for removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any eye irritation, and at the end of the day, it is the easiest to wash off, with no dark staining around my eyes, that requires the extra attention for removal.  </li>
            <li> black color is deep black.  </li>
            <li> I honestly expected it to be just like the other mascara&#x27;s that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Now the company: due to some unknown mix-up in my order, the mascara did not come in the package I received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seller is an extremely compassionate, responsive and focused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are four common toxic ingredients found in commercial mascara:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I found that applying two coats and then putting some dark eyeshadow over it works well.</li>
            <li> eyelashes are long but thin and very blonde.  </li>
            <li> I would say my only complaint is that I do not like the shorter applicator.</li>
            <li> I only use one coat because I don&#x27;t like to lay it on thick.</li>
            <li> I was initially dissatisfied with this mascara because it did not have the thick, goopy texture I&#x27;ve always found mascaras have.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little less wet and keeps your lashes separate instead of clumping them?</li>
            <li> I typically use either Benefit or L&#x27;Oreal mascara.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the same national brands that promote our voluminous and longer lashes have toxic ingredients that absorb in our skin, which makes them potentially hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara has a slight coffee coconut smell, so I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> flaking mascara that 90 minutes in was smearing and making me look like I hadn&#x27;t slept in days and at the half day mark, I was having to remove my contacts from irritation /flaking.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter whether I bought expensive or cheap, went through a crazy amount of prep, it still always ended with the same results :</li>
            <li> I had to use a little eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The chemical ingredients from national brands ultimately are the cause for eyelashes to weaken, break, thin out, and fall, with the side effects of toxin skin absorption.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I decided I wanted to start being nicer to my skin and cut out all the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Not at all clumpy, wears well over the course of a few hours.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I usually just use vitamin mascara in black</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that the tube is very small.</li>
            <li> I have used some decent and some bad natural mascaras in the past (I hate the one from 100% Pure, for example).</li>
            <li> Essentially, although this mascara does not give my lashes a dramatic effect that usually looks artificial, it instead provides a softer and prettier appearance; it darkens my lashes, enhances the length, and provides me with a natural look.  </li>
            <li> Even though I wipe the excess off of the end of the wand every time I use it, I often have at least a little fall out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how waterproof it is.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Clinique mascara</li>
            <li> and I usually forget that I have mascara and I scratch, but I have to say that it did not happen like that with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have to scrub, but it did take a few wipes to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than some very small flaking, it stayed on well and never caused the dreaded raccoon eye.  </li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because it does smudge just a bit, but not as bad as other mascara.</li>
            <li> or if the system had broken down.</li>
            <li> Finally decided  to google for information and found out that the 7th generation baby shampoo I was using contained high amounts of that horrible chemical.  </li>
            <li> , if you wear makeup you know the smell I&#x27;m talking about, not very pleasant.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much different this mascara would be than the normal brand I use, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. Right off though I did notice that the tube was smaller than a normal tube of mascara, but when I opened the tube I noticed it smelled so much nicer than what I normally use. What I normally use smells like mascara, if you wear makeup you know the smell I&#x27;m talking about, not very pleasant. When I had my husband smell this mascara he says it smells like vanilla to him, I smell coffee with a hint of vanilla...very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is black in color, I normally use &#x27;very black&#x27; when choosing a mascara shade, but this still goes on dark and made my eyes look great. It glided on smoothly and easily,...no clumps. The brush is also pretty long, which makes it easy to get all your lashes in one sweep, and helps you get to those tiny corner lashes. Adding a second, and then a third coat still did not clump up on me, and I didn&#x27;t have to use the eyelash curler either, something I normally use when applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this doesn&#x27;t make my eyes  itch while wearing it and I love all the natural ingredients that are used in this mascara. I have been trying to change over to gentler more natural products. This natural mascara even made my lashes feel soft. Normally after you apply mascara your lashes feel stiff like plastic. After three coats my lashes still felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too. I do like this mascara, but it smudges easily after you have worn it for awhile. Not a good mascara for allergy season or sad movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample received for review purposes.till felt softer than after using my normal brand, and they looked a bit longer too. I&#x27;m not going to get my twenty-something lashes back, but for a baby boomer this mascara worked out very well. :)</li>
            <li> I have used some decent and some bad natural mascaras in the past (I hate the one from 100% Pure, for example). But I love trying new cosmetic products so I couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to test this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid mascara for daily use, I think. I definitely notice the color on my lashes and I see some lengthening. I would not say this thickens the lashes terribly much. I did not experience any clumping, flaking, or irritation (and I wear contact lenses and have sensitive eyes). And the mascara did not dry out in the tube after being open for awhile (we&#x27;re talking days/weeks, not months, but you shouldn&#x27;t keep an open mascara for months, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator was pretty standard, nothing fancy. It did pick up a fair amount of product on the tip, so I just wiped the tip on the rim of the container before applying. I typically applied a few coats for maximum coverage -- about the same as I would do with other mascaras (both natural ones and regular ones). One thing I liked is that I did not get mascara all over the place when I used this applicator -- only on my eyelashes. So I didn&#x27;t have to clean up with my makeup remover pen afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any events that allowed me to test the water-resistance of this product. It came off fairly well with some makeup remover wipes (don&#x27;t even remember the brand). The only thing that wasn&#x27;t perfect is that I guess the makeup remover wipes didn&#x27;t get *all* of the mascara off, because I woke the next morning with a little purple under my lower lash line. But, I have this issue with high-end (non-natural) mascaras, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is made in the US and is cruelty free. This doesn&#x27;t contain artificial preservatives so you would want to use it within a few months of opening to avoid bacterial contamination. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this. It&#x27;s great for wearing to the office; I get some color but don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m ready to go clubbing. If you are interested in going all natural with your cosmetics, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.ng all natural with your cosmetics, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Greatest mascara ever! I took it with me when I went down for vacation in Florida to put it to the ultimate test and it worked beautifully! No smudges!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the mascara for a few days - and I love it. All natural, goes on well and wears well.  Will definitely be making this my new mascara.</li>
            <li> so - blue eyes that are very sensitive with blonde (think albino) lashes - I am a huge fan of JET BLACK mascara - and while this states it is black, It seemed to be more dark brown to me - even after 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply with a fairly typical wand, the mascara coats the brush well, goes on smothly and there is an instant color difference in the lash - some lengthening with coat # 1, more with coat # 2.  No weird flakes, clumps or smudges on application, it didn&#x27;t run / raccoon during my workout or walk (I live in high humidity) and came off neatly with cleanser and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No perfume-y smell, and other than my seeing the color as more a dark brown than black - it&#x27;s a great everyday option that did not irritate my eyes even with pollen/allergy issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing is fair for an all natural/organic product - I like this company&#x27;s ability and willingness to answer questions, provide ingredient lists and assure customer confidence and proper use of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample product from the manufacturer for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this great product!! Goes on smoothly, not clumpy at all, looks great, and best of all----not tested on animals or harmful for the environment!! Yes!!! Very happy :)</li>
            <li> The mascara was great and did not lump up.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and I love that. I never have a problem with it bothering my contact lenses and that&#x27;s a big plus for me. I would highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I typically use either Benefit or L&#x27;Oreal mascara. I have tried many other brands and these two are my favorite. I do not have sensitive eyes or typically go for organic, vegan, natural mascara. So, this mascara was very different to me. I honestly expected it to be just like the other mascara&#x27;s that I have tried. It wasn&#x27;t and I actually like it a lot more than most of the brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara did go on light on my eyelashes. I had to apply three coats in order to be satisfied with the look. It also doesn&#x27;t curl at all, so you may want to use an eyelash curler with it (I didn&#x27;t in these photos). However, I did not have ANY fall out at all. Even though I wipe the excess off of the end of the wand every time I use it, I often have at least a little fall out. My absolute favorite thing about this mascara though was the fact that it did not feel like I had mascara on! This mascara feels light and does not flake if you touch your eyelashes. For this reason alone, I am a fan and will continue to use this mascara in my rotation. It is a great &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; mascara. I also was amazed at how easily it was removed with makeup remover wipes at the end of the night. I would recommend trying this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review*</li>
            <li> a great mascara to carry with you, it&#x27;s small and compact, does a big job tho and has a very natural look. not the thing if you want a heavy layered looking eye but for a pretty and real look - it&#x27;s great. and it doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> I got a bad allergy to it. My eyes are swollen. I have a sensitive skin that&#x27;s why I ordered organic mascara. But it is worse than none organic mascaras.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nice mascara.....goes on well and looks great.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There is virtually no scent in the Invoketress Beauty mascara, but there is also not a long lasting color.  It looks just like the photo provided with this listing, and it arrived sealed for security.  I tried the product over the course of several days, hoping to like it better over time, however, I found that it did not perform well as a mascara which is typically used to color, separate, lengthen, strengthen or thicken eyelashes.  For me, it only darkened my lashes for a very short while and if my eyes teared or became moist from the environment, the color was washed away.  It separated a little, but then clumped and flaked in a fine mess.  On a positive note, none of the natural ingredients caused an adverse reaction to my eyes or skin, something that often occurs with other mascara formulas.  The formula in this tube is nearly empty because I have had to reapply it throughout the day, something I have not ever done.  The applicator has a fairly blunt tip and short, straight brush which inevitably left stain on my eyes that required removal each time it was applied.  I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Mascara is an instant beauty enhancer, which has the ability to transform plain, unnoticeable and drab looking lashes to a markedly stunning and dramatic appearance. In the US, mascara is the second most favored cosmetic for everyday wear and helps boosts self-assurance. Unfortunately, the same national brands that promote our voluminous and longer lashes have toxic ingredients that absorb in our skin, which makes them potentially hazardous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye cosmetics such as mascara, can easily deteriorate your vision, therefore it is important to know what ingredients are in daily makeup products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are four common toxic ingredients found in commercial mascara:&lt;br /&gt;1. Parabens â€“ used as preservatives, but an excess amount is absorbed and found in the skin tissue of cancerous breast tumors.&lt;br /&gt;2. Aluminum Powder â€“ a neurotoxin considered worse than mercury; it is associated with a variety of cellular and metabolic disturbances in the nervous system and skin tissues.&lt;br /&gt;3. Propylene Glycol â€“ causes skin irritation, accompanied with itching and minor pain.&lt;br /&gt;4. Retinyl Acetate â€“ rated as a â€˜high concernâ€™ ingredient, interferes with cellular signaling and can cause mutations in the body genes. This toxic ingredient is now restricted and prohibited in Canadian cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the safety hazards, I had stopped wearing mascara except for very special occasions, due to the damage that mascara has formerly ruined my eyelashes.  I am aware that eyelashes do go through a shedding process, but the breaking, and thinning process was sometimes so severe that I decided that it was better to have unglamorous light colored lashes, than not to have any lashes at all.  Although I used lash grow serums and successfully grew them back, I still had to wait a few months for my lashes to regain some length and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress Mascara does NOT contain these toxic ingredients; their mascara is 100% natural and made with 85% organic ingredients. There are no artificial colors, preservatives, or fragrances, therefore safer for sensitive eyes and skin.  In addition, this mascara has natural plant extracts for the nourishing and conditioning properties, to help stimulate healthy lash growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress mascara contains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile â€“ is a soothing plant extract that fights inflammation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E â€“ may help to accelerate eyelash growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oregano â€“ has antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thyme â€“ antiseptic and anti-bacterial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee Powder â€“ aside from a natural coloring agent, coffee has incredible properties, one of which is an anti-oxidant, calms and soothes redness caused by inflammation, has anti-aging properties, and is beneficial for skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamon â€“ anti-bacterial properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary - antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, helps to condition lashes and there are reports of increased length and fullness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit- strong antibacterial and antioxidant properties that condition and stimulate lash growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other natural ingredients that I have not listed include rice powder, sunflower seed oil, lecithin, and bark extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of Invoketress 100% Natural Organic mascara is to provide gentle natural ingredients that have nourishing properties, instead of coating the lashes with harsh chemical elements. The chemical ingredients from national brands ultimately are the cause for eyelashes to weaken, break, thin out, and fall, with the side effects of toxin skin absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;The first noticeable thing concerning Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is the vanilla smell, which is so different from other unpleasant smelling commercial brands. Although, this mascara does not provide me with the true black dramatic color, it does darken my lashes, and it accentuates, lengthening and separates each eyelash hair.  There is no clumping or flaking that leave smears and smudges, therefore I do not experience the embarrassing effect of â€˜raccoon eyesâ€™.  The mascara does not have a sticky feeling, and when I casually rub my eye, there is no transfer of color.  I have not experienced any eye irritation, and at the end of the day, it is the easiest to wash off, with no dark staining around my eyes, that requires the extra attention for removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, although this mascara does not give my lashes a dramatic effect that usually looks artificial, it instead provides a softer and prettier appearance; it darkens my lashes, enhances the length, and provides me with a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invoketress Natural and Organic mascara is a safe and healthy alternative for fuller looking lashes. It smells delicious, it is smudge proof, with nourishing and anti-oxidant plant extracts to prevent breaking, thinning and extra shedding.  Therefore safe for everyday use, and there is no exposure to the harmful chemicals that are contained in commercial mascaras. Made in the US, Invoketress mascara is 100% Natural, 85% organic, Vegan, Gluten-Free and cruelty free â€“ never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple sources on the internet, and the testing results, statements and opinions are my own.not have a sticky feeling, and when I casually rub my eye, there is no transfer of color.

            <li> I am allergic to methylisothiazolinone. I was treated for what appeared to be recurring pink eye over an 18 month period. Finally decided  to google for information and found out that the 7th generation baby shampoo I was using contained high amounts of that horrible chemical.  My bangs kept touching my eyelid on one side and the result was that I had a swollen red eye and a highly allergic response to the chemical in every product since.  Methylisothiazolinone is  in mascara, shampoos, laundry detergents,etc.  It took months after I switched to basic Castile soap and no mascara to heal. Had to cut my hair really short until all the old hair had finally grown out. It was a leap of faith to try this mascara and I have had no adverse  reaction thus far. It is not a thick coverage;also factor in that I&#x27;m very blonde with blonde lashes.  I found that applying two coats and then putting some dark eyeshadow over it works well. My eyeshadow hasn&#x27;t caused a reaction, so it seems to be ok. The mascara has a slight coffee coconut smell, so I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Being somewhat of a mascara-snob, I was skeptical of a mascara that didn&#x27;t cost very much, and though I try to use as many natural products as I can, no makeup has been as good as the department store brands--until now.  I was asked to review this mascara, and since it was free, I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found was that it went on dry, yet covered my lashes nicely.  Seems like I&#x27;m always having to choose between a mascara that covers and thickens my lashes, and one that goes on in clumps.  This mascara did as well as the high-priced brands I use normally use, if not a little better.  Iw as amazed.  I have nightmares of cheap mascaras and having them clump on and then smear all day as you wear them.  Of applicators that seemed to make my lashes stick together so it looked like I had only five actually lashes(I&#x27;m sure every woman who uses mascaras knows what I&#x27;m talking about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this mascara go one beautifully, it has all natural ingredients.  And as much as I love my pricey department store mascaras, I DO NOT want to know what kind of voodoo they put into them.  I&#x27;m glad to see that natural makeup products are finally able to compete with the store brands.  I will definitely be buying this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final comment, this mascara comes in a tube that looks half the size of a regular mascara tube which is probably why it costs about half as much. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but for under $20, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!  I love it, it smells delicious and does not bother by eyes as I wear contacts.  Will use this forever!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loved it, and the price is excellent</li>
            <li> Great product and glad to have a mascara that is actually good for my lashes!  Have been using natural skin products but this is the perfect addition.  It does not go on heavy which is great because I am blonde with finer lashes and really like a more natural look.  No clumping, just separated and pretty.  Stays on well and I have decided that I should have used natural mascara long ago!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first natural mascaras that has staying power but comes off easily and does not run. My only negative comment is that the tube is very small. It gives a more natural look and not very dramatic, in my opinion, but great for every day or sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have only used it a few times since I received this mascara, but it goes on nicely and separates lashes. It builds upon the last coat fine (I only put on 2 coats though). I also love that it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes if I get any tears at all! Overall, I think I may have found a new favorite without any of the yuck I don&#x27;t need or want!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery. I have used it once already &amp; it looked great! It smells really good!  Loving the fact that it&#x27;s organic!</li>
            <li> Free product provided for testing and reivew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara has a typical brush comparable with the one that comes with Great Lash.  It colors well.  I found that it did best with 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;The black color is deep black.  The product did well for about an hour, but I did notice some flaking after that, which was very minor.  It did not smudge at all on me.  It felt ok while on, not too sticky or stiff.  It came off easily with a Olay makeup removing toilette.  I did not have to scrub, but it did take a few wipes to get it all.&lt;br /&gt;Other than some very small flaking, it stayed on well and never caused the dreaded raccoon eye.  I found it wore well but it did need some touching up in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are long but thin and very blonde.  It colored well and thickened a bit.  It didn&#x27;t really add length but it did help what was there to show up.  The wand does little to curl lashes, so for my best results, I&#x27;ve added a curler and made sure to do 2 coats, with a bit of drying time between coats.</li>
            <li> First time trying an organic mascara.  I love the way it goes on.  It separates and defines my lashes beautifully.  The only downside would be it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  I need to reapply it in the afternoon/evening.  With that being said, I love everything else about it!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a natural mascara and I must say, I&#x27;m impressed. This performed almost as good as high-end mascaras that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m not a big mascara wearer. I only use it 1-2 times a week (most of the time just once a week). I tested it out on Sunday to see how it would hold up. It is very easy to apply. I only use one coat because I don&#x27;t like to lay it on thick. A light coating is all I need or want. There was more than enough product on the wand to coat all my lashes evenly with just one layer. I didn&#x27;t need to add anymore. I was happy with the one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a unique smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I was away from home for about 4 hours and the mascara did not smudge or wear off. I didn&#x27;t get any water on my eyes so I&#x27;m not sure how waterproof it is. I then washed my face to take a nap and it didn&#x27;t come off all the way with just my regular cleanser. I had to use a little eye makeup remover. It came off very easily with that and a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I have no complaints. I did not experience any flaking, smudging, irritation or difficulty removing it. As others have mentioned, not it doesn&#x27;t have a fancy wand, but it&#x27;s suffice. I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Sets perfectly without lumps ... I am in love with it :)</li>
            <li> I have had lash extensions for the past 2 years and finally decided that as much as I loved the look, it was getting too pricey.  As you might imagine, my eyelashes are pretty short right now.  I am trying a lash enhancer, and wanted to try a really gentle and nourishing mascara.  I am really happy with Endlessly Beautiful Natural Mascara.  It applies and removes easily, and it doesn&#x27;t clump or smudge.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> great product. wish it came in colors</li>
            <li> I like it for a daily wear, but not for going out. It is very light.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have very sensitive eyes so I haven&#x27;t worn mascara in a long time.  I tried this product and it did not hurt or burn my eyes, has a slightly nice scent.  I will buy this product again and am telling everyone I know about this product.  Finally.....Invoketress has made a product that is natural and wearable.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had given up on mascara. It didn&#x27;t matter whether I bought expensive or cheap, went through a crazy amount of prep, it still always ended with the same results :flaking mascara that 90 minutes in was smearing and making me look like I hadn&#x27;t slept in days and at the half day mark, I was having to remove my contacts from irritation /flaking. When Invoketress Beauty contacted me and asked if I&#x27;d be willing to receive a sample of their mascara to try and then let people know what I thought, good or bad, I agreed to give mascara another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did when it arrived was look at the ingredients, because I suspect that 90%of the problems I have with other mascaras is all of the chemicals in them. And it doesn&#x27;t matter if it was from the dollar store or a $65 tube from Foofy Elite Brand shop, I ended up with the same results.  What is in the Invoketress Mascara?  100 Natural and 85% Organic ingredients including Chamomile, Vitamin E, and Coffee Powder to nourish, condition and stimulate growth. Another unusual tidbit is this product is made in the USA.  It&#x27;s also Vegan and Gluten Free, and no animal testing. This made me feel good about the product before I even used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are long but there is a lot of blonde in them, so mascara gives my eyes more definition. This sample was black and went on nice and smooth, no clumps! The best part is that I&#x27;m able to wear it every day, all day with NO smearing, no flaking, no irritated contacts. But it&#x27;s not difficult to remove like some water resistant mascara is. In shirt:I like it and have no reservations in recommending it.</li>
            <li> The wand design is very basic and could do with some upgrading. The Mascara is also very light in terms of thickness, you have to apply a few coats, otherwise it is not bad, especially considering I am not putting any chemicals near my eyes.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really pleased. I have older eyes (in my 50s) and had decided to stop using mascara, despite the gray lashes coming in. When I saw the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. I wore it all day today  and have no complaints. It stayed put, went on smoothly, smells fresh, came off when I wanted it to with water or make up remover wipe</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a vegan mascara that would help strengthen my lashes- however it was a very clumpy mascara that washed off even with laughter... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. But I commend the company for trying</li>
            <li> Natural mascara gone glamorous!!</li>
            <li> I like that it smells nice and does not clump my lashes. I also notice that when I wash it off at the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes fall out like store-bought mascara does. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My lashes feel nourished. I was looking for vegan and natural. That is exactly what I got. My eyes don&#x27;t feel irritated and my lashes are not hard and brittle anymore like the previous mascaras I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;re looking for soft smooth lashes, no more irritated eyes, and also the fact the item is vegan (no animals died for this product), I highly suggest this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> I have spent years trying to find a mascara that I could wear. I thought it was hopeless, but I kept trying.  I discovered Naturally Beautiful. I was not disappointed. It was easy to apply,no clumps or globs. It was so easy that I put it on my bottom lashes, something I have not done for years! My lashes looked fabulous and it lasted all day with no burning, stinging,or itching. As an extra bonus, it was so easy to remove. I will buy this product again and again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Would definitely recommend it.  I usually wear Clinique mascara but I decided I wanted to start being nicer to my skin and cut out all the harsh chemicals.  This product is wonderful!!! It stays on all day long and although my eyelashes look just as good there&#x27;s no thick residue left on my lashes.  I would most definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This natural mascara is OUTSTANDING!!!  Seems to nourish lashes nicely, and does not smudge. Excited to have such an excellent quality mascara that is cruelty free, vegan and gluten free as well. So important !!! Seller is an extremely compassionate, responsive and focused. I will continue to buy this mascara, and am interested in other products from seller</li>
            <li> I love to treat my lashes now and then since my lashes are not thick or long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I usually just use vitamin mascara in black so my lashes can look nice and receive some vitamins and minerals because usaully my lashes are thin and sensative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I was ask to try this new mascara I was excited. Because I did some research and I love what its made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me tell you that I have use this mascara and I am loving it. It goes smooth on my lashes and it does not bulk and it slides the mascara evenly on my lashes as well it did not even smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes and my eyes are very sensative that normally if I wear eye mascara my eyelids and my eyes start to itch and I usually forget that I have mascara and I scratch, but I have to say that it did not happen like that with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I love that it is water proof and it did last me the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is 100% natural, organic, vegan and gluten free. It nourishes and enrich with chamomile and vitamin E which is perfect for my eyelashes, as well it is cruelty free and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains coffee powder which helps in stimulating your lashes to grow.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, all opinions are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear mascara for years because my eyes are so easily irritated by the common ingredients, which includes fragrance. I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years. Then I found this! It&#x27;s fun to have eyelashes again and this product is easily to apply and lasts all day. Thank you so much for this product!!</li>
            <li> Not so happy with this product.  It&#x27;s taking me 4 and 5 coats to get any real build up.  Could just be an off tube but disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because I wanted a natural mascara without all the chemicals, but that doesn&#x27;t smear or come off if I sweat. I wore it running in the heat and it seemed to stay on fine. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and comes off easily with makeup remover. I would say my only complaint is that I do not like the shorter applicator. I think if it were longer, it would be easier to handle to apply the mascara. Other than that, I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> After the first used of mascara... I had a  good feeling about this mascara but I have to use it for a few more days before I can write a review about it. I love it...It apples easy, does not feel heavy or clumpy on lashes. The aromatic scent (chamomile) makes you feel calm and vitamins e makes you feel clean and natural. I have been searching for the non toxic, organic, vegan make up and mascara due to my sensitive skin and problem with allergy. I know my girl friends and other women out there who have the same problem that I have. Look no further, I finely found it. It makes you feel clean, clear and good about yourself.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good. No clumping, stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is great mascara</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.</li>
            <li> I was initially dissatisfied with this mascara because it did not have the thick, goopy texture I&#x27;ve always found mascaras have. However, after a couple days, I realized it has many benefits. Most importantly for my preferences, the kind of volume I wanted can easily be achieved with two coats. Any way it&#x27;s applied looks quite &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as it follows the shape of your lashes to the tips. What&#x27;s more, I did not expect it to be so easy to remove: it comes off (yet doesn&#x27;t run) with water and hardly leaves any smudges. Lastly, it does not irritate my eyes one bit, so I feel completely fine sleeping with it on. The yummy smell is a trivial but pleasing bonus. :-)</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate or hurt my lashes.  Washes off nicely, but stays on during the day.  Delivery was prompt and as expected.</li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE this mascara.  It does not irritate my eyes and washes off very easily and also lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this mascara and the company that makes it! First, the mascara: It went on smoothly with no clumping, wore beautifully throughout the day with no smudging or flaking, and removed easily with my usual almond oil and cotton pad! Great stuff. Now the company: due to some unknown mix-up in my order, the mascara did not come in the package I received from Amazon. When I was asked in a a followup email by the company how I liked the mascara, I felt I should tell them that I hadn&#x27;t actually received the mascara. In less than a week, they were on it, and sent me &amp;#34;another&amp;#34; one for free. You have to like people who do business this way. I hadn&#x27;t complained because it seemed like a hassle, but they were more interested in me getting the mascara than they were in haggling over where or if the system had broken down. Integrity. It makes a difference.  UPDATE: This is the only mascara I buy! I have recently received my third order, and the quality of the product remains wonderful! I am so happy to have a product and a company I can depend on to deliver! Update: How many years have I been using this? It is the only mascara I buy, and this company never lets me down!</li>
            <li> Product was almost dry when it arrived. Instantly flaked and clumped when I put it on. I have naturally long lashes and rarely have issues with mascara. Sending back.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look very lush and smells wonderful! And, the ingredients are health-fulfilling.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! I only gave 4 stars because it does smudge just a bit, but not as bad as other mascara. I will keep using it, as it is just a bit of smudge that can be easily swiped away.</li>
            <li> Clumps a little&lt;br /&gt;Make lashes look longer and fuller</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I wanted something natural. It does lengthen my lashes and add a bit of volume. Overall, very pleased with this purchase, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Soft yet makes my lashes look lush and thick.&lt;br /&gt;I wear daily wear contact lenses  and finally have found a mascara that I can wear contacts with.&lt;br /&gt;Lashes stay thick and full all day with no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Plus does not smudge or run.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove too.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> Hope it organic as it says. It goes on well. It stays on well. It washes of well. But a very subtle look.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very happy with product. Not at all clumpy, wears well over the course of a few hours.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives a natural look that is hard to get with other mascara. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> it smells soooo good.  you know how the best mascara is when it&#x27;s a few weeks old so it&#x27;s a little less wet and keeps your lashes separate instead of clumping them? this is like that from the beginning. love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this mascara.  It goes on without clumping, has a short wand which gives me more control applying and it lasts all day without smudging. This was a great find!</li>
