            <li>just make sure you use a moisturizer that is oil free</li>
            <li>Good Product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a perfect 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li>Too strong and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Too strong irritated skin</li>
            <li>For a good ten year span, I regularly saw a dermatologist who put me on antibiotic treatments that were very successful in treating the acne.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I came across this Rugby product and it has cleared up my acne!</li>
            <li>It is incredibly drying, as is to be expected, so you&#x27;ll want to invest in a pore-friendly moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for breakouts on your back and chest area.</li>
            <li>Good job so far...</li>
            <li>Because of this, it&#x27;s usually better to use it at night, right before you go to bed.   </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t wear any make up to cover the acne while you are doing the treatment, the face have to be clean with the product on only!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is super cheap</li>
            <li>I was super excited</li>
            <li>My skin turned bright red wherever I used this product.</li>
            <li>other item that I&#x27;ve found works great is PanOxyl, from Stiefel Labs.  </li>
            <li>The B5 dries up the oil from the inside and this particular brand does a great job taking care of it from the outside.</li>
            <li>I run out of it, I will definitely buy more again!</li>
            <li>Thanks seller!!</li>
            <li>It works great on both face and body acne, but like all benzoyl peroxide meds, it is very drying and bleaching to tread carefully.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really effective neutrogena on spot big fan for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will update post after one weeks worth of using product.  </li>
            <li>Give it a shot; definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have not had any new breakouts, and it very quickly penetrated and eliminated the one gigantic pimple that I did have.  </li>
            <li>Great product I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years consistently.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; just as well as the more expensive brand name ones that a come in sets with face wash, toner, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>bought for daughter so far its good will update later  in about a month .not</li>
            <li>Hey, for the first time I don&#x27;t have pimples.</li>
            <li>And boy did it work fast!</li>
            <li>Beware that it dries your skin out ALOT the first day or two, so be sure to keep a facial moisturizer nearby.</li>
            <li>It DID clear up most of my acne but the constant &#x27;burning&#x27; of my skin and the dryness that it caused wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>In 3 days most of the pimples were getting dry.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed my areas treated being more dry..  </li>
            <li>but I was still having breakouts/oily skin not as much as before,so</li>
            <li>so I guess not too much lost.</li>
            <li>I have even tried using nothing but water and done the whole proactive thing.</li>
            <li>It is very drying</li>
            <li>I even tried using it with intense lotion afterwards and my face would always feel like sandpaper afterwards.</li>
            <li>Even if it was reallly fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that really work in a 40 y.o. acne</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t so much recommend for all over treatment on the face</li>
            <li>Thanks^^</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work better than any other benzoyl peroxide product.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it works faster and better then any other acne products.</li>
            <li>Or if you do, make sure to not put any on your forehead, because it&#x27;ll basically run down your forehead, and into your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since I was about 14-15 years old, like one really huge deep multi-pocketed cyst that takes weeks to go away</li>
            <li>The main areas of my face that break out are in my T region.</li>
            <li>Works on mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>Finally, I ditched all the acne treatments and kits, switched to &amp;#34;Cetaphil antibacterial gentle cleansing bar&amp;#34; for washing my face and this product &amp;#34;Ruby Acne Medication 10%&amp;#34; for treatment, and my face is finally COMPLETELY clear after a full two years of struggling.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear!!</li>
            <li>If anyone wants clear skin, I highly recommened this Acene Medication.</li>
            <li>Its the only acne med worth my money</li>
            <li>However, with my new insurance, I can no longer afford the medications, which often are in the $200+ range for a two month supply.  </li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old that has stuggled with acne since high school.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely gone!</li>
            <li>My skin was irritated and red and hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>product last a little bit more than the liquid product.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I found this I have not used anything else to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I had stubborn adult acne pimples on my forehead,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Depends on how sensitive your skin is and the effects.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I used to use OXY 10, which worked really well for me up until recently when they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>feels good to know I don&#x27;t have to use antibiotics and expensive creams anymore.  </li>
            <li>some new deep cyst starts to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clear gel formula will not leave your face white or greasy.</li>
            <li>I am a 19 year old female that has never struggled with any sort of acne until I was in college.</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice daily along with a soft cleanser and moisturizer (from Acne.org).</li>
            <li>I barely ordered it like 3 days ago, wasn&#x27;t expecting it soooo soon.</li>
            <li>Due to a medication I am taking my skin has became excessively oily and thus prone to having more breakouts.</li>
            <li>The first night I apply all over my acne problem areas and the next morning my face was all red ...super red and dry..</li>
            <li>It took only one week to get rid of small pimples and couple big red sore ones, so after two weeks my skin got all smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t have to wait for the usual time, which is like a a week and a half.</li>
            <li>Then when your acne is gone, use it only if you get pimples, put some cream only in the pimples everyday until they are gone!!! :]</li>
            <li>the other side this product does dry skin very much as it says on description</li>
            <li>It definitely has helped clear up the majority of the pimples, but it caused my skin to peel, flake, and dry out.</li>
            <li>I used this for a few days combined with an exfoliating natural scrub and some Cerave moisturizer and my face is finally clear!</li>

            <li> It took only one week to get rid of small pimples and couple big red sore ones, so after two weeks my skin got all smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t have to wait for the usual time, which is like a a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Then when your acne is gone, use it only if you get pimples, put some cream only in the pimples everyday until they are gone!!! :]</li>
            <li> the other side this product does dry skin very much as it says on description</li>
            <li> It definitely has helped clear up the majority of the pimples, but it caused my skin to peel, flake, and dry out.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few days combined with an exfoliating natural scrub and some Cerave moisturizer and my face is finally clear!</li>
            <li> The only caveat about this medication is that it tends to leave your skin really dry, even if you use it only once a day.</li>
            <li> I was struggling with acne for a long time and tried all kinds of &amp;#34;anti-acne&amp;#34; cosmetics care and non of them seemed to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I joined the Military that I was prescribed this 10% Benzol Peroxide cream from Rugby that I finally found something that worked.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it can irritate/dry your skin out if you use it too often (multiple times a day).</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed wait for it to dry then wipe off.</li>
            <li> works well and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out....</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin out</li>
            <li> my face was this clear and it has calmed my usually oily skin.</li>
            <li> Also a bigger tube for much less money.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been stocking up on these little bottles and when I use it everyday after shaving, my skin is 100% clear.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since puberty and I am now a 27 year old woman who has literally tried everything... from natural products to expensive prescription treatments...</li>
            <li> Since once you will run out and you will need to wait a few days for the next to be shipped.</li>
            <li> Be warned, though: the 10% content means your clothing and sheets WILL bleach if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I tried tee tree oil, salicylic acid, other benzyl peroxide based products, and vanishing creams and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other product containing benzoyl peroxide before.</li>
            <li> I suffered from moderate acne for the past 10 years of my life now, and I need benzoyl peroxide to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> It can cause your skin to become a little dry but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it at night and moisture at night every other day and use it every other day and if dark spot stop it and moisturize I use some clearing moisturizer to help the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I started to combine it with a moisturizer and stopped using it because of the dark spot it was putting all over my face.</li>
            <li> Thank God they are going away yet that was not fun to see.</li>
            <li> I only used a very small amount after this to prevent the drying effects.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if it didn&#x27;t have such horrible side effects of my face.</li>
            <li> It cleared everything up in less than 2 weeks and ever since this is my number one product for acne.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use any heavy foundation to cover previous disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At night, I use a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always had a little problem with acne</li>
            <li> And I mean, really dry.</li>
            <li> , so I used it once day before going to sleep and every few days I scrub my skin to remove all dead skin cell, to moisture skin where I used this product I use oil-free cream in the morning and sun screen spf 50 to protect it when I go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with some hideous acne on my chin and jaw line, so decided to purchase product a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> A few stubborn pimples remain, but it does help.</li>
            <li> Rub your hand across your face, and you&#x27;ll pick up some dead skin, sort of like rubbing an eraser on a piece of paper.  </li>
            <li> If you have a severe acne I recommend to use this product for a 3 months treatment, everyday using it 3 times per day.</li>
            <li> I am using a combination of products for effects and haven&#x27;t used this one for a few days.</li>
            <li> Also combined with in-grown hairs from shaving everyday, I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li> every few days keeps my combination skin from freaking out.</li>
            <li> On my forehead I get small whiteheads that are quite noticeable even when wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Around my nose I get the usual blackheads.</li>
            <li> I did I am hoping to use on body and on face after a while again to see I am not sure yet</li>
            <li> During the day, I use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> It works for acne by drying it up, but it seems very harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> My back was getting worse and worse using all products recommended and nothing worked like this Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> At least, it didn&#x27;t feel that way.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly bad acne, and this is the only benzoyl peroxide product that works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they i broke out like crazy and got a rash.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the size: 1.5 oz, very difficult size to find.  </li>
            <li> but it was so bad that I talked to my doctor</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have this horrible HORRIBLE problem of picking.</li>
            <li> Unless you have terrible acne</li>

            <li> I was struggling with acne for a long time and tried all kinds of &amp;#34;anti-acne&amp;#34; cosmetics care and non of them seemed to work. But when I tried this one, Oh my god! It took only one week to get rid of small pimples and couple big red sore ones, so after two weeks my skin got all smooth and I don&#x27;t need to use any heavy foundation to cover previous disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side this product does dry skin very much as it says on description, so I used it once day before going to sleep and every few days I scrub my skin to remove all dead skin cell, to moisture skin where I used this product I use oil-free cream in the morning and sun screen spf 50 to protect it when I go outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out of it, I will definitely buy more again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with some hideous acne on my chin and jaw line, so decided to purchase product a few weeks ago. It definitely has helped clear up the majority of the pimples, but it caused my skin to peel, flake, and dry out. I only used a very small amount after this to prevent the drying effects. A few stubborn pimples remain, but it does help.</li>
            <li> The product has worked well with my face and I do not have razor bump.  When I shave I no longer cut myself and I am quite happy!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work better than any other benzoyl peroxide product. Better off buying zapzyt at Walmart so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to be mailed.</li>
            <li> Hey, for the first time I don&#x27;t have pimples. Stunning. The only caveat about this medication is that it tends to leave your skin really dry, even if you use it only once a day. And I mean, really dry. Rub your hand across your face, and you&#x27;ll pick up some dead skin, sort of like rubbing an eraser on a piece of paper.  Because of this, it&#x27;s usually better to use it at night, right before you go to bed.   Another recommendation is to not use this before taking a shower. Or if you do, make sure to not put any on your forehead, because it&#x27;ll basically run down your forehead, and into your eyes. It doesn&#x27;t dilute along the way either. At least, it didn&#x27;t feel that way.  I recommend washing your fingers too with lots of soap and water, just in case you feel like scratching your eyes or putting on your contacts afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; just as well as the more expensive brand name ones that a come in sets with face wash, toner, moisturizer.  Also a bigger tube for much less money.</li>
            <li> If anyone wants clear skin, I highly recommened this Acene Medication. This product does work. I have tried many acne medication and this one work the best!!</li>
            <li> This is the most essentail part of my facewashing routine. Product works well and this is a great price compared to in-store.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing!!!!!  I had stubborn adult acne pimples on my forehead, that despite a myriad of different product uses, just would not go away.  I tried tee tree oil, salicylic acid, other benzyl peroxide based products, and vanishing creams and nothing worked.  Finally, I ditched all the acne treatments and kits, switched to &amp;#34;Cetaphil antibacterial gentle cleansing bar&amp;#34; for washing my face and this product &amp;#34;Ruby Acne Medication 10%&amp;#34; for treatment, and my face is finally COMPLETELY clear after a full two years of struggling.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, and I have stocked up so I don&#x27;t run out.  I pray it never goes off the market.</li>
            <li> I like the product. My skin got better but I was still having breakouts/oily skin not as much as before,so I could see a difference. Am I buying again? Yes, because it is the best product I have found that is over the counter. I do wish I could get it stronger then just 10%.</li>
            <li> Good Product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I am a 19 year old female that has never struggled with any sort of acne until I was in college. Due to a medication I am taking my skin has became excessively oily and thus prone to having more breakouts. The main areas of my face that break out are in my T region. On my forehead I get small whiteheads that are quite noticeable even when wearing makeup. Around my nose I get the usual blackheads. On my chin I have whiteheads as well. After one use of this product all the acne in my problem areas got noticeably smaller. After just 4 applications my skin has looked better than ever! I put it on before bed wait for it to dry then wipe off. It can cause your skin to become a little dry but just make sure you use a moisturizer that is oil free and you&#x27;ll be set. This product is honestly a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> works well and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out....just have the occasional pimple but when I get them I want them gone...this product does it!</li>
            <li> This benzoyl peroxide cream is great for spot treatment. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used to get rid of pimples.</li>
            <li> My son is 15 and has cystic acne. I have done a ton of research and what is working for him is mega dosing of B5 (pantothenic acid) and this product. The B5 dries up the oil from the inside and this particular brand does a great job taking care of it from the outside. It has me convinced that not all benzoyl peroxide products are equal.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product for people that have severe acne &amp; get acne all the time too. If you have a severe acne I recommend to use this product for a 3 months treatment, everyday using it 3 times per day. Then when your acne is gone, use it only if you get pimples, put some cream only in the pimples everyday until they are gone!!! :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something very important, you have to be patient!! Also, don&#x27;t wear any make up to cover the acne while you are doing the treatment, the face have to be clean with the product on only!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck you guys, hope this product is effective as much as it was for me &amp; still is!!! :]</li>
            <li> My skin turned bright red wherever I used this product. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other product containing benzoyl peroxide before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from cystic acne for years--usually just one or two at a time, but the pimples are very deep and leave embarrassing marks.  For a good ten year span, I regularly saw a dermatologist who put me on antibiotic treatments that were very successful in treating the acne.  However, with my new insurance, I can no longer afford the medications, which often are in the $200+ range for a two month supply.  So, it&#x27;s back to the OTCs for me.  I wanted a spot benzoyl peroxide treatment and this product works beautifully.  It is incredibly drying, as is to be expected, so you&#x27;ll want to invest in a pore-friendly moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve also found that using the Neutrogena Micdermabrasion system also helps to exfoliate away the dryness.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have not had any new breakouts, and it very quickly penetrated and eliminated the one gigantic pimple that I did have.  I&#x27;m sure this will not be foolproof, as none of these OTC or even the prescription medications are.  But Rugby 10% is a very good item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other item that I&#x27;ve found works great is PanOxyl, from Stiefel Labs.  It works great on both face and body acne, but like all benzoyl peroxide meds, it is very drying and bleaching to tread carefully.</li>
            <li> It seems like it was working I started to combine it with a moisturizer and stopped using it because of the dark spot it was putting all over my face. Thank God they are going away yet that was not fun to see. I have to say the pimples are clearing yet I am using a combination of products for effects and haven&#x27;t used this one for a few days. It does not hurt to give it a try I did I am hoping to use on body and on face after a while again to see I am not sure yet I am using something else that&#x27;s really effective neutrogena on spot big fan for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depends on how sensitive your skin is and the effects. I&#x27;d recommend it at night and moisture at night every other day and use it every other day and if dark spot stop it and moisturize I use some clearing moisturizer to help the dark spots. If not use it on body. Another thing also use it only on the pimple I think I was putting it all over maybe use a swab and put it only on pimples and see once I start using again that&#x27;s what I may have to do when I put it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps ditto and cheers!!!</li>
            <li> Too strong and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> It works for acne by drying it up, but it seems very harsh on the skin. I didn&#x27;t like how it made my skin feel, and actually prefer not treating my acne as opposed to using this.</li>
            <li> I say goodbye to the acne with this product. For my it deserves more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It took 6-8 weeks to work. Works on mild to moderate acne. Would recommend to others. Will Buy again. Good</li>
            <li> It....... Actually..... Works...... So happy :)&lt;br /&gt;But beware, you will probably need to use a moisturizer along with this cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since I was about 14-15 years old, like one really huge deep multi-pocketed cyst that takes weeks to go away and then often can leave a scar. Also combined with in-grown hairs from shaving everyday, I&#x27;ve tried it all. Literally every over the counter cream/oil/wash/whatever from pro-active to oxy/nutragina/ect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I joined the Military that I was prescribed this 10% Benzol Peroxide cream from Rugby that I finally found something that worked. And boy did it work fast! Within 24 hours my giant blemish is 50% of it&#x27;s size, another day or two and it&#x27;s completely gone! Since then I have been stocking up on these little bottles and when I use it everyday after shaving, my skin is 100% clear. If I happen to forget to use it for a couple day&#x27;s, almost like clockwork some new deep cyst starts to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works for me and I&#x27;ve tried just about every product under the sun. And when you don&#x27;t use it or stop using it, it shows, the difference is night and day. Be careful, it can irritate/dry your skin out if you use it too often (multiple times a day). Also wash your hands/fingers after touching it. This stuff WILL bleach your clothing white so don&#x27;t rub your collar on your face and such.</li>
            <li> Do not use, it ruined my face</li>
            <li> all the reviews made me think this product would be the end to all my problems. I will say that when I break out it is because I am so stressed out and I have this horrible HORRIBLE problem of picking. BUttttttttttt, it rally has done nothing for me. It is super cheap so I guess not too much lost.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since puberty and I am now a 27 year old woman who has literally tried everything... from natural products to expensive prescription treatments...nothing has worked in any combination. I have even tried using nothing but water and done the whole proactive thing. I used this for a few days combined with an exfoliating natural scrub and some Cerave moisturizer and my face is finally clear! This took care of everything from the tiny blackheads to the giant pimples that surface under the skin. I just put it on once or twice daily on anything forming and it knocks it out of the water. I&#x27;m thrilled to find it. My skin has never been this clear!! It is very drying and I find that moisturizing every few days keeps my combination skin from freaking out. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This medicine is so so. I would like it better if it didn&#x27;t have such horrible side effects of my face. The first night I used it, I rubbed it in small areas of my face that were breaking out and the next morning I woke up with chemical  burns on my face from it. My skin was irritated and red and hot to the touch. It DID clear up most of my acne but the constant &#x27;burning&#x27; of my skin and the dryness that it caused wasn&#x27;t worth it. I even tried using it with intense lotion afterwards and my face would always feel like sandpaper afterwards. Unless you have terrible acne I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting the 10% one because it will probably fry your face like it did to mine.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. DOES NOT VANISH AS IT SAYS ON PACKAGE. Although it is a Gel and only Gels vanish,  not this manufacturer.  I bought it for the size: 1.5 oz, very difficult size to find.  Stick with 1 oz Clearasil.</li>
            <li> Awsome acne product&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had severe acne for years and since she has used this she is 95 percent  better.  Love it</li>
            <li> My face cleared up for about a day but they i broke out like crazy and got a rash. Yeah, I know it was partly an allergic reaction but i would expect more.</li>
            <li> This was a great product, it does go fast so i recommend to order more then one. Since once you will run out and you will need to wait a few days for the next to be shipped. I dont like to wait. Even if it was reallly fast shipping. Order and check out how great it is. Thanks seller!! Will order again</li>
            <li> I have used 10% bp before and it didn&#x27;t burn my face. I read all the good reviews in ordered it. The first night I apply all over my acne problem areas and the next morning my face was all red ...super red and dry.. I was super excited but wen I saw my face now I gotta worry about my scars and redness...</li>
            <li> Very good product and it does what suppose to do. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too strong irritated skin</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. I have been looking for something that really work in a 40 y.o. acne and I finally found it. My skin is very oily, so I have not gotten harsh dryness. My back was getting worse and worse using all products recommended and nothing worked like this Benzoyl Peroxide. In 3 days most of the pimples were getting dry. I have to admit that I had to go and buy a bunch of white beater shirts to wear one in the AM and one before bed. I have been using it twice daily along with a soft cleanser and moisturizer (from Acne.org). My plan is to use the 3 tubes and then go back to Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%. This is a bacteria killer. &amp;#34;Top Gun&amp;#34;. The clear gel formula will not leave your face white or greasy.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be working.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it once or twice daily.  During the day, I use a small amount.  At night, I use a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product last a little bit more than the liquid product.  Good job so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> About 4yrs. ago my doctor put me on steroids and it made me break out on my back and chest. I always had a little problem with acne but it was so bad that I talked to my doctor and they gave me this. It cleared everything up in less than 2 weeks and ever since this is my number one product for acne. It does dry my skin out and I don&#x27;t so much recommend for all over treatment on the face but it is good for spot treatment. It&#x27;s great for breakouts on your back and chest area. Ever since I found this I have not used anything else to clear up my acne. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Just got back from a Urgent care facility and paid $40 for this med.  Only $7 here?  The doctor claimed it was $200 anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years consistently. Its the only acne med worth my money</li>
            <li> I had razor bumps on the back of my head. I started using Rugby Acne Medication on the back of my head it cleared it up. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of difference bump fighters and nothing worked until I used Rugby Acne Medication. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Best over the counter benzoyl peroxide product! My dermatologist recommended it but it cheaper to purchase off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I barely ordered it like 3 days ago, wasn&#x27;t expecting it soooo soon. I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t have to wait for the usual time, which is like a a week and a half. Love the service. Thanks^^</li>
            <li> This medication does what it says! I suffered from moderate acne for the past 10 years of my life now, and I need benzoyl peroxide to keep it under control. I used to use OXY 10, which worked really well for me up until recently when they changed the formula. Luckily I came across this Rugby product and it has cleared up my acne! I don&#x27;t remember the last time my face was this clear and it has calmed my usually oily skin. Beware that it dries your skin out ALOT the first day or two, so be sure to keep a facial moisturizer nearby. Other than that, a perfect 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> bought for daughter so far its good will update later  in about a month .not much more to say .ok</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old that has stuggled with acne since high school.  I have used this product only twice and I have already seen noticable results.  feels good to know I don&#x27;t have to use antibiotics and expensive creams anymore.  I hope to continue to see these great results.  I have not noticed my areas treated being more dry..  will update post after one weeks worth of using product.  i would recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> This acne cream just did not work for me. I used it for about 2 months and I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Saves the time of going to the doc &amp; getting a prescription and cheaper.  The product itself, I recommend it to everyone. In my opinion it works faster and better then any other acne products.</li>
            <li> I have fairly bad acne, and this is the only benzoyl peroxide product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid doesn&#x27;t work for me, but this does. Give it a shot; definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Benzol peroxide is a great treatment for acne. The price for this tube was nice! Be warned, though: the 10% content means your clothing and sheets WILL bleach if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Best ache medication I have ever purchased and the price is incredible!  This works better than anything I have ever tried at twice the price!</li>
