            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about chopping off the top part if I cannot get it to cooperate or find an alternative way to style it.</li>

            <li>The seller was very kind and fast.</li>
            <li>Looked great and can also pass for Haruhi from Ouran High School</li>
            <li>Worked great for my Eren Jaeger and Light Yagami cosplays, most people thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>It came early and its so beautiful</li>
            <li>I thought it was good at first</li>
            <li>It did arrive rather quickly as well, which I thought to be nice.</li>
            <li>Overall I had a very good experience with this wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very true to the character</li>
            <li>The colour is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The wig is very good quality, but you WILL need to know how to cut a wig, as it is VERY long.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>the wig is cheap.</li>
            <li>Bangs did need to be trimmed to fit the character of Eren Jaeger but that was no problem.</li>
            <li>wig fits comfortably.</li>
            <li>The wig looks and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a Digby cosplay (from animal crossing new leaf) and it&#x27;s shaped more like a bob, but I&#x27;m sure it can be style to how you want it</li>
            <li>The top of the wig look funny since it&#x27;s sticking up.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair is straight, easy to style (you&#x27;ll wanna trim the bangs to fit your face</li>
            <li>wig is relatively good, super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed too much, and layered a bit like I had wanted it to.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a wig for cosplaying Eren, I would recommend this shop first thing!</li>
            <li>When the wig came it was much poofier and shinier than I had expected, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to fix those problems, and it does look good once you put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little lighter than the image shown, but it looks great.</li>
            <li>And the seller sent me a nice little letter on cute stationary and a surprise gift,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut wigs before, but this one is unmanageable because no matter how much I snip off it makes my head look huge.</li>
            <li>Its a really light brown, more like red.</li>
            <li>however the price is right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not styled like in the picture exactly, but I&#x27;m not complaining and it would be very easy to make any necessary adjustments.</li>
            <li>I can shape it to be Eren, regular hair, and many others.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Very well made !</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you have to cut the bangs to the appropriate length that you want them to be.</li>
            <li>I love it the only thing is, is that it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture when it comes its a lot longer</li>
            <li>but it still isn&#x27;t much of a hassle to cut and style the wig so 10/10! ^^</li>
            <li>I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dark brown, and very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short, but works perfectly for covering up short hair (if you have short hair like me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It arrived ten days early with the sweet gesture of a free gift hair tie and wig cap along with a sweet hand-written note from the seller.</li>
            <li>Overall the only bright side of this wig is, it makes a decent wig for Tsuna Sawada from Kateky≈ç Hitman Reborn</li>
            <li>I got my wig today, looked great til I turned it around to find a chunk missing from the back.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It came very well kept and neat, not tangled at all.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li>but I still like the style and comes at a longer length for cutting and styling which is perfect!</li>
            <li>The wig is about 90% orange and 10% red, and on the max size adjustment i can almost never get it to fit.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t even use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but really this isn&#x27;t the product you have up for display.</li>
            <li>take a real picture of the thing you are trying to sell to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely displeased with the wig, although it isn&#x27;t the right length or the right color to be Erens hair.</li>
            <li>Not as long as the picture, but hopefully it&#x27;ll be fine for my cosplay.</li>
            <li>nice wig, but it was a bit to small for me ._.</li>
            <li>it was more of a cheap Beiber haircut, too long in the back and short in the front.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be longer, but for the price it&#x27;s a decent wig.</li>
            <li>actually ordered this wig the 17th (on February) and it arrived the 24th, very fast delivery for where it came from!</li>
            <li>but it is a high quality wig</li>
            <li>Although, I wish it would have looked a little more like the photo.</li>
            <li>It does not fit well and is shaped goofy.</li>
            <li>(so don&#x27;t buy this if you can&#x27;t style)&lt;br /&gt;the wig is super soft and very short</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t a total lost right there.</li>
            <li>I styled the bangs down the middle, it was good the wig came with the part in the middle too</li>
            <li>came in actually very early...  </li>
            <li>And its pretty short</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t fit good on my head, maybe because of my thick hair or big head, but I think it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li>Mine was smaller th an expected but fit.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t even cover the whole back of my head!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and shinee 8]</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really similar to the real hair of the character.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s any wig with bangs) and the perfect colour and base cut for Eren Jaeger.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a little long cutting/styling shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does come with a decent hair net though.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is very choppy with many layers especially on the back.</li>
            <li>This wig sucks a million asses and it looks nothing like erens hair its way too light brown</li>
            <li>Overall, I wish it came with a cap, but it&#x27;s a bit small for my hair to fit in.</li>
            <li>This wig is very soft and thick, which is nice, but it&#x27;s WAY too small for my head.</li>
            <li>A little thin, but still a good wig~</li>
            <li>A little small fitting</li>
            <li>This wig is absolutely perfect, when i first put it on it looks very realistic and its very very thick so you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing the inside base of the wig!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick wavy hair and its stretchy enough to fit it for those with the same difficulties.</li>

            <li> but it is a high quality wig</li>
            <li> Although, I wish it would have looked a little more like the photo.</li>
            <li> It does not fit well and is shaped goofy.</li>
            <li> (so don&#x27;t buy this if you can&#x27;t style)&lt;br /&gt;the wig is super soft and very short</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a total lost right there.</li>
            <li> I styled the bangs down the middle, it was good the wig came with the part in the middle too</li>
            <li> came in actually very early...  </li>
            <li> And its pretty short</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t fit good on my head, maybe because of my thick hair or big head, but I think it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Mine was smaller th an expected but fit.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even cover the whole back of my head!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and shinee 8]</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really similar to the real hair of the character.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s any wig with bangs) and the perfect colour and base cut for Eren Jaeger.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little long cutting/styling shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does come with a decent hair net though.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very choppy with many layers especially on the back.</li>
            <li> This wig sucks a million asses and it looks nothing like erens hair its way too light brown</li>
            <li> Overall, I wish it came with a cap, but it&#x27;s a bit small for my hair to fit in.</li>
            <li> This wig is very soft and thick, which is nice, but it&#x27;s WAY too small for my head.</li>
            <li> A little thin, but still a good wig~</li>
            <li> A little small fitting</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely perfect, when i first put it on it looks very realistic and its very very thick so you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing the inside base of the wig!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick wavy hair and its stretchy enough to fit it for those with the same difficulties.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t that long in the back, and is shaped sort of like a bowl</li>
            <li> the hair isn&#x27;t even all that long and even the style simply just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews that said it was too long, so I was expecting it to be a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This wig is super fluffy and realistic-looking, as well as thick, you can&#x27;t see through the wig to the cap or anything.</li>
            <li> I can use the wig for a Levi cosplay but other than that I&#x27;m not entirely displeased.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a lot earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> From previous experiences of buying wigs on manquine heads made me feel relatively iffy about this wig, but I decided to buy it anyway for it was the closest thing I could find for my 2p!</li>
            <li> Color was right, the item was as described, needed some trimming and styling and there was this really weird piece of hair on the top that I could not style down or fix, it did not blend with the hair, it was so weird and makes this wig look like trash and unusable unless I bobby pin it down forever, but it&#x27;s an Eren wig and he doesn&#x27;t use bobby pins</li>
            <li> Got what we expected.</li>
            <li> Received item way sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> What you get isn&#x27;t even remotely close to the image.</li>
            <li> Comes a little bit flat, but all you have to do if just fluff it up with your fingers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little long though</li>
            <li> When i got it, the wig look like an ordinary short brown wig.</li>
            <li> The bangs itself are long and a few chunks of hair fell out while I was trying to figure it with my fingers.</li>
            <li> The wig is a tad TOO thick, and the back was almost to my shoulders</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously unstyled, which is to be expected, but it also had a few loose strands and was a little awkward in the back at the hairline.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I was excited too</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing this wig but with the price, I decide to go for it since I needed one of a up coming con.</li>
            <li> you can fix that with a little trimming and layering.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s horrible, the stitch at the top is poking out, it&#x27;s horribly thin, and way too short.</li>
            <li> very displeased by this and wished it looked a little bit close to even the bad ones ive seen.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be here on time because I ordered it a little late for Metroconvention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brown Mikasa wig ( a bit past chin length bob ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a shipping error or</li>
            <li> was a bit small</li>
            <li> This is absolutely unacceptable and I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that I&#x27;d at least have a brown/dark brown wig.</li>
            <li> it sucks dingle berries</li>
            <li> but the bangs are currently frustrating me a lot.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The crown is poorly stitched.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong wig.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I&#x27;m not too angry and the bangs cover my forehead,</li>
            <li> the color is wrong.</li>
            <li> but, its the wrong color...</li>
            <li> Though it shed some hair and desperately needs styled.</li>
            <li> and it has a bowl hair cut its very lame</li>
            <li> Still disappointed</li>
            <li> really hate to leave a bad review</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that I&#x27;d at least have a brown/dark brown wig. What I received a month after purchasing it was practically orange/red. This is absolutely unacceptable and I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Got what we expected.</li>
            <li> Its just like the color in the picture and the wig material is surprisigly nice. When i got it, the wig look like an ordinary short brown wig. I just need to style it which im sure it will look great. In happy for the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely displeased with the wig, although it isn&#x27;t the right length or the right color to be Erens hair. I can use the wig for a Levi cosplay but other than that I&#x27;m not entirely displeased.</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect. It was super cheap and of great quality</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as full as I was expecting and just wasn&#x27;t as good as I was expecting but it works for my cosplay for now</li>
            <li> Received the wrong wig. It was an orange, red-ish color. It was parted in the middle unlike the side part in the picture.  Look for an Eren wig elsewhere.</li>
            <li> total rock star look.</li>
            <li> The wig looks great. It arrived on time and in great condition. I can&#x27;t wait to use it at anime cons.</li>
            <li> Needed work...will probably be one I will wear more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! I can shape it to be Eren, regular hair, and many others. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The wig I had purchased looks nothing like the picture, it&#x27;s horrible, the stitch at the top is poking out, it&#x27;s horribly thin, and way too short. Wouldn&#x27;t even cover the whole back of my head! So disappointed, I was excited too</li>
            <li> I received the wig along with a wig cap. It came very well kept and neat, not tangled at all. I had read some reviews that said it was too long, so I was expecting it to be a bit longer. But for whoever needs a wig for Eren I totally recommend this one! The colour is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.  Received item way sooner than expected.  Very pleased all the way around.</li>
            <li> When the wig came it was much poofier and shinier than I had expected, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to fix those problems, and it does look good once you put it on.</li>
            <li> the wig is cheap. I honestly rather look like a good eren. So I&#x27;m buying a more priced wig. It doesn&#x27;t come cut. It poofs in the back.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and it even came with a wig cap</li>
            <li> Fits nicely, same colour as in the pictures, absolutely great!</li>
            <li> Very well made ! Can&#x27;t see any me hair through it, it has little adjustable hooks on the inside and that&#x27;s cool, looks super real, fits perfectly, and made my cosplay perfect ! :D</li>
            <li> Hard to set. Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture at all.</li>
            <li> It came with a really nice gift .I like how the seller is  very nice .And as well for the wig it&#x27;s soft and shinee 8]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig I&#x27;ll give you that and I&#x27;m probably one of the only ones who /didn&#x27;t/ like it, I guess it&#x27;s just me. The wig is a tad TOO thick, and the back was almost to my shoulders so I had to cut all that off. I styled the bangs down the middle, it was good the wig came with the part in the middle too but the bangs are currently frustrating me a lot. I&#x27;ve cut wigs before, but this one is unmanageable because no matter how much I snip off it makes my head look huge. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Arrived WAY before the estimated date, don&#x27;t be nervous about the price because it&#x27;s definitely high-quality! Bangs did need to be trimmed to fit the character of Eren Jaeger but that was no problem. 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Looked great and can also pass for Haruhi from Ouran High School</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for. Great quality and it&#x27;s really similar to the real hair of the character.</li>
            <li> It came early and its so beautiful</li>
            <li> This was perfect for the costume we needed.  Good quality and easy to style.</li>
            <li> This wig is very soft and thick, which is nice, but it&#x27;s WAY too small for my head. For the price I paid, I&#x27;m not too angry and the bangs cover my forehead, so maybe I can use it sometime in the future or gift it to another friend. I recommend getting this if you have a smaller sizes head.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be longer, but for the price it&#x27;s a decent wig. It did arrive rather quickly as well, which I thought to be nice.</li>
            <li> This wig is super fluffy and realistic-looking, as well as thick, you can&#x27;t see through the wig to the cap or anything. Although it&#x27;s a little long cutting/styling shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for most people. Great for Eren cosplay.</li>
            <li> It looks NOTHING like the picture. It is a bit lighter and a LOT longer. It&#x27;s a brown Mikasa wig ( a bit past chin length bob ).</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be here on time because I ordered it a little late for Metroconvention. It arrived ten days early with the sweet gesture of a free gift hair tie and wig cap along with a sweet hand-written note from the seller. So sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig fits comfortably. I have long, thick wavy hair and its stretchy enough to fit it for those with the same difficulties. The hair is straight, easy to style (you&#x27;ll wanna trim the bangs to fit your face but that&#x27;s any wig with bangs) and the perfect colour and base cut for Eren Jaeger. I love it. I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it for the weekend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously unstyled, which is to be expected, but it also had a few loose strands and was a little awkward in the back at the hairline. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> wig was not what i was expecting, it looks nothing like the picture&lt;br /&gt;even the color is wrong. the shade is lighter.&lt;br /&gt;it would be perfect for hiccup (HTTYD) but not for Eren Jaeger</li>
            <li> From previous experiences of buying wigs on manquine heads made me feel relatively iffy about this wig, but I decided to buy it anyway for it was the closest thing I could find for my 2p! Russia cosplay that I was throwing together.&lt;br /&gt;The wig is relatively good, super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed too much, and layered a bit like I had wanted it to. The only downside is that you have to cut the bangs to the appropriate length that you want them to be. The wig that I had gotten has the bangs all the way to my chin! But all in all, I find this wig pretty good!</li>
            <li> Worked great for my Eren Jaeger and Light Yagami cosplays, most people thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wig for Eren Jaeger I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this wig. I was a little worried about purchasing this wig but with the price, I decide to go for it since I needed one of a up coming con. The wig itself is very choppy with many layers especially on the back. The top of the wig look funny since it&#x27;s sticking up. The bangs itself are long and a few chunks of hair fell out while I was trying to figure it with my fingers. Overall the only bright side of this wig is, it makes a decent wig for Tsuna Sawada from Kateky≈ç Hitman Reborn so it wasn&#x27;t a total lost right there.</li>
            <li> Its not even has a star...so not what i expect..sorry</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture but it is a high quality wig and it&#x27;s super cheap. I bought this wig for a Digby cosplay (from animal crossing new leaf) and it&#x27;s shaped more like a bob, but I&#x27;m sure it can be style to how you want it (so don&#x27;t buy this if you can&#x27;t style)&lt;br /&gt;the wig is super soft and very short and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig, it was orange, not brown. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a shipping error or what, but I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great quality but needs A LOT of restyling!  Looks nothing like the photo however the price is right and I can restyle it.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE! The wig is ORANGE. Total waste of money. I recommend you don&#x27;t buy this wig. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and it looks amazingly real for my daughters love and the artistic world of toonami and anime style comics</li>
            <li> Color was right, the item was as described, needed some trimming and styling and there was this really weird piece of hair on the top that I could not style down or fix, it did not blend with the hair, it was so weird and makes this wig look like trash and unusable unless I bobby pin it down forever, but it&#x27;s an Eren wig and he doesn&#x27;t use bobby pins so I may use this wig for cosplaying a different character. I&#x27;m thinking about chopping off the top part if I cannot get it to cooperate or find an alternative way to style it.</li>
            <li> This wig sucks a million asses and it looks nothing like erens hair its way too light brown and it looks like a bowl haircut its nothing like the picture either</li>
            <li> nice wig, but it was a bit to small for me ._.</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE!! I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she likes it a lot. The one we received is all one length, does not look like the photo at all. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a toy. There were no instructions or care papers with. Just a net and the wig. She wears it at home. It does not fit well and is shaped goofy. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I did not expect a $200 wig for $8. Although, I wish it would have looked a little more like the photo. I would not buy this for cosplay or outside use.</li>
            <li> This wig is absolutely perfect, when i first put it on it looks very realistic and its very very thick so you don&#x27;t have to worry about seeing the inside base of the wig! I love it the only thing is, is that it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture when it comes its a lot longer but it still isn&#x27;t much of a hassle to cut and style the wig so 10/10! ^^</li>
            <li> Overall I had a very good experience with this wig. The seller was very kind and fast. The wig is very good quality, but you WILL need to know how to cut a wig, as it is VERY long. The wig looks and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dark brown, and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t that long in the back, and is shaped sort of like a bowl hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;But you can fix that with a little trimming and layering.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I loved it, and it shipped quickly!&lt;br /&gt;üëèüëèüëè</li>
            <li> my wig looked nothing like this. it was more of a cheap Beiber haircut, too long in the back and short in the front. very displeased by this and wished it looked a little bit close to even the bad ones ive seen.</li>
            <li> Comes a little bit flat, but all you have to do if just fluff it up with your fingers and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> The crown is poorly stitched. A lot of kinks that wouldn&#x27;t come out with styling. Overall, I wish it came with a cap, but it&#x27;s a bit small for my hair to fit in.</li>
            <li> This is ok and all but, its the wrong color... Its a really light brown, more like red. And its pretty short but, like all the things I buy here I always find a way to work with it</li>
            <li> came in actually very early...  was a bit small but I have a lot of hair to tuck under. looks awesome. I trimmed the bangs a bit so I could see.. and styled it a bit.</li>
            <li> Really good. Mine was smaller th an expected but fit. It didn&#x27;t need to be styled which is really nice.</li>
            <li> Got this for my granddaughter and she loved it.  Very affordable.</li>
            <li> The wig that I received was nothing like the one in the picture. The one I got was a completely different color and style. But since I&#x27;m good with wigs, I was able to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> A little thin, but still a good wig~ I&#x27;m using it for a Haruhi Fujioka cosplay.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a lot earlier than expected! It&#x27;s a really nice wig for the price. I bought this for my Eren cosplay and the color is perfect, it has a realistic look to it. It&#x27;s a little lighter than the image shown, but it looks great. It&#x27;s a little long though so I would suggest trimming it.</li>
            <li> I would first like to say that this is one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve ever ordered off of the internet! It&#x27;s very true to the character and it&#x27;s made very well. It&#x27;s not styled like in the picture exactly, but I&#x27;m not complaining and it would be very easy to make any necessary adjustments. It&#x27;s short, but works perfectly for covering up short hair (if you have short hair like me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered this wig the 17th (on February) and it arrived the 24th, very fast delivery for where it came from! And the seller sent me a nice little letter on cute stationary and a surprise gift, how nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a wig for cosplaying Eren, I would recommend this shop first thing! I&#x27;m very happy with everything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like tis wig at all. I thought it was good at first but then when it came in, the color was bright orange and not brown like Erens&#x27;s. It also didn&#x27;t fit good on my head, maybe because of my thick hair or big head, but I think it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> A little small fitting but I still like the style and comes at a longer length for cutting and styling which is perfect!</li>
            <li> I got my wig today, looked great til I turned it around to find a chunk missing from the back. Not as long as the picture, but hopefully it&#x27;ll be fine for my cosplay. Still disappointed</li>
            <li> What you get isn&#x27;t even remotely close to the image. The wig is about 90% orange and 10% red, and on the max size adjustment i can almost never get it to fit. the hair isn&#x27;t even all that long and even the style simply just isn&#x27;t there. I really can&#x27;t even use this.&lt;br /&gt;I really hate to leave a bad review but really this isn&#x27;t the product you have up for display. take a real picture of the thing you are trying to sell to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with a decent hair net though. i guess..</li>
            <li> if you are going to get this wig for eren jaeger cosplay DONT it sucks dingle berries it doesn&#x27;t even look like the pic it&#x27;s a very light brown and it has a bowl hair cut its very lame don&#x27;t get it I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> The same color as the picture but that&#x27;s about all I can say. It&#x27;s short, the bangs only really hang one way,  and one of the clips was missing</li>
            <li> The wig came on time and the color was good. Though it shed some hair and desperately needs styled. over all, good wig.</li>
