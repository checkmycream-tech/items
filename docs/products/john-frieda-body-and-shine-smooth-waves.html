            <li>I also agree with others who say they do a great job of smoothing hair and adding volume without curl.</li>
            <li>it was a great set until they fried.</li>
            <li>It works great to give me that &amp;#34;blown-out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>Very good i love it</li>
            <li>Good to reduce friz.</li>
            <li>It looks good no matter how it falls.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me that although these products are good they will just lay there on my hair and that what is need is heat to bring out the shine.</li>
            <li>She thought that was a good idea and suggested 2&amp;#34; rollers for the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>In 10 minutes I am good to go.</li>
            <li>It is also impressive how quickly those heat up.</li>
            <li>The size of the rollers were perfect but the velvet coating does not allow them to get very hot</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, delivery prompt, and product lovely looking.  </li>
            <li>It works great, but I needed more rollers.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Loved the size and texture but temperature barely warm.</li>
            <li>They give you volume, flippy, and beautiful super model hair!</li>
            <li>Gives smooth waves, love the hi/low settings, on/off switch and the best plastic grips for the curlers that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the fullness it creates in my hair, and it takes away my flyways, too!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these curlers!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this set!</li>
            <li>Just got it, used it and love it!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>With these 2 inch rollers my hair looks perfect the minute I take them out of the hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a Jumbo hot roller set; and this was perfect!!  </li>
            <li>Love these curlers!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>and my hair looks amazing every time.</li>
            <li>These are amazing-</li>
            <li>5 curlers is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole line of John Frieda thickening product and these rollers, which seemed like the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>and I liked the coating on the rollers</li>
            <li>and I liked the way the clips are made.</li>
            <li>Thus I don&#x27;t use it often--only when I have that kind of time.  </li>
            <li>I liked these</li>
            <li>but I never could achieve that on my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>(my hair can&#x27;t take that kind of heat anyway)</li>
            <li>nice clips come with, an A + item</li>
            <li>In addition to giving lift and smoothing the hair, these rollers leave the hair with a nice shine too.    </li>
            <li>This fits nicely into a counter corner or to store in cabinet corner under the sink.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice bonus since it is this shape.    </li>
            <li>This set is exemplary with nice heat up time.</li>
            <li>Still, I loved the volume these rollers gave, so I kept trying searching for a better set.  </li>
            <li>It does make nice curls, but they keeps falling.</li>
            <li>And my hair rarely looks good on its own!</li>
            <li>The 2 inch jumbo rollers in this set are perfect to create smooth, full hair.  </li>
            <li>I let them stay in until cool and get great results.</li>
            <li>Love Love this!</li>
            <li>Curlers are huge &amp; good for hair that&#x27;s longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li>These John Frieda rollers themselves work great and leave just the right amount of wave, body, and smoothness to my hair.  </li>
            <li>styled look that my stylist does so easily, but that I can&#x27;t manage without four hands!  </li>
            <li>However, I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love, love, love them!  </li>
            <li>These 2 inch rollers straighten it beautifully and it remains straight.  </li>
            <li>Also, I do have a lot of hair, and five rollers isn&#x27;t quite enough; Seven would be the perfect number</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>6 would be better.</li>
            <li>These rollers are just okay.  </li>
            <li>Metal clips would be better</li>
            <li>sent John Frieda an email asking if they had better clips to hold these curlers, but as suspected, to date I have not received a reply.  </li>
            <li>so I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>The clips are just okay, but they do the job.  </li>
            <li>On the top of your head they roll forward.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a 1 1/2 inch curling iron that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need another set to have more rollers......</li>
            <li>OK, so I LOVE LOVE LOVE my hair after using these rollers.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my John Fieda Body and Shine hair rollers.</li>
            <li>I looked at many brands, types, and sizes and decided on the John Frieda 2&amp;#34; 5 rollers.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these rollers.</li>
            <li>I do really love the curlers.  </li>
            <li>(wish there were more in the pack) but the clips do cause crimping in my hair.  </li>
            <li>She loves their performance and I love the look they give to her hair.  </li>
            <li>Love these curlers...</li>
            <li>These reviews are hilarious.</li>
            <li>These work ok</li>
            <li>but it would be better if the curlers were lighter in weight and the clips were a bit more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I love the hi-lo setting.</li>
            <li>I liked the flexibility of being able use 1.5\\&quot; rollers if I wanted, because the unit is heated by bar so any size curler would fit.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a nice smooth style.  </li>
            <li>: The curlers give good volume and that fresh &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the size of the curlers and</li>
            <li>Your hair will look even better then the Kardashian Clan and Lilly Ghalichi hair.  </li>
            <li>I would love if 2in rollers would come in more than 5pk.</li>
            <li>Would love 1 dozen.</li>
            <li>I was able to remedy that by some strategically placed bobby pins in an \\&quot;x\\&quot; shape underneath the roller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glad to have found something that makes me look like I made an effort in the morning :)</li>
            <li>Love it, love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Set works well, but would be much better with six rollers, rather than five, as most women would roll hair in six sections.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more curlers</li>
            <li>This works great, but it really needs another roller.</li>
            <li>and I wish there were just two more in the case</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need more than 5 rollers and I can change out some of the for jumbo rollers from my conair</li>
            <li>Wish I had been able to find this&#x27;s sooner.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>the best on the market, from my experience, for big bouncy body...</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to see this in CVS...</li>
            <li>have to say, the comments had me a bit leery, but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them anyway.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that problem, and that&#x27;s something that most heating curlers do to my hair.  </li>
            <li>i have plenty of time and hold the rollers in with my fingers, i love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone know of a better clip?</li>
            <li>Great curl, heat fast and give my hair lots of volume.</li>
            <li>Gives smooth body, lifts from the scalp, stays shaped!</li>
            <li>Will order another one because I need more rollers.  </li>
            <li>Love the rollers.</li>
            <li>If the company would manufacture a 1 1/4 inch roller bag to be sold to everyone, we would buy it on top of the set.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that these rollers don&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>She is well pleased with their performance and with everything else about them.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>SOOOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with these 2 inch rollers--they are perfect for taming my medium length hair, which is thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li>It produces the most beautiful soft</li>
            <li>If you have hair that is longer than your shoulders and want a look that simulates how your hair looks after you blow dry your hair, this set would be an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li>But on the whole they are good rollers I am pleased.</li>
            <li>bought better clips at store and it works just fine</li>
            <li>I fine that the volume and wave does not stay for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I have fizzy, curly hair and needed something to smooth it out after blow drying and didn&#x27;t want to have more curls.  </li>
            <li>These are great, helps with frizz and gives the hair a natural curve.  </li>
            <li>Just makes my hair look full, healthy, and effortlessly styled, rather than curled and styled, which I love.</li>
            <li>INCREDIBLE VOLUME EVEN ON LOW SETTING!!  </li>
            <li>Because Amazon is so reliable - fast shipping and good prices - I wouldn&#x27;t have had any issue ordering these from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Awesome set of roller, wish it came with three more extra large rollers!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with the product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s easy to use and gives lots of body to my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>So easy, and minimizes heat damage.</li>
            <li>THEY MAKE MY HAIR ROUTINE IN THE MORNINGS SO EASY.</li>
            <li>I have easy to manage hair and  this curler don&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t go anywhere ..</li>
            <li>There is no way to secure the top ones securely to my head.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quick (</li>
            <li>set easily.</li>
            <li>They are so affordable and make fixing my hair soooo easy.</li>
            <li>The set heats up very quickly, instructions recommend heating on \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting then switching to the lower setting if that&#x27;s what is preferred.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t break off my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets nice and hot on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine hair</li>
            <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine and wavy, but I have a TON of hair.</li>
            <li>These were the size I wanted, but the clips didn&#x27;t stay put in my wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Infiniti Pro by Conair Smooth Waves Mega Volume 2 Inch Roller Hairsetter hot roller set comes with two-pronged \\&quot;prong\\&quot; type clamps, ironically they don&#x27;t work as well with the rollers in that set but work perfectly with the larger rollers in this set.</li>
            <li>The set gives me excellent volume with a little bit of a wave at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product, I just ordered a second set.</li>
            <li>you really have to know your own hair.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, they SMOOTH, not curl, so if you&#x27;re thinking of using these as a curling set, that&#x27;s not the purpose.</li>
            <li>Low heat setting works great.</li>
            <li>I really think my hair looks AMAZING after using these....</li>
            <li>Clip does not hold securely therefore roller falls out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Used as intended, they leave crimp marks, defeating the purpose of rollers designed to smooth your hair.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is fabulous.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit so they don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li>Use after a blowout lightly of hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair wavy and smooth even with the humidity in Florida.</li>
            <li>I then take them out and smooth my hair with a brush, and my hair has loads of smooth volume.  </li>
            <li>I then take them out and smooth my hair with a brush, and my hair has loads of smooth volume.  </li>
            <li>I did try many times to get it right, to no avail.</li>
            <li>some of the other reviewers have said, the plastic clips aren&#x27;t great--they leave dents in my hair and don&#x27;t do a very good job of holding the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li>Great alternative to a flat iron</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this large hot-curler set!  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Quick heat up, easy to use.</li>
            <li>You may be successful using these rollers if you buy extra clips and somehow use two to secure the rollers..</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up fast and 5 are the perfect number to place in my hair to get the body and shine I want without taking too long.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is super SUPER easy to curl, I&#x27;ve used hair rollers before but these rollers didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get these</li>
            <li>(If she were more willing during the evening, I probably would opt for her styling!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smoothe out my long hair and give it movement, without burning it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Gives my style body, and smooth, full shape.  </li>
            <li>so I know how hot rollers work (I&#x27;ve bought so many over the years!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have super fine hair..</li>
            <li>I originally intended them to be the set I had for my boyfriend&#x27;s house, but now I am ordering an additional set because I love them so much!.</li>
            <li>Love these quick heating large hair rollers!  </li>
            <li>It is smoothe  with nice body and very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I could use just one more roller to fit all my hair more comfortably.</li>
            <li>They work best when I let my hair air dry after washing and then use rollers on the top layer of my hair only.</li>
            <li>The are quite large and are probably better for a  longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Well I was right!</li>
            <li>If you want beautiful thick and full sexy hair this is it....</li>
            <li>It would be better if it was even longer to really make the roller feel secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the high heat option (don&#x27;t even bother with the lower heat setting!)</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this brand of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I can let my hair air dry at night, and then pop these rollers in my hair in the morning, and it looks nice!  </li>
            <li>From the size, shape, and design of the set to the clips which work very well for me to the little pouch that you store your clips in--it all functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for my fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly but by no means am I scorching my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Heat quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super bouncey</li>
            <li>I like the results i get when I do the top layer of hair with the rollers and the bottom with a curling iron, but the process is more time consuming than simply throwing the rollers in.</li>
            <li>But the unit reheats rollers fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, and the covering on the rollers helps protect the fingers while putting them in the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which I lost a good bit of due to medication.</li>
            <li>but when I used them they were VERY hot and the clips did not hold them in.</li>
            <li>Two of them cracked and broke when I opened them to put them around the roller on my very first use</li>
            <li>It also has 2 setting, the highest gets the rollers very hot and will immediatley make the rolls.</li>
            <li>The rollers do get very hot, so on shorter sections of hair (like around the bangs)</li>
            <li>They get very hot.  </li>
            <li>However, the very first time using them, one of the clips &amp;#34;sprang&amp;#34; apart.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find hot rollers this large anywhere...</li>
            <li>They are doable--they would fit nicely in the very slots the bigger rollers fit in.</li>
            <li>On the very positive side: I was looking for large hot rollers to give my fine, medium length, layered and colored treated hair some lift and smooth it out, and that&#x27;s *</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers I wish it had more curlers, at least one more would be best.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find hot rollers that were 2 inches</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that can just &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; with no shape.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and layered, fine and straight but lots of it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and this works great in giving me waves / loose curls how I want.</li>
            <li>In theory, they should fit the whole way around the curler to avoid leaving an indentation.</li>
            <li>The best part so far is how soft my hair actually felt and looked.</li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t secure the rollers very well</li>
            <li>I use this product to smooth out frizzy hair and to add wave to otherwise straight hair.</li>
            <li>Probably some safety regulation, because I have not seem true hot rollers since 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>If better wire clips aren&#x27;t available, These will go back.</li>
            <li>After hundreds of dollars worth of volume boosters, this was all I needed.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I still struggle with it, but the finish is worth it and beats paying for my hair to be straightened or sitting for an hour while my daughter does it.</li>
            <li>They are so nice and big.</li>
            <li>Those two inch rollers have their place, but the smaller set would be really, really nice to have.</li>
            <li>The clips are OK, and have to be positioned right next to the scalp to keep the roller secure.  </li>
            <li>love my new hot rollers...</li>
            <li>but mainly it just smooths the hair, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Heats up fairly quickly but the rollers don&#x27;t get as hot as I would prefer.  </li>
            <li>So while many reviewers here comment that they&#x27;re great if you use them properly to get a tight fit with the clips, I was not able to do so successfully...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a bit of practice to curl up the hair just right and use the clips.</li>
            <li>well if you position them right and the clip marks &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; as your hair cools and relaxes some after taking the rollers out.</li>
            <li>or they&#x27;ll roll right off my head.</li>
            <li>She opened them and plugged them in right away.</li>
            <li>Right now my hair is like medium-long.</li>
            <li>I have to put little pieces of cotton under the curlers, so it won&#x27;t burn my head; but it does nice curls, very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are very large.  </li>
            <li>With very little effort these could have been great.</li>
            <li>Typically, with the smaller rollers hair does not look its best awhile after you take off rollers.  </li>
            <li>These work ok for my hair, but barely.  </li>
            <li>Although the rollers are large and that&#x27;s what I was looking for, I do not like the clips!</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a superior product that offers two-inch rollers that provide smoothness as well as body; the choice of two heat settings provides an extra advantage..</li>
            <li>These really heat up quick.</li>
            <li>These are great for second day hair as well--it just pumps your hair back up and smooths out any kinks from sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for second day hair as well--it just pumps your hair back up and smooths out any kinks from sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have read the other reviews more closely (my fault) since my hair is fine and does not need to be smoothed or straightened.  </li>
            <li>With my long hair I need more than 5 rollers but it was easy enough to just add two or three more because they heat so fast.</li>
            <li>I dropped one roller just two feet onto the bathroom floor, which often happens while using rollers, right, and it bent it completely out of shape and it won&#x27;t fit into the heating unit.</li>
            <li>, my hair is very straight</li>
            <li>Wife likes these very much.</li>
            <li>hair comes out soft and smooth with a large curl!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find TRUE jumbo 2\\&quot; rollers that I loved this set.</li>
            <li>I have a set of conair hot rollers if I want to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact, they dont even get as hot as my conair hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>and I think the set would be better if there were seven rollers to ensure coverage over your entire head at one time.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars since they will do exactly what you want if you want smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really doing the trick!  </li>
            <li>so she&#x27;ll have 10 setters instead of 5 to give her more options for different styles.  </li>
            <li>They get too hot on the scalp</li>
            <li>Hot on the head though so put a piece of kleenex under each roller to keep from burning your scalp.</li>
            <li>The rollers are perfect size but unfortunately slip through hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years and have always used the 5 roller set of 1 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li>I got compliments at work all day after the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could be better is the clips.  </li>
            <li>I have another set with slightly smaller rollers but they have metal clips (u-shaped) which work much better and do not cause creases.  </li>
            <li>The setter straightens out the kinks and adds a more flattering universal wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Do they even test it out first before putting it on the market?  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these!  </li>
            <li>Have been searching for 2 inch hot rollers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The return replace period had expired and I was dissapointed after spending more for the John Frieda brand only to have to throw them away.</li>
            <li>, I was looking for a hot roller set that would give my hair some body and add shine.</li>
            <li>so I can heat 10 at a time, make smaller sections and get even more curl and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>O love this curler, however, I needed a smaller size to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing in my life that has changed how my hair comes out.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product so much!</li>
            <li>exactly* what these hot rollers do.</li>
            <li>Because they get so hot, for my bangs</li>
            <li>This set probably works better for someone with shoulder length or longer hair so that they have enough hair to wrap around the roller and keep the heat off of the scalp.    </li>
            <li>With just past shoulder length hair, I have searched for a way to get it nice and smooth, without curls, and also without using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>These work: they are padded and not burning hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I bought them for.  </li>
            <li>Weight was a huge concern given you&#x27;re putting five giant hot things on your head,  but they&#x27;re not bad.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>the clip broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and soft with just a bit of a curve at the ends.  </li>
            <li>too hot topick</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found one about 5 years ago made by Hot Tools that had 5 1 3/4 rollers, and while they worked better than the smaller rollers, they still were not quite there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, they actually made my hair MORE FLAT ON THE TOP.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting for years for a set of hot rollers this large</li>
            <li>The clips could hold a little tighter, but all in all, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The rollers are pretty good but the clips ALWAYS leave a mark on the hair that has to be either straightened with a flat iron or left looking like you had your hair tied up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>I love the 2&amp;#34; Jumbo rollers for my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been able to use these much because the only clips they provide are the ones shown - which make creases in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, easy to use, only 2\\&quot; rollers I could find</li>
            <li>the rollers do not get hot enough to really smooth my hair out.  </li>
            <li>The rollers flipped my hair out pretty nicely on the bottom, but they were so heavy</li>
            <li>I like the large size of the ceramic rollers but the plastic clips do NOT hold the roller and within seconds the roller starts to slip away from the scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I need large size curlers.  </li>
            <li>I have to use my old set of smaller hot rollers on the underneath hair and the jumbos on the top layer.  </li>
            <li>I recieved my rollers last weekend, and after using them several times, I can honestly say that this is the holy grail of jumbo hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>They give your hair a lift and nice bend but not too tight a curl.</li>
            <li>The product met my expectations, unfortunately my fine hair did not hold the curl, even after trying multiple ways.(I&#x27;m not one for hairsprays and gels, so that might have helped).</li>
            <li>Really like the large rollers and texture of rollers.</li>
            <li>I heat them on high, however, I read all these reviews about how hot these things get</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with rollers since high school.  </li>
            <li>On the high setting, the rollers get so hot they burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>I used these a couple times, and they&#x27;re okay, but they kept slipping out of my hair and didn&#x27;t really curl my hair that well.</li>
            <li>The rollers give me ton of volume on top and a nice, soft, Victoria Secret style wave.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I knew when I bought these they would only give me some smooth body and wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li>As some reviewers stated, you will have problems keeping them in and they wont really do anything for you.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>They do the job but don&#x27;t stay in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Got this hairsetter to give my hair volume without too much curl.  </li>
            <li>You would not expect 2\\&quot; rollers to give you much curl</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother to really handle it much after I take the rollers out - I just let my hair fall and go.</li>
            <li>I put them in before applying my makeup so I can curl while getting my face ready.</li>
            <li>really really want these to work, so I will keep trying...</li>
            <li>fast work</li>
            <li>Plus, they don&#x27;t stay in place well, once you put them in, you have to remain VERY still</li>
            <li>The result is very curly hair, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t take up much space on the counter.</li>
            <li>They do not add much in the way of curl.  </li>
            <li>(really I need 10) that would be helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky.  </li>
            <li>and so you don&#x27;t get much of any curl at all.  </li>
            <li>and these didn&#x27;t produce much of anything.  </li>
            <li>I leave these in for ~20 minutes while I get ready in the morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;It so much healthier for my hair than what I&#x27;d been doing for years.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s real life</li>
            <li>Because I have so much hair, I plan to buy another</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the volume I get with these rollers.</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted something to straighten and smooth my hair, and these curlers fulfilled that.</li>
            <li>I do achieve the straight look I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I received my rollers last night, and used them this morning, with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>Just notify everyone who bought the big rollers the others are available.</li>
            <li>Not stick straight.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy a second one...  </li>
            <li>have only had them a couple of weeks but love them so far.</li>
            <li>Surprised John F didn&#x27;t think of making a larger product with more rollers for those with a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>For my fine hair, the lo was enough but on special occasions I would use the hi setting for extra assurance.</li>
            <li>Awesome product - was skeptical until i used them !</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally find 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great idea, but these did not get hot enough to curl my thick hair and the clips were too flimsy to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>I bought these to get a smooth wave in my long hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get some of those long, metal roller clamp thingies at the drug store and use them to secure the hair instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These curlers are great for smooth waves, my only complaint being that the curler holders leave crimps in the wave that need to be smoothed out with a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>I left them in until they were completly cool</li>
            <li>You have to stay completely still or hold on to the rollers one side at a time - not practical and too hot.</li>
            <li>Says it heats in 2 mins, but it gets just about warm not hot enough to really do too much, my hair needs heat.</li>
            <li>Like the size as it initially creates a nice loose wave</li>
            <li>clip carefully, making sure the clip grabs a little of your hair by the scalp and they will stay pretty secure.  </li>
            <li>and when I take them out the wave look decent</li>
            <li>find 5 curlers to be more than enough, especially since the goal is body and volume.  </li>
            <li>have had many sets of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; rollers, but most come in a 1 1/2 inch roller set that ends up curling the hair or making it flip out weird (think Nancy Drew from the 60&#x27;s) at the ends.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t even warm up enough to put a wave in my long, naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li>I considered looking for large metal U-shaped clips instead, but was concerned with how my hair would respond to the weight of the curlers, as well as about the fact that the curlers have gaps where the heating element fits in, whereby even if I found such clips, they might get stuck in those large gaps and/or really damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>so maybe it will be better when my hair is a little longer.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a little more curl than these.  </li>
            <li>keep it long for special events</li>
            <li>As an older woman I have to use so many more and expensive products like keratin on my hair to make it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>leaving them in until all the heat has left them; your smooth hair will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this has more to do with how heavy the curlers are than the size of the plastic clips.  </li>
            <li>Many people also wrote in they had trouble with the clips staying in.</li>
            <li>For many years I have wanted the round brush salon look</li>
            <li>Wish there were a few more in the set.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that heated up properly and would be easy to do daily.</li>
            <li>With some effort and a bit of luck you can secure the rollers by affixing the clips end-on, digging one comb of the clip into the hair near your scalp, with the  other comb clamped down on top of the roller.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders (especially if I time it right or use a straightening solution).  </li>
            <li>If I had one wish, it is that a smaller curler was included because many of us want that little bit of volume on top, which these aren&#x27;t expected to give.</li>
            <li>The price was kinda high but worth it to finally find this larger hot roller set.</li>
            <li>I bought both of my sets on E-bay, brand new and shipped to my home for 29.99 each.  </li>
            <li>or I will be in search for new clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered a new set of clips for them.  </li>
            <li>Great for second day hair or days when you don&#x27;t have the patience to blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>The clamps are mega strong and hold the curlers in place but can leave a \\&quot;bend\\&quot; mark in the hair if placement is slightly off.</li>
            <li>I pop two curlers on both front sides of my hair, one at the high top middle in the back, and two at both the underneath back portions of my hair and this setter tames, straightens, and smoothes my hair.  </li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Rollers did not stay hot enough.</li>
            <li>bought these to create some bounce and volume, and i got the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and heated them as hot as possible.</li>
            <li>Other smaller rollers heat up as you add and remove if you need more.</li>
            <li>I have medium-long hair (a few inches past my shoulders in long layers) and these rolers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I have medium-long hair (a few inches past my shoulders in long layers) and these rolers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>So I am buying a second set for duel-ling hot setters.  </li>
            <li>She has thick long hair and these hair setters give her hair that full, sexy look.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to accomplish with a little practice and familiarity.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products with a rollers just a bit smaller that work far better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they get near hot enough</li>
            <li>I just take the roller out after several seconds and my bangs are full enough.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, they are designed to smooth hair (almost like a flat iron), yet retain body and volume (unlike the effect you get with a flat iron).  </li>
            <li>, I went into this purchase very skeptical that these would be any better, but I love everything about them.  </li>
            <li>think these would be really good for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that, unlike other hot rollers I&#x27;ve ordered, these are truly jumbo size, necessary for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long layers (straight, thick dark brown Asian hair) and these rollers are perfect for adding volume and giving that salon look in just 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually too large to make a curl.</li>
            <li>the clips are not sturdy or large enough so the curlers flip around on my head.  </li>
            <li>not happy with this purchase at all, rollers do not curl at all, clips are very cheap and do not hold rollers very well.</li>
            <li>These are cheap plastic and not worth the money!</li>
            <li>I think they are defective, the high setting barely heats them.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal for me personally because it&#x27;s hard to find really good 2 inch rollers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are fabulous and heat up in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Big rollers that produce gentle curves.  </li>
            <li>Much faster but with my Asian hair I have to follow up with hair spray to keep the curl.</li>
            <li>but wow my life just got easier.</li>
            <li>they make my hair look like I have had a professional blow</li>
            <li>,.took a long time for the rollers to get hot,</li>
            <li>I also wish there were 1-2 more rollers I need at least 6 to cover my head.</li>
            <li>morning, I blow-dried my hair, rolled these suckers in, started on my makeup in about 10-15 minutes, I was brushing out the most luxurious, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>All i can say is wow.</li>
            <li>I looked and looked for a set of 2 inch rollers and finally found these, they heat fast, work well,</li>
            <li>I really like this set, the only reason for 4 stars is I wish there were 6 rollers and not 5</li>
            <li>The curl provides a soft flowing look.</li>
            <li>naturally curly/wavy.  </li>
            <li>They leave ridges in your hair near your scalp or point of contact with your hair.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is much shorter or you have short layers, they may not work</li>
            <li>If your hair is much shorter or you have short layers, they may not work well.</li>
            <li>Makes my thick hair smooth and  very silky</li>
            <li>I put one on my front left side, 1 on the front right, 1 on a portion of the back crown, and 1 on each side to finish the remainder of hair.  </li>
            <li>For years I used a flat iron but my hair looked too straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is just as straight and flat as it ever was after using these curlers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to working with hot roller clips but these do not hold as well as my old ones and they can leave a dent in your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful about the placement.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of the great reviews but it does absolutely nothing for me :(</li>
            <li>The clear plastic top also does not seal or snap shut in any way so they are not good for travel.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had another previous set.</li>
            <li>and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to wash my hair at night, blow it dry quickly, and then flat iron it.  </li>
            <li>I only use the high.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have noted, the rollers are very large, so curling is not what they are made for.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product unless you have used these type of cheap plastic clips in the past and like them.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews state that rollers are heavy and this is true</li>
            <li>If you are looking for big loose curls this is the right product...</li>
            <li>i wish they made those u shaped clips like they have for other hot rollers</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other setter sets I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>, it works as well as any other hot roller.</li>
            <li>This is small enough you could travel with it easily.</li>
            <li>I use these very loosely, hard to keep the clips secure for some reason.</li>
            <li>The clips in general do leave a &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34; or indentation in your hair.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li>I could barely wrap my hair around these rollers once.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a larger soft wave.</li>
            <li>If you have medium hair, it barely \\&quot;flips\\&quot; your hair.</li>
            <li>Second, all of the reviews are true that say these rollers are too heavy with a combo of crappy clips</li>
            <li>The rollers themselves are nice as it is the unit but without the clips, they are useless.</li>
            <li>- doesnt burn - and takes way less time than a curling iron or round brush/blow dry and does a much better job!</li>
            <li>I say loveD because I had to throw them out on the very first day of a European vacation, they instantly fried - despite the proper adapter. :(    </li>
            <li>Heats up quick and can be unplugged to use a little less intense</li>
            <li>Unlike some other reviewers, I have no problem with the clips leaving marks in my hair, I actually really like these clips.  </li>
            <li>It is a hot mess in the morning.  </li>
            <li>not so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to find the wire clips for these as I think they would work better, but you can&#x27;t buy them anywhere.</li>
            <li>I will simply replace with the old school u shaped metal things at a later date.  </li>
            <li>My hair is VERY naturally curly, and holds water, so it takes forever to blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I was anxious to get it as I was sure that the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; was coming, since, like that particular reviewer, I have thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long (mid-back) length hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I use these hot rollers instead of blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li>(I smooth out the bottom layer of my hair with a Sedu flat iron because, like I said, my hair is thick and frizzy.)</li>
            <li>let my hair dry naturally, then I put 10 of these rollers in my hair, and believe it or not, I end up with voluminous, straight hair with a lot less damage than I would get from blow-drying and flat-ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They just didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me and it left it with limp wave.  </li>
            <li>and  also not hot enough, so basically you get a wimpy,  so - so wave that don&#x27;t last 15 minutes, it might as well pick up my older iron</li>
            <li>If you have thin, fine hair, I would imagine these probably just arent for you.  </li>
            <li>Thin and fine.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair</li>

            <li> it was a great set until they fried.</li>

            <li> Very good i love it</li>
            <li> Good to reduce friz.</li>
            <li> It looks good no matter how it falls.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me that although these products are good they will just lay there on my hair and that what is need is heat to bring out the shine.</li>
            <li> She thought that was a good idea and suggested 2&amp;#34; rollers for the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> In 10 minutes I am good to go.</li>
            <li> It is also impressive how quickly those heat up.</li>
            <li> The size of the rollers were perfect but the velvet coating does not allow them to get very hot</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, delivery prompt, and product lovely looking.  </li>
            <li> It works great, but I needed more rollers.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Loved the size and texture but temperature barely warm.</li>
            <li> They give you volume, flippy, and beautiful super model hair!</li>
            <li> Gives smooth waves, love the hi/low settings, on/off switch and the best plastic grips for the curlers that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the fullness it creates in my hair, and it takes away my flyways, too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these curlers!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this set!</li>
            <li> Just got it, used it and love it!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> With these 2 inch rollers my hair looks perfect the minute I take them out of the hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a Jumbo hot roller set; and this was perfect!!  </li>
            <li> Love these curlers!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> and my hair looks amazing every time.</li>
            <li> These are amazing-</li>
            <li> 5 curlers is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole line of John Frieda thickening product and these rollers, which seemed like the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> and I liked the coating on the rollers</li>
            <li> and I liked the way the clips are made.</li>
            <li> Thus I don&#x27;t use it often--only when I have that kind of time.  </li>
            <li> I liked these</li>
            <li> but I never could achieve that on my own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> (my hair can&#x27;t take that kind of heat anyway)</li>
            <li> nice clips come with, an A + item</li>
            <li> In addition to giving lift and smoothing the hair, these rollers leave the hair with a nice shine too.    </li>
            <li> This fits nicely into a counter corner or to store in cabinet corner under the sink.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice bonus since it is this shape.    </li>
            <li> This set is exemplary with nice heat up time.</li>
            <li> Still, I loved the volume these rollers gave, so I kept trying searching for a better set.  </li>
            <li> It does make nice curls, but they keeps falling.</li>
            <li> And my hair rarely looks good on its own!</li>
            <li> The 2 inch jumbo rollers in this set are perfect to create smooth, full hair.  </li>
            <li> I let them stay in until cool and get great results.</li>
            <li> Love Love this!</li>
            <li> Curlers are huge &amp; good for hair that&#x27;s longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> These John Frieda rollers themselves work great and leave just the right amount of wave, body, and smoothness to my hair.  </li>
            <li> styled look that my stylist does so easily, but that I can&#x27;t manage without four hands!  </li>
            <li> However, I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I love, love, love them!  </li>
            <li> These 2 inch rollers straighten it beautifully and it remains straight.  </li>
            <li> Also, I do have a lot of hair, and five rollers isn&#x27;t quite enough; Seven would be the perfect number</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> 6 would be better.</li>
            <li> These rollers are just okay.  </li>
            <li> Metal clips would be better</li>
            <li> sent John Frieda an email asking if they had better clips to hold these curlers, but as suspected, to date I have not received a reply.  </li>
            <li> so I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> The clips are just okay, but they do the job.  </li>
            <li> On the top of your head they roll forward.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a 1 1/2 inch curling iron that works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need another set to have more rollers......</li>
            <li> OK, so I LOVE LOVE LOVE my hair after using these rollers.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my John Fieda Body and Shine hair rollers.</li>
            <li> I looked at many brands, types, and sizes and decided on the John Frieda 2&amp;#34; 5 rollers.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these rollers.</li>
            <li> I do really love the curlers.  </li>
            <li> (wish there were more in the pack) but the clips do cause crimping in my hair.  </li>
            <li> She loves their performance and I love the look they give to her hair.  </li>
            <li> Love these curlers...</li>
            <li> These reviews are hilarious.</li>
            <li> These work ok</li>
            <li> but it would be better if the curlers were lighter in weight and the clips were a bit more sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I love the hi-lo setting.</li>
            <li> I liked the flexibility of being able use 1.5\\&quot; rollers if I wanted, because the unit is heated by bar so any size curler would fit.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nice smooth style.  </li>
            <li> : The curlers give good volume and that fresh &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the size of the curlers and</li>
            <li> Your hair will look even better then the Kardashian Clan and Lilly Ghalichi hair.  </li>
            <li> I would love if 2in rollers would come in more than 5pk.</li>
            <li> Would love 1 dozen.</li>
            <li> I was able to remedy that by some strategically placed bobby pins in an \\&quot;x\\&quot; shape underneath the roller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glad to have found something that makes me look like I made an effort in the morning :)</li>
            <li> Love it, love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Set works well, but would be much better with six rollers, rather than five, as most women would roll hair in six sections.</li>
            <li> Wish there were more curlers</li>
            <li> This works great, but it really needs another roller.</li>
            <li> and I wish there were just two more in the case</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need more than 5 rollers and I can change out some of the for jumbo rollers from my conair</li>
            <li> Wish I had been able to find this&#x27;s sooner.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> the best on the market, from my experience, for big bouncy body...</li>
            <li> and I was so glad to see this in CVS...</li>
            <li> have to say, the comments had me a bit leery, but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them anyway.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that problem, and that&#x27;s something that most heating curlers do to my hair.  </li>
            <li> i have plenty of time and hold the rollers in with my fingers, i love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone know of a better clip?</li>
            <li> Great curl, heat fast and give my hair lots of volume.</li>
            <li> Gives smooth body, lifts from the scalp, stays shaped!</li>
            <li> Will order another one because I need more rollers.  </li>
            <li> Love the rollers.</li>
            <li> If the company would manufacture a 1 1/4 inch roller bag to be sold to everyone, we would buy it on top of the set.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that these rollers don&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> She is well pleased with their performance and with everything else about them.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> SOOOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these 2 inch rollers--they are perfect for taming my medium length hair, which is thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It produces the most beautiful soft</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is longer than your shoulders and want a look that simulates how your hair looks after you blow dry your hair, this set would be an excellent choice.  </li>
            <li> But on the whole they are good rollers I am pleased.</li>
            <li> bought better clips at store and it works just fine</li>
            <li> I fine that the volume and wave does not stay for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> I have fizzy, curly hair and needed something to smooth it out after blow drying and didn&#x27;t want to have more curls.  </li>
            <li> These are great, helps with frizz and gives the hair a natural curve.  </li>
            <li> Just makes my hair look full, healthy, and effortlessly styled, rather than curled and styled, which I love.</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLE VOLUME EVEN ON LOW SETTING!!  </li>
            <li> Because Amazon is so reliable - fast shipping and good prices - I wouldn&#x27;t have had any issue ordering these from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of roller, wish it came with three more extra large rollers!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s easy to use and gives lots of body to my medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> So easy, and minimizes heat damage.</li>
            <li> THEY MAKE MY HAIR ROUTINE IN THE MORNINGS SO EASY.</li>
            <li> I have easy to manage hair and  this curler don&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t go anywhere ..</li>
            <li> There is no way to secure the top ones securely to my head.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quick (</li>
            <li> set easily.</li>
            <li> They are so affordable and make fixing my hair soooo easy.</li>
            <li> The set heats up very quickly, instructions recommend heating on \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting then switching to the lower setting if that&#x27;s what is preferred.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t break off my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets nice and hot on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of fine hair</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> I have medium length, fine hair</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and wavy, but I have a TON of hair.</li>
            <li> These were the size I wanted, but the clips didn&#x27;t stay put in my wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Smooth Waves Mega Volume 2 Inch Roller Hairsetter hot roller set comes with two-pronged \\&quot;prong\\&quot; type clamps, ironically they don&#x27;t work as well with the rollers in that set but work perfectly with the larger rollers in this set.</li>
            <li> The set gives me excellent volume with a little bit of a wave at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product, I just ordered a second set.</li>
            <li> you really have to know your own hair.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, they SMOOTH, not curl, so if you&#x27;re thinking of using these as a curling set, that&#x27;s not the purpose.</li>
            <li> Low heat setting works great.</li>
            <li> I really think my hair looks AMAZING after using these....</li>
            <li> Clip does not hold securely therefore roller falls out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Used as intended, they leave crimp marks, defeating the purpose of rollers designed to smooth your hair.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is fabulous.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit so they don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> Use after a blowout lightly of hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair wavy and smooth even with the humidity in Florida.</li>
            <li> I then take them out and smooth my hair with a brush, and my hair has loads of smooth volume.  </li>

            <li> I did try many times to get it right, to no avail.</li>
            <li> some of the other reviewers have said, the plastic clips aren&#x27;t great--they leave dents in my hair and don&#x27;t do a very good job of holding the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to a flat iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this large hot-curler set!  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Quick heat up, easy to use.</li>
            <li> You may be successful using these rollers if you buy extra clips and somehow use two to secure the rollers..</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up fast and 5 are the perfect number to place in my hair to get the body and shine I want without taking too long.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is super SUPER easy to curl, I&#x27;ve used hair rollers before but these rollers didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these</li>
            <li> (If she were more willing during the evening, I probably would opt for her styling!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smoothe out my long hair and give it movement, without burning it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Gives my style body, and smooth, full shape.  </li>
            <li> so I know how hot rollers work (I&#x27;ve bought so many over the years!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have super fine hair..</li>
            <li> I originally intended them to be the set I had for my boyfriend&#x27;s house, but now I am ordering an additional set because I love them so much!.</li>
            <li> Love these quick heating large hair rollers!  </li>
            <li> It is smoothe  with nice body and very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I could use just one more roller to fit all my hair more comfortably.</li>
            <li> They work best when I let my hair air dry after washing and then use rollers on the top layer of my hair only.</li>
            <li> The are quite large and are probably better for a  longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Well I was right!</li>
            <li> If you want beautiful thick and full sexy hair this is it....</li>
            <li> It would be better if it was even longer to really make the roller feel secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the high heat option (don&#x27;t even bother with the lower heat setting!)</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this brand of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I can let my hair air dry at night, and then pop these rollers in my hair in the morning, and it looks nice!  </li>
            <li> From the size, shape, and design of the set to the clips which work very well for me to the little pouch that you store your clips in--it all functions perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for my fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly but by no means am I scorching my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Heat quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super bouncey</li>
            <li> I like the results i get when I do the top layer of hair with the rollers and the bottom with a curling iron, but the process is more time consuming than simply throwing the rollers in.</li>
            <li> But the unit reheats rollers fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, and the covering on the rollers helps protect the fingers while putting them in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which I lost a good bit of due to medication.</li>
            <li> but when I used them they were VERY hot and the clips did not hold them in.</li>
            <li> Two of them cracked and broke when I opened them to put them around the roller on my very first use</li>
            <li> It also has 2 setting, the highest gets the rollers very hot and will immediatley make the rolls.</li>
            <li> The rollers do get very hot, so on shorter sections of hair (like around the bangs)</li>
            <li> They get very hot.  </li>
            <li> However, the very first time using them, one of the clips &amp;#34;sprang&amp;#34; apart.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find hot rollers this large anywhere...</li>
            <li> They are doable--they would fit nicely in the very slots the bigger rollers fit in.</li>
            <li> On the very positive side: I was looking for large hot rollers to give my fine, medium length, layered and colored treated hair some lift and smooth it out, and that&#x27;s *</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I wish it had more curlers, at least one more would be best.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find hot rollers that were 2 inches</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that can just &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; with no shape.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and layered, fine and straight but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and this works great in giving me waves / loose curls how I want.</li>
            <li> In theory, they should fit the whole way around the curler to avoid leaving an indentation.</li>
            <li> The best part so far is how soft my hair actually felt and looked.</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t secure the rollers very well</li>
            <li> I use this product to smooth out frizzy hair and to add wave to otherwise straight hair.</li>
            <li> Probably some safety regulation, because I have not seem true hot rollers since 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> If better wire clips aren&#x27;t available, These will go back.</li>
            <li> After hundreds of dollars worth of volume boosters, this was all I needed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I still struggle with it, but the finish is worth it and beats paying for my hair to be straightened or sitting for an hour while my daughter does it.</li>
            <li> They are so nice and big.</li>
            <li> Those two inch rollers have their place, but the smaller set would be really, really nice to have.</li>
            <li> The clips are OK, and have to be positioned right next to the scalp to keep the roller secure.  </li>
            <li> love my new hot rollers...</li>
            <li> but mainly it just smooths the hair, which is fine.</li>
            <li> Heats up fairly quickly but the rollers don&#x27;t get as hot as I would prefer.  </li>
            <li> So while many reviewers here comment that they&#x27;re great if you use them properly to get a tight fit with the clips, I was not able to do so successfully...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a bit of practice to curl up the hair just right and use the clips.</li>
            <li> well if you position them right and the clip marks &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; as your hair cools and relaxes some after taking the rollers out.</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;ll roll right off my head.</li>
            <li> She opened them and plugged them in right away.</li>
            <li> Right now my hair is like medium-long.</li>
            <li> I have to put little pieces of cotton under the curlers, so it won&#x27;t burn my head; but it does nice curls, very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are very large.  </li>
            <li> With very little effort these could have been great.</li>
            <li> Typically, with the smaller rollers hair does not look its best awhile after you take off rollers.  </li>
            <li> These work ok for my hair, but barely.  </li>
            <li> Although the rollers are large and that&#x27;s what I was looking for, I do not like the clips!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a superior product that offers two-inch rollers that provide smoothness as well as body; the choice of two heat settings provides an extra advantage..</li>
            <li> These really heat up quick.</li>
            <li> These are great for second day hair as well--it just pumps your hair back up and smooths out any kinks from sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great for second day hair as well--it just pumps your hair back up and smooths out any kinks from sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews more closely (my fault) since my hair is fine and does not need to be smoothed or straightened.  </li>
            <li> With my long hair I need more than 5 rollers but it was easy enough to just add two or three more because they heat so fast.</li>
            <li> I dropped one roller just two feet onto the bathroom floor, which often happens while using rollers, right, and it bent it completely out of shape and it won&#x27;t fit into the heating unit.</li>
            <li> , my hair is very straight</li>
            <li> Wife likes these very much.</li>
            <li> hair comes out soft and smooth with a large curl!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find TRUE jumbo 2\\&quot; rollers that I loved this set.</li>
            <li> I have a set of conair hot rollers if I want to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact, they dont even get as hot as my conair hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> and I think the set would be better if there were seven rollers to ensure coverage over your entire head at one time.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars since they will do exactly what you want if you want smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really doing the trick!  </li>
            <li> so she&#x27;ll have 10 setters instead of 5 to give her more options for different styles.  </li>
            <li> They get too hot on the scalp</li>
            <li> Hot on the head though so put a piece of kleenex under each roller to keep from burning your scalp.</li>
            <li> The rollers are perfect size but unfortunately slip through hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years and have always used the 5 roller set of 1 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li> I got compliments at work all day after the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could be better is the clips.  </li>
            <li> I have another set with slightly smaller rollers but they have metal clips (u-shaped) which work much better and do not cause creases.  </li>
            <li> The setter straightens out the kinks and adds a more flattering universal wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Do they even test it out first before putting it on the market?  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these!  </li>
            <li> Have been searching for 2 inch hot rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The return replace period had expired and I was dissapointed after spending more for the John Frieda brand only to have to throw them away.</li>
            <li> , I was looking for a hot roller set that would give my hair some body and add shine.</li>
            <li> so I can heat 10 at a time, make smaller sections and get even more curl and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> O love this curler, however, I needed a smaller size to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing in my life that has changed how my hair comes out.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product so much!</li>
            <li> exactly* what these hot rollers do.</li>
            <li> Because they get so hot, for my bangs</li>
            <li> This set probably works better for someone with shoulder length or longer hair so that they have enough hair to wrap around the roller and keep the heat off of the scalp.    </li>
            <li> With just past shoulder length hair, I have searched for a way to get it nice and smooth, without curls, and also without using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> These work: they are padded and not burning hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what I bought them for.  </li>
            <li> Weight was a huge concern given you&#x27;re putting five giant hot things on your head,  but they&#x27;re not bad.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> the clip broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and soft with just a bit of a curve at the ends.  </li>
            <li> too hot topick</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found one about 5 years ago made by Hot Tools that had 5 1 3/4 rollers, and while they worked better than the smaller rollers, they still were not quite there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they actually made my hair MORE FLAT ON THE TOP.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for years for a set of hot rollers this large</li>
            <li> The clips could hold a little tighter, but all in all, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The rollers are pretty good but the clips ALWAYS leave a mark on the hair that has to be either straightened with a flat iron or left looking like you had your hair tied up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> I love the 2&amp;#34; Jumbo rollers for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to use these much because the only clips they provide are the ones shown - which make creases in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, easy to use, only 2\\&quot; rollers I could find</li>
            <li> the rollers do not get hot enough to really smooth my hair out.  </li>
            <li> The rollers flipped my hair out pretty nicely on the bottom, but they were so heavy</li>
            <li> I like the large size of the ceramic rollers but the plastic clips do NOT hold the roller and within seconds the roller starts to slip away from the scalp.  </li>
            <li> so I need large size curlers.  </li>
            <li> I have to use my old set of smaller hot rollers on the underneath hair and the jumbos on the top layer.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my rollers last weekend, and after using them several times, I can honestly say that this is the holy grail of jumbo hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> They give your hair a lift and nice bend but not too tight a curl.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations, unfortunately my fine hair did not hold the curl, even after trying multiple ways.(I&#x27;m not one for hairsprays and gels, so that might have helped).</li>
            <li> Really like the large rollers and texture of rollers.</li>
            <li> I heat them on high, however, I read all these reviews about how hot these things get</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with rollers since high school.  </li>
            <li> On the high setting, the rollers get so hot they burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I used these a couple times, and they&#x27;re okay, but they kept slipping out of my hair and didn&#x27;t really curl my hair that well.</li>
            <li> The rollers give me ton of volume on top and a nice, soft, Victoria Secret style wave.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I knew when I bought these they would only give me some smooth body and wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li> As some reviewers stated, you will have problems keeping them in and they wont really do anything for you.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> They do the job but don&#x27;t stay in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Got this hairsetter to give my hair volume without too much curl.  </li>
            <li> You would not expect 2\\&quot; rollers to give you much curl</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother to really handle it much after I take the rollers out - I just let my hair fall and go.</li>
            <li> I put them in before applying my makeup so I can curl while getting my face ready.</li>
            <li> really really want these to work, so I will keep trying...</li>
            <li> fast work</li>
            <li> Plus, they don&#x27;t stay in place well, once you put them in, you have to remain VERY still</li>
            <li> The result is very curly hair, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t take up much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> They do not add much in the way of curl.  </li>
            <li> (really I need 10) that would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky.  </li>
            <li> and so you don&#x27;t get much of any curl at all.  </li>
            <li> and these didn&#x27;t produce much of anything.  </li>
            <li> I leave these in for ~20 minutes while I get ready in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;It so much healthier for my hair than what I&#x27;d been doing for years.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s real life</li>
            <li> Because I have so much hair, I plan to buy another</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the volume I get with these rollers.</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted something to straighten and smooth my hair, and these curlers fulfilled that.</li>
            <li> I do achieve the straight look I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received my rollers last night, and used them this morning, with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> Just notify everyone who bought the big rollers the others are available.</li>
            <li> Not stick straight.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough to buy a second one...  </li>
            <li> have only had them a couple of weeks but love them so far.</li>
            <li> Surprised John F didn&#x27;t think of making a larger product with more rollers for those with a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> For my fine hair, the lo was enough but on special occasions I would use the hi setting for extra assurance.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - was skeptical until i used them !</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally find 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great idea, but these did not get hot enough to curl my thick hair and the clips were too flimsy to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I bought these to get a smooth wave in my long hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get some of those long, metal roller clamp thingies at the drug store and use them to secure the hair instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These curlers are great for smooth waves, my only complaint being that the curler holders leave crimps in the wave that need to be smoothed out with a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> I left them in until they were completly cool</li>
            <li> You have to stay completely still or hold on to the rollers one side at a time - not practical and too hot.</li>
            <li> Says it heats in 2 mins, but it gets just about warm not hot enough to really do too much, my hair needs heat.</li>
            <li> Like the size as it initially creates a nice loose wave</li>
            <li> clip carefully, making sure the clip grabs a little of your hair by the scalp and they will stay pretty secure.  </li>
            <li> and when I take them out the wave look decent</li>
            <li> find 5 curlers to be more than enough, especially since the goal is body and volume.  </li>
            <li> have had many sets of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; rollers, but most come in a 1 1/2 inch roller set that ends up curling the hair or making it flip out weird (think Nancy Drew from the 60&#x27;s) at the ends.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even warm up enough to put a wave in my long, naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these.</li>
            <li> I considered looking for large metal U-shaped clips instead, but was concerned with how my hair would respond to the weight of the curlers, as well as about the fact that the curlers have gaps where the heating element fits in, whereby even if I found such clips, they might get stuck in those large gaps and/or really damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it will be better when my hair is a little longer.</li>
            <li> I am looking for a little more curl than these.  </li>
            <li> keep it long for special events</li>
            <li> As an older woman I have to use so many more and expensive products like keratin on my hair to make it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> leaving them in until all the heat has left them; your smooth hair will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I believe that this has more to do with how heavy the curlers are than the size of the plastic clips.  </li>
            <li> Many people also wrote in they had trouble with the clips staying in.</li>
            <li> For many years I have wanted the round brush salon look</li>
            <li> Wish there were a few more in the set.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that heated up properly and would be easy to do daily.</li>
            <li> With some effort and a bit of luck you can secure the rollers by affixing the clips end-on, digging one comb of the clip into the hair near your scalp, with the  other comb clamped down on top of the roller.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders (especially if I time it right or use a straightening solution).  </li>
            <li> If I had one wish, it is that a smaller curler was included because many of us want that little bit of volume on top, which these aren&#x27;t expected to give.</li>
            <li> The price was kinda high but worth it to finally find this larger hot roller set.</li>
            <li> I bought both of my sets on E-bay, brand new and shipped to my home for 29.99 each.  </li>
            <li> or I will be in search for new clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered a new set of clips for them.  </li>
            <li> Great for second day hair or days when you don&#x27;t have the patience to blow dry with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> The clamps are mega strong and hold the curlers in place but can leave a \\&quot;bend\\&quot; mark in the hair if placement is slightly off.</li>
            <li> I pop two curlers on both front sides of my hair, one at the high top middle in the back, and two at both the underneath back portions of my hair and this setter tames, straightens, and smoothes my hair.  </li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Rollers did not stay hot enough.</li>
            <li> bought these to create some bounce and volume, and i got the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and heated them as hot as possible.</li>
            <li> Other smaller rollers heat up as you add and remove if you need more.</li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair (a few inches past my shoulders in long layers) and these rolers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair (a few inches past my shoulders in long layers) and these rolers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> So I am buying a second set for duel-ling hot setters.  </li>
            <li> She has thick long hair and these hair setters give her hair that full, sexy look.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to accomplish with a little practice and familiarity.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products with a rollers just a bit smaller that work far better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they get near hot enough</li>
            <li> I just take the roller out after several seconds and my bangs are full enough.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, they are designed to smooth hair (almost like a flat iron), yet retain body and volume (unlike the effect you get with a flat iron).  </li>
            <li> , I went into this purchase very skeptical that these would be any better, but I love everything about them.  </li>
            <li> think these would be really good for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that, unlike other hot rollers I&#x27;ve ordered, these are truly jumbo size, necessary for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long layers (straight, thick dark brown Asian hair) and these rollers are perfect for adding volume and giving that salon look in just 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually too large to make a curl.</li>
            <li> the clips are not sturdy or large enough so the curlers flip around on my head.  </li>
            <li> not happy with this purchase at all, rollers do not curl at all, clips are very cheap and do not hold rollers very well.</li>
            <li> These are cheap plastic and not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I think they are defective, the high setting barely heats them.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal for me personally because it&#x27;s hard to find really good 2 inch rollers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are fabulous and heat up in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Big rollers that produce gentle curves.  </li>
            <li> Much faster but with my Asian hair I have to follow up with hair spray to keep the curl.</li>
            <li> but wow my life just got easier.</li>
            <li> they make my hair look like I have had a professional blow</li>
            <li> ,.took a long time for the rollers to get hot,</li>
            <li> I also wish there were 1-2 more rollers I need at least 6 to cover my head.</li>
            <li> morning, I blow-dried my hair, rolled these suckers in, started on my makeup in about 10-15 minutes, I was brushing out the most luxurious, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> All i can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a set of 2 inch rollers and finally found these, they heat fast, work well,</li>
            <li> I really like this set, the only reason for 4 stars is I wish there were 6 rollers and not 5</li>
            <li> The curl provides a soft flowing look.</li>
            <li> naturally curly/wavy.  </li>
            <li> They leave ridges in your hair near your scalp or point of contact with your hair.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is much shorter or you have short layers, they may not work</li>
            <li> If your hair is much shorter or you have short layers, they may not work well.</li>
            <li> Makes my thick hair smooth and  very silky</li>
            <li> I put one on my front left side, 1 on the front right, 1 on a portion of the back crown, and 1 on each side to finish the remainder of hair.  </li>
            <li> For years I used a flat iron but my hair looked too straight.</li>
            <li> My hair is just as straight and flat as it ever was after using these curlers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to working with hot roller clips but these do not hold as well as my old ones and they can leave a dent in your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful about the placement.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews but it does absolutely nothing for me :(</li>
            <li> The clear plastic top also does not seal or snap shut in any way so they are not good for travel.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had another previous set.</li>
            <li> and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to wash my hair at night, blow it dry quickly, and then flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> I only use the high.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have noted, the rollers are very large, so curling is not what they are made for.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product unless you have used these type of cheap plastic clips in the past and like them.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews state that rollers are heavy and this is true</li>
            <li> If you are looking for big loose curls this is the right product...</li>
            <li> i wish they made those u shaped clips like they have for other hot rollers</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other setter sets I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> , it works as well as any other hot roller.</li>
            <li> This is small enough you could travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> I use these very loosely, hard to keep the clips secure for some reason.</li>
            <li> The clips in general do leave a &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34; or indentation in your hair.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li> I could barely wrap my hair around these rollers once.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a larger soft wave.</li>
            <li> If you have medium hair, it barely \\&quot;flips\\&quot; your hair.</li>
            <li> Second, all of the reviews are true that say these rollers are too heavy with a combo of crappy clips</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves are nice as it is the unit but without the clips, they are useless.</li>
            <li> - doesnt burn - and takes way less time than a curling iron or round brush/blow dry and does a much better job!</li>
            <li> I say loveD because I had to throw them out on the very first day of a European vacation, they instantly fried - despite the proper adapter. :(    </li>
            <li> Heats up quick and can be unplugged to use a little less intense</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviewers, I have no problem with the clips leaving marks in my hair, I actually really like these clips.  </li>
            <li> It is a hot mess in the morning.  </li>
            <li> not so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to find the wire clips for these as I think they would work better, but you can&#x27;t buy them anywhere.</li>
            <li> I will simply replace with the old school u shaped metal things at a later date.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY naturally curly, and holds water, so it takes forever to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to get it as I was sure that the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; was coming, since, like that particular reviewer, I have thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long (mid-back) length hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I use these hot rollers instead of blow drying with a round brush.</li>
            <li> (I smooth out the bottom layer of my hair with a Sedu flat iron because, like I said, my hair is thick and frizzy.)</li>
            <li> let my hair dry naturally, then I put 10 of these rollers in my hair, and believe it or not, I end up with voluminous, straight hair with a lot less damage than I would get from blow-drying and flat-ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me and it left it with limp wave.  </li>
            <li> and  also not hot enough, so basically you get a wimpy,  so - so wave that don&#x27;t last 15 minutes, it might as well pick up my older iron</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine hair, I would imagine these probably just arent for you.  </li>
            <li> Thin and fine.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair (it falls down to my bum crack)and as much as I love it</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t well past your shoulders, all these do is provide a smooth, slightly curled under finish.</li>
            <li> This does not work because you have to put a significant amount of hair around each roller (even if you hair thin hair like me) because there are only five rollers.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep them as it&#x27;s difficult to find hot rollers this large.  </li>
            <li> Pulled muscle in the shoulder prevents keeping my arms raised long enough to do a proper style with the brush, so I sought an alternative with these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for large rollers ever since my hair got longer and the small rollers out there (that still claim to be \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; but aren&#x27;t) just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I do like the wave these give my hair if left in long enough and headed long enough.</li>
            <li> Has the same effect as taking a GIANT roller brush and blow drying chunks of hair when it&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> A straightner can make my hair look so flat, not to mention the damage it does.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could return it, but I had to open and wait to use for an event, so now It&#x27;s too long of a time to return.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience for flat irons or blow outs</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> - my hair has volume, is slightly wavy, and isn&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; like the results I get when using a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The clips could be improved though, they seem like they won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> They left hideous indentations, which I had to blow dry out afterwards.</li>
            <li> gave this product 4 stars because my only complaint is that the clips didn&#x27;t hold all of my hair very well.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up big and loose and shiny.  </li>
            <li> They weighed my hair down so much that no matter how tightly I wound my hair around the rollers.</li>
            <li> I did not think this did very much for my hair and the actual product seemed to be poor quality.</li>
            <li> The plastic clips with this set are cheap and basically useless.  </li>
            <li> but they still stay in place as long as you don&#x27;t engage in any vigorous activity.</li>
            <li> I will also be returning the rest of the John Frieda line because it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hair must be medium to long length.</li>
            <li> I have long but layered hair.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> but it looks like I had a professional blow out with a round brush.</li>
            <li> They take a long time to heat up and the clips do not stay on the rollers.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG</li>
            <li> And adding a volumizer and a smoothing creme or oil will go a long way with these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try</li>
            <li> This will work well on long hair.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had long hair lots of times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get these.</li>
            <li> The ends of the rollers are wide enough to hold onto without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, I can&#x27;t see how</li>
            <li> I have long hair and a lot of it</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to tame my thick wavy hair without during a full blowout.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this set WILL NOT provide curl, only smoothing and some volume.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tends to frizz, so have to use a round brush to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> Not like the older ones that were actual metal and hard plastic and worked for decades!</li>
            <li> I refuse to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I let my hair dry on</li>
            <li> But used on completely dry hair, it works as well as the very-hot type rollers for me.  </li>
            <li> With the jumbo rollers I can just let my hair basially air dry (blow just a bit) and then put the 5 rollers in.</li>
            <li> This would have been a great product if the clips didn&#x27;t leave such terrible kinks in your hair.</li>
            <li> Think i might order a set of extra rollers so I can heat a few extra up while I pin the others in.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I really need 7 rollers for my full head (I have a lot of thick hair a little past my collarbone).  </li>
            <li> did buy a set by Babyliss last year that had a mix of jumbo and large rollers that worked well in theory, but for some reason they just left my hair with weird ridges and dents.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush through, because I like the &#x27;piece-y, separated&amp;#34; full-body look; instead, I just turn my head upside and loosely shake it out.</li>
            <li> Like others have said the clips tend to be loose.  </li>
            <li> and this set still only does about half my head.</li>
            <li> I use all 5 when my hair is still slightly damp after a shampoo, and the look I get lasts til the next washing!</li>
            <li> I color frequently so it can be dull, dry, and frizzy at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I agree the clamps don&#x27;t hold it in place tight enough to apply any heat coming off of the roller</li>
            <li> It definitely smooths the hair but dont expect a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Clips doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough...</li>
            <li> These rollers are larege enough not to make those little girl curls.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> me make it very clear that I am VERY LAZY when it comes to my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two complaints:  with so few rollers I need three heats to do my entire head, but I knew that before I ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do exactly as expected and described.  </li>
            <li> but the clips don&#x27;t hold as well as expected..</li>
            <li> This item was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes later, when she tried to use them, the curlers would not come out.</li>
            <li> They had melted in their case and the one curler that did come out,had the purple/blue plastic part melted and would not fit back in the case.</li>
            <li> but the result is the same as a round brush blow out, which I could never master.  </li>
            <li> Also, careful, have burned my face with the rollers.</li>
            <li> They give you a look that is similar to blow out (with a round brush) that you get from a salon.  </li>
            <li> I did have to flat iron out the little kinks though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will have luck to find large older style clips as previously suggested and annoyed I need to do that anyway!</li>
            <li> last con is that I wish it came with at least 8 curlers for us long hair gals.</li>
            <li> As other users have noted, you&#x27;re not really going to get curls from these due to the size.</li>
            <li> The first problem is that the rollers are too heavy for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was using 1 1/2 inch rollers to straighten a little.  </li>
            <li> They are a small set and there are only five rollers</li>
            <li> The clips did not hold the curler at all, I had to use other clips that I had.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try the Conair Extreme Heat rollers instead</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other thing are the clips.</li>
            <li> This was my result, and my hair is several inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> You roll your hair, spray with hair spray,  fluff with fingers, spray again, and go!</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat curly hair (below shoulder length) and flat ironing is so damaging and takes a really long time.</li>
            <li> and now I have a little less than average, so it falls flat.</li>
            <li> Overall, nice waves and body, horrible application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to say that this is a bad product, it just doesn&#x27;t work on my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and unfortunately, these rollers are too large for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Must be a little careful with the clips though.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the clips are just average for keeping the curlers inplace.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have curl my hair in two sections.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is the clips.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to make one that has at least 8-9 rollers.</li>
            <li> So I have fairly long hair past shoulder length,</li>
            <li> First, the clips that come with this are complete crap.</li>
            <li> , if I used them I would have to buy another set, because 5 wasn&#x27;t enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair and it is just above my shoulder</li>
            <li> Heat the rollers with the cover down, and wait about 5 minutes so that they will get hotter.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes down about 4 or 5 inches past my shoulders but isn&#x27;t very thick and is a medium fine texture, this might work if I had a hundred rollers each with a paper thin section of hair on each</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and don&#x27;t need much to get a wave or curl</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have the time to deal with it every single morning, so it usually ends up in a ponytail or a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me less than 5 minutes to turn it on and roll all of my hair.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re less money as well.</li>
            <li> They take less than 10 minutes to heat up and 8-10 minutes to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> However if you have frizzy and sometimes lifeless hair, and are looking to cut your styling time in half, these rollers will do the job.  </li>
            <li> One side of the comb clip is slightly longer.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to find them and found them for substantially less, so I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep trying to use less and less hair thinking that will work</li>
            <li> I put these in after blow-drying my hair upside down (for volume), and after spraying a little Bumble &amp; Bumble &amp;#34;Do it all&amp;#34; styling spray, then I leave them in while I do my make-up and get dressed.</li>
            <li> Too much to mess with.  </li>
            <li> with my hair being thick and long, I knew I&#x27;d get body.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair, you will need 2 sets of these.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, these didn&#x27;t work for me, they didn&#x27;t straighten curl or anything.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Only slight downsides (I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers) is that the clips are a bit flimsy - they haven&#x27;t broken on me</li>
            <li> They are a little wobbly once you get them in, so</li>
            <li> So, I think they&#x27;re a little over-priced on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found I needed to hold them away from my head for a little bit.</li>
            <li> and they could still be with a little improvement.  </li>
            <li> A little curve and a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my experience lined up exactly with another reviewer who said that the clips crimped her hair around the roots - not a good look.  </li>
            <li> That causes the clips to have trouble staying on the rollers.</li>
            <li> The curlers are SO HEAVY they do not stay on your head..</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t being especially rough with them.</li>
            <li> These rollers are 2 heavy</li>
            <li> I ended up having to hold a few of them in for 10 minutes...</li>
            <li> It took a few hours before the curl fell out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with rollers being too heavy, clips staying in, or leaving marks on my hair.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I think the rollers are too heavy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews I have read about this roller set are I believe due to unmet expectations.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used electric curlers in decades but was tired of flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> The clips are not easy to use.</li>
            <li> make these next to impossible to keep in your hair, especially on the sides of your head.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t post reviews but since I rely heavily on customer feedback</li>
            <li> This may be idea for those that have thin long hair.</li>
            <li> If you expect these rollers to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair, then I will tell you right now you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My hair normally frizzes at the mere mention of rain! :</li>
            <li> Since my hair isn&#x27;t very thick i have to be careful when i put them on</li>
            <li> Not sure what some of the complaints were all about.  </li>
            <li> The curler did nothing for my hair, not even a small wave after I took them out.</li>
            <li> They are a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> It is just past my shoulders blades.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to make this purchase becuase there are only 5 rollers</li>
            <li> I usually do my makeup with the rollers in and by the time I&#x27;m finished, I take the rollers out.</li>
            <li> I have done extensive research and been unable to find metal clips.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Hair length is about 2 inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> These are the lazy girl&#x27;s hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> Not a safe product.</li>
            <li> The curlers are VERY heavy</li>
            <li> This 2 inch Jumbo Hair Setter is very heavy and can&#x27;t do anything for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a 30-something girl who loves playing with hair, and I had a hard time.</li>
            <li> the rollers are hard to use.  </li>
            <li> This prudyct is aweful, NOT worth a penny!!!</li>
            <li> (duh)</li>
            <li> I never liked how curly that size made my hair.  </li>
            <li> If there were at least 8</li>
            <li> I was hoping for waves at least.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light, which imo is why they don&#x27;t leave those nasty indents in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Leave them in for at  least 15 minutes to get the maximum  bend to hair.</li>
            <li> This is a common problem with many&lt;</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work well with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and like to wash it at night.  </li>
            <li> But if you are like me and your arms get tired from trying to round brush-dry your hair, this is a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> I had to get 2 sets for my thick hair</li>
            <li> I think if you don&#x27;t have thick hair, this may not be a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It might work if you set it wet and sat up all night in a chair with the curlers in until they dried, but since that&#x27;s impossible, I&#x27;m not a happy customer at all.  </li>
            <li> i have a weird dent in my hair and little to no volume at all.  </li>
            <li> Not to thick, not too thin...</li>
            <li> This is pure waste of money!!!!!!!.  </li>
            <li> Does not curl well because it is weak</li>
            <li> Wish I can get my money back  :(</li>
            <li> Clips don&#x27;t hold well:( also was sent two sets/boxes, need to return the extra one.</li>
            <li> The company should produce one with 7-8 rollers for us thick haired ladies!</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, beware.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me - it was a lot of effort with poor results, so it was returned.</li>
            <li> One clip arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> gave it away because I hate returning products back to the post office (I don&#x27;t drive) ..</li>
            <li> if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to curl.</li>
            <li> There must be something wrong with my hair.</li>
            <li> sadly I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> and I was concerned to read that others had gotten indents from the clamps and that the clamps were very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These rollers desperately need metal clips.  </li>
            <li> I have heard blowing cold air on the curlers before taking them out can help.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not that crazy about the clamps.</li>
            <li> too bad :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the clips.</li>
            <li> but I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as the quality of the product IS great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> something I hate to do.</li>
            <li> Worthless product</li>
            <li> I truly hate the clips.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star because I hated the fact that they had to just be thrown away.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in these rollers!</li>
            <li> .. very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed yet again with another hair product.  </li>
            <li> The plastic butterfly clips that come with it are the worst.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the clips are HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips are horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really excited to get these but when I used them they were VERY hot and the clips did not hold them in. They also left lines in your hair where the clips were after you had to hold them on there! Trying to return them</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, easy to use, only 2\\&quot; rollers I could find anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two complaints:  with so few rollers I need three heats to do my entire head, but I knew that before I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the rollers do not get hot enough to really smooth my hair out.  Probably some safety regulation, because I have not seem true hot rollers since 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Curlers work to straighten hair. The clips are not easy to use. They don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> I have very long layers (straight, thick dark brown Asian hair) and these rollers are perfect for adding volume and giving that salon look in just 15-20 minutes. I put these in after blow-drying my hair upside down (for volume), and after spraying a little Bumble &amp; Bumble &amp;#34;Do it all&amp;#34; styling spray, then I leave them in while I do my make-up and get dressed. After I take them out I don&#x27;t brush through, because I like the &#x27;piece-y, separated&amp;#34; full-body look; instead, I just turn my head upside and loosely shake it out. The finishing touch is just a dab of B&amp;B&#x27;s Brillliantine cream on the ends for extra separation and shine. Only slight downsides (I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers) is that the clips are a bit flimsy - they haven&#x27;t broken on me but they seem to be made for hair that&#x27;s not quite as long/thick as mine. Also, I do have a lot of hair, and five rollers isn&#x27;t quite enough; Seven would be the perfect number but I make do with the five and my hair looks amazing every time.</li>
            <li> Returned this. Clips don&#x27;t hold the rollers</li>
            <li> Curlers are huge &amp; good for hair that&#x27;s longer than shoulder length. The plastic butterfly clips that come with it are the worst. They not only don&#x27;t hold the curlers in place well, but leave that crease/line in your hair. If better wire clips aren&#x27;t available, These will go back.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product, I just ordered a second set. Some reviews state that rollers are heavy and this is true but they still stay in place as long as you don&#x27;t engage in any vigorous activity. After all it only takes 10 minutes to get results. It is also impressive how quickly those heat up.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated...you really have to know your own hair.  I knew when I bought these they would only give me some smooth body and wave to my hair.  A straightner can make my hair look so flat, not to mention the damage it does.  I&#x27;ve used various jumbo rollers before, including the velcro ones, so with my hair being thick and long, I knew I&#x27;d get body.  I have a set of conair hot rollers if I want to curl my hair.  If you have thin, fine hair, I would imagine these probably just arent for you.  As some reviewers stated, you will have problems keeping them in and they wont really do anything for you.  Unlike some other reviewers, I have no problem with the clips leaving marks in my hair, I actually really like these clips.  They are a little wobbly once you get them in, so clip carefully, making sure the clip grabs a little of your hair by the scalp and they will stay pretty secure.  I heat them on high, however, I read all these reviews about how hot these things get and I totally disagree.  They heat up quickly but by no means am I scorching my fingers.  In fact, they dont even get as hot as my conair hot rollers.  Not sure what some of the complaints were all about.  They do exactly as expected and described.  I received them in 2 days. Plug and go.  I love them.</li>
            <li> not happy with this purchase at all, rollers do not curl at all, clips are very cheap and do not hold rollers very well.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set of rollers.  They heat up quickly and are easy to use.  I have shoulder length hair and unfortunately, these rollers are too large for my hair.  They are a small set and there are only five rollers and I think the set would be better if there were seven rollers to ensure coverage over your entire head at one time.  If you have hair that is longer than your shoulders and want a look that simulates how your hair looks after you blow dry your hair, this set would be an excellent choice.  i wish my hair would grow longer so that I could use them.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of these hair curlers I&#x27;ve bought. 5 curlers is nice. 6 would be better. I love the fullness it creates in my hair, and it takes away my flyways, too! That&#x27;s quite a feat for my curly hair. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the clips. I packed my set and took it with me traveling - they&#x27;re plastic, and one of the clips broke. It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these curlers!  I bought 2 sets and use them both at the same time, as I have a lot of hair.  It produces the most beautiful soft curls.&lt;br /&gt;They are fabulous and heat up in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work well with thick hair. I left them in until they were completly cool &amp; it barely curled my hair.</li>
            <li> The clips did not hold the curler at all, I had to use other clips that I had.  The curler did nothing for my hair, not even a small wave after I took them out. They&#x27;re actually too large to make a curl. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely horrible. I have fine hair, which I lost a good bit of due to medication. I used to have a lot of fine hair and now I have a little less than average, so it falls flat. I bought the whole line of John Frieda thickening product and these rollers, which seemed like the perfect solution. The first problem is that the rollers are too heavy for thin hair. They weighed my hair down so much that no matter how tightly I wound my hair around the rollers. I did try many times to get it right, to no avail. Second, the clips are a disaster. In theory, they should fit the whole way around the curler to avoid leaving an indentation. This does not work because you have to put a significant amount of hair around each roller (even if you hair thin hair like me) because there are only five rollers. That causes the clips to have trouble staying on the rollers. They left hideous indentations, which I had to blow dry out afterwards. The rollers flipped my hair out pretty nicely on the bottom, but they were so heavy, they actually made my hair MORE FLAT ON THE TOP. They are getting returned. They are a complete disappointment. I will also be returning the rest of the John Frieda line because it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations, unfortunately my fine hair did not hold the curl, even after trying multiple ways.(I&#x27;m not one for hairsprays and gels, so that might have helped).</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough.  Having said that, they SMOOTH, not curl, so if you&#x27;re thinking of using these as a curling set, that&#x27;s not the purpose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to say that this is a bad product, it just doesn&#x27;t work on my kind of hair. My hair comes down about 4 or 5 inches past my shoulders but isn&#x27;t very thick and is a medium fine texture, this might work if I had a hundred rollers each with a paper thin section of hair on each but it&#x27;s not for me!</li>
            <li> These are awesome!..If you are looking for big loose curls this is the right product...&lt;br /&gt;Gave my hair lots of body..easy to use..I love them!!</li>
            <li> Good to reduce friz. Low heat setting works great.</li>
            <li> These rollers are just okay.  They are very large.  I have fizzy, curly hair and needed something to smooth it out after blow drying and didn&#x27;t want to have more curls.  They do the job but don&#x27;t stay in my hair very well.  I decided to keep them as it&#x27;s difficult to find hot rollers this large.  The clips leave a dent sometimes, not like the ones with the pins.  I&#x27;m letting the layers grow out in my hair so maybe it will be better when my hair is a little longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what a needed...lift and body to my hair!</li>
            <li> Great product ! It heats up super fast.  Great alternative to a flat iron - my hair has volume, is slightly wavy, and isn&#x27;t completely &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; like the results I get when using a flat iron.  Love it !! Hair must be medium to long length.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - was skeptical until i used them ! They make my hair look great.  Easy to use - doesnt burn - and takes way less time than a curling iron or round brush/blow dry and does a much better job!</li>
            <li> Will not stay in hair with the clips provided.  Metal clips would be better</li>
            <li> This is pure waste of money!!!!!!!.  The curlers are SO HEAVY they do not stay on your head..they just fall out.&lt;br /&gt;I sent John Frieda an email asking if they had better clips to hold these curlers, but as suspected, to date I have not received a reply.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Got this hairsetter to give my hair volume without too much curl.  It works.  My only complaint is that the clips are just average for keeping the curlers inplace.  I liked it enough to buy a second one...  It has updated my look!</li>
            <li> the clips are not sturdy or large enough so the curlers flip around on my head.  With very little effort these could have been great.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a quality product and I liked the coating on the rollers and I liked the way the clips are made. I just need to find myself something with smaller rollers.  I gave it 5 stars since they will do exactly what you want if you want smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would be really good for long thick hair. I should have read the other reviews more closely (my fault) since my hair is fine and does not need to be smoothed or straightened.  I am looking for a little more curl than these.  You would not expect 2\\&quot; rollers to give you much curl (duh) so I should have known better.  But I like all John Frieda&#x27;s products so gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for longer hair that tends to frizz. It took me less than 5 minutes to turn it on and roll all of my hair. The best part so far is how soft my hair actually felt and looked. I don&#x27;t bother to really handle it much after I take the rollers out - I just let my hair fall and go. It looks good no matter how it falls. And my hair rarely looks good on its own!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Big rollers that produce gentle curves.  I wish it came with 8 rollers.  The clips are just okay, but they do the job.  Takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I like the set but the clips don&#x27;t hold as well as expected..bought better clips at store and it works just fine</li>
            <li> I use these hot rollers instead of blow drying with a round brush. Much faster but with my Asian hair I have to follow up with hair spray to keep the curl.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these. I have long and thick hair. First, the clips that come with this are complete crap. Two of them cracked and broke when I opened them to put them around the roller on my very first use and I wasn&#x27;t being especially rough with them. Second, all of the reviews are true that say these rollers are too heavy with a combo of crappy clips make these next to impossible to keep in your hair, especially on the sides of your head. I am going to try the Conair Extreme Heat rollers instead and they&#x27;re less money as well.</li>
            <li> These rollers are 2 heavy and I feel like the curl does not have staying power. Back to my regular set, was hoping to get big curls and waves, but no chance.</li>
            <li> These are great, helps with frizz and gives the hair a natural curve.  The clips could be improved though, they seem like they won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have mid-length hair, these are perfect. They don&#x27;t curl your hair, they add volume. Quick heat up, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the large size of the ceramic rollers but the plastic clips do NOT hold the roller and within seconds the roller starts to slip away from the scalp.  Don&#x27;t waste your money until they get real and create a way to hold the roller.</li>
            <li> I like the size of these rollers but they DO NOT stay in place on your head with the clips.  On the top of your head they roll forward. On the sides the clips leave dents in hair. They need teeth so the hair has something to grab onto. Have not found wire clips marge enough to replace clips.</li>
            <li> I used these a couple times, and they&#x27;re okay, but they kept slipping out of my hair and didn&#x27;t really curl my hair that well. I ended up buying a 1 1/2 inch curling iron that works MUCH better. I was hoping these would work so I could curl my hair and do my makeup simultaneously, but no dice. Maybe if I practiced A LOT, I could get them to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if I used them I would have to buy another set, because 5 wasn&#x27;t enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that can just &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; with no shape.  I bought these rollers to help give shape to my hair...a  line, definition, a coiffed hair look.  Rollers succeeded in doing this.  It took but ten minutes...</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to tame my thick wavy hair without during a full blowout.  This is really doing the trick!  My only complaint is that I really need 7 rollers for my full head (I have a lot of thick hair a little past my collarbone).  Think i might order a set of extra rollers so I can heat a few extra up while I pin the others in.  The company should produce one with 7-8 rollers for us thick haired ladies!</li>
            <li> Love these quick heating large hair rollers!  The clips actually hold on!  Heat quickly.  The entire unit is pretty small so it fits on the side of my sink.  I would definitely buy these again and recommend.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life??!! LOVE this set! After hundreds of dollars worth of volume boosters, this was all I needed. Just got it, used it and love it! Have to get use to the clip placements but wow my life just got easier. This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;curling&#x27; set. It&#x27;s smooths and gives volume. Maybe I need another set to have more rollers......</li>
            <li> I was worried this product wouldn&#x27;t do the trick on my stubbornly curly hair.  It works wonders (especially if I time it right or use a straightening solution).  My only complaint is that I have curl my hair in two sections.  Thus I don&#x27;t use it often--only when I have that kind of time.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy a second set one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit of practice to curl up the hair just right and use the clips. Sometimes I still struggle with it, but the finish is worth it and beats paying for my hair to be straightened or sitting for an hour while my daughter does it. (If she were more willing during the evening, I probably would opt for her styling!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out soft and smooth with a large curl!</li>
            <li> Although the rollers are large and that&#x27;s what I was looking for, I do not like the clips! They leave a crimp in your hair. NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> This are some big rollers! They don&#x27;t always stay in my hair and I wish it came with the metal pin type clips but they save time when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I put them in before applying my makeup so I can curl while getting my face ready.</li>
            <li> OK, so I LOVE LOVE LOVE my hair after using these rollers. They will NOT give you curls. They give you volume, flippy, and beautiful super model hair! I have long but layered hair. Not to thick, not too thin...somewhere in between. I really think my hair looks AMAZING after using these....&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the clips are HORRIBLE. I wanted to cry this am after using them. I ended up having to hold a few of them in for 10 minutes...not so much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to find the wire clips for these as I think they would work better, but you can&#x27;t buy them anywhere. You may be successful using these rollers if you buy extra clips and somehow use two to secure the rollers..but that&#x27;s just a suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;I really really want these to work, so I will keep trying...but I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my John Fieda Body and Shine hair rollers. As an older woman I have to use so many more and expensive products like keratin on my hair to make it soft and shiney. My hairdresser told me that although these products are good they will just lay there on my hair and that what is need is heat to bring out the shine. For years I used a flat iron but my hair looked too straight. I told her I wanted to try going back to heated rollers. She thought that was a good idea and suggested 2&amp;#34; rollers for the length of my hair. It is just past my shoulders blades. I looked at many brands, types, and sizes and decided on the John Frieda 2&amp;#34; 5 rollers. The plastic clips hold my hair well if you position them right and the clip marks &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34; as your hair cools and relaxes some after taking the rollers out. I am short on time in the morning. The rollers heat up fast and 5 are the perfect number to place in my hair to get the body and shine I want without taking too long. I LOVE these rollers.</li>
            <li> Very good i love it&lt;br /&gt;I use travel adaptor it is wirking good&lt;br /&gt;Heet fast work just fine</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, delivery prompt, and product lovely looking.  I was anxious to get it as I was sure that the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; was coming, since, like that particular reviewer, I have thick and wavy hair.  Keep in mind that I have used jumbo electric curlers daily for years, just not quite the 2-inch ones.  Unfortunately, my experience lined up exactly with another reviewer who said that the clips crimped her hair around the roots - not a good look.  I believe that this has more to do with how heavy the curlers are than the size of the plastic clips.  I considered looking for large metal U-shaped clips instead, but was concerned with how my hair would respond to the weight of the curlers, as well as about the fact that the curlers have gaps where the heating element fits in, whereby even if I found such clips, they might get stuck in those large gaps and/or really damage my hair.  I returned these curlers, something I hate to do.</li>
            <li> These are amazing- you can wrap your hair, do your makeup then take them out and it looks like a blow out!! So happy I got them! !!</li>
            <li> I do really love the curlers.  The are quite large and are probably better for a  longer hair.  If you have really short hair they would not do..  They give your hair a lift and nice bend but not too tight a curl.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with rollers since high school.  I liked these (wish there were more in the pack) but the clips do cause crimping in my hair.  I will simply replace with the old school u shaped metal things at a later date.  This roller created a curl that lasted all day.  Super bouncey...loved...  I did have to flat iron out the little kinks though.</li>
            <li> The curlers work great.  Like other reviewers I wish it had more curlers, at least one more would be best.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas present for my wife.  She loves their performance and I love the look they give to her hair.  She has thick long hair and these hair setters give her hair that full, sexy look.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying her a second set so she&#x27;ll have 10 setters instead of 5 to give her more options for different styles.  Best thing since lingerie.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for these at all.  They get too hot on the scalp and I have to put a piece of tissue under each one.  Plus, they don&#x27;t stay in place well, once you put them in, you have to remain VERY still or they slip out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for my fine wavy hair.  I wanted a bit of body and wave and the rollers delivered.</li>
            <li> Love these curlers...they make my hair look like I have had a professional blow out.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the clips. They sometimes leave marks in my hair...i wish they made those u shaped clips like they have for other hot rollers</li>
            <li> I like this.  I&#x27;s easy to use and gives lots of body to my medium length hair.  Hot on the head though so put a piece of kleenex under each roller to keep from burning your scalp. That&#x27;s no big deal though.  This is small enough you could travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t post reviews but since I rely heavily on customer feedback I thought I should post. I was skeptical to make this purchase becuase there are only 5 rollers and I have long hair and a lot of it. Many people also wrote in they had trouble with the clips staying in. I was amazed that these 5 rollers were all I needed. I also dont have any issues with the clips. For many years I have wanted the round brush salon look but I never could achieve that on my own. These rollers allow you to have salon perfect hair. They take less than 10 minutes to heat up and 8-10 minutes to curl your hair. I usually do my makeup with the rollers in and by the time I&#x27;m finished, I take the rollers out. They do not make your hair curly but it looks like I had a professional blow out with a round brush.</li>
            <li> These do not heat up enough for me... They didn&#x27;t even warm up enough to put a wave in my long, naturally wavy/curly hair.  Also, 5 rollers wasn&#x27;t enough to do all my hair either.  Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Maybe the curlers are too big for my hair length, or maybe I need different clips.  But I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on properly curling my hair using these rollers and STILL ended up with big dents in my hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with layered hair or anything shorter than shoulder-length.  I could barely wrap my hair around these rollers once.  Five is not enough, either.  I didn&#x27;t feel like they got very hot...and they are heavy.  The rollers on the side of my head were pulling on my hair.  So while many reviewers here comment that they&#x27;re great if you use them properly to get a tight fit with the clips, I was not able to do so successfully...and I&#x27;m a 30-something girl who loves playing with hair, and I had a hard time.</li>
            <li> clips don&#x27;t keep hair in,otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to try the rollers. The rollers are perfect size but unfortunately slip through hair. Clip does not hold securely therefore roller falls out. Rollers did not stay hot enough. Sorry to say but I&#x27;m returning them.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, beware.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t stay on your head.&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can use these is to curl the bottoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to create some bounce and volume, and i got the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> The curlers are VERY heavy the the clamps provided don&#x27;t help to keep them in place.  I bought Conair clips and those did not work either.  You have to stay completely still or hold on to the rollers one side at a time - not practical and too hot. The clips also leave marks.  Very disappointing as the quality of the product IS great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for the pin style metal clips and could not find the Jumbo size.  Had to return the product.  Now evaluating Caruso Steam Rollers (they can leave marks too).</li>
            <li> I just love it! Just what I needed to add body to my hair. I strongly recommend this brand of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend them at all.,.took a long time for the rollers to get hot, and then when I started using them, almost burned my scalp. Not convenient at all.</li>
            <li> Gives smooth waves, love the hi/low settings, on/off switch and the best plastic grips for the curlers that I&#x27;ve ever used. Great purchase for the price</li>
            <li> Does not curl well because it is weak and it&#x27;s difficult to curl. I wish I could return it, but I had to open and wait to use for an event, so now It&#x27;s too long of a time to return. Wish I can get my money back  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for years and have always used the 5 roller set of 1 1/2 inch.  I never liked how curly that size made my hair.  It took a few hours before the curl fell out and I looked the way I wanted it to look.  With these 2 inch rollers my hair looks perfect the minute I take them out of the hot rollers.  I have medium length, fine hair and they give me tons of volume.  I got compliments at work all day after the first time I used them.  I love, love, love them!  The only thing that could be better is the clips.  I&#x27;m use to working with hot roller clips but these do not hold as well as my old ones and they can leave a dent in your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful about the placement.  I still give the product 5 starts because of the volume!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been able to use these much because the only clips they provide are the ones shown - which make creases in my hair.  I have long (mid-back) length hair that is naturally wavy so I need large size curlers.  I have another set with slightly smaller rollers but they have metal clips (u-shaped) which work much better and do not cause creases.  The plastic clips with this set are cheap and basically useless.  I have done extensive research and been unable to find metal clips.  I would not recommend this product unless you have used these type of cheap plastic clips in the past and like them.  The rollers themselves are nice as it is the unit but without the clips, they are useless.</li>
            <li> These reviews are hilarious. Rhodes scholars all over this product. Its for waves and volume obviously based on the rod circumference and does the job well. Heats in one minute.</li>
            <li> I like it; but it sometimes burns my fingers. I have to put little pieces of cotton under the curlers, so it won&#x27;t burn my head; but it does nice curls, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and like to wash it at night.  It is a hot mess in the morning.  I pop two curlers on both front sides of my hair, one at the high top middle in the back, and two at both the underneath back portions of my hair and this setter tames, straightens, and smoothes my hair.  It gets nice and hot on the highest setting.  I prefer this because I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and style it in the morning.  I can let my hair air dry at night, and then pop these rollers in my hair in the morning, and it looks nice!  The setter straightens out the kinks and adds a more flattering universal wave to my hair.  Will be great for travel too.</li>
            <li> love my new hot rollers...work great and get the smoothness I wanted. Makes my thick hair smooth and  very silky</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair, you will need 2 sets of these.  I bought both of my sets on E-bay, brand new and shipped to my home for 29.99 each.  So, I think they&#x27;re a little over-priced on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make it very clear that I am VERY LAZY when it comes to my hair.  I refuse to blow dry it.  My hair is VERY naturally curly, and holds water, so it takes forever to blow dry.  Therefore, I let my hair dry on it&#x27;s own.  The result is very curly hair, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat irons straighten my unruly, curly hair, but I cringe every time I use one because I know the damage it&#x27;s doing to my hair.  So, I thought I would give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry naturally, then I put 10 of these rollers in my hair, and believe it or not, I end up with voluminous, straight hair with a lot less damage than I would get from blow-drying and flat-ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of suggestions:  Heat the rollers with the cover down, and wait about 5 minutes so that they will get hotter.  Use heat protectant spray that also has medium hold.  (Yes, such a product exists.)  See if you can find a set cheaper on E-bay.  I bought my sets about a month ago, and there were several listings for these.</li>
            <li> These are the best size rollers for my frizzy hair.  Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Not 100% happy...They take a long time to heat up and the clips do not stay on the rollers.</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me - it was a lot of effort with poor results, so it was returned.</li>
            <li> There must be something wrong with my hair. I bought this because of the great reviews but it does absolutely nothing for me :(</li>
            <li> Awesome set of roller, wish it came with three more extra large rollers!</li>
            <li> These work ok but it would be better if the curlers were lighter in weight and the clips were a bit more sturdy.  Since my hair isn&#x27;t very thick i have to be careful when i put them on or they&#x27;ll roll right off my head.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is super SUPER easy to curl, I&#x27;ve used hair rollers before but these rollers didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I got a tiny kink at the ends of my hair. Kink, not curl. I don&#x27;t think they get near hot enough and I agree the clamps don&#x27;t hold it in place tight enough to apply any heat coming off of the roller.. very disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find TRUE jumbo 2\\&quot; rollers that I loved this set. I say loveD because I had to throw them out on the very first day of a European vacation, they instantly fried - despite the proper adapter. :(    Other than that, they were my go-to rollers. I love the hi-lo setting. For my fine hair, the lo was enough but on special occasions I would use the hi setting for extra assurance. On the high setting, the rollers get so hot they burn your fingers. And they don&#x27;t take up much space on the counter. With my long hair I need more than 5 rollers but it was easy enough to just add two or three more because they heat so fast. I liked the flexibility of being able use 1.5\\&quot; rollers if I wanted, because the unit is heated by bar so any size curler would fit. I also agree with others who say they do a great job of smoothing hair and adding volume without curl. I don&#x27;t have the patience for flat irons or blow outs (my hair can&#x27;t take that kind of heat anyway) so I would use these and then do my makeup. So easy, and minimizes heat damage. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with rollers being too heavy, clips staying in, or leaving marks on my hair.     All in all it was a great set until they fried. I wish John Frieda would update these for dual voltage and/or add one roller. The clear plastic top also does not seal or snap shut in any way so they are not good for travel. For this I must deduct two stars. Next I will be buying the dual voltage Conair for travel but I may come back to these for 2\\&quot; home use.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for rollers this size for years because I thought its what I needed. Well I was right! These are perfect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!!! I HAVE LONG HAIR/ MEDIUM COURSE HAIR AND USE THEM EVERY MORNING! I HAVE HAD THEM FOR 8+ MONTHS WITH NO PROBLEMS. THEY MAKE MY HAIR ROUTINE IN THE MORNINGS SO EASY. I JUST WISH THEY CAME IN LARGER QUANTITIES, BUT THAT CAN BE SOLVED BY ORDERING ANOTHER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> This item was not what I expected.  One clip arrived broken.  The clips in general do leave a &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34; or indentation in your hair.  I was hoping for a nice smooth style.  Because they are big rollers I knew they would not curl my hair.  I was dissapointed.  I did not think this did very much for my hair and the actual product seemed to be poor quality. I have tried other products with a rollers just a bit smaller that work far better.</li>
            <li> This would be a five-star review were it not for the clips that come with these rollers.  Used as intended, they leave crimp marks, defeating the purpose of rollers designed to smooth your hair.  With some effort and a bit of luck you can secure the rollers by affixing the clips end-on, digging one comb of the clip into the hair near your scalp, with the  other comb clamped down on top of the roller.  No crimp marks if this strategy works, which it doesn&#x27;t always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rollers desperately need metal clips.  I could find no after-market clips big enough to work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it,  it&#x27;s a piece of junk . I have easy to manage hair and  this curler don&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t go anywhere .. Do they even test it out first before putting it on the market?  It&#x27;s diffict to put on. and  also not hot enough, so basically you get a wimpy,  so - so wave that don&#x27;t last 15 minutes, it might as well pick up my older iron I&#x27;ll be done faster with  solid results.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it away because I hate returning products back to the post office (I don&#x27;t drive) .. This prudyct is aweful, NOT worth a penny!!!</li>
            <li> Clips don&#x27;t hold well:( also was sent two sets/boxes, need to return the extra one. I use these very loosely, hard to keep the clips secure for some reason. :/</li>
            <li> Just a note on my hair length/texture, to benefit the reader:  Hair length is about 2 inches past my shoulders.  Layered. Thin and fine.  I color frequently so it can be dull, dry, and frizzy at times.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noted, the rollers are very large, so curling is not what they are made for. Hence the product name, &amp;#34;Smooth Waves&amp;#34;.  However if you have frizzy and sometimes lifeless hair, and are looking to cut your styling time in half, these rollers will do the job.  They do not add much in the way of curl.  A bit of body and wave.  But if you are like me and your arms get tired from trying to round brush-dry your hair, this is a lifesaver.  I simply blow-dry my hair with a paddle brush, and pop these curlers in.  The heat smoothes the hair follicles.  And the rollers are covered in a velvety material, so they will not burn your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Try leaving them in until all the heat has left them; your smooth hair will last much longer.  And adding a volumizer and a smoothing creme or oil will go a long way with these.</li>
            <li> These are the lazy girl&#x27;s hair straighteners. I have been waiting for years for 2inch rollers to come out. Here they are... And my hair is fabulous.</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> I think they are defective, the high setting barely heats them.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This  just arrived, so I set my hair on it, per instructions, waited, then removed the curlers.  My hair is just as straight and flat as it ever was after using these curlers.  It might work if you set it wet and sat up all night in a chair with the curlers in until they dried, but since that&#x27;s impossible, I&#x27;m not a happy customer at all.  Worthless product if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Just received them and tried them. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The curlers give good volume and that fresh &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; look. I love the size of the curlers and the velvet coating smooths out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Says it heats in 2 mins, but it gets just about warm not hot enough to really do too much, my hair needs heat. Letting it sit for awhile and I hope they heat up to HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing are the clips. They do leave the indentation from the claws. I have to play with them to see how to hopefully make them work or I will be in search for new clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last con is that I wish it came with at least 8 curlers for us long hair gals. I have hair length to the middle of my back. It&#x27;s fine and wavy, but I have a TON of hair. If there were at least 8 (really I need 10) that would be helpful.</li>
            <li> returned, too big for my hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these!  They just didn&#x27;t get hot enough for me and it left it with limp wave.  I have shoulder length hair and if your hair is any shorter then that then these will not work for you.  It just didn&#x27;t give me the root lift that I was looking for....sadly I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair so I bought this set. It works great, but I needed more rollers. I should have bought the bigger size. This was my mistake, not Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, these didn&#x27;t work for me, they didn&#x27;t straighten curl or anything.  I did return them and purchase another different set.</li>
            <li> Have been searching for 2 inch hot rollers. No where to be found not even in Beauty Hair Supply Store.  If you want beautiful thick and full sexy hair this is it....Typically, with the smaller rollers hair does not look its best awhile after you take off rollers.  With these, Hair looks its best the moment they come off.  Your hair will look even better then the Kardashian Clan and Lilly Ghalichi hair.  Trust me, this is the best rollers. I&#x27;m very picky.  It also has 2 setting, the highest gets the rollers very hot and will immediatley make the rolls. Love Love this!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  I was so excited to finally find 2&amp;#34; rollers.  Couldn&#x27;t wiat to use them. The size of the rollers were perfect but the velvet coating does not allow them to get very hot and so you don&#x27;t get much of any curl at all.  I have very thin hair and don&#x27;t need much to get a wave or curl and these didn&#x27;t produce much of anything.  Also, the clips are horrible.  They don&#x27;t fit so they don&#x27;t hold and they leave a crease in your hair.  I am still looking for a set that have 2&amp;#34; rollers without the velvet coating and with wire clips and not the clamp type clips so if anyone has found them, please share!</li>
            <li> I would love if 2in rollers would come in more than 5pk. I have long thick hair. Would love 1 dozen. Rollers and heat up excellent</li>
            <li> These rollers burn my scalp. Can&#x27;t use them. Not a safe product.</li>
            <li> This 2 inch Jumbo Hair Setter is very heavy and can&#x27;t do anything for my curly hair. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These work for a blow out look. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I had to get 2 sets for my thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought these to get a smooth wave in my long hair in the mornings. I was my hair at night and by the morning it needs a pick me up. I do like the wave these give my hair if left in long enough and headed long enough. I truly hate the clips. There is no way to secure the top ones securely to my head. They end up falling all over the place. I also wish there were 1-2 more rollers I need at least 6 to cover my head. I leave these in for ~20 minutes while I get ready in the morning and when I take them out the wave look decent but mainly it just smooths the hair, which is fine. I fine that the volume and wave does not stay for more than an hour. I have heard blowing cold air on the curlers before taking them out can help. Overall, nice waves and body, horrible application.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star because I hated the fact that they had to just be thrown away.  I bought them for my daughter in July to give as a Christmas present. She opened them and plugged them in right away. A few minutes later, when she tried to use them, the curlers would not come out. They had melted in their case and the one curler that did come out,had the purple/blue plastic part melted and would not fit back in the case. The return replace period had expired and I was dissapointed after spending more for the John Frieda brand only to have to throw them away.</li>
            <li> These rollers are larege enough not to make those little girl curls.&lt;br /&gt;They smoothe out my long hair and give it movement, without burning it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up big and loose and shiny.  I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try these.&lt;br /&gt;It so much healthier for my hair than what I&#x27;d been doing for years.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair (it falls down to my bum crack)and as much as I love it, I don&#x27;t have the time to deal with it every single morning, so it usually ends up in a ponytail or a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it long for special events so I can style it into anything (I&#x27;m a singer so it&#x27;s real life 24/7 stage hair hahaha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was looking for a hot roller set that would give my hair some body and add shine. I wanted something that heated up properly and would be easy to do daily. THIS PRODUCT DOES IT! They heat up very quick (about 2 mins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I blow-dried my hair, rolled these suckers in, started on my makeup in about 10-15 minutes, I was brushing out the most luxurious, wavy hair. It was like Barbie hair, pageant hair - or porn star hair! lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am really impressed with this product. Because I have so much hair, I plan to buy another so I can heat 10 at a time, make smaller sections and get even more curl and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because my only complaint is that the clips didn&#x27;t hold all of my hair very well. I was able to remedy that by some strategically placed bobby pins in an \\&quot;x\\&quot; shape underneath the roller. I think if you don&#x27;t have thick hair, this may not be a problem at all. One side of the comb clip is slightly longer. It would be better if it was even longer to really make the roller feel secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get some of those long, metal roller clamp thingies at the drug store and use them to secure the hair instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have found something that makes me look like I made an effort in the morning :) Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this large hot-curler set!  It works great to give me that &amp;#34;blown-out&amp;#34; styled look that my stylist does so easily, but that I can&#x27;t manage without four hands!  Gives my style body, and smooth, full shape.  Love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other setter sets I&#x27;ve used.  But used on completely dry hair, it works as well as the very-hot type rollers for me.  This is a great product.  Thank you, John Frieda!!</li>
            <li> These curlers are great for smooth waves, my only complaint being that the curler holders leave crimps in the wave that need to be smoothed out with a flat iron or curling iron. If this came with pins instead of clips for the holders I would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> O love this curler, however, I needed a smaller size to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing in my life that has changed how my hair comes out.  Shiny, bouncy, and straightened.  Use after a blowout lightly of hair.  All i can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that, unlike other hot rollers I&#x27;ve ordered, these are truly jumbo size, necessary for long hair. Set works well, but would be much better with six rollers, rather than five, as most women would roll hair in six sections.</li>
            <li> The very best of all electric rollers!  Finally, a superior product that offers two-inch rollers that provide smoothness as well as body; the choice of two heat settings provides an extra advantage.. i  intend to order an extra set just to have on hand as sometimes manufacturers discontinue product lines (although  choosing  one with the John Freida name and reputation seem to avoid that pitfall).  Highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes my hair wavy and smooth even with the humidity in Florida. Would recommend this product so much!</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t well past your shoulders, all these do is provide a smooth, slightly curled under finish. Definitely won&#x27;t curl shorter hair, these curlers just make it look like you round-brushed it. This was my result, and my hair is several inches past my shoulders. I was hoping for waves at least. I followed the instructions and heated them as hot as possible. They work well for smoothing out kinks though.</li>
            <li> I really like the volume I get with these rollers. However, I have very fine hair and this set still only does about half my head. I like the results i get when I do the top layer of hair with the rollers and the bottom with a curling iron, but the process is more time consuming than simply throwing the rollers in. As other users have noted, you&#x27;re not really going to get curls from these due to the size.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my thick hair. Wish there were more curlers but they are some of the largest you can find. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for large rollers ever since my hair got longer and the small rollers out there (that still claim to be \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; but aren&#x27;t) just stopped working. I haven&#x27;t been able to find hot rollers this large anywhere...until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want body and volume and something to take the \\&quot;bends\\&quot; out of my hair after every wash. My hair is straight and this works great in giving me waves / loose curls how I want. Just makes my hair look full, healthy, and effortlessly styled, rather than curled and styled, which I love. This will work well on long hair. Right now my hair is like medium-long. But I&#x27;ve had long hair lots of times so I know how hot rollers work (I&#x27;ve bought so many over the years!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I could use just one more roller to fit all my hair more comfortably. Am thinking of ordering an extra. It comes with an order form.</li>
            <li> This works great, but it really needs another roller. I cannot use 5...need 6.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works as well as any other hot roller.</li>
            <li> It definitely smooths the hair but dont expect a tight curl. I have pretty thick hair and I wish there were just two more in the case so I could do all my hair at once. But the unit reheats rollers fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> These were the size I wanted, but the clips didn&#x27;t stay put in my wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a set of 2 inch rollers and finally found these, they heat fast, work well, nice clips come with, an A + item</li>
            <li> I have long hair and was using 1 1/2 inch rollers to straighten a little.  These 2 inch rollers straighten it beautifully and it remains straight.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. I don&#x27;t need more than 5 rollers and I can change out some of the for jumbo rollers from my conair set easily. You can always switch out smaller sizes if you want/need to but you can&#x27;t go larger. Wish I had been able to find this&#x27;s sooner. The price was kinda high but worth it to finally find this larger hot roller set.</li>
            <li> Loved the size and texture but temperature barely warm.</li>
            <li> I thought I had made a purchasing mistake when I saw how big the rollers were.  My hair is shoulder length and layered, fine and straight but lots of it.  My shortest layers only go around once but the result is the same as a round brush blow out, which I could never master.  In 10 minutes I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get these. They are so affordable and make fixing my hair soooo easy. I have thick somewhat curly hair (below shoulder length) and flat ironing is so damaging and takes a really long time. With the jumbo rollers I can just let my hair basially air dry (blow just a bit) and then put the 5 rollers in. In 10 minutes (while I am multi tasking away) my hair is done. It is smoothe  with nice body and very natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I have only had them a couple of weeks but love them so far.</li>
            <li> The best electric curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned. They are so nice and big. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these curlers almost a year ago, I saw some of the complaints were that they didn&#x27;t curl enough.  If you are expecting a lot of curls, these aren&#x27;t for you.  I actually wanted something to straighten and smooth my hair, and these curlers fulfilled that.</li>
            <li> Really like the large rollers and texture of rollers. Do not like the hair clips, leave marks on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.  If they made them even bigger in circumference, I&#x27;d get them.&lt;br /&gt;These are not for curl - but for lift.  They do the job.  I have several sets. They heat up&lt;br /&gt;fast - simple to operate.  Must be a little careful with the clips though. Roller placement is&lt;br /&gt;crucial or else they will rock and slip..This is easy to accomplish with a little practice and familiarity. These&lt;br /&gt;are the best on the market, from my experience, for big bouncy body...</li>
            <li> I have the 5 set smaller roller too. I can mix and match as I curl. Heats up quick and can be unplugged to use a little less intense&lt;br /&gt;heat if wanted to just be gentler to your hair. Other smaller rollers heat up as you add and remove if you need more.</li>
            <li> yes the rollers are big- but they don&#x27;t heat up like my Conair Jumbo rollers. too bad :(  Maybe if you have super fine hair..this might work?</li>
            <li> I really like this set, the only reason for 4 stars is I wish there were 6 rollers and not 5 and I&#x27;m not that crazy about the clamps. The clamps are mega strong and hold the curlers in place but can leave a \\&quot;bend\\&quot; mark in the hair if placement is slightly off. Infiniti Pro by Conair Smooth Waves Mega Volume 2 Inch Roller Hairsetter hot roller set comes with two-pronged \\&quot;prong\\&quot; type clamps, ironically they don&#x27;t work as well with the rollers in that set but work perfectly with the larger rollers in this set. Since I have both sets I just switch clamps.    On the very positive side: I was looking for large hot rollers to give my fine, medium length, layered and colored treated hair some lift and smooth it out, and that&#x27;s *exactly* what these hot rollers do. As other reviewers have said, this set WILL NOT provide curl, only smoothing and some volume. In addition to giving lift and smoothing the hair, these rollers leave the hair with a nice shine too.    The set heats up very quickly, instructions recommend heating on \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting then switching to the lower setting if that&#x27;s what is preferred. The rollers do get very hot, so on shorter sections of hair (like around the bangs) I found I needed to hold them away from my head for a little bit. Because they get so hot, for my bangs I just take the roller out after several seconds and my bangs are full enough. For the rest of my hair I let them stay in until cool and get great results. This set probably works better for someone with shoulder length or longer hair so that they have enough hair to wrap around the roller and keep the heat off of the scalp.    The ends of the rollers are wide enough to hold onto without burning your fingers. Another plus is the trapezoid shape to the set. This fits nicely into a counter corner or to store in cabinet corner under the sink. Of course if they added a 6th roller that might change this design, and I&#x27;d take the 6th roller over the shape of the set. But it&#x27;s a nice bonus since it is this shape.    I didn&#x27;t purchase this set at Amazon, I had a % off coupon for a store retailer so I purchased there. Because Amazon is so reliable - fast shipping and good prices - I wouldn&#x27;t have had any issue ordering these from Amazon. I just went for price.</li>
            <li> With just past shoulder length hair, I have searched for a way to get it nice and smooth, without curls, and also without using a blow dryer. These work: they are padded and not burning hot to the touch. I use all 5 when my hair is still slightly damp after a shampoo, and the look I get lasts til the next washing! If I had one wish, it is that a smaller curler was included because many of us want that little bit of volume on top, which these aren&#x27;t expected to give. Other than that, I am very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for years for a set of hot rollers this large and I was so glad to see this in CVS... until I saw they were selling for over $50.  I came to Amazon to find them and found them for substantially less, so I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, the comments had me a bit leery, but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased them anyway.  I have thin, fine hair and I was concerned to read that others had gotten indents from the clamps and that the clamps were very poor quality.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem, and that&#x27;s something that most heating curlers do to my hair.  Not these!  I also didn&#x27;t find the clamps to be of a low quality.  They&#x27;re light, which imo is why they don&#x27;t leave those nasty indents in my hair.  I think they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoothing claim isn&#x27;t hype.  We had a n&#x27;oreaster here today, and I got rained on, but despite that, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz or lose the body from the curlers.  My hair normally frizzes at the mere mention of rain! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find 5 curlers to be more than enough, especially since the goal is body and volume.  I put one on my front left side, 1 on the front right, 1 on a portion of the back crown, and 1 on each side to finish the remainder of hair.  The set gives me excellent volume with a little bit of a wave at the bottom.  That&#x27;s exactly what I bought them for.  Very happy!! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these to straighten out my curly hair.  They work.  Like others have said the clips tend to be loose.  I ordered a new set of clips for them.  They get very hot.  The highest heat burns my head.  I just use the medium.  I do achieve the straight look I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This would have been a great product if the clips didn&#x27;t leave such terrible kinks in your hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I will have luck to find large older style clips as previously suggested and annoyed I need to do that anyway!</li>
            <li> Clips leave a kink in your hair,&lt;br /&gt;If i have plenty of time and hold the rollers in with my fingers, i love the results.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know of a better clip?</li>
            <li> Weight was a huge concern given you&#x27;re putting five giant hot things on your head,  but they&#x27;re not bad.  Wish there were 7 of them but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for over 30 years. I wanted a larger soft wave. This didn&#x27;t even give that when i left them in forever. the clip broke on the first use. I returned it pronto.</li>
            <li> If you have medium hair, it barely \\&quot;flips\\&quot; your hair. If you have long hair, I can&#x27;t see how&lt;br /&gt;it would hold in the clips. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get a curling iron instead or smaller&lt;br /&gt;rollers.</li>
            <li> These really heat up quick. The size of the roller is much bigger than I have seen in department stores. The curl provides a soft flowing look.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tends to frizz, so have to use a round brush to smooth it out.  Pulled muscle in the shoulder prevents keeping my arms raised long enough to do a proper style with the brush, so I sought an alternative with these rollers.  I received my rollers last night, and used them this morning, with fantastic results.  They heat up quickly, and the covering on the rollers helps protect the fingers while putting them in the hair.  The clips are OK, and have to be positioned right next to the scalp to keep the roller secure.  My hair was smooth and soft with just a bit of a curve at the ends.  This was an excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Great idea, but these did not get hot enough to curl my thick hair and the clips were too flimsy to keep the rollers in place. I ended up returning the product. This may be idea for those that have thin long hair.</li>
            <li> These curlers are great. I have long hair and a lot of it so I actually purchased 2 of these and put 10 in my hair. Great curl, heat fast and give my hair lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Jumbo hot roller set; and this was perfect!!  The only downfall is that there are only 5 rollers, cant do a lot with that! My only suggestion is to make one that has at least 8-9 rollers.</li>
            <li> Gives smooth body, lifts from the scalp, stays shaped! My only issue is that  5 is not enough rollers. I have to use my old set of smaller hot rollers on the underneath hair and the jumbos on the top layer.  The clips could hold a little tighter, but all in all, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the 2&amp;#34; Jumbo rollers for my long hair.  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t break off my baby fine hair.  Will order another one because I need more rollers.  Surprised John F didn&#x27;t think of making a larger product with more rollers for those with a lot of hair.  Hmmmm.</li>
            <li> Love the rollers. However, the very first time using them, one of the clips &amp;#34;sprang&amp;#34; apart. Luckily I had another previous set. Like everybody else said, there should be ore. I have to combine 2 sets. But on the whole they are good rollers I am pleased.</li>
            <li> So I have fairly long hair past shoulder length, naturally curly/wavy.  I was so excited to find hot rollers that were 2 inches thinking I would get some great volume.  The clips don&#x27;t secure the rollers very well at all so when I take them out i have a weird dent in my hair and little to no volume at all.  Very disappointed yet again with another hair product.  I keep trying to use less and less hair thinking that will work but it doesn&#x27;t.  These will sit in my bathroom cabinet collecting dust.</li>
            <li> Heats up fairly quickly but the rollers don&#x27;t get as hot as I would prefer.  Like the size as it initially creates a nice loose wave but the waves are short-lived because of the heat issue.</li>
            <li> These give me the volume I was lacking. It doesn&#x27;t curl your hair, but gives it lift. I have medium length hair and these work great. I just wish they got hotter! That low setting is a joke. I only use the high.</li>
            <li> Like the size.  Wish there were a few more in the set.  Also, careful, have burned my face with the rollers.</li>
            <li> They serve the purpose.  The rollers are for shoulder length hair.  My hair is too short for 2&amp;#34; rollers.  They slip out.  Leave them in for at  least 15 minutes to get the maximum  bend to hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and add great volume! Love these curlers!</li>
            <li> the rollers are hard to use.  too hot topick up- ihate this</li>
            <li> I use mine almost every day!</li>
            <li> This set is exemplary with nice heat up time. If the company would manufacture a 1 1/4 inch roller bag to be sold to everyone, we would buy it on top of the set. They are doable--they would fit nicely in the very slots the bigger rollers fit in. Those two inch rollers have their place, but the smaller set would be really, really nice to have. I hope we get it soon. Just notify everyone who bought the big rollers the others are available.</li>
            <li> These are cheap plastic and not worth the money! I dropped one roller just two feet onto the bathroom floor, which often happens while using rollers, right, and it bent it completely out of shape and it won&#x27;t fit into the heating unit. I am so disappointed in these rollers! Quality just isn&#x27;t there. Not like the older ones that were actual metal and hard plastic and worked for decades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using heated curlers for over 25 year and have been searching for jumbo rollers for some time.  These looked&lt;br /&gt;perfect, and they could still be with a little improvement.  I&#x27;m talking about the clips.  This is a common problem with many&lt;br /&gt;rollers.  They leave ridges in your hair near your scalp or point of contact with your hair.  These John Frieda rollers themselves work great and leave just the right amount of wave, body, and smoothness to my hair.  Make improved clips and you&#x27;d have&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> The rollers are pretty good but the clips ALWAYS leave a mark on the hair that has to be either straightened with a flat iron or left looking like you had your hair tied up in a pony tail.  Too much to mess with.  Disappointed in that!&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my hair is very straight and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I recieved my rollers last weekend, and after using them several times, I can honestly say that this is the holy grail of jumbo hot rollers.  The negative reviews I have read about this roller set are I believe due to unmet expectations.  If you expect these rollers to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair, then I will tell you right now you will be disappointed.  5 2 inch jumbo rollers are not made to \\&quot;curl\\&quot; hair.  On the contrary, they are designed to smooth hair (almost like a flat iron), yet retain body and volume (unlike the effect you get with a flat iron).  I LOVE that these rollers don&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  They give you a look that is similar to blow out (with a round brush) that you get from a salon.  This is exactly what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many sets of \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; rollers, but most come in a 1 1/2 inch roller set that ends up curling the hair or making it flip out weird (think Nancy Drew from the 60&#x27;s) at the ends.  Still, I loved the volume these rollers gave, so I kept trying searching for a better set.  I found one about 5 years ago made by Hot Tools that had 5 1 3/4 rollers, and while they worked better than the smaller rollers, they still were not quite there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a set by Babyliss last year that had a mix of jumbo and large rollers that worked well in theory, but for some reason they just left my hair with weird ridges and dents.  They also flipped out the ends despite the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went into this purchase very skeptical that these would be any better, but I love everything about them.  From the size, shape, and design of the set to the clips which work very well for me to the little pouch that you store your clips in--it all functions perfectly.  I love the high heat option (don&#x27;t even bother with the lower heat setting!) and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to wash my hair at night, blow it dry quickly, and then flat iron it.  I have wavy hair that works well with some heat on it.  The next morning before work I plug in my roller set, and throw the 5 rollers (1 in front, 1 in crown, 1 on each side, and one in back) while I do my make up.  I only leave them in about 5-8 minutes.  I then take them out and smooth my hair with a brush, and my hair has loads of smooth volume.  I love it!  These are great for second day hair as well--it just pumps your hair back up and smooths out any kinks from sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a look like that of a curling iron (which I don&#x27;t like anyway) or smaller roller set--and it isn&#x27;t meant to be. I have medium-long hair (a few inches past my shoulders in long layers) and these rolers work perfectly for me.  If your hair is much shorter or you have short layers, they may not work well.work I plug in my roller set, and throw the 5 rollers (1 in front, 1 in crown, 1 on each side, and one in back) while I do my make up.

            <li> The 2 inch jumbo rollers in this set are perfect to create smooth, full hair.  Not curls.  Not stick straight.  A little curve and a lot of body.  Great for second day hair or days when you don&#x27;t have the patience to blow dry with a round brush.  As another reviewer mentioned - 5 rollers are really not enough.  So I am buying a second set for duel-ling hot setters.  Love these!</li>
            <li> Clips leave marks on hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a friend&#x27;s birthday gift.  She is well pleased with their performance and with everything else about them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used electric curlers in decades but was tired of flat ironing my hair.  These work ok for my hair, but barely.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair and it is just above my shoulder and it feels like I am about 1 curler short with this set.  It works for me but wouldn&#x27;t for longer or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It does make nice curls, but they keeps falling. Clips doesn&#x27;t hold tight enough... I think the rollers are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.  They are truly life-altering.  I originally intended them to be the set I had for my boyfriend&#x27;s house, but now I am ordering an additional set because I love them so much!. You roll your hair, spray with hair spray,  fluff with fingers, spray again, and go! I look just like I stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  INCREDIBLE VOLUME EVEN ON LOW SETTING!!  SOOOOOO GLAD I GOT THESE CURLERS!!  I purchased 2 sets!!  One for Texas and one for Florida.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. DO NOT BUY. Has the same effect as taking a GIANT roller brush and blow drying chunks of hair when it&#x27;s already dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these 2 inch rollers--they are perfect for taming my medium length hair, which is thick and frizzy. They work best when I let my hair air dry after washing and then use rollers on the top layer of my hair only. (I smooth out the bottom layer of my hair with a Sedu flat iron because, like I said, my hair is thick and frizzy.) The rollers give me ton of volume on top and a nice, soft, Victoria Secret style wave.&lt;br /&gt;Like some of the other reviewers have said, the plastic clips aren&#x27;t great--they leave dents in my hair and don&#x27;t do a very good job of holding the rollers in place. (Otherwise, I&#x27;d be giving this product 5 stars.) Not a big deal for me personally because it&#x27;s hard to find really good 2 inch rollers.  If you decide to purchase, do yourself a favor and order some inexpensive metal pins  or plan to pick some up at a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Wife likes these very much.</li>
            <li> I use this product to smooth out frizzy hair and to add wave to otherwise straight hair. I might order extra curlers so I can section my hair into smaller sections.</li>
