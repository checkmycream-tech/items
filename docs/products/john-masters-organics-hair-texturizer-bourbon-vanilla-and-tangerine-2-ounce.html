            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>It does not seem to flake though, which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, it smells great, but it also leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>It is a great conditioner for hair, skin scalp</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this.  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am happy to have bought this product as it verified that the homemade pomade that I made was superior.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, it has a citrus smell and does not make it seem like I am wearing perfume.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant -- tangerine -- but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, it works well and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells so good to me</li>
            <li>all good stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make my hair look really good</li>
            <li>Exceptional smell.  </li>
            <li>There are not that many organic hair care products on the market, so I was happy to find this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sure this adds to the shine of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great products, works better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Works nice shaping my style in place.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>I found this product to do what it needs to do by keeping your hair in one place but it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice feeling to your hair.</li>
            <li>This is kind of oily</li>
            <li>Nice foam but softer.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m guessing it was already cracked and they shipped it anyway, which is kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li>Smells like warm tangerine.</li>
            <li>It neither makes my hair look thicker nor holds any kind of shape at all.</li>
            <li>Just overlook the sticky at first and wash your hands after, your good!</li>
            <li>But it has nice texture to it, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I get more fullness in my hair.</li>
            <li>I like this much better then using products with wax.</li>
            <li>More like a sticky feeling</li>
            <li>I definitely love the smell of it</li>
            <li>I love the smell and takes out the frizz and keeps the curl.</li>
            <li>the top ingredient is CASTOR.</li>
            <li>Well you could, if you want more lift it would work.</li>
            <li>more shine.</li>
            <li>more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this pomade.</li>
            <li>Will buy again, for sure.</li>
            <li>Your will surely thank you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer than most pomades and sorta looks liks like coagulated vaseline.  </li>
            <li>The hold is pretty good, but it&#x27;s no hairspray â€“ it&#x27;s not even waxy.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said my hair really shines which means its in good condition.</li>
            <li>Recommend for anyone who wants a good hold without the weight.</li>
            <li>Washes out easy.</li>
            <li>Bourbon Vanilla is a type of vanilla though I wouldn&#x27;t say that the smell of this is too strongly vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product a few days ago but If you have straight hair it works fine and it leave a good and awesome smell and texture in your hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and all it does is make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>but all I ended up with was a floppy mess dripping with what looked like really delicious smelling cooking oil.</li>
            <li>It will spread evenly over your hair and &#x60;enhances light reflection&#x27; so its glossy looking, gives hair the &#x60;slip&#x27; for defining, and yep,</li>
            <li>I have a short pixie cut, and this is a great product to add texture to my hair.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a good natural thickener.</li>
            <li>I soon found out that less is more and now with the correct amount my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>And it smells fabulous -- a true, rich orange bourbon vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is unique in that it is not waxed based.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to go overboard the first time or two that you use it - because it smells so wonderful!  </li>
            <li>If you want a wet look, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I added my own Rosemary into it, and I&#x27;ll reapply into dry hair if I need more hold and shine.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, it gives my hair a nice and soft shine, with consistent hold.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does what the Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade does, but with a more modern, less shiny look.</li>
            <li>This one is more greasy and my fuzzies end up sticking up, the shine on smooths them down nicely.</li>
            <li>Works exceedingly well on tightly coiled hair (e.g. afro-ish, happy to be nappy, wooly, etc.).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side so use it sparingly, but it gives great texture.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>hair stays right where I put it.</li>
            <li>seed oil - right</li>
            <li>just right because I don&#x27;t get the humidity frizz from this product at all.</li>
            <li>Smells and works awesome.... but come on, soooo overpriced for a little jar,  should say &#x27;actual size&#x27; when looking at this item on your phone....</li>
            <li>My first reaction was ACKY.</li>
            <li>The first 5 ingredients are castor seed oil, glycerin, shea butter, sorbitol (a humectant) and panthenol.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>that does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and this works better on it than any other texturizer that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>It then looks pretty much like a mullet</li>
            <li>would prefer a bit more hold, but this product is a solid option and seems high quality.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to comb and you definitely need a strong arm to do it some days.</li>
            <li>Since I had to use a fair bit, this small 2oz bottle went fast and at $20...</li>
            <li>Overall -- super!</li>
            <li>My ends get very dry, and most products do nothing for this problem.</li>
            <li>Also, my curls really pull up</li>
            <li>It is very gooey and makes the hair stick together.</li>
            <li>It is a sticky unusual consistency.</li>
            <li>so I try not to use much.</li>
            <li>However, for whatever reason I dove in and really tried this thing.</li>
            <li>No broken fingers or goo.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really put this on your scalp.</li>
            <li>and it works really well for that.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Having said that a person doesn&#x27;t want to use too much at once to look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods hoping it would work.</li>
            <li>I needed to add so much my hair looked greasy or it wouldn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>But you really do need just the tiniest bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice smelling but heavy and a bit greasy</li>
            <li>It rinses off my hands using plain warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and many products are just absorbed into it and disappear</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do that for the normal body bars because it can leave the bar softer.</li>
            <li>A few of these reviews seem to think it&#x27;s like a styling gel when it&#x27;s more like a molding or defining paste</li>
            <li>I state, moisture, moisture and more moisture in the ingredientsit does not weight your hair down or make it &#x60;too soft&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft goo, which keeps your hair pretty soft, giving it a natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying make all of my personal products organic/all natural, and I&#x27;ve achieved some success but for some reason have struggled to find a hair product that works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural product.</li>
            <li>I get near to running out!  </li>
            <li>In fact, while it seems to condition the hair more, I&#x27;m not sure I would &#x60;recommend&#x27; doing that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a lot of extra hot iron touch up if I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>If you want to chance it yourself, go ahead but don&#x27;t be surprised when this product disappoints you!</li>
            <li>from the previous reviews i thought this product would be great for my thick, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally use a hot iron on wet hair and listen to it sizzle and fry.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft all day.</li>
            <li>Just soft but, in place</li>
            <li>Any style will remain soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I prefer the glossier shine this offers compared to some products with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>This first time I used it I put too much and ended up with a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>go figure after color, blow dry every day and hot iron</li>
            <li>I used this texturizer and heres the magic: I brushed down my hair in the front and poofed it in the back.</li>
            <li>I have a short pixie cut for 2 years now and have been trying new products to add texture to my cut.</li>
            <li>I am new to short hair.</li>
            <li>I put in my hair when it&#x27;s closer to dry, then it gives a better hold and a slick and textured look.  </li>
            <li>but it does last long depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li>My hair is short (natural:</li>
            <li>Have been in constant pursuit for an all natural (and organic) hair texturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky on my fingers, but my hair seems to drink it right up.</li>
            <li>The directions warn you to only use a little bit - and they are right.  </li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount will last an entire week, this little guy is absolutely worth the price.  </li>

            <li> It is a sticky unusual consistency.</li>
            <li> so I try not to use much.</li>
            <li> However, for whatever reason I dove in and really tried this thing.</li>
            <li> No broken fingers or goo.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really put this on your scalp.</li>
            <li> and it works really well for that.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Having said that a person doesn&#x27;t want to use too much at once to look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods hoping it would work.</li>
            <li> I needed to add so much my hair looked greasy or it wouldn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> But you really do need just the tiniest bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice smelling but heavy and a bit greasy</li>
            <li> It rinses off my hands using plain warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and many products are just absorbed into it and disappear</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do that for the normal body bars because it can leave the bar softer.</li>
            <li> A few of these reviews seem to think it&#x27;s like a styling gel when it&#x27;s more like a molding or defining paste</li>
            <li> I state, moisture, moisture and more moisture in the ingredientsit does not weight your hair down or make it &#x60;too soft&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft goo, which keeps your hair pretty soft, giving it a natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying make all of my personal products organic/all natural, and I&#x27;ve achieved some success but for some reason have struggled to find a hair product that works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural product.</li>
            <li> I get near to running out!  </li>
            <li> In fact, while it seems to condition the hair more, I&#x27;m not sure I would &#x60;recommend&#x27; doing that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a lot of extra hot iron touch up if I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> If you want to chance it yourself, go ahead but don&#x27;t be surprised when this product disappoints you!</li>
            <li> from the previous reviews i thought this product would be great for my thick, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally use a hot iron on wet hair and listen to it sizzle and fry.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft all day.</li>
            <li> Just soft but, in place</li>
            <li> Any style will remain soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I prefer the glossier shine this offers compared to some products with a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This first time I used it I put too much and ended up with a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> go figure after color, blow dry every day and hot iron</li>
            <li> I used this texturizer and heres the magic: I brushed down my hair in the front and poofed it in the back.</li>
            <li> I have a short pixie cut for 2 years now and have been trying new products to add texture to my cut.</li>
            <li> I am new to short hair.</li>
            <li> I put in my hair when it&#x27;s closer to dry, then it gives a better hold and a slick and textured look.  </li>
            <li> but it does last long depending on how much you use.</li>
            <li> My hair is short (natural:</li>
            <li> Have been in constant pursuit for an all natural (and organic) hair texturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky on my fingers, but my hair seems to drink it right up.</li>
            <li> The directions warn you to only use a little bit - and they are right.  </li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount will last an entire week, this little guy is absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> maybe 2.5in stretched, just below chin-length pressed) &amp; 100% natural no perms weaves or anything as the like.</li>
            <li> Only a tiny bit is required, so it will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> This jar will last me a long time</li>
            <li> Use a flat iron to flatten and curl the ends or give volume.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve had the same jar for at least 2 years, I use it all of the time, and the jar is still half full.</li>
            <li> You need a minimal amount to get the look/style necessary</li>
            <li> A can of pomade lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Does not hold for too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and stays sticky on your hair -- doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> What I do is dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My ends tend to be dry..</li>
            <li> Not the case, it was such a waste of money, it is in a tiny container and seems like just a whipped honey in a jar..</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with soft dark hair about 4-5 inches, and usually go with a combed back look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone, but if you like a loose hold that looks almost like you don&#x27;t have anything on your hair, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have that curly kinky black (as in black people) hair that holds water, heat and anything else you throw at it except for the natural oils from my scalp.</li>
            <li> I would say this small bottle will last me 8-10 months with almost daily use.</li>
            <li> The next morning I noticed my hair still felt a little sticky.</li>
            <li> so the little bottle last years!</li>
            <li> It does hold your hair in place and does not keep the wet look, but it leaves a sticky film in your hair and hand after use.</li>
            <li> It has a gritty tacky feel, but once it&#x27;s in his hair it doesn&#x27;t leave his hair stiff, but it holds all day.</li>
            <li> It might just be for a different hair type than mine, but if you&#x27;re looking for something like a stiff pomade this is not it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only use a little bit and it leaves your hair bouncy and shiny!</li>
            <li> It works well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is not thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I love John Masters&#x27; other products, but was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bottle IS small but its lasting forever.</li>
            <li> You can even let other people touch it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a really long way!</li>
            <li> There is NOT a purer product on this planet...or any other one that I can think of at the moment.</li>
            <li> So it is extremely concentrated.</li>
            <li> In terms of quantity, its small but a little goes a long way and I can style wet or dry, although slightly wet is a bit easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian with shoulder-length thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It took me about a week to figure out that I only need a very small amount of the Bourbon Vanilla &amp; Tangerine Hair Texturizer on my finger to use.</li>
            <li> i went through a half a jar in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I spray a little hair spray to hold my style in place after using the Bourbon Vanilla &amp; Tangerine Hair Texturizer.  </li>
            <li> I also tried just putting some in and just brushing my hair down all the way around, Presto!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I think in this case it &#x60;seals&#x27; the hair locking in moisture without leaving your hair greasy and heavy</li>
            <li> Wish it cost bit less for this small size.</li>
            <li> Putting plain jojoba oil in your hair will do just as well.</li>
            <li> A tiny amount works wonders smoothing frizz, adding very subtle shine, and nourishing my ends.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a good natural product that holds and this one, despite its seductive packing and aroma performs the worst of all :(</li>
            <li> Smells divine and small in potion</li>
            <li> but it do the job with a small.</li>
            <li> Not much more needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I use some sometimes if weather sucks.</li>
            <li> This is the longest I&#x27;ve stayed with a product as of late.  </li>
            <li> product is thick, sticky...really sticky</li>
            <li> Although I would have to guess this product is not good for those who require a very stiff hold like spiked hair or mohawks.</li>
            <li> I use this pommade on my hairline and ends, then work a very small amount through the rest.</li>
            <li> but it has a really weak hold</li>
            <li> Yep, its expensive but</li>
            <li> Now that sounds scary but they must have the amount</li>
            <li> ( sadly it doesn&#x27;t work for spiky styles.</li>
            <li> yep, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and used to use allot of hairspray to keep it from flying away.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the greasy gel look or the crispy hairspray look, so</li>
            <li> I really hated the sticky.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells like you could eat it!</li>
            <li> There are not that many organic hair care products on the market, so I was happy to find this one. It does hold your hair in place and does not keep the wet look, but it leaves a sticky film in your hair and hand after use. The next morning I noticed my hair still felt a little sticky. It does not seem to flake though, which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and this works better on it than any other texturizer that I have tried so far. Also, my curls really pull up and I get more fullness in my hair. Like it!</li>
            <li> I have a short pixie cut for 2 years now and have been trying new products to add texture to my cut. It took me about a week to figure out that I only need a very small amount of the Bourbon Vanilla &amp; Tangerine Hair Texturizer on my finger to use. I rub it between my 2 hands then scrunch it into my hair. Works nice shaping my style in place. Smells very nice. I spray a little hair spray to hold my style in place after using the Bourbon Vanilla &amp; Tangerine Hair Texturizer.  I like this much better then using products with wax. Washes out easy. This jar will last me a long time but I&#x27;ll come back for another jar when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but I prefer the shine on product also by John Masters. This one is more greasy and my fuzzies end up sticking up, the shine on smooths them down nicely.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it gives my hair a nice and soft shine, with consistent hold. I am a guy with soft dark hair about 4-5 inches, and usually go with a combed back look. Although I would have to guess this product is not good for those who require a very stiff hold like spiked hair or mohawks. The smell is pleasant, it has a citrus smell and does not make it seem like I am wearing perfume. In terms of quantity, its small but a little goes a long way and I can style wet or dry, although slightly wet is a bit easier to manage. I would say this small bottle will last me 8-10 months with almost daily use. My only problem is the case that holds the pomade is made of glass, and a drop from the sink counter to the floor will instantly shatter it.</li>
            <li> Reaaaally wished this stuff worked. Can&#x27;t find a good natural product that holds and this one, despite its seductive packing and aroma performs the worst of all :( It is very gooey and makes the hair stick together. Putting plain jojoba oil in your hair will do just as well.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing!!  It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side so use it sparingly, but it gives great texture.</li>
            <li> First of all I didn&#x27;t expect this item to be so small when I got it in the mail but it does last long depending on how much you use. I found this product to do what it needs to do by keeping your hair in one place but it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice feeling to your hair. More like a sticky feeling and I wouldn&#x27;t advise running your fingers through your hair. I definitely love the smell of it but I don&#x27;t use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have curly/wavy hair. It is not thick or thin. I use it over another product to finish it off. It is a sticky unusual consistency. I love the smell and takes out the frizz and keeps the curl.</li>
            <li> I had never used a product like this before so I had to figure out how to use it.  This first time I used it I put too much and ended up with a greasy mess.  I soon found out that less is more and now with the correct amount my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> It was like putting Vaseline in my hair. Product claims to style and hold spikes but all I ended up with was a floppy mess dripping with what looked like really delicious smelling cooking oil. I was lead to believe this was going to be a styling aid not the stuff you use to grease your baking dish. It was the most expensive vegetable shortening I ever bought. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have bought this product as it verified that the homemade pomade that I made was superior.  I make this stuff for about .50/oz.  Just google &amp;#34;Hommade Pomade&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It has all the John Masters signatures. Smells divine and small in potion but it do the job with a small. This is kind of oily so I try not to use much. But it has nice texture to it, and easy to apply. Wish it cost bit less for this small size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying make all of my personal products organic/all natural, and I&#x27;ve achieved some success but for some reason have struggled to find a hair product that works. I have a haircut that needs some amount of hold but I hate the greasy gel look or the crispy hairspray look, so I&#x27;ve been looking into waxes and pastes. I will say that this John Masters product seems to work best. The smell is pleasant -- tangerine -- but not overpowering.  The hold is pretty good, but it&#x27;s no hairspray â€“ it&#x27;s not even waxy. It&#x27;s a soft goo, which keeps your hair pretty soft, giving it a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a bit more hold, but this product is a solid option and seems high quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does what the Aveda Brilliant Anti-Humectant Pomade does, but with a more modern, less shiny look. As others have noted, it smells great, but it also leaves my hair feeling great. It washes out easily--I don&#x27;t have to shampoo twice. It achieves a hold by adding weight rather than with stickiness. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but if you like a loose hold that looks almost like you don&#x27;t have anything on your hair, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I tried it a while back and have been reordering it everytime I get near to running out!  You only use a little bit and it leaves your hair bouncy and shiny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and stays sticky on your hair -- doesn&#x27;t dry. If you want a wet look, it&#x27;s great but I wanted a volumizer. I love John Masters&#x27; other products, but was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million and one different hair products. I am new to short hair. My hair is cut just below my ears. Oh man, the cowlicks that I didn&#x27;t know I had and the curl that doesn&#x27;t go the way you want it to. Never knew before with just a pony tail! My hair is fine but a lot of it. What I do is dry my hair. Use a flat iron to flatten and curl the ends or give volume. It then looks pretty much like a mullet so I want definition. That is where the product comes in.&lt;br /&gt;So, all that said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is thick, sticky...really sticky like someone said, whipped honey. My first reaction was ACKY. I really hated the sticky. However, for whatever reason I dove in and really tried this thing. I got about a generous dime size dollop, I rubbed it between both hands and worked it in my hair, especially on the places you want to cooperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Like nothing else. My hair seemed, hmm, well, gooey in spots but I could take a curling iron to those places if I still needed to further define or give curl to an area. I wouldn&#x27;t normally use a hot iron on wet hair and listen to it sizzle and fry. It doesn&#x27;t do that. In fact, while it seems to condition the hair more, I&#x27;m not sure I would &#x60;recommend&#x27; doing that. But we do what we have to do with hair! I don&#x27;t do a lot of extra hot iron touch up if I don&#x27;t have to. The goal is to get out the door. I finger my hair or use a pick to put it in place. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End results:&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays right where I put it. I don&#x27;t need hair spray. The gooey is gone before I leave the bathroom. Every defined curl stays put. Again, no hairspray. I use some sometimes if weather sucks. My hair is so soft all day. If you want someone running fingers through your hair, no worries. No broken fingers or goo. Just soft but, in place hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine! Yes, the bottle IS small but its lasting forever. Yep, its expensive but so are the ingredients. AND those ingredients are second to none in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor seed oil - right there is your number one goo maker...however, also THE best hair moisturizer there is. I make a hair soap that leaves my hair in rocking condition and the top ingredient is CASTOR. I don&#x27;t do that for the normal body bars because it can leave the bar softer. Nice foam but softer. But for a hair shampoo, nothing conditions like castor, which also includes for skin. Because it is so sticky is isn&#x27;t used often. Overlook that in this product and you have a very good thing. My hair dresser said my hair really shines which means its in good condition. Well, believe me, I abuse it every why possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin- What I know about glycerin is it is a humectant for the hair, which means it attracts moisture and seals moisture in the hair. Now that sounds scary but they must have the amount just right because I don&#x27;t get the humidity frizz from this product at all. I think this just adds to the definition of curl or wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter- I think shea butter rocks. It is a great conditioner for hair, skin scalp but you don&#x27;t really put this on your scalp. Well you could, if you want more lift it would work. I think in this case it &#x60;seals&#x27; the hair locking in moisture without leaving your hair greasy and heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorbitol - another humectant (moisture attractor) and THE texturizing agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panthenol - vitamin B5... more shine. It will spread evenly over your hair and &#x60;enhances light reflection&#x27; so its glossy looking, gives hair the &#x60;slip&#x27; for defining, and yep, more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bourbon vanilla fruit oil, orange flower oil, tangerine peel oil, grapefruit peel oil - Oh my gosh yummy!! Smells so good to me and I&#x27;m very sure this adds to the shine of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbyl palmitate (vitamin C), ascorbic acid, phytic acid *Certified Organic by EcoCert / QAI - all good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*While I state, moisture, moisture and more moisture in the ingredientsit does not weight your hair down or make it &#x60;too soft&#x27; so it falls over. My ends tend to be dry.. go figure after color, blow dry every day and hot iron but with this the ends area great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 star from me! Just overlook the sticky at first and wash your hands after, your good!</li>
            <li> Not much more needs to be said. It works well and a little goes a long way. I have that curly kinky black (as in black people) hair that holds water, heat and anything else you throw at it except for the natural oils from my scalp. My hair is short (natural:maybe 2.5in stretched, just below chin-length pressed) &amp; 100% natural no perms weaves or anything as the like. If you stick it with a pic or pencil, it needs no help holding the object as inserted. It takes a while to comb and you definitely need a strong arm to do it some days. I used this texturizer and heres the magic: I brushed down my hair in the front and poofed it in the back. I was going for the afro and headband look w/o the headband. The style-specifically the brushdown- held all day. Never before in my life have I had this happen without my hair being pressed. I also tried just putting some in and just brushing my hair down all the way around, Presto! It stayed all day. Any style will remain soft and natural looking. You can even let other people touch it.  Despite the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a short pixie cut, and this is a great product to add texture to my hair. Only a tiny bit is required, so it will last a very long time! It smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> The product is great, it works well and smells amazing. It&#x27;s for definition, not hold. A few of these reviews seem to think it&#x27;s like a styling gel when it&#x27;s more like a molding or defining paste and it works really well for that. I have really thick hair and many products are just absorbed into it and disappear but this held without being too waxy. A little goes a really long way! I&#x27;ve have an allergic reaction to a lot of drugstore products but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However I would not order this product from this seller again bc while the product came wrapped and seemed packaged really well (bubble wrap inside a plastic wrapper in a padded package) the lid was cracked to the point that I can&#x27;t close the jar. I doubt it cracked while being shipped inside all that packaging so I&#x27;m guessing it was already cracked and they shipped it anyway, which is kind of a bummer.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible! My boyfriend uses it and he loves it. It has a gritty tacky feel, but once it&#x27;s in his hair it doesn&#x27;t leave his hair stiff, but it holds all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product! You need a minimal amount to get the look/style necessary so the little bottle last years! Not over greasy like pomade sometimes can be. Smells like warm tangerine. Love</li>
            <li> There is NOT a purer product on this planet...or any other one that I can think of at the moment. Yeah, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Great products, works better than anything I have tried. Recommend for anyone who wants a good hold without the weight.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I have very thin hair and used to use allot of hairspray to keep it from flying away.  This product is all I need now to place my hair and keep it looking great!</li>
            <li> Love this pomade. It&#x27;s a very natural product. It smells great. I prefer the glossier shine this offers compared to some products with a matte finish. Having said that a person doesn&#x27;t want to use too much at once to look greasy.  Overall -- super!</li>
            <li> Smells and works awesome.... but come on, soooo overpriced for a little jar,  should say &#x27;actual size&#x27; when looking at this item on your phone.... metric system misread strikes again!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods hoping it would work. It doesn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t even imagine how they can claim that it thickens anything. I have really fine hair and all it does is make my hair look greasy. I use a seriously tiny amount...barely visible on my fingers. It neither makes my hair look thicker nor holds any kind of shape at all. I guess I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a good natural thickener. It bums me out to throw it away but I guess I&#x27;m going to.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and works incredibly well!  As a &amp;#34;dime-sized&amp;#34; amount will last an entire week, this little guy is absolutely worth the price.  Will buy again, for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago but If you have straight hair it works fine and it leave a good and awesome smell and texture in your hair but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for spiky or messy styles  &#x3D;...( sadly it doesn&#x27;t work for spiky styles.</li>
            <li> Have been in constant pursuit for an all natural (and organic) hair texturizer.  Amazing!  No build up; can use every day and washes out well.  Exceptional smell.  Do not be discouraged by the 2 ounces.  No need for a heap to produce magnificent results.  Works exceedingly well on tightly coiled hair (e.g. afro-ish, happy to be nappy, wooly, etc.).  Go ahead.  Celebrate your hair by using this product. Your will surely thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice smelling but heavy and a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product. I&#x27;m caucasian with shoulder-length thick, coarse hair. My ends get very dry, and most products do nothing for this problem. I also have a ton of frizz at the hairline. I use this pommade on my hairline and ends, then work a very small amount through the rest. A tiny amount works wonders smoothing frizz, adding very subtle shine, and nourishing my ends. My hair seems to absorb this -- I don&#x27;t notice a build-up even when I used this daily and wash my hair every 3 days or so. And it smells fabulous -- a true, rich orange bourbon vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is unique in that it is not waxed based. The first 5 ingredients are castor seed oil, glycerin, shea butter, sorbitol (a humectant) and panthenol. It feels a little sticky on my fingers, but my hair seems to drink it right up. It rinses off my hands using plain warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the price -- yep, it&#x27;s expensive. However, I&#x27;ve had the same jar for at least 2 years, I use it all of the time, and the jar is still half full. So it is extremely concentrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man with short bleached hair.  This stuff didn&#x27;t hold well for me at all.  I needed to add so much my hair looked greasy or it wouldn&#x27;t do much.  It&#x27;s softer than most pomades and sorta looks liks like coagulated vaseline.  Since I had to use a fair bit, this small 2oz bottle went fast and at $20... that is pricey.  A can of pomade lasts a long time.  i went through a half a jar in 2 weeks.  It might just be for a different hair type than mine, but if you&#x27;re looking for something like a stiff pomade this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrific.  After purchasing I looked up \\&quot;Bourbon Vanilla \\&quot; trying to figure out what the Bourbon was.  Bourbon Vanilla is a type of vanilla though I wouldn&#x27;t say that the smell of this is too strongly vanilla.  I could imagine a man or woman appreciating.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this.  This is the longest I&#x27;ve stayed with a product as of late.  I put in my hair when it&#x27;s closer to dry, then it gives a better hold and a slick and textured look.  I added my own Rosemary into it, and I&#x27;ll reapply into dry hair if I need more hold and shine.  Like how it&#x27;s oil based.</li>
            <li> The directions warn you to only use a little bit - and they are right.  It&#x27;s easy to go overboard the first time or two that you use it - because it smells so wonderful!  But you really do need just the tiniest bit.  I think the jar I have will last the rest of my life. ;)</li>
            <li> Too greasy. Does not hold for too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make my hair look really good but it has a really weak hold so maybe I&#x27;m not using enough.</li>
            <li> from the previous reviews i thought this product would be great for my thick, curly, frizzy hair. Not the case, it was such a waste of money, it is in a tiny container and seems like just a whipped honey in a jar..that does absolutely nothing! If you want to chance it yourself, go ahead but don&#x27;t be surprised when this product disappoints you!</li>
