    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Disappears into your skin and moistens excellently.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind humoring him, and i haven&#x27;t had the best luck with moisturizers anyway, so</li>
            <li>It seems to have kept wrinkles at bay and is lightweight so it is perfect under makeup or by itself.</li>
            <li>This is the best day creme I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I also use the night cream and the two together are the perfect combo for me.</li>
            <li>I do believe this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Good price here!</li>
            <li>Great product to use</li>
            <li>Found it is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>and I liked the non greasy feel of it on my skin the best.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks great</li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>is great for living in fl.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great as it doesn&#x27;t have any odor and doesn&#x27;t leave any creasy spots.</li>
            <li>Great day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34;  had 2 sunscreens, was lightweight, and had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Good spf protection and has retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>Use this product every day and have found it is so good for my skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing, and I have to follow up with my go-to moisturizer</li>
            <li>so I guess it really isn&#x27;t fair for me to say yet</li>
            <li>I think it would be good on a baby&#x27;s exposed skin also.  </li>
            <li>(I use night cream too, drink lots of water, and eat healthy) and in the morning when rushed it is great to use this all in one.  </li>
            <li>I had nice skin to start with but pimple appeared after I used it for a week.</li>
            <li>After seeing so many good reviews for this cream, I bought it.  </li>
            <li>honestly, if it does manage to keep wrinkles at bay?</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li>This is the best reasonably priced over-the-counter wrinkle cream I have used.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about wrinkle control, but it sure feels great on my face, love the SPF 15, and love the product...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a nice perk, but i have tried so many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>and I have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This was able to restart the bleaching process.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and i love it.</li>
            <li>When this Anti-Wrinkle cream came out, I switched to it from the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Before testing, I took photos, then after a month, I took more photos.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s affordable makes me love it that much more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this off and on (mostly on) for 10 years</li>
            <li>if it works, but I can update my post at 39.5.  :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>SPF 15 is way better than nothing for every-day sunscreen on a woman&#x27;s face and this product feels like a light moisturizer without gooey sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>And the tube is easy to throw into a purse or carry-on,</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 items with the retinol ingredient and this one was the most economical</li>
            <li>My partner uses this for every day use, and it&#x27;s great especially in summer because it is SPF15.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and leaves your skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I WILL be back to buy more when the time comes!!  </li>
            <li>Love the way it feels going on as it is very smooth, not thick, and does not smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as you won&#x27;t need to use very much when applying...</li>
            <li>This was a classic, very popular formulation that many women, including me, relied on for our daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin easily so you can apply foundation right away.</li>
            <li>Do be aware though that the SPF15 can wear off very quickly if you exercise</li>
            <li>That would explain why all of the older reviews are more favorable.  </li>
            <li>Since I still had a full tube of my Neutrogena, I thought it would be fun to do a test.  </li>
            <li>This is a big difference from the night cream, which is light, smooth, and spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>It can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun even though it has sunscreen, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use this alone for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>and I think my skin looks pretty good with minimal wrinkles except for a laugh line.</li>
            <li>I saw improvement for the first month, then lightening stagnated.</li>
            <li>I currently use the Neutrogena product in the morning to take advantage of the greater sunscreen and the Ambi at night.</li>
            <li>No frills lotion giving EXACTLY what is proven to work: retinol.</li>
            <li>I regularly use Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night cream, and was looking for a comparable daytime moisturizer with retinol.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions on weening yourself onto this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was so positive after reviewing all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s great for some types of skin, but obviously not good for oily or even combo skin.</li>
            <li>After years of using L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect, which is now impossible to find in fragrance free, and a short term disaster using Avalon Vitamin C cream, which made my eyes burn all day, I think I have finally hit on a really nice totally fragrance free face cream.  </li>
            <li>It works better than other major brands on fine lines.</li>
            <li>Just a small dose for daily use keeps your skin looking young and perfect.</li>
            <li>and it does help you with those fine lines if used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I started using a pearl-sized dab on the tops of my hands daily as well and see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>If you need a good but fairly light daytime moisturizer you can hardly go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed that my pores had NO reduction.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The new formulation has 4 sunscreens in it and smells like sunscreen!</li>
            <li>PS Do not trust any review of this product that is older than 2015.</li>
            <li>this because it was highly recommended on a beauty</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We have used this particular product from Neutrogena and it work better than any of the more expensive cream that has the exact same percentage.  </li>
            <li>I used the Neutrogena once a day in the morning on the left side of my face, and the Olay kit (two items in the morning, one at night) on the right side of my face.  </li>
            <li>No difference in skin tone, condition or wrinkle appearance between the left and right sides of my face after a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I try something new</li>
            <li>The price was higher, but still much lower than any other trusted brand with Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a Neutrogena user, first their bar soaps back when I was a teen, then on to their line of moisturizers as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels soft, not stiff</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I often get mistaken by 10 - 15 years on age - to the young side.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but no issues with this one.  </li>
            <li>I remember when i started using it, after a few weeks my friends kept asking me why my skin looks so fantastic.</li>
            <li>(Olay complete sensitive with SPF 15).</li>
            <li>this one isn&#x27;t greasy, isn&#x27;t heavy, but isn&#x27;t too light either.</li>
            <li>As far as for wrinkles, I cant notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combo skin that is prone to breaking out and since using these moisturizers I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in the texture and clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this daily for a few years now, as most lotions gives me acme.</li>
            <li>how it sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>but I have been pretty clear recently since I got back on this.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, I consistently have people guess I&#x27;m in my mid 20s.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is an issue with the newer formulation of this cream, which came out this year.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 31 years old, and started using it in response to my husband&#x27;s sudden panicky realization that Someday We Will Be Old.</li>
            <li>back, I had a chance to test Olay&#x27;s Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol Kit.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and my skin&#x27;s appearance &amp; texture have improved immensely.  </li>

            <li> The first thing I noticed is that this cream has a sunscreen smell and a thick, greasy consistency.  </li>
            <li> As I have aged, sure I have wrinkles but they could be much worse!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know what the long term results will be.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and protected my skin from sun all summer long.  </li>
            <li> I wished I&#x27;d used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a Long time too, stretching out for months</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and will as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was proof enough for me that Neutrogena has the same results as the Olay system for much less money and hassle.</li>
            <li> They are gone after continued use and it didn&#x27;t take very long, as I purchased this product about a month ago....</li>
            <li> so I sometimes use it too when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday just short of a month</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t aged a bit since I started.</li>
            <li> One needs only a small amount and,almost immediately, skin looks smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> This cream also burns quite a bit after application, which must be from the sunscreen ingredients because I&#x27;ve never had an issue using Neutrogena&#x27;s other retinol products.  </li>
            <li> its hard to put my finger on what it does but after leaving it in overnight i just look younger</li>
            <li> While there&#x27;s considerably less retinol than in a prescription retinol cream, it&#x27;s also about a tenth of the price of what my dermatologist prescribed (which I never filled after pricing it).</li>
            <li> I have been using everyday for a month now.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years</li>
            <li> No strong fragrances.  </li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling just oily and gross...not to mention, I broke out worse than I have in over a year!</li>
            <li> so I usually prefer Neutrogena night cream, even during the day, but if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun</li>
            <li> it is hard to find at times  </li>
            <li> My face is no longer hard to look at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed at this company that I am not planning to buy anything with the name Neutrogena on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin and retards the effects of the age.</li>
            <li> Those awful saggy wrinkles around my mouth have faded away!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I order this on a regular basis. Great product to use and it does help you with those fine lines if used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non greasy.  Good spf protection and has retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because it was highly recommended on a beauty site.&lt;br /&gt;Love how it sinks right in.  No strong fragrances.  I have sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;but no problems with this!</li>
            <li> I would give this face cream five stars, but I just started using it last week so I don&#x27;t know what the long term results will be.  After years of using L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect, which is now impossible to find in fragrance free, and a short term disaster using Avalon Vitamin C cream, which made my eyes burn all day, I think I have finally hit on a really nice totally fragrance free face cream.  It comes in a tube, so there is no dipping the fingertips into the jar, which I always wondered about contamination-wise.  And the tube is easy to throw into a purse or carry-on, which heavier jars were not.  So far, so good.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. SPF 15 built in. Disappears into your skin and moistens excellently. Been using it for about 20 yrs. Dermatologist recommended it.  I often get mistaken by 10 - 15 years on age - to the young side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face daily for about 2 years and it&#x27;s left my face smoother and clearer, but the biggest difference is my hands.  I was beginning to look at my hands and see my mother&#x27;s wrinkled, age-spotted hands - yikes!  I started using a pearl-sized dab on the tops of my hands daily as well and see a huge difference.  While there&#x27;s considerably less retinol than in a prescription retinol cream, it&#x27;s also about a tenth of the price of what my dermatologist prescribed (which I never filled after pricing it).</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling just oily and gross...not to mention, I broke out worse than I have in over a year! I used it everyday just short of a month (you bet, I returned it!) and I thought maybe it was a fluke, but within a week of quitting usage my face cleared back up again. Maybe it&#x27;s great for some types of skin, but obviously not good for oily or even combo skin.</li>
            <li> Use this product every day and have found it is so good for my skin I put this on before my makeup and wear it every day because of the sun here in FL. I go out in the boat and have never had a issue with it Found it is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 10 years. Although I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, I consistently have people guess I&#x27;m in my mid 20s. My skin loves it and I have a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and protected my skin from sun all summer long.  I would use a different sunscreen that is waterproof for swimming in the pool.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 items with the retinol ingredient and this one was the most economical and I liked the non greasy feel of it on my skin the best.  Your skin feels soft, not stiff and I do think my complexion overall has improved after using it for 30 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to lighted age spots on the back of my hands and forehead. This product contains 6% Octinoxate to obtain SPF 15 and 1% Enzulzole for bleaching. I saw improvement for the first month, then lightening stagnated. Johnson and Johnson Ambi uses 2% Octinoxate for sunscreen and 2% Hydroquinone for bleaching. This was able to restart the bleaching process.  I currently use the Neutrogena product in the morning to take advantage of the greater sunscreen and the Ambi at night. Bleaching continues after three months. Exposure to sun will reverse the bleaching and should be avoided.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is affordable, moisture, sun prevention and wrinkle cream all in one.  My skin looks great (I use night cream too, drink lots of water, and eat healthy) and in the morning when rushed it is great to use this all in one.  I have sensitive skin but no issues with this one.  When mine ran out I purchased again.</li>
            <li> I have been using everyday for a month now.I was so positive after reviewing all the positive reviews. May help reduce blemishes, but I still had some. Saw no wrinkle reduction. And irritated eye wrinkles, a burning sensation. I&#x27;m only 41 so I thought it would plump up the wrinkles. I would not buy this again. And I would not recommend this to anyone. I was really bummed that my pores had NO reduction.</li>
            <li> My partner uses this for every day use, and it&#x27;s great especially in summer because it is SPF15. Do be aware though that the SPF15 can wear off very quickly if you exercise and it&#x27;s not always a replacement for sun block!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works great and it&#x27;s great on sensitive skin so I sometimes use it too when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> its hard to put my finger on what it does but after leaving it in overnight i just look younger</li>
            <li> This cream is my only day cream. One needs only a small amount and,almost immediately, skin looks smoother and healthier. I love it.</li>
            <li> I had nice skin to start with but pimple appeared after I used it for a week. Maybe not for me. Will stop.</li>
            <li> When I am going to be in the sun, this is the one I use.  Sunscreen clogs my pores so I usually prefer Neutrogena night cream, even during the day, but if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun I use this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about wrinkle control, but it sure feels great on my face, love the SPF 15, and love the product...</li>
            <li> If you need a good but fairly light daytime moisturizer you can hardly go wrong with this one. If you spend a lot of time in the sun, you may want to supplement it with Neutrogena&#x27;s facial sunblock however.</li>
            <li> No frills lotion giving EXACTLY what is proven to work: retinol. Just a small dose for daily use keeps your skin looking young and perfect. I remember when i started using it, after a few weeks my friends kept asking me why my skin looks so fantastic. This is why!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  keeps my skin moisturizer and SPF 15 is great for living in fl.  Good price here!</li>
            <li> I regularly use Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night cream, and was looking for a comparable daytime moisturizer with retinol.  After seeing so many good reviews for this cream, I bought it.  Honestly I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, and was hoping for something better.  The first thing I noticed is that this cream has a sunscreen smell and a thick, greasy consistency.  This is a big difference from the night cream, which is light, smooth, and spreads easily.  Apparently this is an issue with the newer formulation of this cream, which came out this year.  That would explain why all of the older reviews are more favorable.  This cream also burns quite a bit after application, which must be from the sunscreen ingredients because I&#x27;ve never had an issue using Neutrogena&#x27;s other retinol products.  It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing, and I have to follow up with my go-to moisturizer (Olay complete sensitive with SPF 15).</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t speak to its ability with wrinkles. i&#x27;m 31 years old, and started using it in response to my husband&#x27;s sudden panicky realization that Someday We Will Be Old. i don&#x27;t mind humoring him, and i haven&#x27;t had the best luck with moisturizers anyway, so i figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and i love it. it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, no matter the season or weather. this is a big deal for me. honestly, if it does manage to keep wrinkles at bay? that&#x27;s a nice perk, but i have tried so many moisturizers. this one isn&#x27;t greasy, isn&#x27;t heavy, but isn&#x27;t too light either. and above all: it doesn&#x27;t piss off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It seems to have kept wrinkles at bay and is lightweight so it is perfect under makeup or by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Neutrogena user, first their bar soaps back when I was a teen, then on to their line of moisturizers as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  When this Anti-Wrinkle cream came out, I switched to it from the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion.  The price was higher, but still much lower than any other trusted brand with Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awhile back, I had a chance to test Olay&#x27;s Professional Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol Kit. Since I still had a full tube of my Neutrogena, I thought it would be fun to do a test.  I used the Neutrogena once a day in the morning on the left side of my face, and the Olay kit (two items in the morning, one at night) on the right side of my face.  Before testing, I took photos, then after a month, I took more photos. No difference in skin tone, condition or wrinkle appearance between the left and right sides of my face after a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was proof enough for me that Neutrogena has the same results as the Olay system for much less money and hassle.</li>
            <li> This is the best day creme I&#x27;ve used.  My skin is so soft and my skin&#x27;s appearance &amp; texture have improved immensely.  The fact that it&#x27;s affordable makes me love it that much more.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. This is the second time I have purchased it here and I will continue to buy it here going forward.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try something new but I always come back to this moisturizer. I can always rely on it. Love the way it feels going on as it is very smooth, not thick, and does not smell like sunscreen. Make sure to follow the instructions on weening yourself onto this daily moisturizer. With any anti-aging cream, the anti-aging chemical can cause an initial reaction you can avoid if you build up to what you need to use. It can also make your skin more sensitive to the sun even though it has sunscreen, so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use this alone for a day at the beach. I have combination skin and sometimes have breakouts but I have been pretty clear recently since I got back on this. I have been using this off and on (mostly on) for 10 years and I think my skin looks pretty good with minimal wrinkles except for a laugh line. I am 29.5 so I guess it really isn&#x27;t fair for me to say yet if it works, but I can update my post at 39.5.  :)</li>
            <li> I use this daily and nightly. It was recommended to me by a skin specialist. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I do believe this is a very good product.  As I have aged, sure I have wrinkles but they could be much worse!</li>
            <li> We have used this particular product from Neutrogena and it work better than any of the more expensive cream that has the exact same percentage.  Men and Women should use from 40 on up.&lt;br /&gt;This is great as it doesn&#x27;t have any odor and doesn&#x27;t leave any creasy spots.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for a few years now, as most lotions gives me acme. My face dries out after I wash or shower. As far as for wrinkles, I cant notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Great day time moisturizer. I also use the night cream and the two together are the perfect combo for me. I have sensitive, combo skin that is prone to breaking out and since using these moisturizers I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in the texture and clarity of my skin. Don&#x27;t foresee changing up the routine any time in the future, ever!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena ruined this product. This was a classic, very popular formulation that many women, including me, relied on for our daily face moisturizer. The &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34;  had 2 sunscreens, was lightweight, and had a pleasant smell. I wore it every day under my foundation. The new formulation has 4 sunscreens in it and smells like sunscreen! The company did not put &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34;, or anything else on the package to indicate that they had changed the product. I am so annoyed at this company that I am not planning to buy anything with the name Neutrogena on it. PS Do not trust any review of this product that is older than 2015. The ingredients of this product were recently changed.</li>
            <li> My daughter (30s) wanted something to start fighting wrinkles. I recommended this because I have used it, and I like it. Also, it is within her budget. It absorbs into your skin easily so you can apply foundation right away. I like that.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years and I haven&#x27;t aged a bit since I started. &amp;#34;It seems like I found the fountain of youth&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s what some of my friends are telling me. It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile  it is hard to find at times  thank you</li>
            <li> My face is no longer hard to look at.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> This is the best reasonably priced over-the-counter wrinkle cream I have used.  It works better than other major brands on fine lines. I used to use this, then tried several others.  Will continue to use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I wished I&#x27;d used this product for a long time.  SPF 15 is way better than nothing for every-day sunscreen on a woman&#x27;s face and this product feels like a light moisturizer without gooey sunscreen.  I think it would be good on a baby&#x27;s exposed skin also.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!! I have Found a anti-wrinkle cream that WORKS!!! OH YES!!! It&#x27;s Unbelievable!!! Those awful saggy wrinkles around my mouth have faded away!! They are gone after continued use and it didn&#x27;t take very long, as I purchased this product about a month ago.... THANK YOU Thank You Thank You Neutrogena!!! It lasts a Long time too, stretching out for months I&#x27;m sure as you won&#x27;t need to use very much when applying... I WILL be back to buy more when the time comes!!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have used it forever.  Get compliments on skin at age 70.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and will as long as they make it.  Not greasy and leaves your skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff. I use about a pea size every morning&lt;br /&gt; Skin feels and looks younger.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recomend for all women over 40. It hydrates my skin and retards the effects of the age.</li>
