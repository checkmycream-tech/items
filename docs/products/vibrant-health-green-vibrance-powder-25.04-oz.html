            <li>The taste is not that great, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that tastes good this may not be it.  </li>
            <li>HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY :)</li>
            <li>HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY :)</li>

            <li>seems to have the best mix of everything healthy on this planet in it and is part of my smoothies whenever I make them.</li>
            <li>Amazon does have the BEST prices and if it is purchased in the bulk size,you get a better deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that would make it a more perfect drink, I think.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff though for all of the WONDERFUL ingredients and for good health...</li>
            <li>This blend is great, and I really love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you for your quick shipment and excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Tastes best with apple juice or another sweet juice...  TRY IT :P</li>
            <li>It keeps my tummy happy, my skin amazing</li>
            <li>Many of the ingredients are organic and while the flavor on its own is not the best, if you mix it with flavored beverages or smoothies it is undistinquishable.  </li>
            <li>The benefits Ive already experienced from this product are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I feel a boost of energy, but I feel good.</li>
            <li>This 60 day supply is a good deal here</li>
            <li>TO SEE IF GOOD FOR MY BODY, IT TESTS</li>
            <li>Good supplement.</li>
            <li>Brought this product based on the good review.</li>

            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>But good god, this tastes like vomit.</li>
            <li>I assume this is from the fiber, and detox effects of having so much good stuff in your body.</li>
            <li>Does not taste good, but that&#x27;s not why you take your greens,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t eat animal products and I&#x27;m in really good health.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>I feel good taking it.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good for me...</li>
            <li>The taste is not so good</li>
            <li>good price here too.</li>
            <li>The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1.</li>
            <li>It helps your skin and hair, your joints and it also makes you feel good inside.  </li>
            <li>Im good to go.  </li>
            <li>but the thought of all the good</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to others and feel it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Tastes good.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s good for the body.  </li>
            <li>and some people even said it tastes good...</li>
            <li>I still take fish oil, CoQ10, and vitamin D along with a good diet</li>
            <li>health wise.</li>
            <li>We feels good</li>
            <li>Took me over 2 weeks to start to feel good again.</li>

            <li>and it is LOADED with all kinds of good stuff:  probiotics, vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, digestive support, antioxidants, etc.  </li>
            <li>The superfood also makes me feed good and &amp;</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li>I have been taking this product for years with good results until I read</li>
            <li>Good health to everyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep it in the freezer for optimum freshness.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers get around the \\&quot;what&#x27;s hot\\&quot; thing by throwing in the kitchen sink -- every herb that sounds good goes in the pot.    </li>
            <li>I know it is doing something good for me</li>
            <li>good price</li>

            <li>Good family size and good for improving bowel function.</li>
            <li>It tastes good (to me).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and you should try it.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would have something that would define what every ingredient is good for.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product , its a great product , after searching the internet  found that Amazon had the best price ,so I&#x27;ve been ordering from themon a regular basis  ....</li>
            <li>If u dont get a good amount of greens &amp; or probotics in your diet</li>
            <li>you might find the taste not as good as others.  </li>

            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>The Doctor said to keep drinking it if I am feeling good on it.</li>
            <li>but I must say, the product makes me feel good.  </li>
            <li>Either use a blender or you can buy a nutribullet at Costco for 75 bucks and it will make it all good.</li>
            <li>good product packed with vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m expecting good news.</li>

            <li>I am a very healthy person as it is.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in it seem very healthy, kinda like those vegetables I haven&#x27;t got around to eating.</li>
            <li>Many of these greens powders manufacturers wanted me to be happy with listing \\&quot;xxxx grams of a proprietary greens mixture\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Many of these greens powders manufacturers wanted me to be happy with listing \\&quot;xxxx grams of a proprietary greens mixture\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li>I am a person who leads a very healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I will warn you, you will get a lot of attention from people at work asking why you&#x27;re drinking what they call \\&quot;pond water\\&quot; which leads to a great conversation on the healthy benefits of greens.</li>

            <li>You can make up your own mind.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good and the health benefits are outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love gteen vibrance, feel like Im doing somthing good for myseld every time I use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, use at your own risk...</li>
            <li>I like to take matters in my own hand and take charge of the situation.</li>
            <li>its really dissolved - room temperature water works best for me.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve already convinced a couple co-workers who have ordered their own, and now I am taking it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>While they appear to be doing good work, a healthy skepticism is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps me healthy and feeling good.</li>
            <li>In terms of nutrition, this company has really put their heart and soul into creating a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>I am 57 and truly feel as good or better</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of product you take just once.  </li>
            <li>But even if I had to drink it on its own, I would just for the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was doing over 60 push-ups for warm ups at 160 lbs.</li>
            <li>It has everything you need to maintain good health, along with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company but they refuted the claim and wrote me a lengthy letter explaining the science of their own testing and pointing the finger at consumerlab .</li>
            <li>You need to take charge of your own health.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at work and it gives me a nice boost of energy before my morning</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t acute in toxicity.</li>
            <li>coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Blended all up with any kind of juice I have</li>
            <li>Therefore, I seldom take medications of any kind</li>
            <li>know there are some people who will knock this product because of the taste, but to be honest-</li>
            <li>But who cares when you can get so many good things into your body?</li>
            <li>What kind of price can you put on your health?&lt;br /</li>
            <li>For those of you concerned about it, go to this site and read for yourself, do your own research.  </li>
            <li>Use your own judgement after reading this.</li>
            <li>The taste kind of reminds me of the smell of a farm</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Cheap is cheap - pay for the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was VERY leery about trying this product, BUT, to my surprise, it is the best tasting drink on the market.</li>
            <li>I mix it in O.J. &amp; it kind of grows on you after awhile.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product...feel vibrant and healthy!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of powdered and chewable supplements over the years and Vibrant Health products are, in my opinion, the best.</li>
            <li>The taste is more mild on this product than Perfect food, so people who are more picky about taste would like this.</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, the best in its class-by my limited research.</li>
            <li>I add it to some warm water with a few drops of lemon juice each morning, and it&#x27;s delicious and wakes me up and makes me feel good!</li>
            <li>Happy so far and great price</li>
            <li>It really works, makes me feel good and a great way to get your &amp;#34;greens.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>I was especially impressed that Vibrant Health even tells me how many billions of each pro-biotic strain are included in each serving (I keep getting a picture of some scientist looking through a microscope and counting each one, Ha ha</li>

            <li>Its ingredients are the most well-rounded, it tastes fairly decent (for greens) and the price on Amazon is hands-down the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m getting more vitamins and minerals that my body needs.</li>
            <li>I find it amusing that most \\&quot;alternative practitioners\\</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product we have used this for many years now.  </li>
            <li>After reading the many concerns of arsenic I decided to do some research of my own.</li>

            <li>Most of the health books I have read support this concept.</li>
            <li>, I buy this one for the probiotics which I need more than anything.</li>
            <li>The taste is ok compared to others.  </li>
            <li>&quot; bemoan the fact that most MD&#x27;s are pharmaceutical pushers who are lapdogs for the drug companies while the \\&quot;practitioners\\&quot; preaching this are trying to sell something (to line their pockets)...</li>

            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like I just grazed in the hay field. :)</li>

            <li>I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love that there&#x27;s a built in probiotic.</li>
            <li>The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, just my taste buds have gotten more used to it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>Joint pains are better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for what it has done to improve my digestive system</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and my husband would not juice despite the fact that it made him feel better</li>
            <li>But when bought in this larger size, it is the best deal for the quality.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and tell all my friends and family about it.</li>

            <li>Then chase it with more water.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking that a blender might make it more homogeneous when blended with fruit and/or veggies.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I listened to him.  </li>
            <li>what I love is the company replies because they keep improving and refining.  </li>
            <li>The benefits outweigh the taste though :)</li>
            <li>I wake up feeling energetic and alert</li>
            <li>And if you dig deeper, with more searches, you&#x27;ll find much more.</li>
            <li>It helps me feel better</li>
            <li>I just love it and look forward to it every morning.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Tried mixing in vegetable juice, its was just too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I feel better and know I&#x27;m healthier after taking this.  </li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I gave up vegetarianism and have had to boil most veggies to mush just to get them in me without health issues.  </li>
            <li>makes me feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I am like so many others who are making attempts at eating healthier.</li>
            <li>I was able do things I never could do before.)....</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is day two for me.  </li>
            <li>It says on the container to mix with your favorite drink.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine this tasting ok in &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; - mind</li>
            <li>Today I thought I would adventurous.  </li>
            <li>I feel better and plan to continue using the product.</li>
            <li>First the delivery speed was amazing from this seller!</li>
            <li>but I do feel more energized.</li>
            <li>The particles of this mix tend to stay suspended more</li>
            <li>so I just tend to get more of the mix</li>
            <li>I also think my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I feel more energized and healthier.</li>
            <li>so I can feel confident they are getting healthy greens into their diet.</li>
            <li>: Ok, so there is a lot of name-calling over this incident and the ConsumerLab finding this has elevated arsenic levels.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot more nutrients 120 compared to the 73 in this product plus it has Moringa and 23g of protein in it.  </li>
            <li>I really love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Still, because of the buzz, anything with herbs is considered by most people to be better than anything without herbs.</li>
            <li>My Dr. said I needed more greens in my diet.</li>
            <li>And this is how i get them tho be heart healthy.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a lot more energy in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I just love knowing this is a part of my diet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The price is much more feasible for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, make sure that you can take this if you are on meds.</li>
            <li>In the store the item costs almost $30 more.</li>
            <li>We love that it is organic</li>
            <li>and we can be sure we are not getting more chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 months, I was and still am pain free!  </li>
            <li>There have been many who have stated that they can feel it working within minutes.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>My stomach has been feeling better since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say my wrinkles disappeared, or that I have the energy of my twenty&#x27;s, but nutrition isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li>IT SAYS &amp; MORE</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what healthy is supposed to taste like :)</li>
            <li>my nails and it just makes me feel better ALL day.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare this to, but my roommate and I both use this powder and love it.</li>
            <li>This product gives me more energy and seems to help keep me \\&quot;regular\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li>The price for this item is around $90 in most health food stores so buying it on Amazon is the way to go.</li>
            <li>And to top it all off this</li>
            <li>the taste is okay.</li>
            <li>Until they can prove their product is safe I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li>Listen to your doctor but do not rely on a magic pill to do all the work for you.  </li>
            <li>You must change your diet and make healthy choices in order for this product to work more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>and it makes me want to eat healthier and get the appropriate water intake in each day.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I tried Athletic Greens because of Tim Ferris&#x27; book, &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li>lends me trust them more than others.</li>
            <li>Take it with your favorite juice, a lil lime-aid with water and a scoop or two will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many doctors and been in so many emergency rooms...</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>In seawater, there are 2 to 5 ppb, which accounts for the fact that many seafoods have more arsenic than the FDA limits (2.6 ppm) allow: mollusks, crustacea – prawns and shrimp – fish, fish roe, cod liver oil, herring, even freshwater fish, and most sea animals and plants.</li>
            <li>A Ladyfriend of mine talked me into trying this,and I am glad i did.</li>

            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>FOR A MUCH MORE inexpensive  PRICE THAN</li>

            <li>SILICA is just a type of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; and is mostly used to give weight to the product being sold.</li>
            <li>If you can find another product that is better than buy it.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with this product as soon as I was introduced to it.</li>
            <li>It tastes better than VG</li>
            <li>as well (more earthy than swampy).</li>
            <li>On the instructions is recommends adding to your favorite beverage.</li>
            <li>I have even stopped drinking more then one cup of joe, and I even forget until the afternoon sometimes.</li>
            <li>better than coffee</li>
            <li>And the price is better than anything out there.</li>
            <li>I would give it more stars except for the flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re not going to find a more well-rounded, nutritious vitamin or supplement out there.  </li>
            <li>my many stomach woes continued.  </li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I received the latest version, 13.0.</li>
            <li>I mix it all in a glass (milk, protein powder, and G.V), but if you have a blender or a shaker, that would probably work even better.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, literally changed my health.  </li>
            <li>and I feel much better.  </li>
            <li>It really is just a great product.  </li>
            <li>Maximum Vibrance is even better</li>
            <li>I am sure it is doing more for me that I ever will know.</li>
            <li>With this I feel better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>On Sept 24th after a biopsy was taken I found out that I am cancer free!</li>
            <li>Get creative and share the word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I know it has many probiotics, as does all ferminted foods.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I believed them.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but my body eventually grew a tolerance to most</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taste is ok in juice or fruit drink.</li>
            <li>It is best mixed with your favorite juice or sports drink.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll pay way more in the stores too, so ordering here is a must.</li>
            <li>Love the subscribe and save option for this.</li>
            <li>I do not have to take stool softener any more.</li>
            <li>and as I continued taking it I felt better than I have ever felt.</li>
            <li>i put this in a smoothie everyday and it adds a level of energy and feeling good that is priceless.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I feel more energetic all day when I have it as my breakfast.</li>
            <li>We just love this supplement....</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than any I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>much better deals on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I have gained so much more energy.  </li>
            <li>Not for sure but feel like I&#x27;m getting the nutrition needs out of this product.</li>
            <li>and i feel more energetic.  </li>
            <li>snack on roasted seaweed all the time and love it</li>
            <li>If it did, I was prepared to try the many recipes others were suggesting below.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>but even if you think it is, it&#x27;s better than being in the hospital</li>
            <li>if you can stand the taste, you will benefit in so many ways.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel a lot better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Much better with almond milk.</li>
            <li>so I looked for it online and found it on amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Here is how I use it to make a healthy smoothie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I do,,,,,:)</li>
            <li>It has a lot of ingredients, and my PH levels are better since using this.</li>
            <li>I stay healthy and this product may or may not be a factor.</li>
            <li>The tartness makes it more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>Then, you have the many, many vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>I use Cranberry / Pomegranate and it makes it much better.</li>
            <li>I love what&#x27;s inside</li>
            <li>The $$ is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I most often take it this way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t take it every day any more, but I went through 2 containers of it</li>
            <li>I like the idea of getting more greens in my diet--</li>
            <li>so I exposed myself to my girlfriend in more than a couple ways (use your imagination).</li>
            <li>and I feel healthy because I&#x27;m having my greens.</li>
            <li>can tell you that it&#x27;s more drinkable than Athletic Greens.  </li>
            <li>feel better as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I feel much better</li>
            <li>And want to say this is best health product I have taken since way back.  </li>
            <li>I was lethargic, but only after about 3 days of taking this product it is awesome on the energy I have.</li>
            <li>I feel better than I than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>the taste is better and looks more greener.</li>
            <li>It seems to mix much better as well.</li>
            <li>Be sure you check before ordering though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more alert and digestion</li>
            <li>I do feel more energy and awake.</li>
            <li>Im sure they make a lot of profit on this product.</li>
            <li>I believe that this has helped us all stay healthy through the flu season and is also helping to regulate my weight.</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>This product might be healthy but what a taste?!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>would expect some better quality/taste for this price!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>This should not be more than $20...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been getting the most explosive diarrhea I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had M.S. for yrs &amp; feel poorly more than I feel well.</li>
            <li>Within 1-2 days I noticed more energy and have been feeling better since.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to the taste, but honestly it magically became more of just a neutral taste</li>
            <li>and I feel more engeritic throughout the day drinking it.</li>
            <li>best mixed in Silk Mango and Strawberry or Banana fruit drink that you can buy from Wal-Mart and have even started putting it in my coffee when I run out of that product!  </li>
            <li>, i feel so much better since i have been taking it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if container damaged before or during shipping, but product itself sealed &amp; ok, no air exposure or spillage.</li>
            <li>but I hope their subscription is not misleading people to think that we are buying through Amazon for better price</li>
            <li>feel better when I use it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend into smoothies, and easy to drink...not like some greens.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was safe for pregnant women, but it probably would&#x27;ve help with the lack of energy I experienced.</li>
            <li>I try in many ways to be very healthy and this is such a great additional to my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a clean, non-stimulating kind of energy, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>My wife particularly likes to mix it with coconut milk or almond milk, both are great.  </li>
            <li>nice energy and clean feel.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that Vibrant Health has put out.</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>All around great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>they will never experience the amazing benefits of this product, because it wasn&#x27;t all sweet and yummy like a fruit smoothie.</li>
            <li>their levels would probably be higher than anyone could imagine, yet they achieved supremely good health.</li>
            <li>but it tastes pretty good...</li>
            <li>This is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good when it comes to food</li>
            <li>but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>In an ideal world, we would all grow, or buy, all our own food locally in tested, organically rich soil.</li>
            <li>I have a strong healthy immune system.</li>
            <li>It mixes easily and is a bit of love in a glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(can cope with work more easily, sleep</li>
            <li>Motions are better and most importantly my body has started craving fruits &amp; veggies.</li>
            <li>Important to me is fresh and no fillers, good balance.  </li>
            <li>luck, it&#x27;s worth a try and many great organic whole food ingredients!</li>
            <li>Ok, fine....</li>
            <li>Yes, this costs a bit more, but not so much more that it doesn&#x27;t make it totally worth it, in quality and taste!</li>
            <li>good ole protein and smart eating.</li>
            <li>This plus Amazing Grass Wheatgrass is a powerful punch to get the day started.</li>
            <li>I am a college football player with no time, a huge appetite and a love for school and lifting weights.</li>
            <li>And I do love the free shipping.</li>
            <li>It left my delicious green smoothie not so delicious.</li>
            <li>So far seems like a great product.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely incredible and is, essentially, a pharmaceutical grade phyto-nutrient/herbal/vitamin/mineral supplement that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Mostly organic and full ingredient disclosure makes it even better.</li>
            <li>While I tend to be Vegan, I still feel much more comfortable with going with something to supplement my morning nutritional start.</li>
            <li>, this is the ideal way to get your daily dose.  </li>
            <li>Health is more important than taste in my life.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it with my Body and Brain Fitness clients as part of a rejuvenation drink we have developed.</li>
            <li>try it, its awesome, by the way this is the first review I have ever took the time to complete...</li>
            <li>Way too many minerals in there for me to handle comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Really helps digestion and works as a good snack substitution.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t eat as much vegetables as I should, so this is a good supplement for me.  </li>

            <li>I feel really good taking this natural and organic supplement and am very happy to get extra probiotics into my gut.</li>
            <li>I loved version 10.3 but this 12.0 seems much nicer.</li>
            <li>Thanks be to God!!! :)</li>
            <li>Plus, honestly it&#x27;s a lot of work to purchase tons of vegetables, clean and store them, clean the juicer afterwards and so on...</li>

            <li>I found I wasn&#x27;t using others I&#x27;ve bought because the taste was too strong.</li>
            <li>It does not taste good, particularly if you let it sit.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still going strong.  </li>
            <li>On the flipside, if you are taking antibiotics (and are not neutropenic) then I would highly recommend taking this because it is a good way to protect colon health and prevent Clostridium Difficile (\\&quot;C diff.\\&quot;) colitis.  </li>
            <li>Flavor wise, this is pretty mild.</li>

            <li>This product is fantastic, I purchase it regularly and am completely satisfied with the results I receive each and every time that I order this great stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous others (the 2nd best for me was Boku Super-food) that were good as well.</li>

            <li>I truely feel so much better.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it isn&#x27;t very tasty!</li>
            <li>We worked our way up to a full scoop and now we&#x27;re enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>After the first purchase, I liked it</li>
            <li>How many times have you read an article about the health benefits of a particular vegetable, herb, root, like say, astragalus and thought thats nice</li>
            <li>I could immediately tell that this product gives me more energy and more vibrant health!!  </li>
            <li>It certainly has more nutritious value than the one I had been using , however the taste is aweful !</li>
            <li>I need a lot of iron so that is fine with me, but the \\&quot;version\\&quot; I got also has 1000 IU of vitamin D per serving.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fine that way.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fine that way.  </li>

            <li>I mix it with juices and it tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>i recommended to are fine, and by the way all of our jars do NOT have the label saying something about child birth defects or cancer known to the state of california</li>
            <li>i believe, basically you should be fine and this is one HELL of an elixir.</li>
            <li>Looks like pond water but tastes just fine.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks much better, I have a lot of more energy, and my colon thanks me every day!</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m staying super healthy this way.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with orange juice and drink it quickly!</li>
            <li>and I did start to feel better quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to ruin a good glass of juice by mixing in this stuff, so I just mix a scoop in about 1/3 cup of water and glug it down, followed by a glass of good water.</li>
            <li>I WILL SAY RIGHT NOW THAT THE TEXTURE AND TASTE OF THE POWDER IS PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the best deal on this product by far!</li>
            <li>The taste is fine - didn&#x27;t expect it to taste &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; since it is free of additives like sugar.</li>
            <li>The taste gets better after the first couple of days!</li>
            <li>Mix it up, makes 2 large morning smoothies and really tastes great.</li>
            <li>This is a huge difference.   </li>
            <li>The Amazon price is a huge savings vs the on-line or health food store</li>
            <li>It makes a HUGE difference in my day.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to feel a HUGE boost of energy</li>
            <li>Give you an A+ rating in the way you accurately depicted and advertised this product.  </li>
            <li>ALL INGREDIENTS ARE LISTED, THATS IMPORTANT FOR ME.</li>
            <li>I came across this product here on Amazon and it had such great reviews</li>
            <li>i got accustomed to it and actually enjoy the taste now.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I came across Green Viberance and, impressed by the glowing reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>but without precise measurements of each).  </li>
            <li>You have to pay for the detailed report, which I also read.</li>
            <li>:) I think it&#x27;s worth the money knowing I&#x27;m putting something in my body</li>
            <li>After trying a couple of servings of a greens powder I picked up at on a whim and having great results I decided to make a greens supplement a regular part of my diet.  </li>
            <li>I definitely feel great after my morning \\&quot;Vibrance\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>My husband makes fun of me though, and he has no problem with it, so I guess everyone wouldn&#x27;t agree with me on that one:)</li>
            <li>I always search for the most economical places to buy supplements because we use a  lot of them</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know,</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is excellent for detoxfying your system.</li>
            <li>One of the best green foods I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly the best Green Powder I&#x27;ve found to date.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the icing on the cake, not the cake, so make sure to get your fresh veggies.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has aton of great ingredients.</li>
            <li>Go on get some, its the best of the green supplements I could find.</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t exactly taste great but when mixed in with a smoothie it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Great supplement to boost your overall health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had such great health benfits:</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I actually think it taste great now.  </li>
            <li>and I tried everything for my acne), and my hair and nails are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and it works just as great for me and has the same affects on helping to keep my blood pressure lowered.</li>
            <li>I encourage others to read the company&#x27;s detailed response</li>
            <li>But Green Vibrance just makes me feel great!     </li>
            <li>Why is this important, you ask?...</li>
            <li>it’s primarily organic form.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my digestion going smooth</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product I was just thrown off with the difference in appearance.</li>
            <li>my face was smooth as a babies</li>
            <li>(I actually enjoy drinking this every morning now.)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t buy this stuff to enjoy sipping it.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance also produces a delicious meal-replacement bar</li>
            <li>Especially after reading a lot of great reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I have been on a light dose of a drug called Plaquenil for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li>I use scent free soap, pee after sex, take a cranberry supplement, eat tons of yogurt, drink tons of water, the doctor has even prescribed a prophylactic antibiotic to take after sex.</li>
            <li>This is the best green powder I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I take it daily.</li>
            <li>And since I have recently begun a vegetarian lifestyle, it will be a great benefit to me.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that gives you energy and the essential minerals and vitamins.</li>
            <li>I mix it into almond or coconut milk with a sugar free protein powder(I like</li>
            <li>I use a crystal light or mio mix to water which covers any chalky taste</li>
            <li>There were a couple of others I liked as much</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is the Best Veg/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that my skin and hair look great when I&#x27;ve been taking this regularly.</li>
            <li>Been using this for several months now and she feels great and loves drinking this once a day.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy to take it daily and has even recommended it to her friends.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product from a fantastic company.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t enjoy my weekly shot, either.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for such a great product!Can&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>this cheap anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now, great product!!!</li>
            <li>Even my 8 year old picky eater said it tasted good after he got over the fact that Mommy&#x27;s&#x27; strawberry smoothie was greenish-gray.  </li>
            <li>Even my 8 year old picky eater said it tasted good after he got over the fact that Mommy&#x27;s&#x27; strawberry smoothie was greenish-gray.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to be delicious, but man, really have to chug this as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>The stuff I take is far superior</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not vegan, but seeing a good natural source of vitamin D was great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>As a natural prebiotic, the inulin contained in Fiber On The Go nourishes good bacteria in the digestive tract.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Which brings up another point, I keep this in the freezer since it states on the packaging to keep it in fridge for good results and freezer for better results, I think in terms of the probiotics lasting longer, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very high-quality product with only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>and now I really feel better More focus,</li>
            <li>There are so many good foods in this product; more then any other of the greens I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt better, stronger, healthier or more wise with any other consumable product.</li>
            <li>I like it best with plain ol&#x27; filtered water (8 oz.)—I just fill a shaker bottle up to the 8 oz.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see results right away, you feel better and your digestive system will thank you.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wake and feel like a million dollars!!!</li>
            <li>The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers, a safe form of lecithin, and no soy lecithin!!  </li>
            <li>Its very fresh smelling, and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others working out, need a boost or just trying to be healthy and feel better.  </li>
            <li>Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is an excellent product, priced nicely (compare it to the overpriced Athletic Greens), and with full disclosure label (no proprietary blend nonsense).</li>
            <li>It does not taste very good mixed with water, but it is way better mixed with your favorite juice.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>but I like it better first thing.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can tell when I&#x27;m on caffeine.</li>
            <li>I tend to eat pretty healthy though</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a significant boost in energy</li>
            <li>I was so excited about trying this</li>
            <li>I am not sure why the directions says \\&quot;Best taken 30-45 minutes after eating.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Worth it though!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue taking this product and update my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also significant improvement with digestion.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li>-- I had the familiar and unmistakable symptoms.</li>
            <li>I have become more consistent w/</li>
            <li>Just finished my first month supply and am buying two more months.  </li>
            <li>This product significantly boosted my immune system.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Having been a \\&quot;health-nut\\&quot; since I was 15 years old (I am 51 now) and having tried a lot of products, I must say that this one is on the very top of my list.  </li>
            <li>Usually get the best price for it here too.</li>
            <li>and everyone I know has noticed that my face has cleared up significantly in the two months</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too sure about this at first</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived this morning.</li>

            <li>I drink it because of all the health benefits, but the taste is not that great, but I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to drink it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>I was really excited because it&#x27;s loaded with nutrients and probiotics.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to pay more for it.</li>
            <li>I was on this product for a long time and felt great-</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>However, the effects make the taste well worth it!</li>
            <li>first of all….i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was excited about the possibility of loosing caffein, but not going to happen with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I spent many hours trying to find a better choice than the Amazing Grass GreenSuperFood I was using before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be grassy, but this one is a very fine powder and it incorporates very well in juice, which helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Taste isn&#x27;t great, but easily masked in a smoothie with berries and other greens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rarely allergic to anything, but it&#x27;s not that surprising that I did have slight flushing and itchiness considering the amount of unique ingredients in it, many of which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve never ingested before.</li>
            <li>I bought this drink more than excited after all the positive reviews that it had received.  </li>
            <li>I love this products and love this type of natural energy.</li>
            <li>hope the probiotics are real, because the evidence indicates that may be the most important</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good, but we just mix it with flavored powders (like Crystal Light) and then it becomes tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is a great supplement to a healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>on the positive side of things - it appears to be packed with nutrients :)</li>
            <li>I have seen many positive benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different \\&quot;green drinks\\&quot; and this one is the best tasting and has the best organic products than any other.  </li>
            <li>This is the best green powder on the market right now for the price.</li>
            <li>Vitamin D in large doses can be toxic and I had planned on taking this twice a day until I felt really healthy again.  </li>
            <li>Even the kids drink it right up!</li>
            <li>Great taste, feels alive and vibrant, just like the name.</li>
            <li>, I feel wonderful and even though I&#x27;m 54, I run circles around the younger agents at the major airline</li>
            <li>just read the lab reports form consumerlab.com, this product has very high arsenic, including most toxic form (inorganic).</li>
            <li>I cannot say that I have lost weight on it or had a ton more energy, but I certainly have felt good since starting it two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is an organic and whole food product that is high quality and helps to keep us in good health.</li>
            <li>After my first try, it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again.  </li>
            <li>me, I notice I generally feel better, and have more energy.</li>
            <li>This product, like most &amp;#34;green drinks&amp;#34; really help with your energy and health.  </li>
            <li>THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME ON A DAILY BASIS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really been more energized.  </li>
            <li>And still think that is true.     </li>
            <li>It eliminates having to take a fist full of vimimins and herbs.    </li>
            <li>I will continue to take this product since I know it&#x27;s good for my system but not on a daily basis</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Product is power packed full of nutrients.</li>
            <li>This is overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I did some research on the internet and found that Amazon had the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Regardless or not if its \\&quot;psychological\\&quot; it&#x27;s still a good feeling - especially internally.  </li>
            <li>I was waking up at 6 am every morning on time for class, jumping out of bed full of energy.</li>
            <li>If I am ready to read 10 books, I can  know more than him, atleast about my condition.</li>
            <li>Actually it would to be good to drink BEFORE eating as an appetite suppressant.  </li>
            <li>You can divide the mix up over the course of the day until you get in the full amount of mix.</li>
            <li>Onions are double whammy fructose and oral allergy wise.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference, I love it and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>take Athletic Greens, which is fantastic, pricey but worth it to me - a 1 month supply runs $100.</li>
            <li>This product says to use a full scoop.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I had to work our way up to a full scoop.  </li>
            <li>(  The one thing i thought i was doing good for myself is actually harming me.</li>
            <li>I have faith that it&#x27;s doing good things for my body, but I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not only getting a fair share of probotics</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper and is much better for you.  </li>
            <li>This is a very comprehensive vitamin and herbal powder, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>More importantly, it really works.  </li>
            <li>Well, I guess I just can&#x27;t say enough good over this product</li>
            <li>No BS proprietary blends that mask the product&#x27;s true ingredients</li>
            <li>it really has helped bring good nutrition and a feeling of wellness to my physical body, which in turn has made me mentally more relaxed and focused.  </li>
            <li>it is that it is chock full of vitamins and minerals you should get from eating your fruits and veggies as well as pre-biotics and pro-biotics.</li>
            <li>Not only is it really good for you and packed with vitamins....</li>
            <li>With this vegetable dring I get many nutrients in a form that can bypass the digestive system and go straight into my blood stream.  </li>
            <li>It helps with regular bowel movements and is good for constipation.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it in smoothies, juices, and even with just water and fresh lemon.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand the taste of the drink alone mix it with a sweet juice.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have time to make some elaborate shake very morning.</li>
            <li>This takes only 30 seconds and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>people weren&#x27;t experiencing that until about a full week or two.</li>
            <li>Tried it with grape juice but did not care for the sweet.</li>
            <li>n not in the mood to complete my weekly workouts,so I started looking for some kind of booster n something that would benefit my health</li>
            <li>Love this in my smoothies so you can&#x27;t really taste it.</li>
            <li>But that wasnt a good enough reason for me to believe this stuff works.</li>
            <li>and it really does make me feel like I have more energy</li>
            <li>mixes well and isnt as much a dominent flavor as many others.</li>
            <li>If I were to go outside and eat the grass in my yard it wouldn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li>I keep a nalgene bottle full of it everywhere</li>
            <li>Yes, it may not taste like candy or anything, but it&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li>No bad  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it does throw off the taste of my morning smoothie.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad taste either.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even taste the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; until I get to the bottom remnants in the glass, and even then it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>is not bad.</li>
            <li>taste is not bad</li>
            <li>I am pretty open to trying new things especially if it is good for my health...</li>
            <li>Having said that - its not the most pleasant tasting green food I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It does not replace a healthy diet for sure, but it adds alot without having to take many other items.</li>
            <li>It mixes pretty easily.</li>
            <li>PS, my research has shown that the best way to take these type of greens is in its most natural state - straight H2O &amp; on an empty stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, unless you have a PERFECT diet, never ever eat junk or fast food, and drink only highly purified water and lots of it, you need this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It does not look good but very easy to take and very little after taste.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making the product available, and delivering it quickly!</li>
            <li>5 stars all the way and priced great compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>It was great if you were making a smoothie but much too sweet if mixed with juices.  </li>
            <li>They review hundreds of products and welcome challenges to their testing when products don&#x27;t have the ingredients they claim, the amounts they claim or have other harmful ingredients that are not listed on the label.</li>
            <li>I found myself walking upright with great posture instead of slouched forward as I do normally due to lack of energy.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is full of so many good for you vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>And the amount of awesome stuff (like the probiotics and organic foods) are enough to get me coming back to it despite the price.</li>
            <li>We noticed more energy and overall better health feeling.</li>
            <li>that although our ancestors smoked freely, they still led a much healthier life free from side effects of tobacco use...and the reason for this was their diet.</li>
            <li>I decided I was going to take a quick shot.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give quick feedback.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick nutrition and,</li>
            <li>After reading about the 7 super foods, I told my husband</li>
            <li>is always quick.</li>
            <li>I buy this stuff and take it because several people I trust who know more than me and do this sort of scientific research for a living tell me that I&#x27;ll be glad I did it in 30 years.</li>
            <li>(Because my local store was out) and although I may have preferred the taste of Greens+, I felt like GV is a better, more holistic product.  </li>
            <li>After I started taking it, I was lucky to reach 35 push-ups.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, this drink gave me a tremendous amount of energy to do the task each day . . .</li>
            <li>I have never felt more confident in a healthcare product I consume on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Vitality Super Greens\\&quot; do not contain beets.  </li>
            <li>Knowing all the wonderful things in Green Vibrance makes the taste very bareable.</li>
            <li>but I am extraordinarily &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; and experience no digestive issues whatsoever</li>
            <li>I think it has improved my energy level tremendously.</li>
            <li>And it arrive so quickly.</li>
            <li>I am a very health conscious person and I take a variety of supplements; this is my favorite (although omega 3&#x27;s are also very important).</li>
            <li>I truly couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff any more highly.  </li>
            <li>P.S it lowered my high bllod pressure from about 160/100 to a stable 120/75 :)</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of taking the powder faithfully, I noticed I felt a little more energetic and my body responded more from the things I ate.</li>
            <li>At first, I almost regretted ingesting it because the taste isn&#x27;t pleasant and that alone almost made it come back up.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for many reasons overall health is the main thing a great way to get your greens it balances out your ph in a big way</li>
            <li>Also, I confirmed with their reps that all the vitamin content, including the Vitamin D3 (from Lichen) to Vitamin&#x27;s A, C, and K, are all from plant based sources, which means they are not \\&quot;lab produced\\&quot; and have higher bio-availability.</li>
            <li>After about 3 days the energy was normal more than a rush and the diarrhetic effect was not rushed any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my very first review at amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My levels are normal at this time and I feel energetic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very aware of my health.</li>
            <li>But take it daily for thirty days and you will be very pleased at how your health improves.</li>
            <li>Other than that, so far so good!!! ^.^</li>
            <li>and this is my very first review, which should speak for itself.</li>
            <li>would even go so far as to say that if you could only afford one product, this would be it as it has so many things that are good for your body.</li>
            <li>Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great vitamin!</li>
            <li>This supplement product is wonderfull,the list of ingredient is endlessly amazing and the taste is not bad at all,the more liquid you mix it with the less you taste it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any one who wants to live a healthy livestyle (I don&#x27;t even work out) and have energy!  </li>
            <li>I had bought this product originally at a Health Food Store and pretty quickly saw some health benefits.</li>
            <li>New Jersy adopted th more conservative 5 mcg limit.</li>
            <li>The company says they continually look for better ingredients and try to keep up to date with new research.</li>
            <li>I literally feel like a completely new, better person.</li>
            <li>We noticed that if we did the full scoop right away we were both a bit nauseous.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to be a loyal customer, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and dissolves fast.</li>
            <li>and overall it has pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mix and fast to drink.</li>
            <li>While AG does taste pretty good, the cost and marketing scheme left me underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>I joke with friends suggesting that I feel like a super hero when I drink my fresh juice smoothies addiing this powder to them.</li>
            <li>Its great im 52 and have a very active job.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Vibrant Health Green Vibrance from Amazon for many reasons; primary for rapidity and also good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I sound over the top and ridiculous over my love for this product.</li>
            <li>We have used Green Vibrance in our smoothies for years and found this great price for this product on Amazon, so will continue to buy it on Amazon as long as their prices are this good.</li>
            <li>First time I added it to orange juice I almost puked and couldn&#x27;t take more than 2 sips, the second time I tried it with miso soup thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go better with its fishy tasting properties but no, cannot tolerate the smell or taste.</li>
            <li>The numbers that came back were stunning!</li>
            <li>Another search bought me up with an article on prevention.com claiming the product contains arsenic twice above the acceptable safe levels!  </li>
            <li>Consult YOUR doctor first!</li>
            <li>I could feel the effect after the first time trying this!  </li>
            <li>I use this product on a daily basis and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>For the few ingredients that could have more, consumers know the exact amount and can choose to confidently supplement more of that ingredient, without over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff won&#x27;t magically make you into a ball of energy or instantly make you healthy, but over time this product will contribute positively to your health and mood.  </li>
            <li>I wound up blending it with a little fruit and veggies, coconut milk, eggs, and whey protein for a great breakfast shake.    </li>
            <li>Eating healthy and getting enough greens in your busy daily routine isn&#x27;t easy, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>Yet, I love it nonetheless, both for how I now feel and for how my large intestine has appreciated the probiotic resurgence.  </li>
            <li>This product is always fresh and filled with pure health benefits.</li>
            <li>If that is the case, try my favorite recipes that will most certainly turn heads at your next party or event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my oppinon this is by far the best green drink on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try Now Phytofood at some point, but Green Vibrance is really great for joint health.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is great.</li>
            <li>unadulterated ingredients, no secret blends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a few reviews about the taste which did concern me and but it taste great to me.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it comfortably than do it because it really does make a difference on how you look and feel in every aspect.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is a great source of all of the plant-based vitamins, minerals, trace minerals and probiotics that you need.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING SUCH AN AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best green drink out there, IMHO.</li>
            <li>(green oatmeal-not a great color).</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews here for Green Vibrance, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>great source of sea vegetables, which are not easily available</li>
            <li>Sounds like a kid crying over eating veggies lol anyways</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t possibly get this kind of nutrition from my food.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth.  </li>
            <li>The health benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a good mental \\&quot;carrot\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li>and this has by far the most effect for me.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that offers a pleasing taste, and adds more protein and fiber.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>As far as quality, this id fantastic!</li>
            <li>and  also  in my  fresh  juicing.  </li>
            <li>and it  wins  </li>
            <li>It will however change the taste, but the nutrition you get from this supplement will be worth it.     </li>
            <li>I make my own green smoothies at home, and actually love the taste.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t need to worry about making him fresh veggies every day either.  </li>
            <li>I almost choked on the price I paid for the product once I checked on Amazon, but her help in selecting a product was well worth</li>
            <li>but I have more than gotten use to the taste and actually now quite enjoy the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased so far with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in love with the results so far.</li>
            <li>it does smell like a fresh mowed lawn</li>
            <li>I take it every day in addition to eating lots of fresh vegetables.  </li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The concentrated greens together with vanilla soy milk, and frozen berries packs a powerful nutritious punch.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>Then it happened, after years of trying to go off of my acne medications, I was finally able to go a week without breakouts and completely discontinued using them.  </li>
            <li>if it worked at all, it would be well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>I recently went gluten free and removed most sugar and processed foods from my diet too.  </li>
            <li>Through-out the course of my lifetime, I&#x27;ve juiced (fresh vegetables, fresh fruits) with a juicer.</li>
            <li>I really do think it helps them behave better, and not crave so much junk since their body is getting what it needs.</li>
            <li>The potency, even though it has a wonderful profile, is poor.</li>
            <li>It kick starts my day with abundant energy and the need to eat smaller portions.</li>
            <li>you really think that this product could be sold for this many years without being pulled from the shelf if it really had inorganic arsenic?</li>
            <li>I continue to take it, much as I do vitamins, on the good faith that it&#x27;s beneficial for me, even though I feel no difference physically.</li>
            <li>This is some powerful nutrition.   </li>
            <li>The concentrated powerful nutrients are worth ever penny.  </li>
            <li>so I felt assured that this order was fresh.</li>
            <li>But than I guess what do you expect with something that&#x27;s all natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was sold and purchased my own tub on amazon and have been taking it religiously every morning (30 mins) after breakfast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;And to boot, they have full disclosure on the label, telling you exactly what you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>this time, i started blending it with smoothies of fresh fruit and or vegetables.</li>
            <li>it is well worth</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even mask it with fresh fruit blended in to the green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and think this product is definatley worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The probiotics in this product make it incredibly useful to my sluggish gut.</li>
            <li>I was at Sprouts and had $300 dollars worth of supplements in my basket.  </li>
            <li>I camouflouge it with fresh fruit in a smoothie.  </li>
            <li>I have modified my diet to include only whole foods, tried gluten free, dairy free, no sugar and more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>Forget saving a dime or two...not worth it.</li>
            <li>If this gives me energy and gets my body healthier then it is worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m trying to lose weight and become more health conscious.</li>
            <li>I consider this the professional grade compared to the others because others worked ok, but nothing like this brand.</li>
            <li>I love the taste too, very fresh and green--slightly addictive!</li>
            <li>Really good stuff for you although like many other things that are good for you nutricionally the flavor sucks.</li>
            <li>They all taste pretty much the same (if they&#x27;re just greens, that is) but this delivers the most nutrients in a very convenient form,  The price is good, much better than what I&#x27;d pay locally.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is great for supplementing greens intake... it is easily dissolved into water which makes it easy to use daily.  </li>
            <li>It takes years of eating the right foods, and even then, you may not know anything is working - just that you feel good, and no real diseases or problems ( which can be attributed to eating right).</li>
            <li>As a meal replacement or a supplement to a smaller meal I feel full, satisfied and physically well as I consciously ingest probiotics, amino acids, spirulina and gobs more amazing ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am a healthy vegetarian, I eat alot of spinach and other healthy things.</li>
            <li>The best mix is when I blend it with other fruits and veggies and Greek Yogurt in the blender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to compensate with other ingredients, but found that simply not using it is what works best.</li>
            <li>and by day three I got a mild hot flash.</li>
            <li>This is one of the things that first attracted me to Vitality Super Greens, the vegetables are ferminted.  </li>
            <li>Tastes fine to me and helps to keep me healthy all year long.  </li>
            <li>Price is also good compared to other sites</li>
            <li>Other members of my family take it and feel it is good for their health.  </li>
            <li>here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;Arsenic is found everywhere on the Earth&#x27;s crust in fair sized amounts, comparable to other toxic metals, at about 5 ppm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other types of greens and none have proven as good as this.  </li>
            <li>but this gave me a spit this out right now feeling.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It came right away.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Let me tell you right now, this is what you have been looking for.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m having some type of stomach cramp on the right side.</li>
            <li>I do not always eat right</li>
            <li>Drinking a glass in the morning helps me start my day off right.</li>
            <li>There is a &amp;#34;Version&amp;#34; listed right under the &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li>but nobody expects that, right?  </li>
            <li>This is a step in the right direction for anyone.</li>
            <li>and right after that I started to take &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Everyone should be on this since we don&#x27;t eat right as it is.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, it gives me energy.  </li>
            <li>if done right there wont be granules but its not going to take them away.</li>
            <li>After finding the right combination to mix with no problem.</li>
            <li>and I found that the usual Arsenic molecule found in water is way more acute in toxicity.</li>
            <li>The owner of the company actually grantees it, and you are able to see the ingredient list and a full transparent disclosure with no proprietary secrecy.</li>
            <li>I really have a strong stomach and drink all kinds of pure juices</li>
            <li>Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great product, specially if you are not eating your veggies every day.  </li>
            <li>Being able to get it from Amazon for much less is a fantastic bonus!</li>
            <li>You would think at 5 lbs less that I would be able to do more</li>
            <li>I feel much more energetic and in less pain as I am gradually weaned off steroids for acerbated asthma.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remain productive all day, desires to drop weight safely and is interested in detoxification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t have blood sugar problems, Green Vibrance may be as wonderful as many people claim, but I&#x27;ll just look for a green drink without all the added herb stuff.</li>
            <li>I have more energy, clarity of thoughts, and general over all</li>
            <li>I always take small amounts of the powder with me when travelling so my body gets great nutrition</li>
            <li>I have to say I feel a lot better after using this for a month, just a general improvement in health.</li>
            <li>I generally feel like I have more energy</li>
            <li>but it really was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I just drink it down, and then have something good to drink.  </li>
            <li>Once this stuff kicked in, I actually started feeling better and had energy for the first time in days!  </li>
            <li>From my perspective, I do like the consistency of this product better, as when I mix up Vitaforce it tends to sink to the bottom a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Mixed with water, a little yogurt and some frozen berries and this taste great!</li>
            <li>I have used Green Vibrance for years and have experienced positive results on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>I chase 3 young children around, work full time, run/workout, and I&#x27;m never sick.</li>
            <li>Armed with the newly acquired enlightment, I set on to find a cure to my problems... and both my jungle and the guiding light being the internet.</li>
            <li>I live in a farm community and have no illusions that the food in today&#x27;s world is toxin free.</li>
            <li>I think this product is very good for people but go slowly!  </li>
            <li>To my amazement I notice after taking green vibrance, more energy, happier mood, and more alert.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is the best ever...and they are constantly improving this product..therefore each time you purchase this</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance has been overall the best for me.</li>
            <li>Of all various green powders, that I have tried, this one is by far the best one, it has given me a lot of energy and an overall good feeling of wellbeing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth way more than the regular stuff out there in potency value alone.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth trying especially my age group (60).  :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m really feeling great since I started taking Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li>Some people complain about the flavor (which I actually like), but if you mix it with your favorite juice, problem solved and it&#x27;s beyond worth it.  </li>
            <li>I only eat red meat one day per week, so its been a great subsitute for iron.</li>
            <li>There are good probiotics out there for half the price.</li>
            <li>I started taking the Green Vibrance and have noticed that I feel much better, having more energy.  </li>
            <li>I have improved my immunity against sinus infections and general sickness, my bowels are regulated, and have more consistent energy through out the day.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to my usual Amazing Grass Amazing Meal original flavor.</li>
            <li>All my main nutrients in one scoop!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Great probuct, that I have been using daily for several years and at a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li>Both enjoy/ed amazing health, vigor, and energy far beyond many people half their age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix and tastes good with just cold water and gives me a nutritious and energetic start to the day.</li>
            <li>the energy I get and the overall good feeling and mental clarity make it an easy choice to purchase.</li>
            <li>I use either organic, unsweetened coconut milk or almond milk, frozen fruit or fresh fruit, spice (cinnamon, cocoa, turmeric, maca powder, camu powder, you get the idea), a scoop of Plant Fusion (unflavored) protein powder and a sweetener like Pure LoHan (monk fruit) and blitz it up with ice in my Bullet.  </li>
            <li>I was feeling a more positive attitude in general, a higher energy level</li>
            <li>I have it in smoothies with vanilla protein powder, raw spinach, and almond milk, and it is low calorie and delicious.</li>
            <li>Blender Bottle by Sundesa, Hand Blender, Sports Bottle, Blue, 20 oz.]], quick and easy.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a person who&#x27;s very much into health products.</li>
            <li>The one caution is that if you mix in a lot of frozen fruit, you definitely raise the sugar content quickly, and in hard-core healthy mode that can sort of backfire, but if you are like me and just looking for a way to get some greens down the pipe (and stay down), I think this is the best bet.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know how much of a difference I feel on the day to day, but it has every vitamin needed for daily nutrition and along with other good health habits, I feel confident this product is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>For us, it seems to keep us more alkaline and we stay healthy throughout the year, very little illness.</li>
            <li>I want to feed vegis to my picky sons but with my busy life it&#x27;s hard to prepare all the good greens and either sneak it into food or cook it in their favorite ways.</li>
            <li>This is huge, as I work nights, and have two young ones, and would often drink 4 cups just to get by on 3-5 hours sleep.</li>
            <li>Further analysis showed that 5.4 mcg of this is \\&quot;inorganic arsenic\\&quot; reported to be the most toxic form of arsenic.  </li>
            <li>California, out of concern for the reproductive effects, has proposed that a product with more than 0.5 mcg of inorganic arsenic in a daily serving carry a warning label.</li>
            <li>Love the blend of different ingredients plus probiotics.</li>
            <li>Actually, a couple of people have commented to me about how much more energy I have.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first thing I do</li>
            <li>I have actually found myself craving it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>When i run out i will definitely buy some more, as i do feel like taking it has improved (and still is improving)</li>
            <li>This product was first recommended to me by a physician friend about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Since I am trying to cut back on processed foods and ingredients, I made sure I did plenty of research on this product.  </li>
            <li>and my hair got sooooo much thicker!  </li>
            <li>Being able to see as many results in a short amount of time is definitely a reason for me to keep buying!</li>
            <li>I just think it is funny when I&#x27;m listening to</li>
            <li>Chaddy Chad ;-)</li>
            <li>I definitely have more energy.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure this wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I had this tested another time that I ran out of product before I could reorder and felt the same decline in mood and endurance until it arrived to me.  </li>
            <li>A very healthful additive to ones daily intake of supplements my cardiolgist was extremely happy to see this in my list of daily intake</li>
            <li>First off, let me address the energy boost.</li>
            <li>I started out with a product called Exsula Iridesca (excellent but expensive).</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a short time and find that I seem to have more energy.</li>
            <li>The latest version, version 10.2 has a low iron content.  </li>
            <li>really well!  </li>
            <li>I realized something had changed drastically when I woke up and realized I had slept the whole night through without interruption!  </li>
            <li>I want to know EXACTLY what you are selling me.  </li>
            <li>I want to know EXACTLY what you are selling me.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and especially the price.</li>
            <li>and they say they are interested in it.</li>
            <li>Vibrance contains more friendly, healthful probiotics than any other superfood.</li>
            <li>This is MY first review</li>
            <li>This is MY first review</li>
            <li>so I feel I&#x27;m pretty well covered</li>
            <li>at first the taste is funky but mix it with cranberry or orange juice</li>
            <li>My throat feels better, my constant pharyngitis is gone.</li>
            <li>well actually I sleep like that on any off day and sometimes more well</li>
            <li>I first got wind of this product from the 4 hour diet wanting you to buy athletic greens which is a competing product and twice the price.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you try a travel packet first.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li>Tastes like dirt at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>it probably tastes exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>My first go around using this product</li>
            <li>At the same time, they also charge manufacturers many thousands of dollars to get their products reviewed.  </li>
            <li>EX: My first cannister was 10.3.</li>
            <li>My tummy thanks me now~!</li>
            <li>carrots and celery were among the first to jump ship.  </li>
            <li>The only way I can seem to kill the proteins I&#x27;m allergic to in most veggies has been to boil them</li>
            <li>This I could not even finish the first glass-</li>
            <li>, I started with the recommended amount for the first week and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in any area of my health (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li>I first heard about this when looking for solutions to a health problem I had.</li>
            <li>First day I suffered through the taste.  </li>
            <li>It really helps!  </li>
            <li>Better than taking a daily multivitamin.</li>
            <li>OK, don&#x27;t buy this for taste, but if you&#x27;re buying it for the potential health benefits, then proceed.  </li>
            <li>Wish I would have tried it first.  </li>
            <li>it has been easier to be consistent since I learned the protein/banana trick.  </li>
            <li>In any case, Green Max Plus was way more affordable and did give me the ability to engage in more intense workouts.</li>
            <li>and I definitely feel better</li>
            <li>It makes me feel better that they&#x27;re getting lots of vitamins they need when I struggle to get the daily veggies into them.</li>
            <li>and I overall feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>First day review</li>
            <li>but goodness it&#x27;s a challenge the first couple days</li>
            <li>Part of my daily routine for many years now.</li>
            <li>Yes if the price hadn&#x27;t gone up $15 since I first ordered it (about 60 days ago).</li>
            <li>I tried it with water at first, and it mixes ok--kind of clumpy like whey protein.</li>
            <li>com is an independent testing lab that many supplement manufacturers submit products to for testing but</li>
            <li>If you want to go a step higher, add a scoop of Rainbow Vibrance.</li>
            <li>Being gluten free with a sensitive stomach I find that whenever I eat something that doesn&#x27;t agree with me 2 glasses of this sorts me out faster than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Do your research and you&#x27;ll come back to this product :)</li>
            <li>First time trying product.  </li>
            <li>the more likely you with buy, and keep using this product.</li>
            <li>my energy level seems much higher too, and my stomach/digestive issues seem to have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Energy is up, detoxes me very well, and I am feeling healthier too!  </li>
            <li>I mix white grape juice (.5 cup) with water (.5 cup) and the mixture, kills the tardiness taste, much better.</li>
            <li>First time buying and</li>
            <li>, I definitely slept better and woke up WAY easier.  </li>
            <li>Does what you want it too...keeps you regular and energetic.</li>
            <li>Lets get this out of the way first, shall we.</li>
            <li>my skin looks much healthier and it glows!  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I are both vegan and also take 6-7 vitamins a day on top of this blend.&lt;br /&gt;However, since adding it into our daily routine</li>
            <li>i would only recommend to anyone, to make sure they are not allergic to any of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li>Tasted pretty</li>
            <li>the first week or two</li>
            <li>I would compare the flavor to the aftertaste you get with spinach or asparagus, and again, only when I get to the bottom of the glass, otherwise I taste just chocolate cake batter :)</li>
            <li>Tastes exactly like what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li>this stuff is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>You will thank me later.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s covering way more bases than I was before even with a bunch of my individual supplements.</li>
            <li>Anticoagulant effects: You need to be aware of the many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients in this product, as well as the one big coagulant.</li>
            <li>interactions\\&quot; because there are just too many that aren&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li>I mostly put it in breakfast smoothies, sprinkle it on greek yoghurt, or sometimes just mix it in a glass of water</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this one and it seemed like the best one to take a chance on, but was still skeptical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skeptical of most supplements and the over the top claims made in many of them.</li>
            <li>Not only did it take the pain away, I immediately had more energy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty yucky.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product!</li>
            <li>I COULD DEFINITELY SAY I FELT BETTER.</li>
            <li>helps me poop more regularly</li>
            <li>but Im glad I finally made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Back and joint pain are much better.</li>
            <li>This is my first review btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I actually feel better than I did in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>and he drank the whole thing!</li>
            <li>This product sent was exactly as depicted in photos.  </li>
            <li>It takes like swamp water, but my husband would experiment mixing it with different juices and mixes to see if we could get it to taste better.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say, it has everything you could possible need in a day for vegetables and that made me feel better.</li>
            <li>I feel more energized and no longer feel constant  hunger.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much better I feel since starting this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t eat enough vegetables and thought that this would help me get more greens in my diet.</li>
            <li>The taste is pretty grassy</li>
            <li>like to mix it with 8 oz V-8 or tomato juice, 2oz carrot juice, a tablespoon of flax seed oil, 5 drops vitamin E oil, a dose of Reuteri probiotic, 1T liquid calcium-magnesium supplement, a splash of hot sauce and a splash of home made garlic-rosemary vinegar</li>
            <li>a difference of $15 more than what I initially subcribed to</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance has thousands of micro-biotics and good flora for my colon.</li>
            <li>I took this to my sports nutritionist and he said it was a good green supplement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Green Vibrance with my family for a couple of years now and it is so energizing and feels so good in our bodies.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this or any green supplement to taste good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product and how it breaks down every ingredient for you.</li>
            <li>Then I put something really delicious &amp; fried with a strong sauce or chutney in my mouth ... and voila no more green burps....</li>
            <li>I USUALLY SHAKE IT UP GOOD AND DRINK IT RIGHT AWAY IN A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE.  </li>
            <li>honestly, the price of the other Greens supplements out there completely justifies the higher prices they charge because I can take it every morning and actually enjoy the taste without ending up coughing and dry-heaving the taste of dirt on dirt on grass from my mouth.</li>
            <li>It is not only LOADED with a gajillion things that benefit the human body, but the taste is quite pleasant</li>
            <li>It came so quickly and I&#x27;m really pleased with the amount I get for the money spent.</li>
            <li>By including  Green Vibrance as part of my diet, I really don&#x27;t have to worry much about going without  many of the major ingredients that our bodies need for optimum health..</li>
            <li>It really helps to get my day off right.  </li>
            <li>cause it does not taste good in plain water....</li>
            <li>but I feel it has had a positive change in replacing good bacteria in the intestines and helps to push waste through.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance keeps me healthy, my system runs smooth and clean, just like a brand new car.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is more affordable, while not as fine a powder as VG, but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Was far grittier than j originally thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Now, after several weeks of use I can honestly say that the above benefits are true.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily we found a better version sold by Tony Robbins that tastes a lot more neutral and includes MSM which was hard to find in a greens drink.</li>
            <li>Chug it down resolutely in water or less dramatically in a glass of juice.&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent supplement to the not-so-healthy food choices too many of us make on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>(I live on Maui)-super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I feel confident of getting the same benefit from this AND getting a two month supply for less than the cost of a one month supply of VM.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be glad to use Green Vibrance again when this problem is solved, because it is otherwise a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Not tired in the morning at all... and very regular. :)</li>
            <li>If you can stay away from fast food, soda, and drink this every day you will probably be doing more than 98 percent of American&#x27;s out there for your health.</li>
            <li>When I take Green Vibrance, I really feel like I&#x27;m taking care of myself, that&#x27;s a good feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is really a good source for getting the green veggie you need with out eating so much.</li>
            <li>Green super-foods have detoxed my liver and has given me the nutrition my body needs and filled the nutritional voids from eating even a healthy diet.     </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t end up too sweet when mixed in a smoothie with a sweet fruit like a banana.    </li>
            <li>It helps me be sure that we&#x27;re getting enough real nourishment into us.  </li>
            <li>This supplement is the most important supplement that I use (that&#x27;s saying a lot because I take quite a few).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a great, complete green.</li>
            <li>Not as tasty as more expensive brands, but good for you.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Green Vibrance is the sole reason why my health improved, but it has so many good things in it, I am convinced that it definitely played an important role, which is why I intend to take this product for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>Clean, pure and healthy, and less taste interference with your juice or protein drinks.</li>
            <li>My cycle has regulated, my cramps are completely gone, and between this and my Kangen water, I am almost never sick.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviewed before purchasing this product and everybody was saying positive things about and since my husband and I need to add a supplement to our diet and workout program we decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>but I plan to move on with a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li>but I plan to move on with a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li>I will add to the chorus of positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>There is a positive energy effect.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s positive effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much a skeptic</li>
            <li>After I finished my first 30 day supply of it, I hadn&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my health or my energy level.  </li>
            <li>(if you are willing to pretend the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t really happen, hehehe).</li>
            <li>After 60 days of taking this I have more energy than I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I got straight A&#x27;s and a B for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>have only used this a few times so far, but its perfect.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much better, mentally and physically, and more energy.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s pretty much all that matters.</li>
            <li>This is the first supplement that my husband says has really made a noticable difference in how he feels.  </li>
            <li>I take this pretty much every morning</li>
            <li>On top of this I am a long time sufferer of recurrent UTI&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>In the past year I have lost about 17 lbs , despite eating normal and healthy amounts, without explanation from doctors running labs, biopsies and more.</li>
            <li>Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I am not deficient in any minerals, vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I usually drink it with O.J, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me taste wise.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a bit pricey, but compared to other products, this is far superior in quality.</li>
            <li>Too me, it is super mild and simply tastes grassy.</li>
            <li>But, after using Vibrant Health for more than 6 months my iron is now at a stable level to give blood every time with not problem or having to take extra kids vitamins making my iron roller coaster.  </li>
            <li>I feel more anxious, and have less energy, and tend to not be as happy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been able to mix this and drink it without oral issues and so far no other issues.  </li>
            <li>The beginning of the second week I took two full scoops on a daily basis because I was willing to believe my body needed more to respond.</li>
            <li>hope the days to follow bring the same results I have experienced in a few short days and more.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance has help greatly, my arthritis has stopped hurting, hair seems thicker and general health</li>
            <li>Well, honestly, at first I couldn&#x27;t really feel that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if you use warm water it dissolves a bit easier and becomes less gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish companies and corporations would get past the obsession with adding faddish herbs to every manufactured good out there.</li>
            <li>I did not take it long enough to see if it was any good.</li>
            <li>Since I take the recommended amount stated on the package, the large container lasts me quite a while.</li>
            <li>I have my morning breakfast in my togo large plastic tupperware.</li>
            <li>I bought the large container</li>
            <li>This way you get a large quantity of well-being in a scoopful.  </li>
            <li>As a supplement I also bought a bottle of Pure Essence labs</li>
            <li>It helps with digestive issues and adds a large variety of nutrients.</li>
            <li>I even drink it with pure water.</li>
            <li>I take a great many supplements, which makes it hard to tell just how effective any given item is, but the Green Vibrance seems to help with regularity among other things.    </li>
            <li>Went to whole foods and since my greens had been a positive part of my dietary supplementation I thought why not change it up a bit.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m a little suspect of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using Green Vibrance for over a month now and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Worth it to get it on amazon for cheaper than in the natural food stores!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Green Vibrance for two weeks, and I love it!.</li>
            <li>We drink this everyday with orange juice and love it !  </li>
            <li>After I ran out, I bought this, which is like half the cost for double the amount--- that seemed great.  </li>
            <li>Then just add a teaspoon of the raw organic honey and it becomes very enjoyable to drink.</li>
            <li>The taste is also fine mixed in a smoothie.  </li>
            <li>I tried exercise, quitting a job to get more sleep, teas, ecchinacea, resveratrol, colloidal silver, astaxanthin, umcka, zinc, and lots of other supplements to boost my immune system, and they worked at first</li>
            <li>Over a week later I am still fine.</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much Vibrant Health!</li>
            <li>a site note, if you are interested in their Maximum Vibrance product, I was told the main difference is that that one contains a serving of plant-based protein in addition to vitamin content...  </li>
            <li>I typically blend this powder in my freshly juiced fruits, although I use commercially produced organic juices which are also just as good, and drink with my breakfast in replace of a meal or often over my morning cereal.  </li>
            <li>also believe that Vibrant Health&#x27;s policy of letting the consumer know EXACTLY</li>
            <li>and it was found to have very high amounts of ARSENIC.</li>
            <li>With Green Vibrance, all the fuss is taken out and even more high impact special greens are involved.</li>
            <li>A little bit more, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Vibrant Health!</li>
            <li>Taking it makes me feel wonderful and combining it with a healthy, plant-based diet keeps me from ever getting sick!</li>
            <li>Overall... great product and definitely worth a little grit to have all the  benifits!!</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it really makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>There are enough reviews about how great this product is, so I&#x27;m not going to waste your time</li>
            <li>The taste is less than desirable but its easy to mix and shoot quickly.</li>
            <li>The taste is something to get used to, but I really don&#x27;t mind it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much of an appetite while recovering, so</li>
            <li>I really think it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>but again, this is costing too much, it is like $2/day</li>
            <li>After three weeks I noticed my nails growing fast and strong-including my hair.  </li>
            <li>Every household should have a jar of this product in the kitchen and everyone really ought to have a dose each day...</li>
            <li>I really believe that we are what we eat.</li>
            <li>All report more energy and mental clarity.  </li>
            <li>At Whole Foods you spend close to $100 with tax.    </li>
            <li>The quantity provided is very generous.</li>
            <li>I noticed it&#x27;s really easier to handle the taste if I don&#x27;t breathe thru my nose until I&#x27;ve had the glass of Rice Dream.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product I could use as a replacement for the real thing on the days that I just don&#x27;t have time to use my juicer.</li>
            <li>The findings of ConsumerLab.com was confirmed by another independent laboratory.</li>
            <li>All is promises it really.</li>
            <li>In today&#x27;s fast paced world, we can sometimes neglect to take care of ourselves as well as we should.</li>
            <li>I made this mistake, using way too much cranberry juice.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who wants to improve their health gain vitamins and energy</li>
            <li>It really helps with my digestive track</li>
            <li>I saw this product in Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>Now I often wake rested and ready to go even before my alarm goes</li>
            <li>and I really think it may have saved me.  </li>
            <li>and I really think it may have saved me.  </li>
            <li>The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m used to drinking yucky stuff for my health, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>For my whole life I always had no energy,</li>
            <li>BEFORE I MAKE ANY REAL HEALTH CLAIMS</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even really tasty.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product being on time.</li>
            <li>Much finer than I have found before.</li>
            <li>and she was very helpful.</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients goes the whole way around the rather fat container.</li>
            <li>Very tolerable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really kicks your immune system up a notch or two.  </li>
            <li>I could not stop taking the product because it cost too much money.</li>
            <li>the whole story about traveling.</li>
            <li>the both of us has had so much energy.</li>
            <li>(we have a whole canister).</li>
            <li>It really seems to help.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t make</li>
            <li>Changing my diet really helped</li>
            <li>Being a natural product from the earth, the arsenic levels in fresh, living food can&#x27;t be controlled in a laboratory.</li>
            <li>The testimonies here by some elderly reviewers tend to reflect much</li>
            <li>I have an arrythmia and sometimes it really helps to drink this..</li>
            <li>So now I mix w/ 8 ounces of water, and drink it as fast as I can.</li>
            <li>so if I had ANY increase in energy, it would be very noticeable and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking to myself, really??</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>I think that is a bit much</li>
            <li>i am very into it.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if these sorts of things work.</li>
            <li>Is it way cheaper than Whole Foods?</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>It has a very well thought out balance of nutrients.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t change much else w/</li>
            <li>and when I drink GV this every day, I don&#x27;t suffer w/ yeast nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>Too much vit K causes blood clots.</li>
            <li>product can really do wonders for your body that you cannot see.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, showed up ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Let me get real here....</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have it now I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>multi-vitamins just aren&#x27;t absorbed completely.</li>
            <li>I use it in my smoothies along with spinach or kale, berries,  sweetener, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>After reading a bunch of reviews, Green Vibrance seemed to be the next best choice,even though it receives low marks for taste.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves this.  </li>
            <li>My husband is a health nut and does all the research for me, and so far, this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And by ordering it from Amazon, I saved about 30 dollars compared buying it at Whole Foods.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who is seeking a healthier lifestyle!</li>
            <li>thanks for the warning from another consumer here.</li>
            <li>I like juicing but at times it&#x27;s to much work when I want to just drink and go.  </li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>It gave me a really lucid energy-boost, and doesn&#x27;t make my heart or nervous system &#x27;splode like caffeine</li>
            <li>I really wish I COULD take it because I think what people are saying here is correct.  </li>
            <li>I have so much energy with this</li>
            <li>Even my wife has mentioned to me how much energy and spirt I have.</li>
            <li>So much is packed into one scoop, just read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I add a scoop to my morning shake and really like it.</li>
            <li>I ran out for two days this week, and really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>Energy and mood is much improved.</li>
            <li>I drink this every morning with juice it really helps give me energy.</li>
            <li>WE REALLY RECEIVED A BARGIN WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about six months now and really do believe that it has helped to increase my energy.</li>
            <li>It really changed my life.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because the holistic vet of my 13 years old lab recommended it to increase her health, and wellness during her golden years.</li>
            <li>I feel so much energized, happier, and my foot pain</li>
            <li>take this stuff every day for a week and see how it changes your appearance, (my skin looks much healthier, it got rid of some eczema around my nose)</li>
            <li>its really</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t taking medication for blood pressure I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it too much, though.    </li>
            <li>Whole apple powder 500</li>
            <li>so I really wanted to find one I could tolerate.  </li>
            <li>I also tried the chocolate version, which I really like</li>
            <li>Too much acid.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER.I</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>We take it in our juice and really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li>I feel energized and also feel that my immune system is much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind the taste at all.</li>
            <li>I spent most of my time on the couch.</li>
            <li>and I really notice the difference if I miss a day.</li>
            <li>Every vitamin and mineral you&#x27;d ever need in reasonable quantities (not overdoing it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was already a size 00 and am currently very underweight .</li>
            <li>My latest research has been &amp;#34;the greens&amp;#34; and I can say without a doubt, Green Vibrance is in the top 3, depending on the specific nutrition and results you are looking for.</li>
            <li>This product supplies a very generous amount of &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; of the nutrients on their label.</li>
            <li>Really helps out if you have acid reflux.  </li>
            <li>It satisfies my needs and proved to be more than what I expected as for as the energy that I now have</li>
            <li>and I believe this product has really helped me.  </li>
            <li>It tells you what&#x27;s in it, how much, what category that ingredient falls into, etc.</li>
            <li>but it does make you want to take it with straight juice of some sort.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to take a lot of it, 8 oz, and so you can really chug fast.</li>
            <li>really  fantastick&lt;br /&gt;gave to my daughtr</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t stress too much about what I eat for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I used to drink it straight with 4-6 ounces of water and god</li>
            <li>really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that attacks my liver and have had absolutely zero energy.  </li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>It is very tolerable to me</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Thanks seller.  </li>
            <li>Really didnt expect an energy boost as its always a claim.</li>
            <li>much B vitamin).&lt;br /&gt;small</li>
            <li>My whole family has been using this product for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I am very faithful in drinking it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing another box because I think it&#x27;s very nutritive and</li>
            <li>I went straight to the kitchen, got it out, &amp; started taking it.</li>
            <li>- something I haven&#x27;t done since high school!)</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t really taste it.</li>
            <li>Every year or two an inflammation flareup requires me to take a one or two week juice and probiotic fast.  </li>
            <li>, I wake up much easier in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>This combination seems to be, for me at least, a good boost for the immune system.</li>
            <li>I am all for this product for people that it works for, just because careful of these products that \\&quot;seem too good to be true\\&quot;, because they might just possibly be.</li>
            <li>I am all for this product for people that it works for, just because careful of these products that \\&quot;seem too good to be true\\&quot;, because they might just possibly be.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I just thought it was an earthy &#x27;green&#x27; flavor&lt;</li>
            <li>Liked the taste of Green Vibrance and the probiotic component.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I am only on my second day taking this product</li>
            <li>At 61 years old I have more energy than I did several years ago.</li>
            <li>I have used many different greens but this one by far has it all.</li>
            <li>It goes down pretty good than if you take a deep breath just chug</li>
            <li>This product delivers on it&#x27;s claims of helping to provide the whole range of proper vitamins/minerals/digestive enzymes, it shipped quickly and lasted exactly 3 months with the suggested serving size.</li>
            <li>I mix with Vega One Berry flavor by Sequel Naturals and get complete health in a shake for breakfast every morning !!!</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in more information on this subject can find it here on Amazon.com reviews.</li>
            <li>Last year I started having mild hot flashes, bloating, fatigue and mood swings.</li>
            <li>I was simply trying to save money but will gladly pay more to avoid the Vibrant Green experience.</li>
            <li>Herb popularity tends to run in fads -- there&#x27;s always a hot new herb everyone is enthused about.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty new to going \\&quot;green\\&quot;</li>
            <li>com tested it and found it was heavily contaminated with arsenic; much more that any other product of it&#x27;s kind and more than legally allowed in other pruducts, one namely apple juice.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance consists of many ingredients and it is likely that one or more of these ingredients are highly contaminated with arsenic.</li>
            <li>Go to the Vibrant Health website and you&#x27;ll find the vast list of ingredients in this are mostly all natural or organic superfoods.</li>
            <li>I take it with water straight up, but I&#x27;ve heard of many people mixing it in orange juice and other beverages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper and better for you than any other shake on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Vibrant Healths Green Vibrance is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back on the band wagon and feeling fresh!  </li>
            <li>The national value exceeds most other products of its type.</li>
            <li>Navy Seals and the other healthy defence guys.</li>
            <li>Mostly wheatgrass and other greens.</li>
            <li>Everything is within the normal range!</li>
            <li>I received the package and was excited to start adding it to my daily nutrition.</li>
            <li>Even if you do eat healthy our foods are depleted of the vitamins and minerals and other micro nutrients we need.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only posting the \\&quot;significant</li>
            <li>this product may not be appropriate but on the other hand it can help a sluggish bowl.</li>
            <li>and I am finitely feeling NORMAL!</li>
            <li>This product fluctuates more than any other I keep track of.</li>
            <li>but I ditched them all for this &amp; see more positive results with less cash out the door.  </li>
            <li>I recently started a new job that to my surprise required 12-15 hour days for the last  4 weeks and my energy levels have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>ordered due the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, but have not noticed much change in my sense of well being or overall health, I did finish one 60 day supply and have ordered another one to give the product a fair shake, but so far it seems in my case that this is another bottle of snake oil.</li>
            <li>I will eat crickets, mealworms, and/or grasshoppers much sooner than I will ever try Vibrant Health</li>
            <li>I am really active and notice how much more I sweat during workouts while taking this product</li>
            <li>As with all natural remedies, you cannot expect to see immediate results but it is more of a long term investment.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for us, this is a safe supplement that gives us enough of a positive effect that we will continue to buy it and take it.</li>
            <li>I am in no way a vegetarian or vegan, not saying that&#x27;s bad, just normal guy trying to live a longer more enjoyable life with the people I love.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this ends up being a solidly rich and healthy chocolate afternoon meal substitute.</li>
            <li>Well made and shipped professionally all at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>great way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the taste was rough with just water, but mixing with a little bit of juice made it very drinkable.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not taste like you&#x27;re eating the grass off your lawn, but it has a pleasant consistency (not like some green powders which turn out lumpy or gooey).  </li>
            <li>That said, right now there&#x27;s no serious research to show exactly what happens when we are exposed to low level, long-term arsenic consumption.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are serious about having good health.  </li>
            <li>How long does it take to make a huge difference?</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is a product I have been using regularly for years, and i was happy to find this source which offers the product at the lowest price I could find and in convenient autoship.  </li>
            <li>so I was clear on exactly what I was consuming.  </li>
            <li>so I was clear on exactly what I was consuming.  </li>
            <li>I use Green Vibrance daily and have experienced a significant increase in energy and mental clarity.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected and love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Same benefits, faster and more enjoyable, at least for me it is.</li>
            <li>natural greens and vegetables tend to higher in arsenic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Parts of the US have higher arsenic soil levels where arsenic just occurs naturally.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable increase in my energy levels when I&#x27;ve drank this consistently.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t always get your full daily recommended dose of fruits and vegetables</li>
            <li>It is chock full of all kinds of goodies and was the only one that had everything from berries, leafy greens, sea veggies, fiber and pro-pre biotics, antioxidants, enzymes...</li>
            <li>And while I prefer to mix with juice, it is sweet enough to be stomached alone with water.</li>
            <li>Got to get use to the taste but overall not bad.</li>
            <li>I have to say that fresh daily juicing and home-made raw green smoothies are THE best way to get the maximum power of living greens into your system.  </li>
            <li>It goes down easier when I mix it with yogurt and frozen blueberries in my Magic Bullet mixer.</li>
            <li>And he use to suffer from anxiety, this has calmed him down and gave him more energy</li>
            <li>Giving it four stars because I can get it down every day and it&#x27;s amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It does require significant dedication, commitment, time, and energy, not to mention the initial expense of the juicer machine and constant purchasing of all that fresh produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to take a very good Green superfood, I would highly recommend Green Vibrance....</li>
            <li>More than half the time it is.</li>
            <li>but A LOT LESS MONEY FOR MORE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- More relaxed, less anxiety/stress  </li>
            <li>The main question</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t manage to swallow it quick enough not to taste it.  </li>
            <li>I researched the response from Vibrant Health and found them to be dismissive of these findings.</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much Vibrant Health!es can be toxic</li>
            <li>Vibrant Health, you have no idea</li>
            <li>ever since i began using this faithfully-2 servings per day-the allergy symptoms particularly with ym eyes have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I opened my container that I was using to confirm that the LARGER measuring spoon was in my most recent purchase.</li>
            <li>I only mix it with an inch or two of water, just to get it over with quickly.  </li>
            <li>Are they interested in educating the public, or are they just interested in making money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I do hope someone from Vibrant Health Company addresses the arsenic report findings here ASAP for the benefit of all of us who consume this product.</li>
            <li>That was the only negative, and if fatique is your problem this works great.</li>
            <li>Around 20 years ago I became a vegetarian and survived mainly off of vegetables, dairy, and nuts.  </li>
            <li>Too soon for decent evaluation at this point.</li>
            <li>It instantly takes away the bitter green taste and gives it a smooth pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend looking at another product by this company called Vibrant Health Maximum Vibrance Digestive Supplement, 24.81 Ounces sold here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking forward to trying Green Vibrance because I had heard so much about it and read so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>Read the ingredients and you will understand why we love Green Vibrance so much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased Green Vibrance with the intent to increase energy levels for more intense workouts.</li>
            <li>I will try for another 60 days to see if energy increase can be attributed to vibrant greens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lot more regular when I take it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Mixes reasonably well for a green powder and ok if you put it in juice.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product pretty consistently for several years now.  </li>
            <li>i went from the misery of bouts of laxatives for constipation and binders for diarrhea for over a year, to actually a balanced digestive system, energy, a feeling of well being, better sleep, no mysterious headaches that were somehow connected to my stomach woes.  </li>
            <li>A friend touted this as a decent solution.</li>
            <li>Finally science and technology do actually work to make our lives better.  </li>
            <li>For those with sensitive taste buds, mix GV in your favorite organic unprocessed juice</li>
            <li>I notice the mornings when I skip my Vibrant Health drink</li>
            <li>: Yep just checked the main site Vibrant health</li>
            <li>Getting rid of older supply?</li>
            <li>I mixed it with orange juice to make it more palatable or mixed it in a smoothy.</li>
            <li>I have taken other greens but this one seems to make my energy last all day and it mixes very good with other things like whey protein.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance not only has a nice flavor to it, especially if you add (Raw Honey and some fresh squeezed orange juice) but it also gives me energy and keeps me full for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend Vibrant Health products.</li>
            <li>I will revisit my original review in either direction to report on long term efficacy and results.</li>
            <li>In any case, it worked for me, besides just plain being good for you overall.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, I really did, but the taste was just plain offensive</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she was taking it and highly recommend it to all of her family and friends.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>to mention that the price is weigh too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have a chronic illness.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too high.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this vendor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your health.</li>
            <li>If you can cut out some other excess, this will benefit you far more than a frap/cap/half caff or spending 50$ buying drinks for girls at a club.</li>
            <li>I am a little worried over the high amount of arsenic found in it though, and the fact that the company has neglected to address that issue with a response worries me more.  </li>
            <li>I have shared this with many in the health care field, Physicians, Surgeons and clinicians who now use and recommend this product with positive results, not just digestive related, but for autoimmune boost,anemia, energy and mental clarity.</li>
            <li>, Consumer Reports reported finding arsenic in many rice products, finding about 4 mcg of inorganic arsenic, on average, in a standard 45 gram (dry) serving of many types of rice sold in the U.X.</li>
            <li>but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT WORKS\\&quot; or \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT SUCKS\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT WORKS\\&quot; or \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT SUCKS\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>May be my imagination, but I do feel a little more \\&quot;get-up and go\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>apple, any fruit with a little water..or with V 8 juice when i want more salt..</li>
            <li>There is little clinical study of many herbs, and reliable reporting on side effects (or even beneficial effects) is anecdotal.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, I do seem to have a little more energy with this addition to my diet so who knows.</li>
            <li>Probiotics: The amounts of probiotics listed are \\&quot;at date of manufacture\\&quot; which does NOT necessarily mean \\&quot;at date of ingestion\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the Junior Vibrance for my grand-daughter to help her grow healthy organs and feed that little growing brain of hers.</li>
            <li>No more afternoon lulls, feeling so much better and as a result more active.</li>
            <li>I suggest mixing it in cranberry or other strong juice to start.</li>
            <li>I first started taking Greens plus which is also a very good Green superfood, but I was introduced to Green Vibrance by a local health food clerk...</li>
            <li>Its taste isn&#x27;t bad and Amazon has the best price I could find.</li>
            <li>I was juicing prior to Green Vibrance, and still do occasionally, but this is quicker (and cheaper) and it has been a great buy for me.  </li>
            <li>It also really seems to be &#x27;cleansing&#x27; as far as, well, you know...</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but too expensive on this site.</li>
            <li>but so far he uses it very sporadically.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone introduced me to Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot better when I take Green Vibrance, it gives me lots of energy and my skin has a glow...</li>
            <li>I have used Green Vibrance for several years now and have to say I am very healthy for 59.</li>
            <li>I heard about Green Vibrance through one of my favorite bloggers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about my energy levels because I get up and get going pretty well on my own, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t hampered it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Green Vibrance for many years.</li>
            <li>$100 is the normal price?  </li>
            <li>They say the normal price is $100??????  </li>
            <li>It goes without saying that Green Vibrance is a much more beneficial boost than caffeine or sugar.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I want that everyday.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>Your smoothie might be brown or green but it tastes so much better.  </li>
            <li>I feel better when taking Green Vibrance each day.</li>
            <li>Then I knew for sure it was really my Green Vibrance that  got rid of the hormonal effects of menopause.</li>
            <li>a product like this was effective for me, I would have noticed some improvement in at least one area this should affect</li>
            <li>its my favorite green food.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give a better rating for Green Vibrance, but it just did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li>so it stays extra fresh.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t taste it at all, but it gives it a green tint, so everyone knows how healthy you are.  </li>
            <li>I love Green Vibrance -</li>
            <li>DOES NOT COMPARE TO NORMAL CHOC MILK</li>
            <li>I like green vibrance better...</li>
            <li>I love this green vibrance.</li>
            <li>After consuming the frothy beverage, the green carnage all over your face is a sure way to scare the pants off of any of your houseplants.</li>
            <li>I started with the Rainbow Vibrance, trying to ease myself into it, and after a week, I noticed that I had more energy, so I ordered the Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li>The big question is, is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>LOVE Green Vibrance!&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance finds ALL of these magical plants and roots from all over the world and grinds them up</li>
            <li>I BEEN PURCHASING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.LOADED WITH HEALTHY NUTRIENTS AND PROBIOTICS</li>
            <li>I love the effects of Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li>I love Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li>I recomend green vibrance to all my patients, and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the green color affects the taste perception for many, you know, mind over matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have read some negative reviews but the company has always been forthcoming and honest.  </li>
            <li>bought the green magic because I was looking into meal supplements.</li>
            <li>have discovered that it is tolerable only with orange fresh.</li>
            <li>Based on the ingredients and what I had read about it on their website, I ordered the Green Vibrance when I needed more.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days I started feeling almost like a normal person again.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better green drinks on the market that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I use the V-8 usually for convenience but it would be better to juice the real thing.</li>
            <li>I just feel better when I use Green Vibrance and plan to continue forever.  </li>
            <li>I take a glass of green powder smoothy every day and have tried many over my lifetime.</li>
            <li>But my hair and skin are more moist, I&#x27;m sleeping about thirty minutes less a night, and I even feel as if I can think a little more clearly.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hypoglycemic, and I&#x27;ve learned through experience that there are certain herbs and herbal products that can profoundly affect my blood sugar.    </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because it is far more affordable and comparable to the other major Greens supplement out there.</li>
            <li>and he just had his 3rd bowel movement that day ( previously 2 BM&#x27;s per week if fortunate) or the Crohn&#x27;s patient who is able to finally have a sabbatical from chronic diarrrhea, or the Stroke patient in a lethargic state for months who was fed this through his PEG tube for two days</li>
            <li>The taste his better hidden in the Apple grape!  </li>
            <li>self, I usually have it for a quick snack-i&#x27;m big and wanted better nutrients.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been sick and have felt great and full of energy.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at the high star rating.</li>
            <li>The price is great, the ingredients are high quality, the vitamins/minerals/ingredients are great and in good numbers, but the awful taste leads to me staring at the huge jar and praying that it will eat itself and disappear off my countertop so I don&#x27;t have to take it or feel guilty for letting it go to waste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product.</li>
            <li>My guess is, they want to unload the older version with this major problem without really disclosing the details of their product.    </li>
            <li>Some of us have jumped right in and taken the required amount only to find it constipating.  </li>
            <li>He said that certain extracts could possible be causing neurtoxicity and ataxia, and that certain herbs like ginko biloba can lower things like the seizure threshold, already damaged by the immune response to the gluten, which could be causing the muscle jerking.  </li>
            <li>I pay particular attention to the iron content: I steer clear away from anything with high iron content.  </li>
            <li>, I am raising our 3 year old grandson, we still have teenagers in our home, I clog dance and am very active, and I know for sure this has been helping me.</li>
            <li>I read the Green Vibrance label carefully and, among the many, many ingredients, discovered the likely culprit -- silymarin (milk thistle extract).</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t usually care for the taste of apple juice, apple juice is definitely the best for the green powder.</li>
            <li>but I felt a little better (after about 2 weeks) as far as gastrointestinal issues go.  </li>
            <li>but I am chalking that up to it just being my new norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>since they added two new ingredients on the label, the taste is not as palatable.</li>
            <li>live the stuff, been taking it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>It continuously snowed for 4 days (around new years)</li>
            <li>I appreciate the new direction on the label to freeze this product after opening to maintain its freshness.</li>
            <li>I am a health coach, so I like to try new things to recommend for clients.</li>
            <li>With or without notification or even a justification from Vibrant health that results in a significant increase in daily use and ultimately price..........enough out of me.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t notice a huge amount of personal &amp;#34;vibrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have had digestive problems most of my adult life and since using Green Vibrance -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with chronic dry, red eyes and joint pain since my early teens, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, has been able to change that.</li>
            <li>(we&#x27;re big green smoothie drinkers) and honestly, it didn&#x27;t fare as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>well the only different thing in my daily consumtion was Green Vibrance, so I am truly sold by taking this product, and it makes me very happy to have this added to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the effects are subtle but I drink it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Increased energy (very helpful with 4 year old twins and a 6 year old), makes me feel as though my brain is awake without caffeine</li>
            <li>Keeps a person young and vibrant.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great taste, get ready for a disappointment.</li>
            <li>unsweetened almond milk(pure), currently trying titan 1 protien but will return to Optimum Nutrition Pro complex vanilla.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers of GV are very clear that they release new versions based on continuous research and improvements.</li>
            <li>As once reviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show (naturalnewsradio.com)  while on location at the 2012 Natural Products Expo, this product comes highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a VERY sensitive stomach, and I just mix this in cranberry juice, and I have no issues.</li>
            <li>We have been starting everyday with Green Vibrant for years and plan on continuing to do so for many more.  </li>
            <li>But WOW!  </li>
            <li>I started feeling sluggish and completely out of wack!  </li>
            <li>I put it in my morning protein shake and at first the taste was different, but edible.</li>
            <li>Okay, I am not sure on this....</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what an associate at my local Sprout&#x27;s told me when she recommended the product to me for the first time.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep young!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I may be in the minority, but I love this green drink!</li>
            <li>the first glass &amp; flush my mouth and throat with the second.</li>
            <li>I usually add a tad more water to finish it off.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the exact same thing for her.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Green Vibrance, I never miss a day!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me FEEL any different, but within the first year drinking it (semi-regularly) my triglycerides dropped about 100 points.  </li>
            <li>, hives on my body suddenly it was my first Time that I had allergies</li>
            <li>You can really give a taste to whatever you put it in if not careful.  </li>
            <li>By testing in this way we can keep levels of arsenic as low as possible, and make sure if it is present</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now by mixing it with a can of V-8 every morning along with red hot sauce, worcestershire sauce and a dash of prepared horseradish.</li>
            <li>I put my scoop into my daily protein drink that has so many other ingredients, that the taste is not an issue with me.  </li>
            <li>I could tell a big difference in my energy level after taking it the first week.  </li>
            <li>ONLY because I think people should be aware of this side effect (for some)</li>
            <li>We love Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>after 2 weeks taking it, my dog looks like a 2 years old puppy!</li>
            <li>they are saying I look healthier which is funny as I am all about physical fitness and dieting correctly.  </li>
            <li>It has by far the grossest aftertaste EVER!</li>
            <li>but I usually mix it in a smoothie with Macro Reds and my day is exponentially better than the days I don&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li>This year was the first time in 10 YEARS thats TEN YEARS!!!</li>
            <li>Well, it surprised me !</li>
            <li>It however tastes, and looks pretty gross.</li>
            <li>And its easy to cover it up with a little orange_pineapple juice.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you look at real people, and use common sense, consuming huge quantities of healthful greens seems to boost the immune system to a higher level so that energy, good health, and well-being can, and often does, last way into old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF there were a way to measure the life-time arsenic consumed by Jay Kordich (the original \\&quot;Juice Man\\&quot;) or the now deceased Jack LaLanne (both passionate, life-long green juice/vegetable advocates)</li>
            <li>I have been in a living hell food wise between oral allergy syndrome (itchy mouth, sneezing, scratchy throat, often times nearly losing my voice, and having everything come out the other end looking the same as it did when it went in within an hour or two) and fructose malabsorption (flatulence, extreme crippling abdominal pain and cramping, belly distended similar to that of a 6 to 8 month pregnant woman, on rare occasions a mild headache, and unfortunately the side effect of mild depression).  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to give Green Vibrance a little more time, but I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>more active and overall feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make a glass of Crystal Light Lemonade and add 2 Tablespoons of the Vibrant Green mix.  </li>
            <li>Choke it down if you must, the benefits are fantastic.</li>
            <li>One weekendI had no raw veggies and was all better, went to work, a few hours in tried my snack and all symptoms returned!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d resigned myself to putting in some Visine and popping some Ibuprofen whenever my symptoms flared up, but honest to God, a few days of Green Vibrance has cleared those problems right up.</li>
            <li>alfalfa hay-kind of sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Visual appeal isn&#x27;t wonderful after mixed in the above smoothie-looks very dark green.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the product has become more expensive; however, Amazon offers the best price!</li>
            <li>There are too many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients that would enhance Warfarin, and possibly make your blood pressure dangerously low, AND there is 150% DV of Vitamin K in a normal dose, which very seriously conflicts with Warfarin as well as most all blood-thinners.</li>
            <li>I have had this weird foot fungus forever on my foot, and the only thing i have changed recently is adding this to my diet, and it&#x27;s getting better!!!</li>
            <li>It does require frequent stirring to keep the parts that don&#x27;t dissolve mixed in, and there is often a significant amount of residue left on the inside and bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to this product but like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li>Not like caffeine which can give you the jitters, but a slight pleasant notch up in overall energy and mental capacity.  </li>
            <li>Since adding Vibrant Green to my daily regimen, my GERD symptoms are more under control</li>
            <li>My stomach got back to normal fast</li>
            <li>Since I am not good about getting enough veggies in my diet, I feel this is a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only was I walking taller and definitely felt more energy, a week later I found myself having a definite &amp;#34;spring to my step&amp;#34; in fact I was walking very briskly.</li>
            <li>I found that a combination of prune juice and orange juice with calcium stands up to the strong taste of Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very sensitive to it, and as far as I can tell the energy boost doesn&#x27;t come from caffeine.</li>
            <li>After hearing that the taste was sub-par, I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m a man, I&#x27;ve eaten dozens of gross things, surely I could choke this down before it does me in,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure what happened next, but it ended up with me coughing, hacking, and dry-heaving at the sink and the rest of the drink going down the drain.</li>
            <li>A regular staple now, I think Vibrant Health&#x27;s Green Vibrance is an amazing product and have ordered it several times (in increasing sizes!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to take a big scoop with less juice.  </li>
            <li>After receiving and making my &#x27;greens &amp; protein&#x27; smoothie I found it to have a much better taste than the product mentioned above that I was previously using.</li>
            <li>I take it 30-45 minutes after eating once a day and know that I&#x27;ve consumed a very nutrient dense green super food.  </li>
            <li>After much research I landed here at this product for a super shake including a green powder.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The size and price of the Family Size Green Vibrance is an amazing value for a single person like myself.</li>
            <li>The upside to this new discovery is that I can once again enjoy the benefits of Green Vibrance with complete confidence in their product.</li>
            <li>energy is better, I feel more upbeat, less physically exhausted.  </li>
            <li>scoop of Green Vibrance, 1 batch of Organic Kale, 1 dash of Stevia, 1 dash of Sea Salt, 2 Organic Lemons (peeled), 2 Organic Green Apples, 1 thumb size chunk of Ginger root (peeled), slight dash of Cayenne Pepper, Mountain Spring Water or best Aqua Hydrate 9pH water,</li>
            <li>If you are buying this purely looking for something that tastes like strawberry cheesecake ice cream then obviously just no.  </li>
            <li>Being a previous nutritionist he said that harvesting the wheat grass could determine if it could contain gluten, since although the leaves do not contain gluten, there must be a guarantee that the leaves have completely matured, using up all the protein that the gluten intolerant are sensitive to in order to ensure that the product is completely gluten free.  </li>
            <li>I take it with a little water mixed with my favorite juice...</li>
            <li>Have only used it for a little over a onth,but have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>However I really am grateful Vibrant Health continues to be consistent with value and integrity in the production of Green Vibrance Powder.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better, I hardly notice I am going bald anymore.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many green-powders out there - hard to know which one to try.</li>
            <li>You do have an earthy taste, but it is easily covered up when mixed or blended with other things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe there are people out there who are even more sensitive to taste than I am, but I guess there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it lives up to the hype my face is clear</li>
            <li>I will NOT buy any product of this company until they clearly show the nutritional profile of the product they are selling each time.    </li>
            <li>so clear</li>
            <li>This really surprised me as I was unaware of how much slouching</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this clear since,</li>
            <li>It might seem expensive, but Green Vibrance only averages to about $1 a day, which is definitely worth it for me to feel healthy and energetic.</li>
            <li>I have used Green Vibrance for about 18 months, its a great way to get total greens everyday.</li>
            <li>Armour thyroid and Calm magnesium made a big difference in improvoing that, but I noticed a definite increase in energy after using GreenVibrance.</li>
            <li>I trust them completely.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until recently--after having the flu for several days--that this product really shined...    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a health kick lately, just trying to focus eating better and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I am gald to see they fixed the iron issue.  </li>
            <li>But overall I believe it is very helpful to my health.</li>
            <li>To get the old $58  price I need to subscribe now?  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of green veggies, but realize they are important to health and well being.  </li>
            <li>I exercise regularly and adhere to a very strict diet.  </li>
            <li>and she is essentials off her acid reflux medication completely.</li>
            <li>I will stop using it since the risk far outweighs the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I exercise regularly and have a diet that consists almost entirely of whole grains, veggies, fruits, legumes, and lean meat.</li>
            <li>However, there&#x27;s one more thing it&#x27;s done for me that cannot be attributed to placebo, the reason I&#x27;ll be buying Green Vibrance for the conceivable future.</li>
            <li>What I do know is that I&#x27;m completely sold on this product.     </li>
            <li>Yet, the benefits of this product far outweigh this inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I use this early in the morning, before my work out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had intestinal issues since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li>Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily?</li>
            <li>For the price that this lists for (and thank heaven for Amazon&#x27;s pricing) this should be a complete supplement,(of course with the exception of omega 3 fish oil).  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is far too much iron for an adult male.  </li>
            <li>AT LEAST 2 MORE MONTHS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li>So much of your daily needs.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference when I don&#x27;t have it daily.</li>
            <li>Like all green supplements, it doesn&#x27;t taste fantastic, but this one is palatable.  </li>
            <li>Old Review:   </li>
            <li>IT IS SO NATURAL .</li>
            <li>, which far exceeds the 10-mcg-per-34-ounce safety limit established by the Environmental Protection Agency.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>, that is the least amount of pain you can take for ensuring a healthy life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and a RN  </li>
            <li>I am overweight and had a complete lack of energy to make it through the day.</li>
            <li>I totally feel ready for the day.</li>
            <li>here are discussing the recent ConsumerLab report (Greens and Whole Foods Powders and Pills Review) about arsenic levels in this</li>
            <li>Makes the next morning much easier.</li>
            <li>and you know in you busy lifestyle</li>
            <li>My least favorite part (besides the smell of spirulina) is the foam that forms when you shake it up.</li>
            <li>and I now believe the antibiotics were killing everything in my gut, including the bacteria that go crazy when my body can&#x27;t digest fructose because suddenly I was able to enjoy fruits too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in complete shock that my body is allowing this to pass through my system without attacking it on all fronts.  </li>
            <li>but so far I want to hug this jar and every person who has a part in getting it from idea, to canister to my hands.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it had all the ingredients I was looking for, spirulina being the number one ingredient.</li>
            <li>but I confirmed with a rep that all the vitamins in Green Vibrance are ALSO all from plant sources though it doesn&#x27;t explicity say this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tasted like the scrapings from the bottom of a dairy water trough, complete with chunks of grass &amp; hay.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait 20 years for the CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT settlement check.</li>
            <li>Too much vitamin K, not enough C, B3, B6, B12 or A.</li>
            <li>With Dr Schulze, I could feel it coming alive after 3 or 4 days of use, and Dr. Schulze was helpful in weight loss.</li>
            <li>I just think of it as my &#x27;adult shot of tequila&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not a teenager loaded with natural energy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Fiber on the go &amp;#34;is sweetened with natural Stevia extract.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only because he had a head injury and cant taste very well anymore</li>
            <li>Very impressing stuff, I just ordered my second 25.4 oz canister.  </li>
            <li>and I am a 58 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>66 years old and still riding a bicycle  </li>
            <li>The taste is the same but the powder looked a bit lighter and much finer in constancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say \\&quot;cowboy up\\&quot; and be an adult about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old and feel like I&#x27;m 20.</li>
            <li>I have been a natural health practitioner for 12 years</li>
            <li>so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way.</li>
            <li>I mix this with white grape juice in the blender, pour it over ice and drink it fast.</li>
            <li>Complete Greens,&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li>I like that they have all organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Chlorella, soft cell</li>
            <li>i buy this for my ninety year old grandmother who refuses to get a computer.</li>
            <li>But I developed gradually insomnia.</li>
            <li>I found however I weighed the cons and the benefits so far anyway</li>
            <li>Been a nurse for over 20 years and my shoulders really ache when I do not take this daily.</li>
            <li>My energy level has increased and I will consider purchasing another bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>You know the old saying, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li>(wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars)</li>
            <li>This product really works for me and has become part of my regular diet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking this product consistently for a long time now.</li>
            <li>After 3rd day I woke up really with a boost that just may be this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get this issue fixed and get my refund</li>
            <li>I stir it well and suck it up fast thorugh a big straw.</li>
            <li>Since Green Vibrance was the only thing that I had changed, I decided to order another tub and immediately started feeling better once I began taking it again.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance has become our family favorite to start the day for several reasons.</li>
            <li>I just purchased Green Vibrance through Amazon and the product they are now sending is Version 14.0, which is the most current version as of 08/01/13.  </li>
            <li>when u first start dont leave the bathroom area for about an hour; i would walk our dogs in the morning after drinking it in the beginning and find myself running home); at some point during the first few months u find yourself craving it as a beginning to your day-</li>
            <li>scoop of Green Vibrance, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Flax Milk, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Coconut Milk, 1 baby Coconut water &amp; meat (Use hatchet to get the coconut open), 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Almond Milk, 1 Chunk of Aloe Vera Leaf, 3 Tablespoons of: Cinnamon &amp; Pumpkin Spice, 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 tablespoons of Chia Seeds, dash of Sea Salt &amp; Stevia and 1 cup of Mountain Spring Water or more depending on the size of your blender.</li>
            <li>I am a person who eats more fruit than green leafy veggies, so this is my way to get all those necessary vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li>I used to smoke a pack a day, Ive never done well in school because of attention and energy issues, and I rarely ever exercised, I never really understood how everyone else did so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker nor do I consume caffeine through any form on a regular basis but Green Vibrance gives me better energy</li>
            <li>most likely will be buying Green Vibrance on Amazon, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Fairway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>as all the others in my opinion, but its good so dont be shy, purchase it. ..</li>
            <li>it is the worse and have good energy until the next treatment.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to taste good though as I usually have to choke it down.</li>
            <li>I exercise and eat right, but Green Vibrance is a big part of my success.</li>
            <li>, I can run about 9-10 miles, I have not smoked a single puff in over two years, and Ive been making solid straight A&#x27;s and almost have my batchelors, going for a masters or higher.</li>
            <li>Love Green Vibrance!!</li>
            <li>I used to be a regular juicer, but that involved hunting down quality organic produce, using a special wash, use plenty of the produce for decent amount of juice and then clean up the God-awful mess.</li>
            <li>I only had some slight sniffles with a very mild headache afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Also, none of my friends had the same jolly fun time on the toilet seat as I had.    </li>
            <li>Although, that is not the reason I have been taking it, I feel a bit better about skimping on food because I know my body is getting the necessary nutrients without sending it into starvation mode which slows down the metabolism even further.  </li>
            <li>, it tastes much better, it&#x27;s much less expensive, and it gives me more energy.</li>
            <li>Mix in half a scoop of Green Vibrance (any more, and it won&#x27;t really dissolve.)  </li>
            <li>I usually whisk it all up with a fork to make sure I get all the powder mixed up.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase from Vibrant Health through Amazon again.  </li>
            <li>Does not overpower other flavors, and gives me more energy than other brands out there.</li>
            <li>For the last 2 years I have suffered tremendously from airborne allergies such as dust, pollen, and vog, and the allergies have constantly triggered a downfall of my immune system.</li>
            <li>I tried adding to smoothies but, the only one that hid some of the flavor was a bahini smoothie which is mainly bananas.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have been overdoing it the past many years; this product just may be the key source of vitamins and minerals</li>
            <li>mix mine with either 8 oz of pineapple juice or orange juice (or a 1/2 and 1/2 combo, add 1/2 scoop of ON Platinum Hydrowhey or ON Gold Standard Whey Strawberry flavor, and a scoop of Vibrant Health&#x27;s Rainbow Superfood.</li>
            <li>The third time I ate it raw as suggested by my husband who thinks that it would be the best way to down a green powder</li>
            <li>I have tried other powders and they&#x27;re all pretty much the same to me</li>
            <li>The other reviews were right...</li>
            <li>This thing is high in fiber, and will make you regular, but not an emergency run to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it both from an anecdotal perspective (mine) and from a medical perspective.</li>
            <li>but it is the opposite for me, this drink has a high pH).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for several years now, and I feel great after my daily shake that includes other ingredients such as oats, flax/hemp/chia seeds, bananas, blueberries, leafy greens (kale/spinach) , Coconut Oil and whatever else</li>
            <li>both short term (right after I take it) or long term(since</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended it to me, and he said he drinks it with half a packet of the individual Crystal Light peach teas.</li>
            <li>I mix Rainbow Vibrance with Field of Greens and Green Vibrance with a glass of strong flavored juice daily.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way i could do a full glass of it, i would never get it down!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so satisfied with Vibrant Health that the ONLY reason I won&#x27;t continue to use it is because they company provides a similar supplement that seems to provide the same ingredients only with a BIG UPPAGE of Vitamin B12 and a HUGE amount of Protein and with the satisfaction level I have with this product, I am looking forward to trying the other one I described in the previous sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only problem is it needs to be frozen or refrigerated after you open it, and the container is big, so its hard to fit it in there if your fridge/freezer is usually full.</li>
            <li>With the dogs and busy schedule I barely slept.</li>
            <li>As far as green powders go, this has the most wide array of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>After you get past the taste I enjoy drinking it now.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance has kept me healthy and regular even with a recent surgery and while taking narcotics.</li>
            <li>Normally, I wake up several times during the night.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; Having been so close to this product there is only one experience that I have had that is not necessarily negative</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they sell this product, as it is difficult to get enough greens in your diet, and can&#x27;t afford a fresh smoothie every day.</li>
            <li>I used to mix this in my morning shake, but then after reading about taking greens on an empty stomach for maximum absorption, I switched to taking it first thing in the morning with just water.</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is not as sweet</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is full of green foods and probiotics and</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is so chocked full of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probiotics, that it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is the full list of ingredients for the 10.3 version of Green Vibrance:    </li>
            <li>Instead of suffering through 16 or more ounces of this mixed in water, I usually just pitch a scoop full of the powder on the back of my tongue and wash it down with water.</li>
            <li>I used to make a smootie with it, but now I make a quick shake, as I don&#x27;t have the time in the morning like I did before, with a little one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as I thought, it&#x27;s actually more bearable than my protein shakes, and tastes just fine in orange juice.  </li>
            <li>Like most smart shoppers, I was a bit skeptical because let&#x27;s admit it, as a supplement</li>
            <li>I guess I could do two shots to get the full one-scoop dose, but so far I seem to be getting results with only half, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also tickled to be able to buy a two-month&#x27;s supply for $50 because the one-month supply I&#x27;ve been buying from a health food store for $50 was getting to be a little harder to purchase each month -</li>
            <li>I did however personally contact Green Vibrance and received a detailed response the General Manager of that company which directly addressed my questions and concerns.  </li>
            <li>Green Vibrance is a very good product but it is expensive.</li>
            <li>One more note, after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon.  </li>
            <li>One more note, after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The only new thing in my life was this product.</li>
            <li>I think I wrote a review on this several months ago but just wanted to let others know that there is a new version out.</li>
            <li>Because arsenic dissolves easily in water, rice (which is grown in water) sucks up metals and arsenic and rice crops</li>
            <li>There is an intense green food taste which is much stronger than wheatgrass.  </li>
            <li>At the local organic stores here it would be at least 20 dollars more.</li>
            <li>Now, I can drink as much milk as I want thanks to the probiotics in Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I came across the reviews for Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li>However, I am also very skeptical about the true benefit of many supplements.  </li>
            <li>I actually liked Green Vibrance until I read the consumer labs report on &#x27;green powders&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Greens Vibrance is a green super food that helps balance acid in your system and does it at 30 to 60 calories each morning.   </li>
            <li>If u can&#x27;t cut up greens everyday for your juice or smoothie use this it gives u quick nutrious help</li>
            <li>Super Food gave me \\&quot;niacin flush\\&quot; and Green Vibrance doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have to drink it right down.  </li>
            <li>I literally gagged down one serving - and I can stomach most anything, and decided to give this a permanent thumbs down.</li>
            <li>I took no other vitamins I should consider a glass of greens a day.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, brown rice has higher concentrations of arsenic than white rice because arsenic is stored in the wheat germ which is removed during white rice</li>
            <li>, arsenic consumed in higher levels is extremely poisonous and the effects are cumulative.  </li>
            <li>If you do your research and think you need this stuff, buy it here and for no other reason than it&#x27;s the cheapest place I found it.</li>
            <li>I started taking this 3 years ago when I was having severe joint problems in every major joint.  </li>
            <li>I had major inflammation, according to my blood tests.  </li>
            <li>If we take no other supplements, we still take this.  </li>
            <li>I also notice a major difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>An all around winner since trying to eat right with what is available is time-consuming AND expensive.</li>
            <li>and so I try very hard to eat healthy, exercise and do what my Doctor says.</li>
            <li>Most of them taste like grass and is very hard to mix.</li>
            <li>health and the human immune system are far more complex and mysterious than any stat from any chemical</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have seen an overall increase in energy, regularity, and we have noticed that our skin is no longer dry, we have experienced minor weight loss, and oddly, I am experiencing less sensitivity during tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>If I am getting a cold or flu, i double the dosage and get better twice as quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty tight squeeze for someone on a fixed income.</li>
            <li>The taste of Green Vibrance is far superior to the other major green powder that I had been using.  </li>
            <li>However, overall i felt fine besides that localized discomfort -- a benefit I attribute to my regular use of green vibrance.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would call one scoop of anything a super food, but at least I can see the ingredients easily.</li>
            <li>Im sure this taste means high quality and quantity, but those benefits are useless if you don&#x27;t want to drink it.</li>
            <li>Manufacturers actually want to get independently certified by them because they are or appear to be impartial and hold a high standing in the community.</li>
            <li>The blood test results showed a low white blood cell count and high AST/ALT levels.</li>
            <li>and I like all kinds of veggies, but this stuff is pretty strong tasting and extremely noticeable even with a lot of other greens and veggies mixed in,  Other than the smell and taste the product</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste great but it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad at all.</li>
            <li>It must do wonders for the immune system and detoxifying the body in general.</li>
            <li>This information ratcheted up my alarm level about their lab reports in general.</li>

            <li>Loads of anti-allergics, Fumetrol &amp; Steroid inhalers will stay with me for the rest of my life, was pretty much the common verdict.</li>
            <li>It took me 6 days in the hospital and 10 days after discharge on a regimen of three different antibiotics to clear the infection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old, but,I swear I feel 15 - 20 years younger!  </li>
            <li>In the first 3 days, my skin went from average to glowing.  </li>
            <li>you could barely read it with a magnifying glass</li>
            <li>This boosted my metabolism, apparently.  </li>
            <li>The body does not have a natural way of getting rid of excess iron: only through blood donation or menstruation.  </li>
            <li>no attention span, no mental clarity, etc.</li>
            <li>You can barely taste it.  </li>
            <li>The doctor told me my lungs were functioning like a 69 year old after a PFT test, I am currently 37.</li>
            <li>I used to suffer from frequent UTI&#x27;s and since drinking this regularly</li>
            <li>I mixed a scoop of Green Vibrance with sunny D, ice, and sugar free french vanilla creamer and drink it up.  </li>
            <li>ConsumerLab funding apparently derives NOT just from their substantial membership fee of $59 a year.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the only supplement to give a descent energy boost. .  </li>

            <li>I was charged two different prices so far...</li>
            <li>We usually take in the morning and it is fulfilling and it does keep us full for a while.</li>
            <li>I mix the scoop full in a small jar with 3 ounces of Rice Dream and shake-em-up.</li>

            <li>Modified many times and they are getting worse.</li>
            <li>I really like that there is no artificial crap in there to make it taste better.  </li>
            <li>I really like that there is no artificial crap in there to make it taste better.  </li>
            <li>this review is in such a substantial place, I would hate for it to deter people from buying such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful product with vitamins, probiotics and green food combined.  </li>
            <li>How effective they are is difficult to know.</li>
            <li>but I do know that it is a healthy addition to my sometimes unhealthy diet</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, we consumers must ask a lot of questions and do our own homework</li>
            <li>I switched to the pills and added fresh green juice to my diet.</li>
            <li>If you look at the vitamins in Schulze vs Green Vib, Dr. Schulze wins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;green\\&quot; powders that taste like dirt, grass, or worse, and I&#x27;m now hooked on this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it does, I just know that I feel better and feel worse when I don&#x27;t take it</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to juice my own tomatoes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, as long as you can get by the taste!</li>
            <li>We are a little less moody and seem to handle stress better.</li>
            <li>I feel a little bit more energy in my work day and a bit less hungry as the day moves along as well.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a little more than the typical greens, and I like the fact that GV has the added and generous amounts of probiotics (as my condition is in the gastrointestinal and endocrine system - pancreas) and the adaptogen herbs.</li>
            <li>After researching the entire mess it seems after getting called-out for high levels of arsenic in GreenVibrance (even though organically bound forms of arsenic aren&#x27;t really a concern)</li>
            <li>We ran out of Tony Pure energy greens drink and a month later I tried the Vibrant Health Green drink again</li>
            <li>The taste of Green Vibrance and Super Food is about the same to me--Nasty!!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed at the new found energy and alertness you experience, and say goodbye to colds as long as you&#x27;re on this stuff.      </li>
            <li>mix with fresh Pineapple, mango,bananna, non fat plain yogurt,</li>
            <li>Green Vibrance helps supplement my diet in all the right ways.</li>
            <li>first I thought this might have to do with me smoking one and a half pack of cigarette and drinking a lot of wine the night before, but I&#x27;ve been doing that since college.</li>
            <li>I was socially mortified!  </li>
            <li>I just drink it quickly to get past the taste.</li>
            <li>If I drink my Green Vibrance early in the day I feel like I have ingested a bushel of fresh, green veggies vibrant with life!</li>
            <li>I usually mix it with water and tank it quickly as the taste is an acquired one.</li>
            <li>As for the other comments about increase energy and all that, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>All without bringing any relief or improvement other than very marginal.</li>
            <li>intend to live a long time!</li>
            <li>Just toss in a blender with a few ounces of water and chug it down with your nose closed while having a strong chaser at the ready.</li>
            <li>There is no substitute for fresh, raw veggies and fruit juices</li>
            <li>I make kefir from fresh raw milk</li>
            <li>I travel far too much and always take Green Vibrance with me.</li>
            <li>I am doing this in hope of helping others as desperate as I am (hopefully was) to find a whole food based supplement, that would compliment my healthy diet and allow me to once again have energy and a feeling of wellness.</li>
            <li>If I get another 10.1 jar it will go back, so far the last 2 deliveries have been the newer version.  </li>
            <li>they sell the 30 day supply at a local health food place near me for the same price, so this price for 60 days just can&#x27;t be beat....  </li>
            <li>then I heard about this product from social networks</li>
            <li>and I only take on days that I don&#x27;t have time to make a fresh green drink.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the Trader Joe&#x27;s green powder has the same effect on me (tried it after GV), just not as pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I drink one scoop a day in milk and add a few drops of stevia, and now I can truthfully say that after just a few days I already feel healthier.</li>
            <li>They are the only manufacturer that actually, and very clearly, lists each and every ingredient with the individual dosage or amount for each ingredient on their label.</li>
            <li>I had made no other changes in my diet nor were there any outside factors affecting me.  </li>
            <li>I mix mine with a little appke juice and drink first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>So, I would try it and buy the small size first, then if you like, buy in bulk, because it will be cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I am not very old - early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It would be very hard and maybe even more expensive to juice so many fruits and veggies every day, along with adding probiotics.  </li>
            <li>Many reviewers have complained about receiving older versions in the past.  </li>
            <li>And the excitement over the new one lasts about as long as it did with the last one.    </li>
            <li>Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after.  </li>
            <li>If you want to make it taste better just add a teaspoon of Y.S. Organic Bee Farm raw organic honey which you can purchase here on Amazon for a little over $12 in a 2lb glass jar.  </li>
            <li>Medical experts tell us that we need to reduce the acidity in our diets and increase the alkaline levels, a factor in improving general health.</li>
            <li>To me there are other similar product that don&#x27;t cost as much that do just as well.</li>
            <li>All and All, I continue to see myself using this product as long as its developed.  </li>
            <li>I will never stop taking this product as long as I am alive.</li>
            <li>So apparently I had some internal digestive issues which was causing my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>so far I have came a long way</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, I tried to mix it in a green smoothie</li>
            <li>I AM TRYING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first canister of Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li>The first few days, I wondered if it was just a placebo effect sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>I held my nose the first few times but after a week I started craving it, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>At first had trouble drinking it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, it smells gross, it tastes worse and it won&#x27;t do anyone a bit of good if it stays in the container</li>
            <li>I tried plugging my nose and swiging it down as fast as I could....</li>
            <li>My heart and kidneys were very close to shutting down as I had a strep</li>
            <li>I am in Chemo treatment and it was really getting me down.</li>
            <li>Not sure if there is new growth, or just more luxurious and thick.</li>
            <li>It is recommended to take this product 30 minuted after a major meal because Green Vibrance assists the body with absorbing nutrients from the food one consumes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of money on internists and rheumatologists throughout my adult life, and none of them have ever been able to find anything wrong with me.</li>
            <li>I am an over 50&#x27;s lady who goes to give blood every other month since my Dr. said my iron was too high.  </li>
            <li>and I believe this is due to the high amount of probiotics included in every serving.</li>
            <li>After finishing nearly the whole bottle I noticed a small label on the side.</li>
            <li>your objective is to increase performance strength look elsewhere unless your objective is to drop weight and detox your body before engaging in serious workouts with an alternative product.</li>
            <li>Have been using Green Vibrance for years and really notice the effects on my general health when I run out.</li>
            <li>We were interested in an alkalanizing green drink product and found this at our local health food store on a shelf \\&quot;recommended by Dr. Oz\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Unicity and green vibrance saved me from low immunine system problems ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have, the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green, nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had.</li>
            <li>the poor taste is easily offset by the benefits of the product.</li>
            <li>;) and have been trying a couple different green drink products.</li>
            <li>This must have a decent amount of potassium perhaps as it seems to have benefited me physically (along with other things I&#x27;ll confess).</li>
            <li>After trying a couple of other \\&quot;Greens\\&quot; formulas, I came back to Vibrant Health.</li>
            <li>I am an internist (MD) who happens to believe in nutritional supplementation and the positive effects of \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; measures to combat everyday ills--i.e.</li>
            <li>I take supplements as well, but this product started to have a positive effect on my health in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the larger Green Vibrance, which is a better deal.  </li>
            <li>I have been using pretty consistently for a few weeks now, but there seemed to be quite a bit of hype with this product that I am not sure of.  </li>
            <li>Although Green Vibrance is a bit pricier than other supergreen products, my mom said the taste is the most tolerable among other brands that she has tried.</li>
            <li>And, I quit taking my high dose vitamin D supplement, as well as various other supplements, because this covers them too.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better if you start with less and slowly build up to the suggested amount.</li>
            <li>I was very loyal to Vitaforce, but I&#x27;ve decided to make a switch to Green Vibrance for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>I think it would be impossible to consume ALL the fine healthy ingredients in this product on a daily basis any other way!!</li>
            <li>Sorry, I really wanted to love this product; have taken other liquid greens and can take a lot of stuff, but not this; but they refunded money so no problem!</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s cheap insurance - certainly not harmful in any way, and the small amount of nutrition in each scoop only can help.</li>
            <li>Not only does this include a long list of standard vitamins and nutrients, but it also contains a WIDE variety of probiotics, Spirulina, Chlorella, Organic Kelp, Organic Flaxseed concentrate, Ginger root, and a whole host of plant-based antioxidants and adaptogens.</li>
            <li>Hundreds of \\&quot;Verified Buyers\\&quot; got positive results from GREEN VIBRANCE that they could actually feel, then posted their reviews here.</li>
            <li>and so made a lot of positive changes in my life, and taking Green Vibrance regularly was one of those changes.  </li>
            <li>but this is a little much.</li>
            <li>Could not even hide the taste of new mowed lawn in other foods or drinks.</li>
            <li>Vibrant Health also informed me they don&#x27;t directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance!  </li>
            <li>of that being said I will probably use this product again in the future and would reccomend it to those with special diets who may be missing out on some key vitamins and minerals due to dietary deficiency, especially those who follow a vegan diet.</li>
            <li>One word of caution.. in people undergoing chemotherapy who are neutropenic (i.e. extremely low white blood cell count--under 1000) the pro-biotics can potentially be harmful (i.e. even the good bacteria can be bad under these condtions).  </li>
            <li>I have been taking Green Vibrance for only a few months, and thought I was doing my body a huge favor.</li>

            <li> Good luck with this one fellow consumers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I feel any difference, but it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m getting my veggies and fruits.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> But good god, this tastes like vomit.</li>
            <li> I assume this is from the fiber, and detox effects of having so much good stuff in your body.</li>
            <li> Does not taste good, but that&#x27;s not why you take your greens,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat animal products and I&#x27;m in really good health.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> I feel good taking it.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good for me...</li>
            <li> The taste is not so good</li>
            <li> good price here too.</li>
            <li> The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1.</li>
            <li> It helps your skin and hair, your joints and it also makes you feel good inside.  </li>
            <li> Im good to go.  </li>
            <li> but the thought of all the good</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others and feel it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Tastes good.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s good for the body.  </li>
            <li> and some people even said it tastes good...</li>
            <li> I still take fish oil, CoQ10, and vitamin D along with a good diet</li>
            <li> health wise.</li>
            <li> We feels good</li>
            <li> Took me over 2 weeks to start to feel good again.</li>
            <li> and so you think it is really good for you?</li>
            <li> are a good indicator of soil health.</li>
            <li> bought the frozen berries from Costco and by adding water or coconut milk and banana making tasty shakes which taste good</li>
            <li> Soooooo good, you cannot taste the &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; flavor at all.</li>
            <li> and I get all the good stuff.</li>
            <li> Clearly a good impact on my digestive system and</li>
            <li> and it is LOADED with all kinds of good stuff:  probiotics, vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, digestive support, antioxidants, etc.  </li>
            <li> The superfood also makes me feed good and &amp;</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for years with good results until I read</li>
            <li> Good health to everyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep it in the freezer for optimum freshness.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers get around the \\&quot;what&#x27;s hot\\&quot; thing by throwing in the kitchen sink -- every herb that sounds good goes in the pot.    </li>
            <li> I know it is doing something good for me</li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> I mix it in V-8 juice &amp; it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> The 15 travel packets are good to use if you travel a lot.</li>
            <li> I mix it with ground flax seed and water for a good start to the day.</li>
            <li> Good family size and good for improving bowel function.</li>
            <li> It tastes good (to me).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and you should try it.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would have something that would define what every ingredient is good for.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product , its a great product , after searching the internet  found that Amazon had the best price ,so I&#x27;ve been ordering from themon a regular basis  ....</li>
            <li> If u dont get a good amount of greens &amp; or probotics in your diet</li>
            <li> you might find the taste not as good as others.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste good bur</li>
            <li> Feel its a good product line and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Good price at Amazon..</li>

            <li> I will warn you, you will get a lot of attention from people at work asking why you&#x27;re drinking what they call \\&quot;pond water\\&quot; which leads to a great conversation on the healthy benefits of greens.</li>

            <li> It would be nice if it could be all organic.</li>
            <li> You can make up your own mind.  </li>
            <li> The taste is good and the health benefits are outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love gteen vibrance, feel like Im doing somthing good for myseld every time I use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, use at your own risk...</li>
            <li> I like to take matters in my own hand and take charge of the situation.</li>
            <li> its really dissolved - room temperature water works best for me.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve already convinced a couple co-workers who have ordered their own, and now I am taking it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> While they appear to be doing good work, a healthy skepticism is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps me healthy and feeling good.</li>
            <li> In terms of nutrition, this company has really put their heart and soul into creating a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> I am 57 and truly feel as good or better</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of product you take just once.  </li>
            <li> But even if I had to drink it on its own, I would just for the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was doing over 60 push-ups for warm ups at 160 lbs.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need to maintain good health, along with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company but they refuted the claim and wrote me a lengthy letter explaining the science of their own testing and pointing the finger at consumerlab .</li>
            <li> You need to take charge of your own health.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and extremely reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at work and it gives me a nice boost of energy before my morning</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t acute in toxicity.</li>
            <li> coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Blended all up with any kind of juice I have</li>
            <li> Therefore, I seldom take medications of any kind</li>
            <li> know there are some people who will knock this product because of the taste, but to be honest-</li>
            <li> But who cares when you can get so many good things into your body?</li>
            <li> What kind of price can you put on your health?&lt;br /</li>
            <li> For those of you concerned about it, go to this site and read for yourself, do your own research.  </li>
            <li> Use your own judgement after reading this.</li>
            <li> The taste kind of reminds me of the smell of a farm</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> Cheap is cheap - pay for the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was VERY leery about trying this product, BUT, to my surprise, it is the best tasting drink on the market.</li>
            <li> I mix it in O.J. &amp; it kind of grows on you after awhile.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of powdered and chewable supplements over the years and Vibrant Health products are, in my opinion, the best.</li>
            <li> The taste is more mild on this product than Perfect food, so people who are more picky about taste would like this.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, the best in its class-by my limited research.</li>
            <li> I add it to some warm water with a few drops of lemon juice each morning, and it&#x27;s delicious and wakes me up and makes me feel good!</li>
            <li> Happy so far and great price</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t drink this because I love the taste</li>
            <li> But, this is so much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> It works okay.</li>
            <li> and I have more energy</li>
            <li> I recommend this product many times to my patients with life limiting illnesses.</li>
            <li> please note, this is not a \\&quot; magic</li>
            <li> I checked the nutritional profile, and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Felt happier with better outlook.  </li>
            <li> Sharper at work with better memory, attention, and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am getting more things done at home and at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE TASTE - ok</li>
            <li> and I had planned on taking this twice a day until I felt really healthy again.  </li>
            <li> THE TASTE - ok</li>

            <li> , I buy this one for the probiotics which I need more than anything.</li>
            <li> The taste is ok compared to others.  </li>
            <li> &quot; bemoan the fact that most MD&#x27;s are pharmaceutical pushers who are lapdogs for the drug companies while the \\&quot;practitioners\\&quot; preaching this are trying to sell something (to line their pockets)...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never felt better.  </li>
            <li> I feel better about myself when I take this product.  </li>

            <li> Now it does not bother me and I feel better since taking it.</li>
            <li> I do feel more energetic when I drink it however.</li>
            <li> IT CONTAINS SO MANY VITAMINS AND NUTRIENTS.</li>

            <li> I love all if the health benefits I get with one scoop.</li>
            <li> As for energy, I can&#x27;t say I experienced an incredible burst of energy using this product because I am in general pretty energetic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel like I just grazed in the hay field. :)</li>
            <li> and it is ok-</li>
            <li> after all this time i can tell u that my gastrointestinal tract feels so much better (but be warned-</li>
            <li> i have been the butt of many jokes by friends and family, and</li>
            <li> I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love that there&#x27;s a built in probiotic.</li>
            <li> The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, just my taste buds have gotten more used to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Joint pains are better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for what it has done to improve my digestive system</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and my husband would not juice despite the fact that it made him feel better</li>
            <li> But when bought in this larger size, it is the best deal for the quality.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and tell all my friends and family about it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It contains many important items and all in one powder!</li>
            <li> Most want to continue taking it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure</li>
            <li> I have more energy and feel 100% better.</li>
            <li> My friei and family love it too.</li>
            <li> Then chase it with more water.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking that a blender might make it more homogeneous when blended with fruit and/or veggies.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I listened to him.  </li>
            <li> what I love is the company replies because they keep improving and refining.  </li>
            <li> The benefits outweigh the taste though :)</li>
            <li> I wake up feeling energetic and alert</li>
            <li> And if you dig deeper, with more searches, you&#x27;ll find much more.</li>
            <li> It helps me feel better</li>
            <li> I just love it and look forward to it every morning.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Tried mixing in vegetable juice, its was just too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I feel better and know I&#x27;m healthier after taking this.  </li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I gave up vegetarianism and have had to boil most veggies to mush just to get them in me without health issues.  </li>
            <li> makes me feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I am like so many others who are making attempts at eating healthier.</li>
            <li> I was able do things I never could do before.)....</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is day two for me.  </li>
            <li> It says on the container to mix with your favorite drink.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine this tasting ok in &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; - mind</li>
            <li> Today I thought I would adventurous.  </li>
            <li> I feel better and plan to continue using the product.</li>
            <li> First the delivery speed was amazing from this seller!</li>
            <li> but I do feel more energized.</li>
            <li> The particles of this mix tend to stay suspended more</li>
            <li> so I just tend to get more of the mix</li>
            <li> I also think my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I feel more energized and healthier.</li>
            <li> so I can feel confident they are getting healthy greens into their diet.</li>
            <li> : Ok, so there is a lot of name-calling over this incident and the ConsumerLab finding this has elevated arsenic levels.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot more nutrients 120 compared to the 73 in this product plus it has Moringa and 23g of protein in it.  </li>
            <li> I really love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Still, because of the buzz, anything with herbs is considered by most people to be better than anything without herbs.</li>
            <li> My Dr. said I needed more greens in my diet.</li>
            <li> And this is how i get them tho be heart healthy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot more energy in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I just love knowing this is a part of my diet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The price is much more feasible for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, make sure that you can take this if you are on meds.</li>
            <li> In the store the item costs almost $30 more.</li>
            <li> We love that it is organic</li>
            <li> and we can be sure we are not getting more chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 months, I was and still am pain free!  </li>
            <li> There have been many who have stated that they can feel it working within minutes.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> My stomach has been feeling better since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say my wrinkles disappeared, or that I have the energy of my twenty&#x27;s, but nutrition isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li> IT SAYS &amp; MORE</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what healthy is supposed to taste like :)</li>
            <li> my nails and it just makes me feel better ALL day.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare this to, but my roommate and I both use this powder and love it.</li>
            <li> This product gives me more energy and seems to help keep me \\&quot;regular\\&quot; as well.  </li>
            <li> The price for this item is around $90 in most health food stores so buying it on Amazon is the way to go.</li>
            <li> And to top it all off this</li>
            <li> the taste is okay.</li>
            <li> Until they can prove their product is safe I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> Listen to your doctor but do not rely on a magic pill to do all the work for you.  </li>
            <li> You must change your diet and make healthy choices in order for this product to work more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> and it makes me want to eat healthier and get the appropriate water intake in each day.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I tried Athletic Greens because of Tim Ferris&#x27; book, &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li> lends me trust them more than others.</li>
            <li> Take it with your favorite juice, a lil lime-aid with water and a scoop or two will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many doctors and been in so many emergency rooms...</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> In seawater, there are 2 to 5 ppb, which accounts for the fact that many seafoods have more arsenic than the FDA limits (2.6 ppm) allow: mollusks, crustacea – prawns and shrimp – fish, fish roe, cod liver oil, herring, even freshwater fish, and most sea animals and plants.</li>
            <li> A Ladyfriend of mine talked me into trying this,and I am glad i did.</li>
            <li> I love drinking this every morning.  </li>
            <li> The amount of ingredients and nutrients is phenomenal and it gives me a lot of energy.  </li>
            <li> he swears it makes him feel better..</li>
            <li> and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I use this instead of the famous workout video brands.  </li>
            <li> It might need some more protein if you are looking to bulk.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> FOR A MUCH MORE inexpensive  PRICE THAN</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 2 because it does help with regularity but many, more affordable products help as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to ingest   is by way of a organic smoothie.</li>
            <li> I have much more stamina.</li>
            <li> Please do research, the more you do</li>
            <li> and I can say truthfully that I FELT HEALTHIER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it and love what it does for me.</li>
            <li> I feel much better on the days I use it - more energy and better sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Much more value for your money.</li>
            <li> Im glad i did..</li>
            <li> When I see the HDL and LDL counts it will give me a better idea if the product is performing the way I expect it to.</li>
            <li> I feel more energetic, and my digestion seems to be improved.</li>
            <li> We put this stuff in so many things.  </li>
            <li> I love getting the kids</li>
            <li> I have more energy</li>
            <li> I plan on buying this for the rest of my life which should be about 46 more years:)</li>
            <li> Wish I had stock in the company because I have turned on so many people to this product now....</li>
            <li> and he was able to stop his Coke/Pepsi soda addiction.</li>
            <li> Best mixed with &amp;#34;Simply Orange&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I feel better, everything seems to be working better.</li>
            <li> I have just been doing it for over a week and love it.</li>
            <li> He was telling me how there were so many nutritious greens and how healthy it was.  </li>
            <li> am pleased to report that I no longer have breakouts.  </li>
            <li> SILICA is just a type of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; and is mostly used to give weight to the product being sold.</li>
            <li> If you can find another product that is better than buy it.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with this product as soon as I was introduced to it.</li>
            <li> It tastes better than VG</li>
            <li> as well (more earthy than swampy).</li>
            <li> On the instructions is recommends adding to your favorite beverage.</li>
            <li> I have even stopped drinking more then one cup of joe, and I even forget until the afternoon sometimes.</li>
            <li> better than coffee</li>
            <li> And the price is better than anything out there.</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars except for the flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to find a more well-rounded, nutritious vitamin or supplement out there.  </li>
            <li> my many stomach woes continued.  </li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> I received the latest version, 13.0.</li>
            <li> I mix it all in a glass (milk, protein powder, and G.V), but if you have a blender or a shaker, that would probably work even better.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, literally changed my health.  </li>
            <li> and I feel much better.  </li>
            <li> It really is just a great product.  </li>
            <li> Maximum Vibrance is even better</li>
            <li> I am sure it is doing more for me that I ever will know.</li>
            <li> With this I feel better</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> On Sept 24th after a biopsy was taken I found out that I am cancer free!</li>
            <li> Get creative and share the word!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know it has many probiotics, as does all ferminted foods.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I believed them.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but my body eventually grew a tolerance to most</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taste is ok in juice or fruit drink.</li>
            <li> It is best mixed with your favorite juice or sports drink.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll pay way more in the stores too, so ordering here is a must.</li>
            <li> Love the subscribe and save option for this.</li>
            <li> I do not have to take stool softener any more.</li>

            <li> and i feel more energetic.  </li>
            <li> snack on roasted seaweed all the time and love it</li>
            <li> If it did, I was prepared to try the many recipes others were suggesting below.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> but even if you think it is, it&#x27;s better than being in the hospital</li>
            <li> if you can stand the taste, you will benefit in so many ways.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel a lot better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Much better with almond milk.</li>

            <li> The $$ is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I most often take it this way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take it every day any more, but I went through 2 containers of it</li>
            <li> I like the idea of getting more greens in my diet--</li>
            <li> so I exposed myself to my girlfriend in more than a couple ways (use your imagination).</li>
            <li> and I feel healthy because I&#x27;m having my greens.</li>

            <li> I believe that this has helped us all stay healthy through the flu season and is also helping to regulate my weight.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.</li>
            <li> This product might be healthy but what a taste?!&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> would expect some better quality/taste for this price!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> This should not be more than $20...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting the most explosive diarrhea I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had M.S. for yrs &amp; feel poorly more than I feel well.</li>
            <li> Within 1-2 days I noticed more energy and have been feeling better since.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the taste, but honestly it magically became more of just a neutral taste</li>
            <li> and I feel more engeritic throughout the day drinking it.</li>
            <li> best mixed in Silk Mango and Strawberry or Banana fruit drink that you can buy from Wal-Mart and have even started putting it in my coffee when I run out of that product!  </li>
            <li> , i feel so much better since i have been taking it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if container damaged before or during shipping, but product itself sealed &amp; ok, no air exposure or spillage.</li>
            <li> but I hope their subscription is not misleading people to think that we are buying through Amazon for better price</li>
            <li> feel better when I use it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to blend into smoothies, and easy to drink...not like some greens.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was safe for pregnant women, but it probably would&#x27;ve help with the lack of energy I experienced.</li>
            <li> I try in many ways to be very healthy and this is such a great additional to my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a clean, non-stimulating kind of energy, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> My wife particularly likes to mix it with coconut milk or almond milk, both are great.  </li>
            <li> nice energy and clean feel.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that Vibrant Health has put out.</li>
            <li> Great product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> All around great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> they will never experience the amazing benefits of this product, because it wasn&#x27;t all sweet and yummy like a fruit smoothie.</li>
            <li> their levels would probably be higher than anyone could imagine, yet they achieved supremely good health.</li>
            <li> but it tastes pretty good...</li>
            <li> This is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty good when it comes to food</li>
            <li> but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> In an ideal world, we would all grow, or buy, all our own food locally in tested, organically rich soil.</li>
            <li> I have a strong healthy immune system.</li>
            <li> It mixes easily and is a bit of love in a glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (can cope with work more easily, sleep</li>
            <li> Motions are better and most importantly my body has started craving fruits &amp; veggies.</li>
            <li> Important to me is fresh and no fillers, good balance.  </li>
            <li> luck, it&#x27;s worth a try and many great organic whole food ingredients!</li>
            <li> Ok, fine....</li>
            <li> Yes, this costs a bit more, but not so much more that it doesn&#x27;t make it totally worth it, in quality and taste!</li>
            <li> good ole protein and smart eating.</li>
            <li> This plus Amazing Grass Wheatgrass is a powerful punch to get the day started.</li>
            <li> I am a college football player with no time, a huge appetite and a love for school and lifting weights.</li>
            <li> And I do love the free shipping.</li>
            <li> It left my delicious green smoothie not so delicious.</li>
            <li> So far seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely incredible and is, essentially, a pharmaceutical grade phyto-nutrient/herbal/vitamin/mineral supplement that works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Mostly organic and full ingredient disclosure makes it even better.</li>
            <li> While I tend to be Vegan, I still feel much more comfortable with going with something to supplement my morning nutritional start.</li>
            <li> , this is the ideal way to get your daily dose.  </li>
            <li> Health is more important than taste in my life.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it with my Body and Brain Fitness clients as part of a rejuvenation drink we have developed.</li>

            <li> Way too many minerals in there for me to handle comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Really helps digestion and works as a good snack substitution.</li>

            <li> Extremely easy to make</li>
            <li> I found I wasn&#x27;t using others I&#x27;ve bought because the taste was too strong.</li>
            <li> It does not taste good, particularly if you let it sit.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still going strong.  </li>
            <li> On the flipside, if you are taking antibiotics (and are not neutropenic) then I would highly recommend taking this because it is a good way to protect colon health and prevent Clostridium Difficile (\\&quot;C diff.\\&quot;) colitis.  </li>
            <li> Flavor wise, this is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it was worth the extra money, because it is the best powdered Greens available.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, I purchase it regularly and am completely satisfied with the results I receive each and every time that I order this great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous others (the 2nd best for me was Boku Super-food) that were good as well.</li>
            <li> It is best to mix this with something other than water unless you enjoy the taste.</li>
            <li> It is true that our immune system got better.</li>
            <li> I truely feel so much better.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it isn&#x27;t very tasty!</li>
            <li> We worked our way up to a full scoop and now we&#x27;re enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> After the first purchase, I liked it</li>
            <li> How many times have you read an article about the health benefits of a particular vegetable, herb, root, like say, astragalus and thought thats nice</li>
            <li> I could immediately tell that this product gives me more energy and more vibrant health!!  </li>
            <li> It certainly has more nutritious value than the one I had been using , however the taste is aweful !</li>
            <li> I need a lot of iron so that is fine with me, but the \\&quot;version\\&quot; I got also has 1000 IU of vitamin D per serving.  </li>
            <li> Tastes fine that way.  </li>
            <li> Tastes fine that way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more regular, my body is detoxing, this stuff is just amazing!  </li>
            <li> , it makes it this important task easy</li>
            <li> I mix it with juices and it tastes fine.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> i recommended to are fine, and by the way all of our jars do NOT have the label saying something about child birth defects or cancer known to the state of california</li>
            <li> i believe, basically you should be fine and this is one HELL of an elixir.</li>
            <li> Looks like pond water but tastes just fine.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks much better, I have a lot of more energy, and my colon thanks me every day!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m staying super healthy this way.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with orange juice and drink it quickly!</li>
            <li> and I did start to feel better quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ruin a good glass of juice by mixing in this stuff, so I just mix a scoop in about 1/3 cup of water and glug it down, followed by a glass of good water.</li>
            <li> I WILL SAY RIGHT NOW THAT THE TEXTURE AND TASTE OF THE POWDER IS PRETTY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers the best deal on this product by far!</li>
            <li> The taste is fine - didn&#x27;t expect it to taste &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; since it is free of additives like sugar.</li>
            <li> The taste gets better after the first couple of days!</li>
            <li> Mix it up, makes 2 large morning smoothies and really tastes great.</li>
            <li> This is a huge difference.   </li>
            <li> The Amazon price is a huge savings vs the on-line or health food store</li>
            <li> It makes a HUGE difference in my day.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to feel a HUGE boost of energy</li>
            <li> Give you an A+ rating in the way you accurately depicted and advertised this product.  </li>
            <li> ALL INGREDIENTS ARE LISTED, THATS IMPORTANT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I came across this product here on Amazon and it had such great reviews</li>
            <li> i got accustomed to it and actually enjoy the taste now.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I came across Green Viberance and, impressed by the glowing reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> but without precise measurements of each).  </li>
            <li> You have to pay for the detailed report, which I also read.</li>
            <li> :) I think it&#x27;s worth the money knowing I&#x27;m putting something in my body</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of servings of a greens powder I picked up at on a whim and having great results I decided to make a greens supplement a regular part of my diet.  </li>
            <li> I definitely feel great after my morning \\&quot;Vibrance\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> My husband makes fun of me though, and he has no problem with it, so I guess everyone wouldn&#x27;t agree with me on that one:)</li>
            <li> I always search for the most economical places to buy supplements because we use a  lot of them</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know,</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is excellent for detoxfying your system.</li>
            <li> One of the best green foods I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly the best Green Powder I&#x27;ve found to date.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the icing on the cake, not the cake, so make sure to get your fresh veggies.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It definitely has aton of great ingredients.</li>
            <li> Go on get some, its the best of the green supplements I could find.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t exactly taste great but when mixed in with a smoothie it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Great supplement to boost your overall health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such great health benfits:</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and I actually think it taste great now.  </li>
            <li> and I tried everything for my acne), and my hair and nails are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and it works just as great for me and has the same affects on helping to keep my blood pressure lowered.</li>
            <li> I encourage others to read the company&#x27;s detailed response</li>
            <li> But Green Vibrance just makes me feel great!     </li>
            <li> Why is this important, you ask?...</li>
            <li> it’s primarily organic form.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my digestion going smooth</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the product I was just thrown off with the difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> my face was smooth as a babies</li>
            <li> (I actually enjoy drinking this every morning now.)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t buy this stuff to enjoy sipping it.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance also produces a delicious meal-replacement bar</li>
            <li> Especially after reading a lot of great reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I have been on a light dose of a drug called Plaquenil for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> I use scent free soap, pee after sex, take a cranberry supplement, eat tons of yogurt, drink tons of water, the doctor has even prescribed a prophylactic antibiotic to take after sex.</li>
            <li> This is the best green powder I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I take it daily.</li>
            <li> And since I have recently begun a vegetarian lifestyle, it will be a great benefit to me.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that gives you energy and the essential minerals and vitamins.</li>
            <li> I mix it into almond or coconut milk with a sugar free protein powder(I like</li>
            <li> I use a crystal light or mio mix to water which covers any chalky taste</li>
            <li> There were a couple of others I liked as much</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the Best Veg/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that my skin and hair look great when I&#x27;ve been taking this regularly.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several months now and she feels great and loves drinking this once a day.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy to take it daily and has even recommended it to her friends.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product from a fantastic company.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t enjoy my weekly shot, either.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for such a great product!Can&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> this cheap anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now, great product!!!</li>
            <li> Even my 8 year old picky eater said it tasted good after he got over the fact that Mommy&#x27;s&#x27; strawberry smoothie was greenish-gray.  </li>
            <li> Even my 8 year old picky eater said it tasted good after he got over the fact that Mommy&#x27;s&#x27; strawberry smoothie was greenish-gray.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be delicious, but man, really have to chug this as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> The stuff I take is far superior</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not vegan, but seeing a good natural source of vitamin D was great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> As a natural prebiotic, the inulin contained in Fiber On The Go nourishes good bacteria in the digestive tract.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Which brings up another point, I keep this in the freezer since it states on the packaging to keep it in fridge for good results and freezer for better results, I think in terms of the probiotics lasting longer, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very high-quality product with only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> and now I really feel better More focus,</li>
            <li> There are so many good foods in this product; more then any other of the greens I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt better, stronger, healthier or more wise with any other consumable product.</li>
            <li> I like it best with plain ol&#x27; filtered water (8 oz.)—I just fill a shaker bottle up to the 8 oz.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see results right away, you feel better and your digestive system will thank you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wake and feel like a million dollars!!!</li>
            <li> The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers, a safe form of lecithin, and no soy lecithin!!  </li>
            <li> Its very fresh smelling, and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to others working out, need a boost or just trying to be healthy and feel better.  </li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is an excellent product, priced nicely (compare it to the overpriced Athletic Greens), and with full disclosure label (no proprietary blend nonsense).</li>
            <li> It does not taste very good mixed with water, but it is way better mixed with your favorite juice.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> but I like it better first thing.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can tell when I&#x27;m on caffeine.</li>
            <li> I tend to eat pretty healthy though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a significant boost in energy</li>
            <li> I was so excited about trying this</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the directions says \\&quot;Best taken 30-45 minutes after eating.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Worth it though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue taking this product and update my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also significant improvement with digestion.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment!</li>
            <li> -- I had the familiar and unmistakable symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have become more consistent w/</li>
            <li> Just finished my first month supply and am buying two more months.  </li>
            <li> This product significantly boosted my immune system.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Having been a \\&quot;health-nut\\&quot; since I was 15 years old (I am 51 now) and having tried a lot of products, I must say that this one is on the very top of my list.  </li>
            <li> Usually get the best price for it here too.</li>
            <li> and everyone I know has noticed that my face has cleared up significantly in the two months</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too sure about this at first</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived this morning.</li>

            <li> I drink it because of all the health benefits, but the taste is not that great, but I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to drink it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I was really excited because it&#x27;s loaded with nutrients and probiotics.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m willing to pay more for it.</li>
            <li> I was on this product for a long time and felt great-</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> However, the effects make the taste well worth it!</li>
            <li> first of all….i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the possibility of loosing caffein, but not going to happen with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I spent many hours trying to find a better choice than the Amazing Grass GreenSuperFood I was using before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be grassy, but this one is a very fine powder and it incorporates very well in juice, which helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t great, but easily masked in a smoothie with berries and other greens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rarely allergic to anything, but it&#x27;s not that surprising that I did have slight flushing and itchiness considering the amount of unique ingredients in it, many of which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve never ingested before.</li>
            <li> I bought this drink more than excited after all the positive reviews that it had received.  </li>
            <li> I love this products and love this type of natural energy.</li>
            <li> hope the probiotics are real, because the evidence indicates that may be the most important</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good, but we just mix it with flavored powders (like Crystal Light) and then it becomes tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a great supplement to a healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> on the positive side of things - it appears to be packed with nutrients :)</li>
            <li> I have seen many positive benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different \\&quot;green drinks\\&quot; and this one is the best tasting and has the best organic products than any other.  </li>
            <li> This is the best green powder on the market right now for the price.</li>
            <li> Vitamin D in large doses can be toxic and I had planned on taking this twice a day until I felt really healthy again.  </li>
            <li> Even the kids drink it right up!</li>
            <li> Great taste, feels alive and vibrant, just like the name.</li>
            <li> , I feel wonderful and even though I&#x27;m 54, I run circles around the younger agents at the major airline</li>
            <li> just read the lab reports form consumerlab.com, this product has very high arsenic, including most toxic form (inorganic).</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I have lost weight on it or had a ton more energy, but I certainly have felt good since starting it two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is an organic and whole food product that is high quality and helps to keep us in good health.</li>
            <li> After my first try, it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again.  </li>
            <li> me, I notice I generally feel better, and have more energy.</li>
            <li> This product, like most &amp;#34;green drinks&amp;#34; really help with your energy and health.  </li>
            <li> THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME ON A DAILY BASIS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really been more energized.  </li>
            <li> And still think that is true.     </li>
            <li> It eliminates having to take a fist full of vimimins and herbs.    </li>
            <li> I will continue to take this product since I know it&#x27;s good for my system but not on a daily basis</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> Product is power packed full of nutrients.</li>
            <li> This is overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the internet and found that Amazon had the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Regardless or not if its \\&quot;psychological\\&quot; it&#x27;s still a good feeling - especially internally.  </li>
            <li> I was waking up at 6 am every morning on time for class, jumping out of bed full of energy.</li>
            <li> If I am ready to read 10 books, I can  know more than him, atleast about my condition.</li>
            <li> Actually it would to be good to drink BEFORE eating as an appetite suppressant.  </li>
            <li> You can divide the mix up over the course of the day until you get in the full amount of mix.</li>
            <li> Onions are double whammy fructose and oral allergy wise.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference, I love it and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> take Athletic Greens, which is fantastic, pricey but worth it to me - a 1 month supply runs $100.</li>
            <li> This product says to use a full scoop.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I had to work our way up to a full scoop.  </li>
            <li> (  The one thing i thought i was doing good for myself is actually harming me.</li>
            <li> I have faith that it&#x27;s doing good things for my body, but I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not only getting a fair share of probotics</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper and is much better for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a very comprehensive vitamin and herbal powder, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> More importantly, it really works.  </li>
            <li> Well, I guess I just can&#x27;t say enough good over this product</li>
            <li> No BS proprietary blends that mask the product&#x27;s true ingredients</li>
            <li> it really has helped bring good nutrition and a feeling of wellness to my physical body, which in turn has made me mentally more relaxed and focused.  </li>
            <li> it is that it is chock full of vitamins and minerals you should get from eating your fruits and veggies as well as pre-biotics and pro-biotics.</li>
            <li> Not only is it really good for you and packed with vitamins....</li>
            <li> With this vegetable dring I get many nutrients in a form that can bypass the digestive system and go straight into my blood stream.  </li>
            <li> It helps with regular bowel movements and is good for constipation.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it in smoothies, juices, and even with just water and fresh lemon.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t stand the taste of the drink alone mix it with a sweet juice.</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have time to make some elaborate shake very morning.</li>
            <li> This takes only 30 seconds and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> people weren&#x27;t experiencing that until about a full week or two.</li>
            <li> Tried it with grape juice but did not care for the sweet.</li>
            <li> n not in the mood to complete my weekly workouts,so I started looking for some kind of booster n something that would benefit my health</li>
            <li> Love this in my smoothies so you can&#x27;t really taste it.</li>
            <li> But that wasnt a good enough reason for me to believe this stuff works.</li>
            <li> and it really does make me feel like I have more energy</li>
            <li> mixes well and isnt as much a dominent flavor as many others.</li>
            <li> If I were to go outside and eat the grass in my yard it wouldn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li> I keep a nalgene bottle full of it everywhere</li>
            <li> Yes, it may not taste like candy or anything, but it&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li> No bad  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it does throw off the taste of my morning smoothie.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad taste either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even taste the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; until I get to the bottom remnants in the glass, and even then it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> is not bad.</li>
            <li> taste is not bad</li>
            <li> I am pretty open to trying new things especially if it is good for my health...</li>
            <li> Having said that - its not the most pleasant tasting green food I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It does not replace a healthy diet for sure, but it adds alot without having to take many other items.</li>
            <li> It mixes pretty easily.</li>
            <li> PS, my research has shown that the best way to take these type of greens is in its most natural state - straight H2O &amp; on an empty stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, unless you have a PERFECT diet, never ever eat junk or fast food, and drink only highly purified water and lots of it, you need this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It does not look good but very easy to take and very little after taste.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making the product available, and delivering it quickly!</li>
            <li> 5 stars all the way and priced great compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It was great if you were making a smoothie but much too sweet if mixed with juices.  </li>
            <li> They review hundreds of products and welcome challenges to their testing when products don&#x27;t have the ingredients they claim, the amounts they claim or have other harmful ingredients that are not listed on the label.</li>
            <li> I found myself walking upright with great posture instead of slouched forward as I do normally due to lack of energy.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is full of so many good for you vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li> And the amount of awesome stuff (like the probiotics and organic foods) are enough to get me coming back to it despite the price.</li>
            <li> We noticed more energy and overall better health feeling.</li>
            <li> that although our ancestors smoked freely, they still led a much healthier life free from side effects of tobacco use...and the reason for this was their diet.</li>
            <li> I decided I was going to take a quick shot.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give quick feedback.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick nutrition and,</li>
            <li> After reading about the 7 super foods, I told my husband</li>
            <li> is always quick.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff and take it because several people I trust who know more than me and do this sort of scientific research for a living tell me that I&#x27;ll be glad I did it in 30 years.</li>
            <li> (Because my local store was out) and although I may have preferred the taste of Greens+, I felt like GV is a better, more holistic product.  </li>
            <li> After I started taking it, I was lucky to reach 35 push-ups.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, this drink gave me a tremendous amount of energy to do the task each day . . .</li>
            <li> I have never felt more confident in a healthcare product I consume on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Vitality Super Greens\\&quot; do not contain beets.  </li>
            <li> Knowing all the wonderful things in Green Vibrance makes the taste very bareable.</li>
            <li> but I am extraordinarily &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; and experience no digestive issues whatsoever</li>
            <li> I think it has improved my energy level tremendously.</li>
            <li> And it arrive so quickly.</li>
            <li> I am a very health conscious person and I take a variety of supplements; this is my favorite (although omega 3&#x27;s are also very important).</li>
            <li> I truly couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff any more highly.  </li>
            <li> P.S it lowered my high bllod pressure from about 160/100 to a stable 120/75 :)</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of taking the powder faithfully, I noticed I felt a little more energetic and my body responded more from the things I ate.</li>
            <li> At first, I almost regretted ingesting it because the taste isn&#x27;t pleasant and that alone almost made it come back up.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for many reasons overall health is the main thing a great way to get your greens it balances out your ph in a big way</li>
            <li> Also, I confirmed with their reps that all the vitamin content, including the Vitamin D3 (from Lichen) to Vitamin&#x27;s A, C, and K, are all from plant based sources, which means they are not \\&quot;lab produced\\&quot; and have higher bio-availability.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days the energy was normal more than a rush and the diarrhetic effect was not rushed any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my very first review at amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My levels are normal at this time and I feel energetic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very aware of my health.</li>
            <li> But take it daily for thirty days and you will be very pleased at how your health improves.</li>
            <li> Other than that, so far so good!!! ^.^</li>
            <li> and this is my very first review, which should speak for itself.</li>
            <li> would even go so far as to say that if you could only afford one product, this would be it as it has so many things that are good for your body.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great vitamin!</li>
            <li> This supplement product is wonderfull,the list of ingredient is endlessly amazing and the taste is not bad at all,the more liquid you mix it with the less you taste it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to any one who wants to live a healthy livestyle (I don&#x27;t even work out) and have energy!  </li>
            <li> I had bought this product originally at a Health Food Store and pretty quickly saw some health benefits.</li>
            <li> New Jersy adopted th more conservative 5 mcg limit.</li>
            <li> The company says they continually look for better ingredients and try to keep up to date with new research.</li>
            <li> I literally feel like a completely new, better person.</li>
            <li> We noticed that if we did the full scoop right away we were both a bit nauseous.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to be a loyal customer, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and dissolves fast.</li>
            <li> and overall it has pretty good reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mix and fast to drink.</li>
            <li> While AG does taste pretty good, the cost and marketing scheme left me underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> I joke with friends suggesting that I feel like a super hero when I drink my fresh juice smoothies addiing this powder to them.</li>
            <li> Its great im 52 and have a very active job.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Vibrant Health Green Vibrance from Amazon for many reasons; primary for rapidity and also good price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I sound over the top and ridiculous over my love for this product.</li>
            <li> We have used Green Vibrance in our smoothies for years and found this great price for this product on Amazon, so will continue to buy it on Amazon as long as their prices are this good.</li>
            <li> First time I added it to orange juice I almost puked and couldn&#x27;t take more than 2 sips, the second time I tried it with miso soup thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go better with its fishy tasting properties but no, cannot tolerate the smell or taste.</li>
            <li> The numbers that came back were stunning!</li>
            <li> Another search bought me up with an article on prevention.com claiming the product contains arsenic twice above the acceptable safe levels!  </li>
            <li> Consult YOUR doctor first!</li>
            <li> I could feel the effect after the first time trying this!  </li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> For the few ingredients that could have more, consumers know the exact amount and can choose to confidently supplement more of that ingredient, without over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t magically make you into a ball of energy or instantly make you healthy, but over time this product will contribute positively to your health and mood.  </li>
            <li> I wound up blending it with a little fruit and veggies, coconut milk, eggs, and whey protein for a great breakfast shake.    </li>
            <li> Eating healthy and getting enough greens in your busy daily routine isn&#x27;t easy, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Yet, I love it nonetheless, both for how I now feel and for how my large intestine has appreciated the probiotic resurgence.  </li>
            <li> This product is always fresh and filled with pure health benefits.</li>
            <li> If that is the case, try my favorite recipes that will most certainly turn heads at your next party or event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my oppinon this is by far the best green drink on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try Now Phytofood at some point, but Green Vibrance is really great for joint health.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is great.</li>
            <li> unadulterated ingredients, no secret blends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews about the taste which did concern me and but it taste great to me.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it comfortably than do it because it really does make a difference on how you look and feel in every aspect.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a great source of all of the plant-based vitamins, minerals, trace minerals and probiotics that you need.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING SUCH AN AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best green drink out there, IMHO.</li>
            <li> (green oatmeal-not a great color).</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews here for Green Vibrance, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> great source of sea vegetables, which are not easily available</li>
            <li> Sounds like a kid crying over eating veggies lol anyways</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly get this kind of nutrition from my food.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth.  </li>
            <li> The health benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a good mental \\&quot;carrot\\&quot; too.</li>
            <li> and this has by far the most effect for me.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that offers a pleasing taste, and adds more protein and fiber.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> As far as quality, this id fantastic!</li>
            <li> and  also  in my  fresh  juicing.  </li>
            <li> and it  wins  </li>
            <li> It will however change the taste, but the nutrition you get from this supplement will be worth it.     </li>
            <li> I make my own green smoothies at home, and actually love the taste.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t need to worry about making him fresh veggies every day either.  </li>
            <li> I almost choked on the price I paid for the product once I checked on Amazon, but her help in selecting a product was well worth</li>
            <li> but I have more than gotten use to the taste and actually now quite enjoy the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased so far with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in love with the results so far.</li>
            <li> it does smell like a fresh mowed lawn</li>
            <li> I take it every day in addition to eating lots of fresh vegetables.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The concentrated greens together with vanilla soy milk, and frozen berries packs a powerful nutritious punch.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> Then it happened, after years of trying to go off of my acne medications, I was finally able to go a week without breakouts and completely discontinued using them.  </li>
            <li> if it worked at all, it would be well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I recently went gluten free and removed most sugar and processed foods from my diet too.  </li>
            <li> Through-out the course of my lifetime, I&#x27;ve juiced (fresh vegetables, fresh fruits) with a juicer.</li>
            <li> I really do think it helps them behave better, and not crave so much junk since their body is getting what it needs.</li>
            <li> The potency, even though it has a wonderful profile, is poor.</li>
            <li> It kick starts my day with abundant energy and the need to eat smaller portions.</li>
            <li> you really think that this product could be sold for this many years without being pulled from the shelf if it really had inorganic arsenic?</li>
            <li> I continue to take it, much as I do vitamins, on the good faith that it&#x27;s beneficial for me, even though I feel no difference physically.</li>
            <li> This is some powerful nutrition.   </li>
            <li> The concentrated powerful nutrients are worth ever penny.  </li>
            <li> so I felt assured that this order was fresh.</li>
            <li> But than I guess what do you expect with something that&#x27;s all natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was sold and purchased my own tub on amazon and have been taking it religiously every morning (30 mins) after breakfast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;And to boot, they have full disclosure on the label, telling you exactly what you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li> this time, i started blending it with smoothies of fresh fruit and or vegetables.</li>
            <li> it is well worth</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even mask it with fresh fruit blended in to the green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and think this product is definatley worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The probiotics in this product make it incredibly useful to my sluggish gut.</li>
            <li> I was at Sprouts and had $300 dollars worth of supplements in my basket.  </li>
            <li> I camouflouge it with fresh fruit in a smoothie.  </li>
            <li> I have modified my diet to include only whole foods, tried gluten free, dairy free, no sugar and more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Forget saving a dime or two...not worth it.</li>
            <li> If this gives me energy and gets my body healthier then it is worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to lose weight and become more health conscious.</li>
            <li> I consider this the professional grade compared to the others because others worked ok, but nothing like this brand.</li>
            <li> I love the taste too, very fresh and green--slightly addictive!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff for you although like many other things that are good for you nutricionally the flavor sucks.</li>
            <li> They all taste pretty much the same (if they&#x27;re just greens, that is) but this delivers the most nutrients in a very convenient form,  The price is good, much better than what I&#x27;d pay locally.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is great for supplementing greens intake... it is easily dissolved into water which makes it easy to use daily.  </li>
            <li> It takes years of eating the right foods, and even then, you may not know anything is working - just that you feel good, and no real diseases or problems ( which can be attributed to eating right).</li>
            <li> As a meal replacement or a supplement to a smaller meal I feel full, satisfied and physically well as I consciously ingest probiotics, amino acids, spirulina and gobs more amazing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a healthy vegetarian, I eat alot of spinach and other healthy things.</li>
            <li> The best mix is when I blend it with other fruits and veggies and Greek Yogurt in the blender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to compensate with other ingredients, but found that simply not using it is what works best.</li>
            <li> and by day three I got a mild hot flash.</li>
            <li> This is one of the things that first attracted me to Vitality Super Greens, the vegetables are ferminted.  </li>
            <li> Tastes fine to me and helps to keep me healthy all year long.  </li>
            <li> Price is also good compared to other sites</li>
            <li> Other members of my family take it and feel it is good for their health.  </li>
            <li> here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;Arsenic is found everywhere on the Earth&#x27;s crust in fair sized amounts, comparable to other toxic metals, at about 5 ppm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of greens and none have proven as good as this.  </li>
            <li> but this gave me a spit this out right now feeling.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> It came right away.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Let me tell you right now, this is what you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m having some type of stomach cramp on the right side.</li>
            <li> I do not always eat right</li>
            <li> Drinking a glass in the morning helps me start my day off right.</li>
            <li> There is a &amp;#34;Version&amp;#34; listed right under the &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34; name.</li>
            <li> but nobody expects that, right?  </li>
            <li> This is a step in the right direction for anyone.</li>
            <li> and right after that I started to take &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Everyone should be on this since we don&#x27;t eat right as it is.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, it gives me energy.  </li>
            <li> if done right there wont be granules but its not going to take them away.</li>
            <li> After finding the right combination to mix with no problem.</li>
            <li> and I found that the usual Arsenic molecule found in water is way more acute in toxicity.</li>
            <li> The owner of the company actually grantees it, and you are able to see the ingredient list and a full transparent disclosure with no proprietary secrecy.</li>
            <li> I really have a strong stomach and drink all kinds of pure juices</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great product, specially if you are not eating your veggies every day.  </li>
            <li> Being able to get it from Amazon for much less is a fantastic bonus!</li>
            <li> You would think at 5 lbs less that I would be able to do more</li>
            <li> I feel much more energetic and in less pain as I am gradually weaned off steroids for acerbated asthma.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remain productive all day, desires to drop weight safely and is interested in detoxification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t have blood sugar problems, Green Vibrance may be as wonderful as many people claim, but I&#x27;ll just look for a green drink without all the added herb stuff.</li>
            <li> I have more energy, clarity of thoughts, and general over all</li>
            <li> I always take small amounts of the powder with me when travelling so my body gets great nutrition</li>
            <li> I have to say I feel a lot better after using this for a month, just a general improvement in health.</li>
            <li> I generally feel like I have more energy</li>
            <li> but it really was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I just drink it down, and then have something good to drink.  </li>
            <li> Once this stuff kicked in, I actually started feeling better and had energy for the first time in days!  </li>
            <li> From my perspective, I do like the consistency of this product better, as when I mix up Vitaforce it tends to sink to the bottom a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Mixed with water, a little yogurt and some frozen berries and this taste great!</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for years and have experienced positive results on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I chase 3 young children around, work full time, run/workout, and I&#x27;m never sick.</li>
            <li> Armed with the newly acquired enlightment, I set on to find a cure to my problems... and both my jungle and the guiding light being the internet.</li>
            <li> I live in a farm community and have no illusions that the food in today&#x27;s world is toxin free.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very good for people but go slowly!  </li>
            <li> To my amazement I notice after taking green vibrance, more energy, happier mood, and more alert.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the best ever...and they are constantly improving this product..therefore each time you purchase this</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has been overall the best for me.</li>
            <li> Of all various green powders, that I have tried, this one is by far the best one, it has given me a lot of energy and an overall good feeling of wellbeing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth way more than the regular stuff out there in potency value alone.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth trying especially my age group (60).  :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m really feeling great since I started taking Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the flavor (which I actually like), but if you mix it with your favorite juice, problem solved and it&#x27;s beyond worth it.  </li>
            <li> I only eat red meat one day per week, so its been a great subsitute for iron.</li>
            <li> There are good probiotics out there for half the price.</li>
            <li> I started taking the Green Vibrance and have noticed that I feel much better, having more energy.  </li>
            <li> I have improved my immunity against sinus infections and general sickness, my bowels are regulated, and have more consistent energy through out the day.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to my usual Amazing Grass Amazing Meal original flavor.</li>
            <li> All my main nutrients in one scoop!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great probuct, that I have been using daily for several years and at a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> Both enjoy/ed amazing health, vigor, and energy far beyond many people half their age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to mix and tastes good with just cold water and gives me a nutritious and energetic start to the day.</li>
            <li> the energy I get and the overall good feeling and mental clarity make it an easy choice to purchase.</li>
            <li> I use either organic, unsweetened coconut milk or almond milk, frozen fruit or fresh fruit, spice (cinnamon, cocoa, turmeric, maca powder, camu powder, you get the idea), a scoop of Plant Fusion (unflavored) protein powder and a sweetener like Pure LoHan (monk fruit) and blitz it up with ice in my Bullet.  </li>
            <li> I was feeling a more positive attitude in general, a higher energy level</li>
            <li> I have it in smoothies with vanilla protein powder, raw spinach, and almond milk, and it is low calorie and delicious.</li>
            <li> Blender Bottle by Sundesa, Hand Blender, Sports Bottle, Blue, 20 oz.]], quick and easy.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a person who&#x27;s very much into health products.</li>
            <li> The one caution is that if you mix in a lot of frozen fruit, you definitely raise the sugar content quickly, and in hard-core healthy mode that can sort of backfire, but if you are like me and just looking for a way to get some greens down the pipe (and stay down), I think this is the best bet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know how much of a difference I feel on the day to day, but it has every vitamin needed for daily nutrition and along with other good health habits, I feel confident this product is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> For us, it seems to keep us more alkaline and we stay healthy throughout the year, very little illness.</li>
            <li> I want to feed vegis to my picky sons but with my busy life it&#x27;s hard to prepare all the good greens and either sneak it into food or cook it in their favorite ways.</li>
            <li> This is huge, as I work nights, and have two young ones, and would often drink 4 cups just to get by on 3-5 hours sleep.</li>
            <li> Further analysis showed that 5.4 mcg of this is \\&quot;inorganic arsenic\\&quot; reported to be the most toxic form of arsenic.  </li>
            <li> California, out of concern for the reproductive effects, has proposed that a product with more than 0.5 mcg of inorganic arsenic in a daily serving carry a warning label.</li>
            <li> Love the blend of different ingredients plus probiotics.</li>
            <li> Actually, a couple of people have commented to me about how much more energy I have.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first thing I do</li>
            <li> I have actually found myself craving it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> When i run out i will definitely buy some more, as i do feel like taking it has improved (and still is improving)</li>
            <li> This product was first recommended to me by a physician friend about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Since I am trying to cut back on processed foods and ingredients, I made sure I did plenty of research on this product.  </li>
            <li> and my hair got sooooo much thicker!  </li>
            <li> Being able to see as many results in a short amount of time is definitely a reason for me to keep buying!</li>
            <li> I just think it is funny when I&#x27;m listening to</li>
            <li> Chaddy Chad ;-)</li>
            <li> I definitely have more energy.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure this wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I had this tested another time that I ran out of product before I could reorder and felt the same decline in mood and endurance until it arrived to me.  </li>
            <li> A very healthful additive to ones daily intake of supplements my cardiolgist was extremely happy to see this in my list of daily intake</li>
            <li> First off, let me address the energy boost.</li>
            <li> I started out with a product called Exsula Iridesca (excellent but expensive).</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a short time and find that I seem to have more energy.</li>
            <li> The latest version, version 10.2 has a low iron content.  </li>
            <li> really well!  </li>
            <li> I realized something had changed drastically when I woke up and realized I had slept the whole night through without interruption!  </li>
            <li> I want to know EXACTLY what you are selling me.  </li>
            <li> I want to know EXACTLY what you are selling me.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and especially the price.</li>
            <li> and they say they are interested in it.</li>
            <li> Vibrance contains more friendly, healthful probiotics than any other superfood.</li>
            <li> This is MY first review</li>
            <li> This is MY first review</li>
            <li> so I feel I&#x27;m pretty well covered</li>
            <li> at first the taste is funky but mix it with cranberry or orange juice</li>
            <li> My throat feels better, my constant pharyngitis is gone.</li>
            <li> well actually I sleep like that on any off day and sometimes more well</li>
            <li> I first got wind of this product from the 4 hour diet wanting you to buy athletic greens which is a competing product and twice the price.</li>
            <li> I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you try a travel packet first.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li> Tastes like dirt at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> it probably tastes exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li> My first go around using this product</li>
            <li> At the same time, they also charge manufacturers many thousands of dollars to get their products reviewed.  </li>
            <li> EX: My first cannister was 10.3.</li>
            <li> My tummy thanks me now~!</li>
            <li> carrots and celery were among the first to jump ship.  </li>
            <li> The only way I can seem to kill the proteins I&#x27;m allergic to in most veggies has been to boil them</li>
            <li> This I could not even finish the first glass-</li>
            <li> , I started with the recommended amount for the first week and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in any area of my health (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li> I first heard about this when looking for solutions to a health problem I had.</li>
            <li> First day I suffered through the taste.  </li>
            <li> It really helps!  </li>
            <li> Better than taking a daily multivitamin.</li>
            <li> OK, don&#x27;t buy this for taste, but if you&#x27;re buying it for the potential health benefits, then proceed.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried it first.  </li>
            <li> it has been easier to be consistent since I learned the protein/banana trick.  </li>
            <li> In any case, Green Max Plus was way more affordable and did give me the ability to engage in more intense workouts.</li>
            <li> and I definitely feel better</li>
            <li> It makes me feel better that they&#x27;re getting lots of vitamins they need when I struggle to get the daily veggies into them.</li>
            <li> and I overall feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> First day review</li>
            <li> but goodness it&#x27;s a challenge the first couple days</li>
            <li> Part of my daily routine for many years now.</li>
            <li> Yes if the price hadn&#x27;t gone up $15 since I first ordered it (about 60 days ago).</li>
            <li> I tried it with water at first, and it mixes ok--kind of clumpy like whey protein.</li>
            <li> com is an independent testing lab that many supplement manufacturers submit products to for testing but</li>
            <li> If you want to go a step higher, add a scoop of Rainbow Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Being gluten free with a sensitive stomach I find that whenever I eat something that doesn&#x27;t agree with me 2 glasses of this sorts me out faster than anything else.  </li>
            <li> Do your research and you&#x27;ll come back to this product :)</li>
            <li> First time trying product.  </li>
            <li> the more likely you with buy, and keep using this product.</li>
            <li> my energy level seems much higher too, and my stomach/digestive issues seem to have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Energy is up, detoxes me very well, and I am feeling healthier too!  </li>
            <li> I mix white grape juice (.5 cup) with water (.5 cup) and the mixture, kills the tardiness taste, much better.</li>
            <li> First time buying and</li>
            <li> , I definitely slept better and woke up WAY easier.  </li>
            <li> Does what you want it too...keeps you regular and energetic.</li>
            <li> Lets get this out of the way first, shall we.</li>
            <li> my skin looks much healthier and it glows!  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are both vegan and also take 6-7 vitamins a day on top of this blend.&lt;br /&gt;However, since adding it into our daily routine</li>
            <li> i would only recommend to anyone, to make sure they are not allergic to any of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> Tasted pretty</li>
            <li> the first week or two</li>
            <li> I would compare the flavor to the aftertaste you get with spinach or asparagus, and again, only when I get to the bottom of the glass, otherwise I taste just chocolate cake batter :)</li>
            <li> Tastes exactly like what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> You will thank me later.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s covering way more bases than I was before even with a bunch of my individual supplements.</li>
            <li> Anticoagulant effects: You need to be aware of the many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients in this product, as well as the one big coagulant.</li>
            <li> interactions\\&quot; because there are just too many that aren&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I mostly put it in breakfast smoothies, sprinkle it on greek yoghurt, or sometimes just mix it in a glass of water</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this one and it seemed like the best one to take a chance on, but was still skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of most supplements and the over the top claims made in many of them.</li>
            <li> Not only did it take the pain away, I immediately had more energy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty yucky.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this product!</li>
            <li> I COULD DEFINITELY SAY I FELT BETTER.</li>
            <li> helps me poop more regularly</li>
            <li> but Im glad I finally made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Back and joint pain are much better.</li>
            <li> This is my first review btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I actually feel better than I did in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> and he drank the whole thing!</li>
            <li> This product sent was exactly as depicted in photos.  </li>
            <li> It takes like swamp water, but my husband would experiment mixing it with different juices and mixes to see if we could get it to taste better.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say, it has everything you could possible need in a day for vegetables and that made me feel better.</li>
            <li> I feel more energized and no longer feel constant  hunger.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much better I feel since starting this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat enough vegetables and thought that this would help me get more greens in my diet.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty grassy</li>
            <li> like to mix it with 8 oz V-8 or tomato juice, 2oz carrot juice, a tablespoon of flax seed oil, 5 drops vitamin E oil, a dose of Reuteri probiotic, 1T liquid calcium-magnesium supplement, a splash of hot sauce and a splash of home made garlic-rosemary vinegar</li>
            <li> a difference of $15 more than what I initially subcribed to</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has thousands of micro-biotics and good flora for my colon.</li>
            <li> I took this to my sports nutritionist and he said it was a good green supplement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Green Vibrance with my family for a couple of years now and it is so energizing and feels so good in our bodies.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this or any green supplement to taste good.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and how it breaks down every ingredient for you.</li>
            <li> Then I put something really delicious &amp; fried with a strong sauce or chutney in my mouth ... and voila no more green burps....</li>
            <li> I USUALLY SHAKE IT UP GOOD AND DRINK IT RIGHT AWAY IN A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE.  </li>
            <li> honestly, the price of the other Greens supplements out there completely justifies the higher prices they charge because I can take it every morning and actually enjoy the taste without ending up coughing and dry-heaving the taste of dirt on dirt on grass from my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is not only LOADED with a gajillion things that benefit the human body, but the taste is quite pleasant</li>
            <li> It came so quickly and I&#x27;m really pleased with the amount I get for the money spent.</li>
            <li> By including  Green Vibrance as part of my diet, I really don&#x27;t have to worry much about going without  many of the major ingredients that our bodies need for optimum health..</li>
            <li> It really helps to get my day off right.  </li>
            <li> cause it does not taste good in plain water....</li>
            <li> but I feel it has had a positive change in replacing good bacteria in the intestines and helps to push waste through.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance keeps me healthy, my system runs smooth and clean, just like a brand new car.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is more affordable, while not as fine a powder as VG, but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Was far grittier than j originally thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Now, after several weeks of use I can honestly say that the above benefits are true.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily we found a better version sold by Tony Robbins that tastes a lot more neutral and includes MSM which was hard to find in a greens drink.</li>
            <li> Chug it down resolutely in water or less dramatically in a glass of juice.&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent supplement to the not-so-healthy food choices too many of us make on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> (I live on Maui)-super quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I feel confident of getting the same benefit from this AND getting a two month supply for less than the cost of a one month supply of VM.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be glad to use Green Vibrance again when this problem is solved, because it is otherwise a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Not tired in the morning at all... and very regular. :)</li>
            <li> If you can stay away from fast food, soda, and drink this every day you will probably be doing more than 98 percent of American&#x27;s out there for your health.</li>
            <li> When I take Green Vibrance, I really feel like I&#x27;m taking care of myself, that&#x27;s a good feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is really a good source for getting the green veggie you need with out eating so much.</li>
            <li> Green super-foods have detoxed my liver and has given me the nutrition my body needs and filled the nutritional voids from eating even a healthy diet.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t end up too sweet when mixed in a smoothie with a sweet fruit like a banana.    </li>
            <li> It helps me be sure that we&#x27;re getting enough real nourishment into us.  </li>
            <li> This supplement is the most important supplement that I use (that&#x27;s saying a lot because I take quite a few).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great, complete green.</li>
            <li> Not as tasty as more expensive brands, but good for you.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Green Vibrance is the sole reason why my health improved, but it has so many good things in it, I am convinced that it definitely played an important role, which is why I intend to take this product for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> Clean, pure and healthy, and less taste interference with your juice or protein drinks.</li>
            <li> My cycle has regulated, my cramps are completely gone, and between this and my Kangen water, I am almost never sick.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviewed before purchasing this product and everybody was saying positive things about and since my husband and I need to add a supplement to our diet and workout program we decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> but I plan to move on with a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li> but I plan to move on with a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li> I will add to the chorus of positive reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> There is a positive energy effect.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s positive effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a skeptic</li>
            <li> After I finished my first 30 day supply of it, I hadn&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my health or my energy level.  </li>
            <li> (if you are willing to pretend the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t really happen, hehehe).</li>
            <li> After 60 days of taking this I have more energy than I have had in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I got straight A&#x27;s and a B for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> have only used this a few times so far, but its perfect.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much better, mentally and physically, and more energy.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s pretty much all that matters.</li>
            <li> This is the first supplement that my husband says has really made a noticable difference in how he feels.  </li>
            <li> I take this pretty much every morning</li>
            <li> On top of this I am a long time sufferer of recurrent UTI&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> In the past year I have lost about 17 lbs , despite eating normal and healthy amounts, without explanation from doctors running labs, biopsies and more.</li>
            <li> Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I am not deficient in any minerals, vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I usually drink it with O.J, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me taste wise.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit pricey, but compared to other products, this is far superior in quality.</li>
            <li> Too me, it is super mild and simply tastes grassy.</li>
            <li> But, after using Vibrant Health for more than 6 months my iron is now at a stable level to give blood every time with not problem or having to take extra kids vitamins making my iron roller coaster.  </li>
            <li> I feel more anxious, and have less energy, and tend to not be as happy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been able to mix this and drink it without oral issues and so far no other issues.  </li>
            <li> The beginning of the second week I took two full scoops on a daily basis because I was willing to believe my body needed more to respond.</li>
            <li> hope the days to follow bring the same results I have experienced in a few short days and more.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has help greatly, my arthritis has stopped hurting, hair seems thicker and general health</li>
            <li> Well, honestly, at first I couldn&#x27;t really feel that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if you use warm water it dissolves a bit easier and becomes less gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish companies and corporations would get past the obsession with adding faddish herbs to every manufactured good out there.</li>
            <li> I did not take it long enough to see if it was any good.</li>
            <li> Since I take the recommended amount stated on the package, the large container lasts me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have my morning breakfast in my togo large plastic tupperware.</li>
            <li> I bought the large container</li>
            <li> This way you get a large quantity of well-being in a scoopful.  </li>
            <li> As a supplement I also bought a bottle of Pure Essence labs</li>
            <li> It helps with digestive issues and adds a large variety of nutrients.</li>
            <li> I even drink it with pure water.</li>
            <li> I take a great many supplements, which makes it hard to tell just how effective any given item is, but the Green Vibrance seems to help with regularity among other things.    </li>
            <li> Went to whole foods and since my greens had been a positive part of my dietary supplementation I thought why not change it up a bit.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m a little suspect of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for over a month now and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Worth it to get it on amazon for cheaper than in the natural food stores!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Green Vibrance for two weeks, and I love it!.</li>
            <li> We drink this everyday with orange juice and love it !  </li>
            <li> After I ran out, I bought this, which is like half the cost for double the amount--- that seemed great.  </li>
            <li> Then just add a teaspoon of the raw organic honey and it becomes very enjoyable to drink.</li>
            <li> The taste is also fine mixed in a smoothie.  </li>
            <li> I tried exercise, quitting a job to get more sleep, teas, ecchinacea, resveratrol, colloidal silver, astaxanthin, umcka, zinc, and lots of other supplements to boost my immune system, and they worked at first</li>
            <li> Over a week later I am still fine.</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much Vibrant Health!</li>
            <li> a site note, if you are interested in their Maximum Vibrance product, I was told the main difference is that that one contains a serving of plant-based protein in addition to vitamin content...  </li>
            <li> I typically blend this powder in my freshly juiced fruits, although I use commercially produced organic juices which are also just as good, and drink with my breakfast in replace of a meal or often over my morning cereal.  </li>
            <li> also believe that Vibrant Health&#x27;s policy of letting the consumer know EXACTLY</li>
            <li> and it was found to have very high amounts of ARSENIC.</li>
            <li> With Green Vibrance, all the fuss is taken out and even more high impact special greens are involved.</li>
            <li> A little bit more, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Vibrant Health!</li>
            <li> Taking it makes me feel wonderful and combining it with a healthy, plant-based diet keeps me from ever getting sick!</li>
            <li> Overall... great product and definitely worth a little grit to have all the  benifits!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it really makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> There are enough reviews about how great this product is, so I&#x27;m not going to waste your time</li>
            <li> The taste is less than desirable but its easy to mix and shoot quickly.</li>
            <li> The taste is something to get used to, but I really don&#x27;t mind it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much of an appetite while recovering, so</li>
            <li> I really think it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> but again, this is costing too much, it is like $2/day</li>
            <li> After three weeks I noticed my nails growing fast and strong-including my hair.  </li>
            <li> Every household should have a jar of this product in the kitchen and everyone really ought to have a dose each day...</li>
            <li> I really believe that we are what we eat.</li>
            <li> All report more energy and mental clarity.  </li>
            <li> At Whole Foods you spend close to $100 with tax.    </li>
            <li> The quantity provided is very generous.</li>
            <li> I noticed it&#x27;s really easier to handle the taste if I don&#x27;t breathe thru my nose until I&#x27;ve had the glass of Rice Dream.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product I could use as a replacement for the real thing on the days that I just don&#x27;t have time to use my juicer.</li>
            <li> The findings of ConsumerLab.com was confirmed by another independent laboratory.</li>
            <li> All is promises it really.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s fast paced world, we can sometimes neglect to take care of ourselves as well as we should.</li>
            <li> I made this mistake, using way too much cranberry juice.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone who wants to improve their health gain vitamins and energy</li>
            <li> It really helps with my digestive track</li>
            <li> I saw this product in Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> Now I often wake rested and ready to go even before my alarm goes</li>
            <li> and I really think it may have saved me.  </li>
            <li> and I really think it may have saved me.  </li>
            <li> The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to drinking yucky stuff for my health, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> For my whole life I always had no energy,</li>
            <li> BEFORE I MAKE ANY REAL HEALTH CLAIMS</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even really tasty.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product being on time.</li>
            <li> Much finer than I have found before.</li>
            <li> and she was very helpful.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients goes the whole way around the rather fat container.</li>
            <li> Very tolerable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really kicks your immune system up a notch or two.  </li>
            <li> I could not stop taking the product because it cost too much money.</li>
            <li> the whole story about traveling.</li>
            <li> the both of us has had so much energy.</li>
            <li> (we have a whole canister).</li>
            <li> It really seems to help.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t make</li>
            <li> Changing my diet really helped</li>
            <li> Being a natural product from the earth, the arsenic levels in fresh, living food can&#x27;t be controlled in a laboratory.</li>
            <li> The testimonies here by some elderly reviewers tend to reflect much</li>
            <li> I have an arrythmia and sometimes it really helps to drink this..</li>
            <li> So now I mix w/ 8 ounces of water, and drink it as fast as I can.</li>
            <li> so if I had ANY increase in energy, it would be very noticeable and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking to myself, really??</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> I think that is a bit much</li>
            <li> i am very into it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if these sorts of things work.</li>
            <li> Is it way cheaper than Whole Foods?</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> It has a very well thought out balance of nutrients.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t change much else w/</li>
            <li> and when I drink GV this every day, I don&#x27;t suffer w/ yeast nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> Too much vit K causes blood clots.</li>
            <li> product can really do wonders for your body that you cannot see.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, showed up ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Let me get real here....</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have it now I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> multi-vitamins just aren&#x27;t absorbed completely.</li>
            <li> I use it in my smoothies along with spinach or kale, berries,  sweetener, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of reviews, Green Vibrance seemed to be the next best choice,even though it receives low marks for taste.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves this.  </li>
            <li> My husband is a health nut and does all the research for me, and so far, this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And by ordering it from Amazon, I saved about 30 dollars compared buying it at Whole Foods.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who is seeking a healthier lifestyle!</li>
            <li> thanks for the warning from another consumer here.</li>
            <li> I like juicing but at times it&#x27;s to much work when I want to just drink and go.  </li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> It gave me a really lucid energy-boost, and doesn&#x27;t make my heart or nervous system &#x27;splode like caffeine</li>
            <li> I really wish I COULD take it because I think what people are saying here is correct.  </li>
            <li> I have so much energy with this</li>
            <li> Even my wife has mentioned to me how much energy and spirt I have.</li>
            <li> So much is packed into one scoop, just read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I add a scoop to my morning shake and really like it.</li>
            <li> I ran out for two days this week, and really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Energy and mood is much improved.</li>
            <li> I drink this every morning with juice it really helps give me energy.</li>
            <li> WE REALLY RECEIVED A BARGIN WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about six months now and really do believe that it has helped to increase my energy.</li>
            <li> It really changed my life.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the holistic vet of my 13 years old lab recommended it to increase her health, and wellness during her golden years.</li>
            <li> I feel so much energized, happier, and my foot pain</li>
            <li> take this stuff every day for a week and see how it changes your appearance, (my skin looks much healthier, it got rid of some eczema around my nose)</li>
            <li> its really</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t taking medication for blood pressure I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it too much, though.    </li>
            <li> Whole apple powder 500</li>
            <li> so I really wanted to find one I could tolerate.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the chocolate version, which I really like</li>
            <li> Too much acid.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER.I</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> We take it in our juice and really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li> I feel energized and also feel that my immune system is much stronger.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind the taste at all.</li>
            <li> I spent most of my time on the couch.</li>
            <li> and I really notice the difference if I miss a day.</li>
            <li> Every vitamin and mineral you&#x27;d ever need in reasonable quantities (not overdoing it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was already a size 00 and am currently very underweight .</li>
            <li> My latest research has been &amp;#34;the greens&amp;#34; and I can say without a doubt, Green Vibrance is in the top 3, depending on the specific nutrition and results you are looking for.</li>
            <li> This product supplies a very generous amount of &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; of the nutrients on their label.</li>
            <li> Really helps out if you have acid reflux.  </li>
            <li> It satisfies my needs and proved to be more than what I expected as for as the energy that I now have</li>
            <li> and I believe this product has really helped me.  </li>
            <li> It tells you what&#x27;s in it, how much, what category that ingredient falls into, etc.</li>
            <li> but it does make you want to take it with straight juice of some sort.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to take a lot of it, 8 oz, and so you can really chug fast.</li>
            <li> really  fantastick&lt;br /&gt;gave to my daughtr</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t stress too much about what I eat for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I used to drink it straight with 4-6 ounces of water and god</li>
            <li> really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that attacks my liver and have had absolutely zero energy.  </li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> It is very tolerable to me</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Thanks seller.  </li>
            <li> Really didnt expect an energy boost as its always a claim.</li>
            <li> much B vitamin).&lt;br /&gt;small</li>
            <li> My whole family has been using this product for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am very faithful in drinking it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purchasing another box because I think it&#x27;s very nutritive and</li>
            <li> I went straight to the kitchen, got it out, &amp; started taking it.</li>
            <li> - something I haven&#x27;t done since high school!)</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really taste it.</li>
            <li> Every year or two an inflammation flareup requires me to take a one or two week juice and probiotic fast.  </li>
            <li> , I wake up much easier in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> This combination seems to be, for me at least, a good boost for the immune system.</li>
            <li> I am all for this product for people that it works for, just because careful of these products that \\&quot;seem too good to be true\\&quot;, because they might just possibly be.</li>
            <li> I am all for this product for people that it works for, just because careful of these products that \\&quot;seem too good to be true\\&quot;, because they might just possibly be.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I just thought it was an earthy &#x27;green&#x27; flavor&lt;</li>
            <li> Liked the taste of Green Vibrance and the probiotic component.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I am only on my second day taking this product</li>
            <li> At 61 years old I have more energy than I did several years ago.</li>
            <li> I have used many different greens but this one by far has it all.</li>
            <li> It goes down pretty good than if you take a deep breath just chug</li>
            <li> This product delivers on it&#x27;s claims of helping to provide the whole range of proper vitamins/minerals/digestive enzymes, it shipped quickly and lasted exactly 3 months with the suggested serving size.</li>
            <li> I mix with Vega One Berry flavor by Sequel Naturals and get complete health in a shake for breakfast every morning !!!</li>
            <li> Anyone interested in more information on this subject can find it here on Amazon.com reviews.</li>
            <li> Last year I started having mild hot flashes, bloating, fatigue and mood swings.</li>
            <li> I was simply trying to save money but will gladly pay more to avoid the Vibrant Green experience.</li>
            <li> Herb popularity tends to run in fads -- there&#x27;s always a hot new herb everyone is enthused about.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty new to going \\&quot;green\\&quot;</li>
            <li> com tested it and found it was heavily contaminated with arsenic; much more that any other product of it&#x27;s kind and more than legally allowed in other pruducts, one namely apple juice.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance consists of many ingredients and it is likely that one or more of these ingredients are highly contaminated with arsenic.</li>
            <li> Go to the Vibrant Health website and you&#x27;ll find the vast list of ingredients in this are mostly all natural or organic superfoods.</li>
            <li> I take it with water straight up, but I&#x27;ve heard of many people mixing it in orange juice and other beverages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper and better for you than any other shake on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Vibrant Healths Green Vibrance is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now back on the band wagon and feeling fresh!  </li>
            <li> The national value exceeds most other products of its type.</li>
            <li> Navy Seals and the other healthy defence guys.</li>
            <li> Mostly wheatgrass and other greens.</li>
            <li> Everything is within the normal range!</li>
            <li> I received the package and was excited to start adding it to my daily nutrition.</li>
            <li> Even if you do eat healthy our foods are depleted of the vitamins and minerals and other micro nutrients we need.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only posting the \\&quot;significant</li>
            <li> this product may not be appropriate but on the other hand it can help a sluggish bowl.</li>
            <li> and I am finitely feeling NORMAL!</li>
            <li> This product fluctuates more than any other I keep track of.</li>
            <li> but I ditched them all for this &amp; see more positive results with less cash out the door.  </li>
            <li> I recently started a new job that to my surprise required 12-15 hour days for the last  4 weeks and my energy levels have been amazing.  </li>
            <li> ordered due the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, but have not noticed much change in my sense of well being or overall health, I did finish one 60 day supply and have ordered another one to give the product a fair shake, but so far it seems in my case that this is another bottle of snake oil.</li>
            <li> I will eat crickets, mealworms, and/or grasshoppers much sooner than I will ever try Vibrant Health</li>
            <li> I am really active and notice how much more I sweat during workouts while taking this product</li>
            <li> As with all natural remedies, you cannot expect to see immediate results but it is more of a long term investment.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for us, this is a safe supplement that gives us enough of a positive effect that we will continue to buy it and take it.</li>
            <li> I am in no way a vegetarian or vegan, not saying that&#x27;s bad, just normal guy trying to live a longer more enjoyable life with the people I love.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this ends up being a solidly rich and healthy chocolate afternoon meal substitute.</li>
            <li> Well made and shipped professionally all at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> great way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the taste was rough with just water, but mixing with a little bit of juice made it very drinkable.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not taste like you&#x27;re eating the grass off your lawn, but it has a pleasant consistency (not like some green powders which turn out lumpy or gooey).  </li>
            <li> That said, right now there&#x27;s no serious research to show exactly what happens when we are exposed to low level, long-term arsenic consumption.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are serious about having good health.  </li>
            <li> How long does it take to make a huge difference?</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a product I have been using regularly for years, and i was happy to find this source which offers the product at the lowest price I could find and in convenient autoship.  </li>
            <li> so I was clear on exactly what I was consuming.  </li>
            <li> so I was clear on exactly what I was consuming.  </li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance daily and have experienced a significant increase in energy and mental clarity.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Same benefits, faster and more enjoyable, at least for me it is.</li>
            <li> natural greens and vegetables tend to higher in arsenic</li>
            <li> /&gt;Parts of the US have higher arsenic soil levels where arsenic just occurs naturally.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable increase in my energy levels when I&#x27;ve drank this consistently.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t always get your full daily recommended dose of fruits and vegetables</li>
            <li> It is chock full of all kinds of goodies and was the only one that had everything from berries, leafy greens, sea veggies, fiber and pro-pre biotics, antioxidants, enzymes...</li>
            <li> And while I prefer to mix with juice, it is sweet enough to be stomached alone with water.</li>
            <li> Got to get use to the taste but overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I have to say that fresh daily juicing and home-made raw green smoothies are THE best way to get the maximum power of living greens into your system.  </li>
            <li> It goes down easier when I mix it with yogurt and frozen blueberries in my Magic Bullet mixer.</li>
            <li> And he use to suffer from anxiety, this has calmed him down and gave him more energy</li>
            <li> Giving it four stars because I can get it down every day and it&#x27;s amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It does require significant dedication, commitment, time, and energy, not to mention the initial expense of the juicer machine and constant purchasing of all that fresh produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to take a very good Green superfood, I would highly recommend Green Vibrance....</li>
            <li> More than half the time it is.</li>
            <li> but A LOT LESS MONEY FOR MORE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- More relaxed, less anxiety/stress  </li>
            <li> The main question</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t manage to swallow it quick enough not to taste it.  </li>
            <li> I researched the response from Vibrant Health and found them to be dismissive of these findings.</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much Vibrant Health!es can be toxic</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health, you have no idea</li>
            <li> ever since i began using this faithfully-2 servings per day-the allergy symptoms particularly with ym eyes have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I opened my container that I was using to confirm that the LARGER measuring spoon was in my most recent purchase.</li>
            <li> I only mix it with an inch or two of water, just to get it over with quickly.  </li>
            <li> Are they interested in educating the public, or are they just interested in making money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I do hope someone from Vibrant Health Company addresses the arsenic report findings here ASAP for the benefit of all of us who consume this product.</li>
            <li> That was the only negative, and if fatique is your problem this works great.</li>
            <li> Around 20 years ago I became a vegetarian and survived mainly off of vegetables, dairy, and nuts.  </li>
            <li> Too soon for decent evaluation at this point.</li>
            <li> It instantly takes away the bitter green taste and gives it a smooth pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend looking at another product by this company called Vibrant Health Maximum Vibrance Digestive Supplement, 24.81 Ounces sold here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking forward to trying Green Vibrance because I had heard so much about it and read so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients and you will understand why we love Green Vibrance so much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased Green Vibrance with the intent to increase energy levels for more intense workouts.</li>
            <li> I will try for another 60 days to see if energy increase can be attributed to vibrant greens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lot more regular when I take it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Mixes reasonably well for a green powder and ok if you put it in juice.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product pretty consistently for several years now.  </li>
            <li> i went from the misery of bouts of laxatives for constipation and binders for diarrhea for over a year, to actually a balanced digestive system, energy, a feeling of well being, better sleep, no mysterious headaches that were somehow connected to my stomach woes.  </li>
            <li> A friend touted this as a decent solution.</li>
            <li> Finally science and technology do actually work to make our lives better.  </li>
            <li> For those with sensitive taste buds, mix GV in your favorite organic unprocessed juice</li>
            <li> I notice the mornings when I skip my Vibrant Health drink</li>
            <li> : Yep just checked the main site Vibrant health</li>
            <li> Getting rid of older supply?</li>
            <li> I mixed it with orange juice to make it more palatable or mixed it in a smoothy.</li>
            <li> I have taken other greens but this one seems to make my energy last all day and it mixes very good with other things like whey protein.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance not only has a nice flavor to it, especially if you add (Raw Honey and some fresh squeezed orange juice) but it also gives me energy and keeps me full for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend Vibrant Health products.</li>
            <li> I will revisit my original review in either direction to report on long term efficacy and results.</li>
            <li> In any case, it worked for me, besides just plain being good for you overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, I really did, but the taste was just plain offensive</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she was taking it and highly recommend it to all of her family and friends.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For example, in some parts of the cotton-growing South, arsenic-based pesticides were used to kill boll weevils on the cotton crops and arsenic levels are extremely high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I also have diabetes type II and high blood pressure.  </li>

            <li> Arsenic organically comes from the soil of the earth and is in our rice and fruits hence the high levels of arsenic</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone trying to improve his/her health.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Anyways I would highly recommend getting the newer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to mention that the price is weigh too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have a chronic illness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too high.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this vendor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your health.</li>
            <li> If you can cut out some other excess, this will benefit you far more than a frap/cap/half caff or spending 50$ buying drinks for girls at a club.</li>
            <li> I am a little worried over the high amount of arsenic found in it though, and the fact that the company has neglected to address that issue with a response worries me more.  </li>
            <li> I have shared this with many in the health care field, Physicians, Surgeons and clinicians who now use and recommend this product with positive results, not just digestive related, but for autoimmune boost,anemia, energy and mental clarity.</li>
            <li> , Consumer Reports reported finding arsenic in many rice products, finding about 4 mcg of inorganic arsenic, on average, in a standard 45 gram (dry) serving of many types of rice sold in the U.X.</li>
            <li> but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT WORKS\\&quot; or \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT SUCKS\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT WORKS\\&quot; or \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT SUCKS\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> May be my imagination, but I do feel a little more \\&quot;get-up and go\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> apple, any fruit with a little water..or with V 8 juice when i want more salt..</li>
            <li> There is little clinical study of many herbs, and reliable reporting on side effects (or even beneficial effects) is anecdotal.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, I do seem to have a little more energy with this addition to my diet so who knows.</li>
            <li> Probiotics: The amounts of probiotics listed are \\&quot;at date of manufacture\\&quot; which does NOT necessarily mean \\&quot;at date of ingestion\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Junior Vibrance for my grand-daughter to help her grow healthy organs and feed that little growing brain of hers.</li>
            <li> No more afternoon lulls, feeling so much better and as a result more active.</li>
            <li> I suggest mixing it in cranberry or other strong juice to start.</li>
            <li> I first started taking Greens plus which is also a very good Green superfood, but I was introduced to Green Vibrance by a local health food clerk...</li>
            <li> Its taste isn&#x27;t bad and Amazon has the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I was juicing prior to Green Vibrance, and still do occasionally, but this is quicker (and cheaper) and it has been a great buy for me.  </li>
            <li> It also really seems to be &#x27;cleansing&#x27; as far as, well, you know...</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but too expensive on this site.</li>
            <li> but so far he uses it very sporadically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone introduced me to Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I feel a lot better when I take Green Vibrance, it gives me lots of energy and my skin has a glow...</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for several years now and have to say I am very healthy for 59.</li>
            <li> I heard about Green Vibrance through one of my favorite bloggers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about my energy levels because I get up and get going pretty well on my own, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t hampered it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for many years.</li>
            <li> $100 is the normal price?  </li>
            <li> They say the normal price is $100??????  </li>
            <li> It goes without saying that Green Vibrance is a much more beneficial boost than caffeine or sugar.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I want that everyday.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> Your smoothie might be brown or green but it tastes so much better.  </li>
            <li> I feel better when taking Green Vibrance each day.</li>
            <li> Then I knew for sure it was really my Green Vibrance that  got rid of the hormonal effects of menopause.</li>
            <li> a product like this was effective for me, I would have noticed some improvement in at least one area this should affect</li>
            <li> its my favorite green food.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a better rating for Green Vibrance, but it just did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> so it stays extra fresh.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t taste it at all, but it gives it a green tint, so everyone knows how healthy you are.  </li>
            <li> I love Green Vibrance -</li>
            <li> DOES NOT COMPARE TO NORMAL CHOC MILK</li>
            <li> I like green vibrance better...</li>
            <li> I love this green vibrance.</li>
            <li> After consuming the frothy beverage, the green carnage all over your face is a sure way to scare the pants off of any of your houseplants.</li>
            <li> I started with the Rainbow Vibrance, trying to ease myself into it, and after a week, I noticed that I had more energy, so I ordered the Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> The big question is, is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> LOVE Green Vibrance!&lt;br /&gt;First</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance finds ALL of these magical plants and roots from all over the world and grinds them up</li>
            <li> I BEEN PURCHASING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.LOADED WITH HEALTHY NUTRIENTS AND PROBIOTICS</li>
            <li> I love the effects of Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> I love Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I recomend green vibrance to all my patients, and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the green color affects the taste perception for many, you know, mind over matter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have read some negative reviews but the company has always been forthcoming and honest.  </li>
            <li> bought the green magic because I was looking into meal supplements.</li>
            <li> have discovered that it is tolerable only with orange fresh.</li>
            <li> Based on the ingredients and what I had read about it on their website, I ordered the Green Vibrance when I needed more.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days I started feeling almost like a normal person again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better green drinks on the market that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I use the V-8 usually for convenience but it would be better to juice the real thing.</li>
            <li> I just feel better when I use Green Vibrance and plan to continue forever.  </li>
            <li> I take a glass of green powder smoothy every day and have tried many over my lifetime.</li>
            <li> But my hair and skin are more moist, I&#x27;m sleeping about thirty minutes less a night, and I even feel as if I can think a little more clearly.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hypoglycemic, and I&#x27;ve learned through experience that there are certain herbs and herbal products that can profoundly affect my blood sugar.    </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because it is far more affordable and comparable to the other major Greens supplement out there.</li>
            <li> and he just had his 3rd bowel movement that day ( previously 2 BM&#x27;s per week if fortunate) or the Crohn&#x27;s patient who is able to finally have a sabbatical from chronic diarrrhea, or the Stroke patient in a lethargic state for months who was fed this through his PEG tube for two days</li>
            <li> The taste his better hidden in the Apple grape!  </li>
            <li> self, I usually have it for a quick snack-i&#x27;m big and wanted better nutrients.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been sick and have felt great and full of energy.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the high star rating.</li>
            <li> The price is great, the ingredients are high quality, the vitamins/minerals/ingredients are great and in good numbers, but the awful taste leads to me staring at the huge jar and praying that it will eat itself and disappear off my countertop so I don&#x27;t have to take it or feel guilty for letting it go to waste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product.</li>
            <li> My guess is, they want to unload the older version with this major problem without really disclosing the details of their product.    </li>
            <li> Some of us have jumped right in and taken the required amount only to find it constipating.  </li>
            <li> He said that certain extracts could possible be causing neurtoxicity and ataxia, and that certain herbs like ginko biloba can lower things like the seizure threshold, already damaged by the immune response to the gluten, which could be causing the muscle jerking.  </li>
            <li> I pay particular attention to the iron content: I steer clear away from anything with high iron content.  </li>
            <li> , I am raising our 3 year old grandson, we still have teenagers in our home, I clog dance and am very active, and I know for sure this has been helping me.</li>
            <li> I read the Green Vibrance label carefully and, among the many, many ingredients, discovered the likely culprit -- silymarin (milk thistle extract).</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t usually care for the taste of apple juice, apple juice is definitely the best for the green powder.</li>
            <li> but I felt a little better (after about 2 weeks) as far as gastrointestinal issues go.  </li>
            <li> but I am chalking that up to it just being my new norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since they added two new ingredients on the label, the taste is not as palatable.</li>
            <li> live the stuff, been taking it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> It continuously snowed for 4 days (around new years)</li>
            <li> I appreciate the new direction on the label to freeze this product after opening to maintain its freshness.</li>
            <li> I am a health coach, so I like to try new things to recommend for clients.</li>
            <li> With or without notification or even a justification from Vibrant health that results in a significant increase in daily use and ultimately price..........enough out of me.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t notice a huge amount of personal &amp;#34;vibrance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have had digestive problems most of my adult life and since using Green Vibrance -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with chronic dry, red eyes and joint pain since my early teens, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, has been able to change that.</li>
            <li> (we&#x27;re big green smoothie drinkers) and honestly, it didn&#x27;t fare as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> well the only different thing in my daily consumtion was Green Vibrance, so I am truly sold by taking this product, and it makes me very happy to have this added to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the effects are subtle but I drink it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Increased energy (very helpful with 4 year old twins and a 6 year old), makes me feel as though my brain is awake without caffeine</li>
            <li> Keeps a person young and vibrant.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great taste, get ready for a disappointment.</li>
            <li> unsweetened almond milk(pure), currently trying titan 1 protien but will return to Optimum Nutrition Pro complex vanilla.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers of GV are very clear that they release new versions based on continuous research and improvements.</li>
            <li> As once reviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show (naturalnewsradio.com)  while on location at the 2012 Natural Products Expo, this product comes highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a VERY sensitive stomach, and I just mix this in cranberry juice, and I have no issues.</li>
            <li> We have been starting everyday with Green Vibrant for years and plan on continuing to do so for many more.  </li>
            <li> But WOW!  </li>
            <li> I started feeling sluggish and completely out of wack!  </li>
            <li> I put it in my morning protein shake and at first the taste was different, but edible.</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure on this....</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what an associate at my local Sprout&#x27;s told me when she recommended the product to me for the first time.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep young!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I may be in the minority, but I love this green drink!</li>
            <li> the first glass &amp; flush my mouth and throat with the second.</li>
            <li> I usually add a tad more water to finish it off.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the exact same thing for her.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Green Vibrance, I never miss a day!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me FEEL any different, but within the first year drinking it (semi-regularly) my triglycerides dropped about 100 points.  </li>
            <li> , hives on my body suddenly it was my first Time that I had allergies</li>
            <li> You can really give a taste to whatever you put it in if not careful.  </li>
            <li> By testing in this way we can keep levels of arsenic as low as possible, and make sure if it is present</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now by mixing it with a can of V-8 every morning along with red hot sauce, worcestershire sauce and a dash of prepared horseradish.</li>
            <li> I put my scoop into my daily protein drink that has so many other ingredients, that the taste is not an issue with me.  </li>
            <li> I could tell a big difference in my energy level after taking it the first week.  </li>
            <li> ONLY because I think people should be aware of this side effect (for some)</li>
            <li> We love Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> after 2 weeks taking it, my dog looks like a 2 years old puppy!</li>
            <li> they are saying I look healthier which is funny as I am all about physical fitness and dieting correctly.  </li>
            <li> It has by far the grossest aftertaste EVER!</li>
            <li> but I usually mix it in a smoothie with Macro Reds and my day is exponentially better than the days I don&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> This year was the first time in 10 YEARS thats TEN YEARS!!!</li>
            <li> Well, it surprised me !</li>
            <li> It however tastes, and looks pretty gross.</li>
            <li> And its easy to cover it up with a little orange_pineapple juice.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you look at real people, and use common sense, consuming huge quantities of healthful greens seems to boost the immune system to a higher level so that energy, good health, and well-being can, and often does, last way into old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF there were a way to measure the life-time arsenic consumed by Jay Kordich (the original \\&quot;Juice Man\\&quot;) or the now deceased Jack LaLanne (both passionate, life-long green juice/vegetable advocates)</li>
            <li> I have been in a living hell food wise between oral allergy syndrome (itchy mouth, sneezing, scratchy throat, often times nearly losing my voice, and having everything come out the other end looking the same as it did when it went in within an hour or two) and fructose malabsorption (flatulence, extreme crippling abdominal pain and cramping, belly distended similar to that of a 6 to 8 month pregnant woman, on rare occasions a mild headache, and unfortunately the side effect of mild depression).  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to give Green Vibrance a little more time, but I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> more active and overall feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Make a glass of Crystal Light Lemonade and add 2 Tablespoons of the Vibrant Green mix.  </li>
            <li> Choke it down if you must, the benefits are fantastic.</li>
            <li> One weekendI had no raw veggies and was all better, went to work, a few hours in tried my snack and all symptoms returned!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d resigned myself to putting in some Visine and popping some Ibuprofen whenever my symptoms flared up, but honest to God, a few days of Green Vibrance has cleared those problems right up.</li>
            <li> alfalfa hay-kind of sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Visual appeal isn&#x27;t wonderful after mixed in the above smoothie-looks very dark green.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product has become more expensive; however, Amazon offers the best price!</li>
            <li> There are too many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients that would enhance Warfarin, and possibly make your blood pressure dangerously low, AND there is 150% DV of Vitamin K in a normal dose, which very seriously conflicts with Warfarin as well as most all blood-thinners.</li>
            <li> I have had this weird foot fungus forever on my foot, and the only thing i have changed recently is adding this to my diet, and it&#x27;s getting better!!!</li>
            <li> It does require frequent stirring to keep the parts that don&#x27;t dissolve mixed in, and there is often a significant amount of residue left on the inside and bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to this product but like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> Not like caffeine which can give you the jitters, but a slight pleasant notch up in overall energy and mental capacity.  </li>
            <li> Since adding Vibrant Green to my daily regimen, my GERD symptoms are more under control</li>
            <li> My stomach got back to normal fast</li>
            <li> Since I am not good about getting enough veggies in my diet, I feel this is a good alternative.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was I walking taller and definitely felt more energy, a week later I found myself having a definite &amp;#34;spring to my step&amp;#34; in fact I was walking very briskly.</li>
            <li> I found that a combination of prune juice and orange juice with calcium stands up to the strong taste of Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very sensitive to it, and as far as I can tell the energy boost doesn&#x27;t come from caffeine.</li>
            <li> After hearing that the taste was sub-par, I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m a man, I&#x27;ve eaten dozens of gross things, surely I could choke this down before it does me in,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure what happened next, but it ended up with me coughing, hacking, and dry-heaving at the sink and the rest of the drink going down the drain.</li>
            <li> A regular staple now, I think Vibrant Health&#x27;s Green Vibrance is an amazing product and have ordered it several times (in increasing sizes!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to take a big scoop with less juice.  </li>
            <li> After receiving and making my &#x27;greens &amp; protein&#x27; smoothie I found it to have a much better taste than the product mentioned above that I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I take it 30-45 minutes after eating once a day and know that I&#x27;ve consumed a very nutrient dense green super food.  </li>
            <li> After much research I landed here at this product for a super shake including a green powder.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The size and price of the Family Size Green Vibrance is an amazing value for a single person like myself.</li>
            <li> The upside to this new discovery is that I can once again enjoy the benefits of Green Vibrance with complete confidence in their product.</li>
            <li> energy is better, I feel more upbeat, less physically exhausted.  </li>
            <li> scoop of Green Vibrance, 1 batch of Organic Kale, 1 dash of Stevia, 1 dash of Sea Salt, 2 Organic Lemons (peeled), 2 Organic Green Apples, 1 thumb size chunk of Ginger root (peeled), slight dash of Cayenne Pepper, Mountain Spring Water or best Aqua Hydrate 9pH water,</li>
            <li> If you are buying this purely looking for something that tastes like strawberry cheesecake ice cream then obviously just no.  </li>
            <li> Being a previous nutritionist he said that harvesting the wheat grass could determine if it could contain gluten, since although the leaves do not contain gluten, there must be a guarantee that the leaves have completely matured, using up all the protein that the gluten intolerant are sensitive to in order to ensure that the product is completely gluten free.  </li>
            <li> I take it with a little water mixed with my favorite juice...</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a little over a onth,but have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> However I really am grateful Vibrant Health continues to be consistent with value and integrity in the production of Green Vibrance Powder.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better, I hardly notice I am going bald anymore.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many green-powders out there - hard to know which one to try.</li>
            <li> You do have an earthy taste, but it is easily covered up when mixed or blended with other things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there are people out there who are even more sensitive to taste than I am, but I guess there are.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it lives up to the hype my face is clear</li>
            <li> I will NOT buy any product of this company until they clearly show the nutritional profile of the product they are selling each time.    </li>
            <li> so clear</li>
            <li> This really surprised me as I was unaware of how much slouching</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this clear since,</li>
            <li> It might seem expensive, but Green Vibrance only averages to about $1 a day, which is definitely worth it for me to feel healthy and energetic.</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for about 18 months, its a great way to get total greens everyday.</li>
            <li> Armour thyroid and Calm magnesium made a big difference in improvoing that, but I noticed a definite increase in energy after using GreenVibrance.</li>
            <li> I trust them completely.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until recently--after having the flu for several days--that this product really shined...    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a health kick lately, just trying to focus eating better and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I am gald to see they fixed the iron issue.  </li>
            <li> But overall I believe it is very helpful to my health.</li>
            <li> To get the old $58  price I need to subscribe now?  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of green veggies, but realize they are important to health and well being.  </li>
            <li> I exercise regularly and adhere to a very strict diet.  </li>
            <li> and she is essentials off her acid reflux medication completely.</li>
            <li> I will stop using it since the risk far outweighs the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I exercise regularly and have a diet that consists almost entirely of whole grains, veggies, fruits, legumes, and lean meat.</li>
            <li> However, there&#x27;s one more thing it&#x27;s done for me that cannot be attributed to placebo, the reason I&#x27;ll be buying Green Vibrance for the conceivable future.</li>
            <li> What I do know is that I&#x27;m completely sold on this product.     </li>
            <li> Yet, the benefits of this product far outweigh this inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I use this early in the morning, before my work out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had intestinal issues since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily?</li>
            <li> For the price that this lists for (and thank heaven for Amazon&#x27;s pricing) this should be a complete supplement,(of course with the exception of omega 3 fish oil).  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is far too much iron for an adult male.  </li>
            <li> AT LEAST 2 MORE MONTHS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old.</li>
            <li> So much of your daily needs.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference when I don&#x27;t have it daily.</li>
            <li> Like all green supplements, it doesn&#x27;t taste fantastic, but this one is palatable.  </li>
            <li> Old Review:   </li>
            <li> IT IS SO NATURAL .</li>
            <li> , which far exceeds the 10-mcg-per-34-ounce safety limit established by the Environmental Protection Agency.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> , that is the least amount of pain you can take for ensuring a healthy life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and a RN  </li>
            <li> I am overweight and had a complete lack of energy to make it through the day.</li>
            <li> I totally feel ready for the day.</li>
            <li> here are discussing the recent ConsumerLab report (Greens and Whole Foods Powders and Pills Review) about arsenic levels in this</li>
            <li> Makes the next morning much easier.</li>
            <li> and you know in you busy lifestyle</li>
            <li> My least favorite part (besides the smell of spirulina) is the foam that forms when you shake it up.</li>
            <li> and I now believe the antibiotics were killing everything in my gut, including the bacteria that go crazy when my body can&#x27;t digest fructose because suddenly I was able to enjoy fruits too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in complete shock that my body is allowing this to pass through my system without attacking it on all fronts.  </li>
            <li> but so far I want to hug this jar and every person who has a part in getting it from idea, to canister to my hands.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it had all the ingredients I was looking for, spirulina being the number one ingredient.</li>
            <li> but I confirmed with a rep that all the vitamins in Green Vibrance are ALSO all from plant sources though it doesn&#x27;t explicity say this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tasted like the scrapings from the bottom of a dairy water trough, complete with chunks of grass &amp; hay.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait 20 years for the CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT settlement check.</li>
            <li> Too much vitamin K, not enough C, B3, B6, B12 or A.</li>
            <li> With Dr Schulze, I could feel it coming alive after 3 or 4 days of use, and Dr. Schulze was helpful in weight loss.</li>
            <li> I just think of it as my &#x27;adult shot of tequila&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not a teenager loaded with natural energy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Fiber on the go &amp;#34;is sweetened with natural Stevia extract.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because he had a head injury and cant taste very well anymore</li>
            <li> Very impressing stuff, I just ordered my second 25.4 oz canister.  </li>
            <li> and I am a 58 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> 66 years old and still riding a bicycle  </li>
            <li> The taste is the same but the powder looked a bit lighter and much finer in constancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say \\&quot;cowboy up\\&quot; and be an adult about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and feel like I&#x27;m 20.</li>
            <li> I have been a natural health practitioner for 12 years</li>
            <li> so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way.</li>
            <li> I mix this with white grape juice in the blender, pour it over ice and drink it fast.</li>
            <li> Complete Greens,&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> I like that they have all organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Chlorella, soft cell</li>
            <li> i buy this for my ninety year old grandmother who refuses to get a computer.</li>
            <li> But I developed gradually insomnia.</li>
            <li> I found however I weighed the cons and the benefits so far anyway</li>
            <li> Been a nurse for over 20 years and my shoulders really ache when I do not take this daily.</li>
            <li> My energy level has increased and I will consider purchasing another bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> You know the old saying, \\&quot;if</li>
            <li> (wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars)</li>
            <li> This product really works for me and has become part of my regular diet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product consistently for a long time now.</li>
            <li> After 3rd day I woke up really with a boost that just may be this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get this issue fixed and get my refund</li>
            <li> I stir it well and suck it up fast thorugh a big straw.</li>
            <li> Since Green Vibrance was the only thing that I had changed, I decided to order another tub and immediately started feeling better once I began taking it again.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has become our family favorite to start the day for several reasons.</li>
            <li> I just purchased Green Vibrance through Amazon and the product they are now sending is Version 14.0, which is the most current version as of 08/01/13.  </li>
            <li> when u first start dont leave the bathroom area for about an hour; i would walk our dogs in the morning after drinking it in the beginning and find myself running home); at some point during the first few months u find yourself craving it as a beginning to your day-</li>
            <li> scoop of Green Vibrance, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Flax Milk, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Coconut Milk, 1 baby Coconut water &amp; meat (Use hatchet to get the coconut open), 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Almond Milk, 1 Chunk of Aloe Vera Leaf, 3 Tablespoons of: Cinnamon &amp; Pumpkin Spice, 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 tablespoons of Chia Seeds, dash of Sea Salt &amp; Stevia and 1 cup of Mountain Spring Water or more depending on the size of your blender.</li>
            <li> I am a person who eats more fruit than green leafy veggies, so this is my way to get all those necessary vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li> I used to smoke a pack a day, Ive never done well in school because of attention and energy issues, and I rarely ever exercised, I never really understood how everyone else did so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker nor do I consume caffeine through any form on a regular basis but Green Vibrance gives me better energy</li>
            <li> most likely will be buying Green Vibrance on Amazon, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Fairway.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> as all the others in my opinion, but its good so dont be shy, purchase it. ..</li>
            <li> it is the worse and have good energy until the next treatment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to taste good though as I usually have to choke it down.</li>
            <li> I exercise and eat right, but Green Vibrance is a big part of my success.</li>
            <li> , I can run about 9-10 miles, I have not smoked a single puff in over two years, and Ive been making solid straight A&#x27;s and almost have my batchelors, going for a masters or higher.</li>
            <li> Love Green Vibrance!!</li>
            <li> I used to be a regular juicer, but that involved hunting down quality organic produce, using a special wash, use plenty of the produce for decent amount of juice and then clean up the God-awful mess.</li>
            <li> I only had some slight sniffles with a very mild headache afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Also, none of my friends had the same jolly fun time on the toilet seat as I had.    </li>
            <li> Although, that is not the reason I have been taking it, I feel a bit better about skimping on food because I know my body is getting the necessary nutrients without sending it into starvation mode which slows down the metabolism even further.  </li>
            <li> , it tastes much better, it&#x27;s much less expensive, and it gives me more energy.</li>
            <li> Mix in half a scoop of Green Vibrance (any more, and it won&#x27;t really dissolve.)  </li>
            <li> I usually whisk it all up with a fork to make sure I get all the powder mixed up.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase from Vibrant Health through Amazon again.  </li>
            <li> Does not overpower other flavors, and gives me more energy than other brands out there.</li>
            <li> For the last 2 years I have suffered tremendously from airborne allergies such as dust, pollen, and vog, and the allergies have constantly triggered a downfall of my immune system.</li>
            <li> I tried adding to smoothies but, the only one that hid some of the flavor was a bahini smoothie which is mainly bananas.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have been overdoing it the past many years; this product just may be the key source of vitamins and minerals</li>
            <li> mix mine with either 8 oz of pineapple juice or orange juice (or a 1/2 and 1/2 combo, add 1/2 scoop of ON Platinum Hydrowhey or ON Gold Standard Whey Strawberry flavor, and a scoop of Vibrant Health&#x27;s Rainbow Superfood.</li>
            <li> The third time I ate it raw as suggested by my husband who thinks that it would be the best way to down a green powder</li>
            <li> I have tried other powders and they&#x27;re all pretty much the same to me</li>
            <li> The other reviews were right...</li>
            <li> This thing is high in fiber, and will make you regular, but not an emergency run to the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it both from an anecdotal perspective (mine) and from a medical perspective.</li>
            <li> but it is the opposite for me, this drink has a high pH).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for several years now, and I feel great after my daily shake that includes other ingredients such as oats, flax/hemp/chia seeds, bananas, blueberries, leafy greens (kale/spinach) , Coconut Oil and whatever else</li>
            <li> both short term (right after I take it) or long term(since</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended it to me, and he said he drinks it with half a packet of the individual Crystal Light peach teas.</li>
            <li> I mix Rainbow Vibrance with Field of Greens and Green Vibrance with a glass of strong flavored juice daily.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way i could do a full glass of it, i would never get it down!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so satisfied with Vibrant Health that the ONLY reason I won&#x27;t continue to use it is because they company provides a similar supplement that seems to provide the same ingredients only with a BIG UPPAGE of Vitamin B12 and a HUGE amount of Protein and with the satisfaction level I have with this product, I am looking forward to trying the other one I described in the previous sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only problem is it needs to be frozen or refrigerated after you open it, and the container is big, so its hard to fit it in there if your fridge/freezer is usually full.</li>
            <li> With the dogs and busy schedule I barely slept.</li>
            <li> As far as green powders go, this has the most wide array of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> After you get past the taste I enjoy drinking it now.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has kept me healthy and regular even with a recent surgery and while taking narcotics.</li>
            <li> Normally, I wake up several times during the night.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt; Having been so close to this product there is only one experience that I have had that is not necessarily negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they sell this product, as it is difficult to get enough greens in your diet, and can&#x27;t afford a fresh smoothie every day.</li>
            <li> I used to mix this in my morning shake, but then after reading about taking greens on an empty stomach for maximum absorption, I switched to taking it first thing in the morning with just water.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is not as sweet</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is full of green foods and probiotics and</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is so chocked full of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probiotics, that it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is the full list of ingredients for the 10.3 version of Green Vibrance:    </li>
            <li> Instead of suffering through 16 or more ounces of this mixed in water, I usually just pitch a scoop full of the powder on the back of my tongue and wash it down with water.</li>
            <li> I used to make a smootie with it, but now I make a quick shake, as I don&#x27;t have the time in the morning like I did before, with a little one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as I thought, it&#x27;s actually more bearable than my protein shakes, and tastes just fine in orange juice.  </li>
            <li> Like most smart shoppers, I was a bit skeptical because let&#x27;s admit it, as a supplement</li>
            <li> I guess I could do two shots to get the full one-scoop dose, but so far I seem to be getting results with only half, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also tickled to be able to buy a two-month&#x27;s supply for $50 because the one-month supply I&#x27;ve been buying from a health food store for $50 was getting to be a little harder to purchase each month -</li>
            <li> I did however personally contact Green Vibrance and received a detailed response the General Manager of that company which directly addressed my questions and concerns.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a very good product but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> One more note, after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One more note, after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The only new thing in my life was this product.</li>
            <li> I think I wrote a review on this several months ago but just wanted to let others know that there is a new version out.</li>
            <li> Because arsenic dissolves easily in water, rice (which is grown in water) sucks up metals and arsenic and rice crops</li>
            <li> There is an intense green food taste which is much stronger than wheatgrass.  </li>
            <li> At the local organic stores here it would be at least 20 dollars more.</li>
            <li> Now, I can drink as much milk as I want thanks to the probiotics in Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I came across the reviews for Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> However, I am also very skeptical about the true benefit of many supplements.  </li>
            <li> I actually liked Green Vibrance until I read the consumer labs report on &#x27;green powders&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Greens Vibrance is a green super food that helps balance acid in your system and does it at 30 to 60 calories each morning.   </li>
            <li> If u can&#x27;t cut up greens everyday for your juice or smoothie use this it gives u quick nutrious help</li>
            <li> Super Food gave me \\&quot;niacin flush\\&quot; and Green Vibrance doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have to drink it right down.  </li>
            <li> I literally gagged down one serving - and I can stomach most anything, and decided to give this a permanent thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I took no other vitamins I should consider a glass of greens a day.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, brown rice has higher concentrations of arsenic than white rice because arsenic is stored in the wheat germ which is removed during white rice</li>
            <li> , arsenic consumed in higher levels is extremely poisonous and the effects are cumulative.  </li>
            <li> If you do your research and think you need this stuff, buy it here and for no other reason than it&#x27;s the cheapest place I found it.</li>
            <li> I started taking this 3 years ago when I was having severe joint problems in every major joint.  </li>
            <li> I had major inflammation, according to my blood tests.  </li>
            <li> If we take no other supplements, we still take this.  </li>
            <li> I also notice a major difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> An all around winner since trying to eat right with what is available is time-consuming AND expensive.</li>
            <li> and so I try very hard to eat healthy, exercise and do what my Doctor says.</li>
            <li> Most of them taste like grass and is very hard to mix.</li>
            <li> health and the human immune system are far more complex and mysterious than any stat from any chemical</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have seen an overall increase in energy, regularity, and we have noticed that our skin is no longer dry, we have experienced minor weight loss, and oddly, I am experiencing less sensitivity during tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> If I am getting a cold or flu, i double the dosage and get better twice as quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty tight squeeze for someone on a fixed income.</li>
            <li> The taste of Green Vibrance is far superior to the other major green powder that I had been using.  </li>
            <li> However, overall i felt fine besides that localized discomfort -- a benefit I attribute to my regular use of green vibrance.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would call one scoop of anything a super food, but at least I can see the ingredients easily.</li>
            <li> Im sure this taste means high quality and quantity, but those benefits are useless if you don&#x27;t want to drink it.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers actually want to get independently certified by them because they are or appear to be impartial and hold a high standing in the community.</li>
            <li> The blood test results showed a low white blood cell count and high AST/ALT levels.</li>
            <li> and I like all kinds of veggies, but this stuff is pretty strong tasting and extremely noticeable even with a lot of other greens and veggies mixed in,  Other than the smell and taste the product</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste great but it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad at all.</li>
            <li> It must do wonders for the immune system and detoxifying the body in general.</li>
            <li> This information ratcheted up my alarm level about their lab reports in general.</li>
            <li> My nails are truly stronger, my hair seems healthier and thicker, I feel I also have a stronger constitution to defend communicable diseases and feel generally well over all.</li>
            <li> personally have consumed it every day for the past 2 years and don&#x27;t go a day w/o a scoop in a glass of filtered (fluoride free) water.  </li>
            <li> Loads of anti-allergics, Fumetrol &amp; Steroid inhalers will stay with me for the rest of my life, was pretty much the common verdict.</li>
            <li> It took me 6 days in the hospital and 10 days after discharge on a regimen of three different antibiotics to clear the infection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old, but,I swear I feel 15 - 20 years younger!  </li>
            <li> In the first 3 days, my skin went from average to glowing.  </li>
            <li> you could barely read it with a magnifying glass</li>
            <li> This boosted my metabolism, apparently.  </li>
            <li> The body does not have a natural way of getting rid of excess iron: only through blood donation or menstruation.  </li>
            <li> no attention span, no mental clarity, etc.</li>
            <li> You can barely taste it.  </li>
            <li> The doctor told me my lungs were functioning like a 69 year old after a PFT test, I am currently 37.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from frequent UTI&#x27;s and since drinking this regularly</li>
            <li> I mixed a scoop of Green Vibrance with sunny D, ice, and sugar free french vanilla creamer and drink it up.  </li>
            <li> ConsumerLab funding apparently derives NOT just from their substantial membership fee of $59 a year.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the only supplement to give a descent energy boost. .  </li>
            <li> I started taking the G.V. in the morning and have had energy I didnt think possible, also my liver pain has disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old, my back was hurting me, even though I was undergoing rehab for it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> My son barely turned 4</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old male suffering from lymphedema and it SEVERLY effects my immune system.</li>
            <li> I came back to add that I am 65 years old</li>
            <li> I was charged two different prices so far...</li>
            <li> We usually take in the morning and it is fulfilling and it does keep us full for a while.</li>
            <li> I mix the scoop full in a small jar with 3 ounces of Rice Dream and shake-em-up.</li>
            <li> Dr. Lisa Love, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]</li>
            <li> and it was more tolerable, but not great.</li>
            <li> Modified many times and they are getting worse.</li>
            <li> I really like that there is no artificial crap in there to make it taste better.  </li>
            <li> I really like that there is no artificial crap in there to make it taste better.  </li>
            <li> this review is in such a substantial place, I would hate for it to deter people from buying such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful product with vitamins, probiotics and green food combined.  </li>
            <li> How effective they are is difficult to know.</li>
            <li> but I do know that it is a healthy addition to my sometimes unhealthy diet</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we consumers must ask a lot of questions and do our own homework</li>
            <li> I switched to the pills and added fresh green juice to my diet.</li>
            <li> If you look at the vitamins in Schulze vs Green Vib, Dr. Schulze wins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;green\\&quot; powders that taste like dirt, grass, or worse, and I&#x27;m now hooked on this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does, I just know that I feel better and feel worse when I don&#x27;t take it</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to juice my own tomatoes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, as long as you can get by the taste!</li>
            <li> We are a little less moody and seem to handle stress better.</li>
            <li> I feel a little bit more energy in my work day and a bit less hungry as the day moves along as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a little more than the typical greens, and I like the fact that GV has the added and generous amounts of probiotics (as my condition is in the gastrointestinal and endocrine system - pancreas) and the adaptogen herbs.</li>
            <li> After researching the entire mess it seems after getting called-out for high levels of arsenic in GreenVibrance (even though organically bound forms of arsenic aren&#x27;t really a concern)</li>
            <li> We ran out of Tony Pure energy greens drink and a month later I tried the Vibrant Health Green drink again</li>
            <li> The taste of Green Vibrance and Super Food is about the same to me--Nasty!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed at the new found energy and alertness you experience, and say goodbye to colds as long as you&#x27;re on this stuff.      </li>
            <li> mix with fresh Pineapple, mango,bananna, non fat plain yogurt,</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance helps supplement my diet in all the right ways.</li>
            <li> first I thought this might have to do with me smoking one and a half pack of cigarette and drinking a lot of wine the night before, but I&#x27;ve been doing that since college.</li>
            <li> I was socially mortified!  </li>
            <li> I just drink it quickly to get past the taste.</li>
            <li> If I drink my Green Vibrance early in the day I feel like I have ingested a bushel of fresh, green veggies vibrant with life!</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with water and tank it quickly as the taste is an acquired one.</li>
            <li> As for the other comments about increase energy and all that, I can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> All without bringing any relief or improvement other than very marginal.</li>
            <li> intend to live a long time!</li>
            <li> Just toss in a blender with a few ounces of water and chug it down with your nose closed while having a strong chaser at the ready.</li>
            <li> There is no substitute for fresh, raw veggies and fruit juices</li>
            <li> I make kefir from fresh raw milk</li>
            <li> I travel far too much and always take Green Vibrance with me.</li>
            <li> I am doing this in hope of helping others as desperate as I am (hopefully was) to find a whole food based supplement, that would compliment my healthy diet and allow me to once again have energy and a feeling of wellness.</li>
            <li> If I get another 10.1 jar it will go back, so far the last 2 deliveries have been the newer version.  </li>
            <li> they sell the 30 day supply at a local health food place near me for the same price, so this price for 60 days just can&#x27;t be beat....  </li>
            <li> then I heard about this product from social networks</li>
            <li> and I only take on days that I don&#x27;t have time to make a fresh green drink.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the Trader Joe&#x27;s green powder has the same effect on me (tried it after GV), just not as pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I drink one scoop a day in milk and add a few drops of stevia, and now I can truthfully say that after just a few days I already feel healthier.</li>
            <li> They are the only manufacturer that actually, and very clearly, lists each and every ingredient with the individual dosage or amount for each ingredient on their label.</li>
            <li> I had made no other changes in my diet nor were there any outside factors affecting me.  </li>
            <li> I mix mine with a little appke juice and drink first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> So, I would try it and buy the small size first, then if you like, buy in bulk, because it will be cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I am not very old - early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It would be very hard and maybe even more expensive to juice so many fruits and veggies every day, along with adding probiotics.  </li>
            <li> Many reviewers have complained about receiving older versions in the past.  </li>
            <li> And the excitement over the new one lasts about as long as it did with the last one.    </li>
            <li> Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after.  </li>
            <li> If you want to make it taste better just add a teaspoon of Y.S. Organic Bee Farm raw organic honey which you can purchase here on Amazon for a little over $12 in a 2lb glass jar.  </li>
            <li> Medical experts tell us that we need to reduce the acidity in our diets and increase the alkaline levels, a factor in improving general health.</li>
            <li> To me there are other similar product that don&#x27;t cost as much that do just as well.</li>
            <li> All and All, I continue to see myself using this product as long as its developed.  </li>
            <li> I will never stop taking this product as long as I am alive.</li>
            <li> So apparently I had some internal digestive issues which was causing my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> so far I have came a long way</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, I tried to mix it in a green smoothie</li>
            <li> I AM TRYING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first canister of Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> The first few days, I wondered if it was just a placebo effect sort of thing.  </li>
            <li> I held my nose the first few times but after a week I started craving it, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> At first had trouble drinking it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it smells gross, it tastes worse and it won&#x27;t do anyone a bit of good if it stays in the container</li>
            <li> I tried plugging my nose and swiging it down as fast as I could....</li>
            <li> My heart and kidneys were very close to shutting down as I had a strep</li>
            <li> I am in Chemo treatment and it was really getting me down.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there is new growth, or just more luxurious and thick.</li>
            <li> It is recommended to take this product 30 minuted after a major meal because Green Vibrance assists the body with absorbing nutrients from the food one consumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of money on internists and rheumatologists throughout my adult life, and none of them have ever been able to find anything wrong with me.</li>
            <li> I am an over 50&#x27;s lady who goes to give blood every other month since my Dr. said my iron was too high.  </li>
            <li> and I believe this is due to the high amount of probiotics included in every serving.</li>
            <li> After finishing nearly the whole bottle I noticed a small label on the side.</li>
            <li> your objective is to increase performance strength look elsewhere unless your objective is to drop weight and detox your body before engaging in serious workouts with an alternative product.</li>
            <li> Have been using Green Vibrance for years and really notice the effects on my general health when I run out.</li>
            <li> We were interested in an alkalanizing green drink product and found this at our local health food store on a shelf \\&quot;recommended by Dr. Oz\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Unicity and green vibrance saved me from low immunine system problems ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have, the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green, nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had.</li>
            <li> the poor taste is easily offset by the benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> ;) and have been trying a couple different green drink products.</li>
            <li> This must have a decent amount of potassium perhaps as it seems to have benefited me physically (along with other things I&#x27;ll confess).</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other \\&quot;Greens\\&quot; formulas, I came back to Vibrant Health.</li>
            <li> I am an internist (MD) who happens to believe in nutritional supplementation and the positive effects of \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; measures to combat everyday ills--i.e.</li>
            <li> I take supplements as well, but this product started to have a positive effect on my health in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the larger Green Vibrance, which is a better deal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using pretty consistently for a few weeks now, but there seemed to be quite a bit of hype with this product that I am not sure of.  </li>
            <li> Although Green Vibrance is a bit pricier than other supergreen products, my mom said the taste is the most tolerable among other brands that she has tried.</li>
            <li> And, I quit taking my high dose vitamin D supplement, as well as various other supplements, because this covers them too.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work better if you start with less and slowly build up to the suggested amount.</li>
            <li> I was very loyal to Vitaforce, but I&#x27;ve decided to make a switch to Green Vibrance for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> I think it would be impossible to consume ALL the fine healthy ingredients in this product on a daily basis any other way!!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted to love this product; have taken other liquid greens and can take a lot of stuff, but not this; but they refunded money so no problem!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s cheap insurance - certainly not harmful in any way, and the small amount of nutrition in each scoop only can help.</li>
            <li> Not only does this include a long list of standard vitamins and nutrients, but it also contains a WIDE variety of probiotics, Spirulina, Chlorella, Organic Kelp, Organic Flaxseed concentrate, Ginger root, and a whole host of plant-based antioxidants and adaptogens.</li>
            <li> Hundreds of \\&quot;Verified Buyers\\&quot; got positive results from GREEN VIBRANCE that they could actually feel, then posted their reviews here.</li>
            <li> and so made a lot of positive changes in my life, and taking Green Vibrance regularly was one of those changes.  </li>
            <li> but this is a little much.</li>
            <li> Could not even hide the taste of new mowed lawn in other foods or drinks.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health also informed me they don&#x27;t directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance!  </li>
            <li> of that being said I will probably use this product again in the future and would reccomend it to those with special diets who may be missing out on some key vitamins and minerals due to dietary deficiency, especially those who follow a vegan diet.</li>
            <li> One word of caution.. in people undergoing chemotherapy who are neutropenic (i.e. extremely low white blood cell count--under 1000) the pro-biotics can potentially be harmful (i.e. even the good bacteria can be bad under these condtions).  </li>
            <li> I have been taking Green Vibrance for only a few months, and thought I was doing my body a huge favor.</li>
            <li> I did a little research after being recommended Green Vibrance only to find out that it is not a Vegan friendly</li>
            <li> We may not know how to technically boost our immune system, but learning how to feed our body the right nutrients can at least help us not damage our immune system further.  </li>
            <li> For awhile I added it to 1 cup milk, 4 large frozen strawberries, 2 raw eggs and some stevia in the blender as my breakfast</li>
            <li> For awhile I added it to 1 cup milk, 4 large frozen strawberries, 2 raw eggs and some stevia in the blender as my breakfast</li>
            <li> Unless you can afford to buy strictly organic, the fresh produce you eat is usually bombarded with a constant chemical onslaught: pre-emergent soil herbicides, seed fungicides, pesticides, more fungicides for shipping, and often further chemicals to artificially ripen in the produce</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any energy change, however I&#x27;ve noticed my hunger throughout the day is less intense and less frequent.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth a serious second</li>
            <li> and once they get past the green look, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Green Vibrance as my main source of supplementation and save money by no longer purchasing vitamins the way I formerly did.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, and trying four of these supplements over the last 60 days, I have decided that Vibrant Health&#x27;s Green Vibrance is the winner by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contacted Vibrant Health, the manufacturer of Green Vibrance, and they informed me the current version is 11.0.  </li>
            <li> Each day, I shoveled, I would drink the vibrant  health green vibrance prior to going out there.</li>
            <li> scoop Vibrant Health green Vibrance (scoop comes in the container-dig deep</li>
            <li> I am shocked to see the report from ConsumerLab.com that it contains high levels of arsenic (24.3 mcg) including the most toxic and carinogen type of inorganic arsenic.</li>
            <li> I do think the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> A couple sales people at Super Supplements recommended it over other brands, telling me that although there are less expensive alternatives, Green Vibrance uses high quality ingredients without cheap fillers to reduce the cost.</li>
            <li> This product is not all natural, people with heart problems should be very careful in using this product.  </li>
            <li> After learning about this from the review, I am not happy when I think about how long I have been ingesting a huge amount of Iron.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this powder pretty much daily for awhile now - at least a year.</li>
            <li> Their analysis of Vibrant Health Green Vibrance revealed that each serving contains 24.3 mcg of arsenic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Vibrant Health Green Vibrance was found to contain 24.3 mcg of arsenic per scoop (12.1 grams).</li>
            <li> Hopefully, Vibrant Health will test the ingredients in Green Vibrance to determine the source of arsenic contamination and eliminate it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> We had been using All Day Energy Greens from the Institute for Vibrant Living before we compared ingredients to Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I know that Spirulina, one the ingredient in green vibrant can causes constipation.</li>
            <li> My main reason for posting this review is for folks like me who don&#x27;t like the taste of Green Vibrance.  </li>

            <li> On a recommendation of a colleague, I tried Vibrant Health Green Vibrance--of course, after a bit of research.  </li>

            <li> I have been taking Vibrant Green for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> She recommended Vibrant Green and blessed us with a 25 oz.</li>
            <li> I start the day with a smoothie using vibrant green.  </li>
            <li> found this vibrant green on amazon based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using Vibrant green Vibrance for over two years.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance originated when the founders of Vibrant Health declared jihad on all plant-kind.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started taking the Vibrant Health Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> In the future I am only going to purchase fresh, current versions of Green Vibrance!!!  </li>
            <li> Then as age and hormone luck would have it I came down with what I thought was the flu, during my work weeks when I&#x27;d snack on raw veggie sticks for convenience I&#x27;d be stuffy nosed, scratchy throat, running to the bathroom, on weekends I&#x27;d feel a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> I often feel dark greens and other important vegetable nutrients are missing in my diet.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance comes highly recommended, and your price was way lower than any others I found online or in health/vitamin stores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this green drink.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I have found Green Vibrance to be one of the healthier choices for me to make I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> And, you spent less money than you would have if you had packed a lunch for the two months straight</li>
            <li> I had been using Dr. Schulze&#x27;s Super Food, another green powder supplement, when my son and I compared the ingredient list of that and the one he was using, Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that because of the price I decided to switch over to Garden of Life&#x27;s RAW Green Super food powder instead.</li>
            <li> Just hope it works, and that I really am getting all the veggies and fruits I need in one large glass of green stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Usually my skin looks this way when I&#x27;m jogging and eating a VERY balanced diet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li> To drink it, I mix it with a small glass of juice and \\&quot;down\\&quot; the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> Just at least try this first.      </li>
            <li> I am not sure what to really say about this product.</li>
            <li> but this has just as much if not more for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO TELL ANY DIFFERANCE  IN THE WAY I FEEL.</li>
            <li> I work long hours and don&#x27;t always have time to eat properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short</li>
            <li> Overall, because of all the yummy goodness inside of it, and whether the taste is what it is, its something I will continue to buy and use for a long time.</li>
            <li> Just last week I doubled the Green Vibrance powder in my morning shake and wow what a difference!</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance helps me feel normal.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy Vibrant Health Green Vibrance again!</li>
            <li> it also seems to have kept my immune system functioning great because I have not gotten sick since my detoxing prior to being the Vibrance Green.  </li>
            <li> Other parts of the US have high levels due to farming practices.</li>
            <li> It was just hard for me to believe a scoop of powder could make any real difference, but now i&#x27;m convinced it actually does.  </li>
            <li> This is our new green juice...</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the taste than knowing i&#x27;m downing more sugar or artificial sweeteners which i don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> tighter, healthier looking skin, way more energy, calmness,and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a cold, regardless of being around those who do.</li>
            <li> You are far far less hungry typically</li>
            <li> The mental clarity and physical energy this brought even allowed me to comprehend emotional issues I wasn&#x27;t confronting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions.</li>
            <li> The only reason, and only ONE reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does taste like you are eating the wet ground of a rainforest.</li>
            <li> Just to clear up the false claim that the product had too much iron.</li>
            <li> Yeah, tastes bad - learn to love it!</li>
            <li> I believe green vibrance has &#x27;fixed&#x27; me!  </li>
            <li> I had a slight allergic reaction the first few times I took it.</li>
            <li> I ran out yesterday and boom- fever back up, energy back down, aches and pains back with a vengeance...  </li>
            <li> Those who reported increased energy have likely understated the improvement, based in my initial results, or they may not have been as down and out on a regular basis as I</li>
            <li> I seriously gag if just drinking it straight!</li>
            <li> I have to say that the energy boost I&#x27;ve gotten from this product, is unparalleled in any other green foods supplement that I&#x27;ve tried, and the results came much quicker.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews that different vendors had different versions I decided to order from Amazon</li>
            <li> We have been using it for about two weeks as directed and we have seen small changes mainly with digestion.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance happens to be one of those products with a kitchen sink full of herbs in addition to the green foods like spirulina and other beneficial ingredients.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still old, but I have seen an improvement in the \\&quot;crepey-ness\\&quot; (not, creepy-ness) of my skin, less dry.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;One supplement, Vibrant Health’s “Green Vibrance” product, contained roughly 24 micrograms of the carcinogen arsenic per .4-ounce serving [yes</li>
            <li> After reading a wide variety of web reviews I bought the 15 package box of Green Vibrance By Vibrant Health.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your everyday health and stamina!</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after becoming sick with pneumonia about a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking green vibrance for a little over 60 days now consistently</li>
            <li> I tried juicing, but the juices I made were too hard on my digestive system and made me very nauseus, not to mention they were a lot of work to make.</li>
            <li> I began feeling a little funny after a few days of being around her but continued my powder.</li>
            <li> His complaint was that in the 10.1 version the Iron content is very high and the newer version is lower.  </li>
            <li> (it even works better than the targeted solutions like Wellness Formula or myCommunity Host Defence) at keeping the cold at bay.</li>
            <li> In fact, the use of this product has actually interferred with my past complete vitamin program.  </li>
            <li> Have energy all day long without additional coffee or energy drinks.  </li>
            <li> I felt mentally and physically balanced.  </li>
            <li> and I am around sniffling, sneezing kids all day long.  </li>
            <li> I think it beats taking a multivitamin by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I have bought four of these so far and take a scoop everyday along with my fiance.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have been taking green super-foods for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Takes a few drinks to get used to, but fruit helps sweeten it naturally</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to that as long as you&#x27;re on this stuff.    </li>
            <li> Source Natural Wellness Formula, Nordic Naturals Omega 3, myCommunity Host Defence Musrooms caps &amp; Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> It took me way too long to come to terms with the fructose issues, never could do sodas or overly sugary products as a kid.  </li>
            <li> It took me way too long to figure out what was causing all of my abdominal issues, and they were plenty.  </li>
            <li> I read the label before purchasing this and was admittedly terrified by the addition of apples but after careful comparison of grams and milligrams on what levels of fructose actually set me off</li>
            <li> That put me at several weeks at the two scoops with literally no improvement in any area that this should affect (mental fog lifting, energy, improved digestion from the probiotics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or will use it and have reactions or side effects (or even long term effects) they don&#x27;t realize are coming from an herb or herbs in the product.     </li>
            <li> I want all of the money back that i spent over the years on this trash.</li>
            <li> I have been long time user of this product and have found it to keep my energy levels</li>
            <li> In complete honesty if someone is just transitioning to a green supplement powder they may want to try this product in tablet form.</li>
            <li> chronologically 65, but mentally, feel</li>
            <li> Improved digestion (so long</li>
            <li> I changed my entire program and went from eating meat to totally vegan and only drinking green drinks.</li>
            <li> After taking green vibrance a couple of times I felt like my old self</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update later after its empty.</li>
            <li> I actually still am curious to try it with the strawberry and banana, til then roasted seaweed in liquid form</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference with overall energy levels approximately a week after starting this product.</li>
            <li> You could survive a long time on this, lose weight and still be healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an RN and work long hours for days at a time and this is what keeps me going.</li>
            <li> Toss a scoop of Green Vibrance in a blender with some fresh pineapple, raspberries, a small banana, and 4-5 oz. of orange juice or water.</li>

            <li> Used to be a real challenge to get myself to drink it in the morning, but my body adjusted slowly.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any residue left in the cup, I add water and get the last of it down.  </li>
            <li> I can positively say that over 90% of the reviews were the first reviews of the reviewer, which leads me to be a little skeptical.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t report anything yet due to the fact that  I Using Energy Green by Institute For Vibrant Living.  </li>
            <li> Vibrant Health has always tested its products for the presence of arsenic and other heavy metals.</li>
            <li> ) CONSISTENCY: Typically, I take a full serving size of Green Vibrance (12.1 grams which is 1 scoop, scoop included), and mix that with Green Plant juice from Trader Joe&#x27;s or an organic juice, and refrigerated water.  </li>
            <li> It has been a few months on this now, and I absolutely do not want to live without it.</li>
            <li> You know how easy it is pass a cold back and forth from your kids.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t subtle at all, made me extremely shaky, mostly in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> Before ordering, I picked up a smaller supply from my local healthfood store to test it and as a comparison to what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the taste, but I have tried other products similar, all with similar taste.</li>
            <li> I mean I really tried and wanted to , but ...</li>
            <li> from other reports possibly also other heavy metal contaminants at high levels.</li>
            <li> It really does not taste bad at all if you mix with a bit of juice and water, and my significant other who takes this with me concurs that it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was reading the reviews and noticed one that only had one star due to the Iron content he found in version 10.1 and below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I had been using other \\&quot;greens-to-go\\&quot; type products as a way to get extra greens in my diet.  </li>
            <li> Other then that, I don&#x27;t feel or look any different.</li>
            <li> It is now on my bi-monthly subscribe and save offering and it will stay there as long as it is remains offered!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;Greens&amp;#34; this one seems to be standing the test of longevity and is actually palatable.  </li>
            <li> I realized that a serving of this doesn&#x27;t even come close to the fructose load of an actual apple and the dextrose and other products set it off, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li> Blend it in a smoothie and get all the benefits of probiotics plus all the other necessary nutrients needed.</li>
            <li> I get all the necessary ingredients in one scoop without the need to take other vitamins, enzymes and probiotics.</li>
            <li> After opening it, the product looked a little different from my last can.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what kind of picky eaters you all are to think this stuff is so nasty tasting, but I enjoy the flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on medication to keep me awake throughout the day due a &#x27;medical mistake&#x27; years ago.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that 4 page nutrition ingredient list! :)    </li>
            <li> Interactions: Below is a list of ingredients in this product which actually conflict which each other (I entered all ingredients at [...] to get this list).</li>
            <li> The taste was bearable like any other powder supplement I drink, no big deal nothing to fuss about.</li>
            <li> Use it daily in my smoothies and sometimes add to soups or other foods.</li>
            <li> So I would first like to say I am one of those selfish A-Holes that never goes back to rate items though I have purchased countless items off amazon.</li>
            <li> The recent endoscopy and colonoscopy shows no damage due to the bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Even mixing it with OJ and every other liquid in my fridge still makes it taste like gross OJ or</li>
            <li> They still offer Green Max and some other new powders</li>
            <li> I also agree with other reviewers that this stuff makes you very regular and that means that toxins do not stay in your body for very long.   </li>
            <li> I eat a lot of greens in my daily diet, but it can be hard to stuff pounds of greens in during a busy schedule.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a low cal vanilla shake and it tastes really good, however, it&#x27;s not too bad by itself (just very green tasting).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just over a week, so I&#x27;ll be happy to give further updates and let you know if I get use to the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> She loves it dry from my hand</li>
            <li> I feel very optimistic that I have found a whole food supplement that is providing my body with the nutrients it has been desperately seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Before taking this I was on daily alpha lipoic acid, green tea, grape seed, CoQ10, and a daily multi</li>
            <li> any potential concern about the arsenic levels has been addressed to my satisfaction by the commitment by the manufacturer to manage the levels in this product and actively work to reduce them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few hours later my blood sugar was way low</li>
            <li> The only thing I had done differently was try the Green Vibrance.    </li>
            <li> I began taking green vibrance daily starting from June 2011 till December 2011.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the number one food supplement I will not live without.  </li>
            <li> This is also the 4th green drink I have tried and no other compares.</li>
            <li> Green vibrance has been a major factor in my recovering from pneumonia.</li>
            <li> Initially it is a little odd to be drinking something so green and people less committed to natural health find that to be too much.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE ONE is still taking it, despite the dollar per day cost.  </li>
            <li> I want the benefits, but I have choked and gagged and spit out and cussed at every single one I tried.  </li>
            <li> some are very subtle with little to no noticeable benefit, but i really felt the difference with my first serving of Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most complete green powders I have seen and in my opinion does not have a bad taste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several green foods supplements, and had been taking another product called Vitaforce, that had been recommended to me by a natural foods store clerk, when I decided to do a test comparison with Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Tastes like seaweed at low tide with raw fish mixed in -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m low maintenance, and down mine with just 8 oz. of water.</li>
            <li> I tried it in juice, in a smoothie, but there just is no way possible to choke this down.  </li>
            <li> Since giving birth to my second child 20 months ago my energy level has been down.</li>
            <li> I have looked long and hard for  a natural supplement to suit my body and life style.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, I too have not caught any flu or colds since starting my daily scoop of Green Vibrance.    </li>
            <li> The smoothies I make are filling and I actually save money over time because I am eating less.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as some said - the taste is pretty awful, but then most of them are.</li>
            <li> I was actually encouraged to buy double what I purchased previously because you guys featured it for dollars less than the competitors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For about the same price you can purchase another green drink that passed the arsenic and heavy metal testing - there are at least 10 out there that did in fact pass with relatively low arsenic levels - much lower (up to 5x lower) levels of arsenic according to the lab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, I could only drink half a glass of milk a day before I would get indigestion.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re only less than 1/2 way through it.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the cold powder from the freezer mixing with a glass of cool water, with a spoon only.  </li>
            <li> The following year I drank a scoop of this stuff every morning and evening (along with a small scoop of the Rainbow Vibrance they also sell), and I&#x27;m never turning back.</li>
            <li> but servings sizes are significantly less for the same size</li>
            <li> I have been dieting really heavy as of late, and I wanted something that was low calorie, yet highly packed with nutrients.</li>
            <li> Older version (version 10.1) is the one with incredibly high, almost dangerous level of iron.  </li>
            <li> I just put a scoop into a cup, add very cold water to cover- maybe a tiny but more.</li>
            <li> I drink this stuff every day mixed with a little juice or metamucil or nothing.</li>
            <li> I too was alarmed and almost joined myself last night until I dug a little deeper.</li>
            <li> I give it to my kids in the morning mixed with a little orange juice</li>
            <li> When I stopped taking I definitely feel a little</li>
            <li> A little back history about myself.  </li>
            <li> mixed it with V8 juice and a little pickle juice</li>
            <li> But mixed with a little OJ</li>
            <li> Note that high concentration of iron is not a GOOD thing at all: a lot of maladies are associated with this.  </li>
            <li> The when I release my breath I hardly feel the taste cause its almost completely flushed out.</li>
            <li> My diet is not very healthy and these make up for my daily nutritional deficiencies.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend those who are not sure to buy this once and take it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Green Vibrance hoping to enhance my overall health and was also hoping for a little extra energy as well.  </li>
            <li> You can pay less out there for other seemingly similar powders, but, no joke, do yourself a favor and buy this instead.      </li>
            <li> I seriously have mixed it in water with it completely dissolving, but I drink it down without taking a breath</li>
            <li> At the very last gulp, you get this foam that makes it hard to get the last bit.</li>
            <li> I finally got down to 145 and seemed to plateau, however, this morning I weighed 142!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll never be able to find out because it tastes so bad</li>
            <li> , so this stuff tastes as bad as many of the reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li> Great news for my face, horrible news for the rest of me.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying GV for at least 1 1/2 years and have not seen GV at such a low price.</li>
            <li> The only way I see to have a balanced vitamin and mineral regimen while taking this product is to purchase individual Calcium and Magnesium, Zinc, and B complex vitamins.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive but in stores the same size container is almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd jar of Green Vibrance I&#x27;ve ordered.  </li>
            <li> This is my last stop for green superfood</li>
            <li> I have been on the automatic delivery of this product from amazon and the current jar of Green vibrance</li>
            <li> If you have never had a green drink, I would start with a smaller container to see if you even like it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle product, but I was looking for something nutritious and as GREEN as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have tried making this drink without the Green Vibrance and my energy level is just not the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance every morning for the last 5 years upon my naturopathic doctor&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I stopped drinking coffee two weeks ago and continued with Green Vibrance daily.</li>
            <li> one thing I do know is that things definitely come out green.</li>
            <li> 1 scoop green vibrance  1/2 banana  1 tbsp fish oil/cod liver oil (carlson&#x27;s or norwegian naturals)  1 scoop hemp or whey protein  1 cup apple or grape juice</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I saw my doctor a few days later and brought a copy of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to discontinue immediately, a total waste of money and pay to get an EEG in a neurology.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to discontinue immediately, a total waste of money and pay to get an EEG in a neurology.  </li>
            <li> and I even add a tablespoon of Chia seed to my daily \\&quot;green cocktail\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> I began taking Green Vibrance after my third child was born and my husband was deployed overseas for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Its careful balance of ingredients worked to improve my energy, mood and sense of well-being.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been drinking this (for a week), I only wake up one time - and a few nights I didn&#x27;t wake up at all.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is one of those things I discovered through the Amazon product ratings (such a helpful resource).</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been taking Green Vibrance for several years now.  </li>
            <li> I have only taken Green Vibrance for about 2 months</li>
            <li> Tried it with a few different juices</li>
            <li> this product (and a few others like it) are a viable and practical way to ingest all those daily greens for your optimal health.</li>
            <li> its only been a few days</li>
            <li> I finally decided on Green Vibrance after reading reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li> not much yet.</li>
            <li> It is bitter to the taste, even will grape drink.</li>
            <li> It gives me energy and give me mental acuity.  </li>
            <li> the company has responded to the exposure by not only committing to monitoring and lowering heavy metal levels but also to measure arsenic levels in all ingredients and do an assessment of the levels in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using a scoop of Green Vibrance in my daily protein shakes.  </li>
            <li> I use a scoop of Green Vibrance daily along with almond milk, frozen fruit, an apple, 1/2 scoop of protein powder, and ice in my blender.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Several years ago a friend turned me on to Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> If Green Vibrance did nothing for you, you&lt;br /&gt;may want to check out Dr. Schulze, for your next foray into superfoods.</li>
            <li> Was on different types of medications for blood pressure and overweight before staring this product now that I have been using Green Vibrance for over a year I have lost 40 pounds and I no longer have the need to take any blood pressure medications.</li>
            <li> I had trouble to digest my food and my immunine system was very Low</li>
            <li> I went to see dermatoligyst spent $500 for virus medicine</li>
            <li> Also, most of the store-brands contain artificially created versions of the different vitamins, the hazards of which range from poor absorption, not being used correctly by the body, or being possibly harmful.</li>
            <li> I also  suffer from joint pain I can tell you that since I starting taking Green Vibrance I have not taken any pain killers at all.  </li>
            <li> Is harder to use than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now and just recently started purchasing it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I drank lots of water and got plenty of sleep and only had those systems for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lots of products out there in the powdered green drink market, but not all are equal.</li>
            <li> This green powder is the ONLY thing that allows me to eat or drink without pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different greens and this is has become my go-to</li>
            <li> He mixed a cup of cranberry juice with a scoop of green vibrance powder.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had found out about green vibrance earlier in my life.</li>
            <li> you are poor and like, &#x27;Man, I can&#x27;t really afford this&#x27;.</li>
            <li> another try a few months later.  </li>
            <li> I poached my husband&#x27;s low sodium V-8, poured 5 ounces into a glass, added a scoop of Green and stirred well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bitter.</li>
            <li> Ever since I began a daily regiment of Green Vibrance, my WBC count and liver enzyme levels have improved incrementally.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, nothing else has changed in my daily routine besides the addition of Green Vibrance to my diet.</li>
            <li> Ascorbic Acid decreases effects of Wheat Germ by unknown mechanism.</li>
            <li> When possible, do not consume Green Tea Extract within 1 hour before or 2 hours after giving Iron salts.  </li>
            <li> I am a TOTAL wimp when it comes to green drinks.  </li>
            <li> I used to take Vitamineral Green as my daily nutrition supplement but had to stop because of cost and a change in my employment situation.  </li>
            <li> A dear friend who is battling pancreatic cancer told us about Green Vibrance and it has been a  part of our daily supplement for close to a year.  </li>
            <li> The store clerk noticed and suggested I put some of the supplements back and use Green Vibrance instead.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried several green drinks.</li>
            <li> Careful coming off of it though, it can make you itchy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;best to dissolve it into NAKED juices Green Machine, use a Shaker.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of supplements, and take careful note as to how they make me feel.</li>
            <li> I take this product everyday mixed with OJ, and a bit of whey powder for breakfast.  </li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks, it&#x27;s only been 30 min since I drank it</li>
            <li> You never know the real reasons behind these kinds of things, but for me it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Been taking Green Vibrance for over a year and can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> I am overweight and have Type 2 Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome, fatty liver, and very low energy.</li>
            <li> I really think it might be the most horrible tasting thing ever.  </li>
            <li> Continued taking Green Vibrance and after a few days the side effect sub sided completely.</li>
            <li> I will be honest it taste like crap</li>
            <li> I weigh the profound benefits of consuming life-giving raw vegetables and green supplements, arsenic is a very minor issue at this</li>
            <li> I opened up my package and mixed a scoop with cold water right away.</li>
            <li> I keep another plain glass of water next to it.</li>
            <li> Even if you find that you receive the wrong item/version, ALWAYS contact support, they will set you right, either by sending you a replacement or refunding your money.</li>
            <li> Though that much I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the green vibrance or the fish oil I started taking about a week and a half ago, or maybe them working together.  </li>
            <li> Have tried several other green products and did not like the taste or the fact they did not mix well in smoothies or water.</li>
            <li> Every other manufacturer of green supplements lists only the amount by grouping of &amp;#34;proprietary ingredients&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d recommend the product but at almost $60 for a two month supply I&#x27;d say only buy it if you&#x27;re serious about taking using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about paying an arm and a leg for Athletic Greens (which costs MORE for a 30-day supply than a 60-day supply of Vibrant Health Greens does) while being stuck on some auto shipment program just to drink a nasty shake every morning.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t give me the same \\&quot;spark\\&quot; that GofL RAW Meal used to.</li>
            <li> I love a cold glass of Green Vibrance to start my day!</li>
            <li> Usually during the year and especially the winter time i will get a stomach virus of some sorts that means i get 101-103 degree fever and all kinds of rough things for 24 hours happen.</li>
            <li> i went from getting sick roughly 8-10 times a year down to 1-2 at most.</li>
            <li> I take a little less than a scoopful before a cardio workout and it gives me a big energy boost.</li>
            <li> I will continue to take Green Vibrance as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> The other issue I have is the soy lecithin.  </li>
            <li> Some report clearer skin, lower blood pressure &amp; other antioxidant benefits.  </li>
            <li> If you check out my other reviews you will see I don&#x27;t rave about everything.</li>
            <li> I just noticed it the other day.</li>

            <li> I may give them 5 after all if I see other benefits of using.  </li>
            <li> The taste can be muted by mixing with other jucies.</li>
            <li> The other drink I was using had print</li>
            <li> and they did not detail the ingredients other than listing the ingredients (</li>
            <li> also  compared it  with  other  products  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , it was pretty expensive</li>
            <li> other things to note.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please be cautious and read the ingredients carefully!  </li>
            <li> Please be cautious and read the ingredients carefully!  </li>

            <li> This progressed to my arms and other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it tastes like grass on</li>
            <li> After my trips I usually sleep the next day until 12 pm</li>
            <li> The review that states to stay away from this product due to the iron content is incorrect.  </li>
            <li> other protein powders &amp; almond milk and flavored coconut water.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE MENOPAUSE SYMTOMS!!!&lt;br /&gt;One time we left on a five day mini vacation</li>
            <li> I also do not know why the warning was on one of the containers and not on the other.</li>
            <li> This product could also be listed as Vegan were it not for the probiotics contained; other than those, the product is vegan.</li>
            <li> I have looked at other &amp;#34;comparable brands&amp;#34; - but nothing comes close to the quality and the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from my local health food store, but I cannot find anyone that can beat this price.</li>
            <li> If you eat alot of salads, spinach or other forms of vitamin K, you may want to avoid this.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why you are considering buying this product, but if you are looking for some regularity and consistency in your day to day private business</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect the flavours of the other ingredients yet gives me the greens I need.</li>
            <li> It also has a ton of other beneficial nutrients.  </li>
            <li> For me the solution is to mix with Low Sodium V8 and add a few shots of Tabasco!</li>
            <li> Several months have passed with no more itching.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily for the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Now, they&#x27;re offering all these different &#x27;versions&#x27; which I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about.  </li>

            <li> &quot; Warning, this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely worried I searched on Google and found a law suit against the company claiming many of the products contained dangerous levels of lead!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please vote this review up to warn other people about the danger of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (just read the label to see all the other good-for-you ingredients are in there).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is from the product, but it is the only thing that was introduced in my life.</li>
            <li> , I also had a 3 month long headache that went away after 3 days on Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand I&#x27;ve never tasted anything nastier, even when I&#x27;ve tried to mask the taste with a variety of juices and other concoctions.</li>
            <li> my body doesn&#x27;t feel stressed anymore.i feel the drive to get it done,now I do take other supplements as well</li>
            <li> I started taking this stuff once a day, or every other day.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from pain due to circulation problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also due for a check up.  </li>
            <li> I mix one scoop with a banana, other fruit, almond milk, and ice.</li>
            <li> I have never taken any supplements before OTHER than my multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> I have stomach problems due to bacteria and have allergies to antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple years and I have other people also using.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from extreme fatigue.  </li>
            <li> Yours might be orange juice or some other juice.</li>
            <li> Although this is only slightly less than the amount of inorganic arsenic in a serving of Green Vibrance, a scoop of Green Vibrance weighs only about 12 grams, meaning that the concentration of inorganic arsenicin Green Vibrance is around 5 times that in rice.</li>
            <li> It seems a little expensive, but then again whats your health worth?</li>
            <li> I wanted a greens powder that had a very wide variety of nutrients in generous amounts as well.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to take and did not taste bad.  </li>
            <li> I love this green stuff, and the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It tastes like the way cow manure smells....</li>
            <li> I read scientific literature stating the benefits of consuming active cultures for stress as well as brain</li>
            <li> Also, I have horrible cramps, and my cycle was almost pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for a little over a week now and noticing a difference in my energy so far, no longer crave my usual two shots of espresso in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suspecting that the tub itself is not very good for in the freezer and need to put in a different storage container.  </li>
            <li> If I need a pick-me-up or haven&#x27;t eaten enough vegetables, I put my scoop of Green Vibrance in a cup, add a tad of hot water, stir to dissolve, then fill with cold water.</li>
            <li> hope other people don&#x27;t have to feel the extreme disappointment I felt at forking out such a high price for lead and arsenic...</li>
            <li> This was a reorder and if it doesn&#x27;t get too expensive, I certainly plan on continuing to reordering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years, I was shocked when I learned the significant arsenic contamination !</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m continuing to strive for more, doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all taking consideration that I have taken other greens in the past</li>
            <li> I have 2 other jars from amazon that are the 10.3 version and the Iron content is much less</li>
            <li> use this as a breakfast supplement in the morning because I have a hard time finding the time and money to invest in cooking myself proper meals with vegetables.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review because I didn&#x27;t see anyone addressing specific allergies in the reviews and it made the purchase really hard for me to justify considering the risk.</li>
            <li> Add this daily to my morning protein shake; blended, I hardly notice the taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I come to find out it has been demonstrated by lab testing to be very high in arsenic and</li>
            <li> I recently purchase Rainbow Vibrance and I mix a small scoop with the Green Vibrance for added nutrition.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, I&#x27;m 25 now, but when I consume this, I feel like I have the energy I did in my late teens.     </li>
            <li> I even got my friend taking it including his whole family who are some seriously skeptical southerners.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommended - at least try it 30 days and you&#x27;ll see why.</li>
            <li> I drink it every morning, or at least by lunchtime, mixed in my smoothie…</li>
            <li> the bulk of their testing is random samples collected/purchased from general commercial lines.</li>
            <li> We drink it everyday either in smoothies (with some cilantro that helps cancel out the taste) or mixed with water (usually hold my nose).</li>
            <li> He reminded me he had ordered the Green Vibrance a year or so ago (when he had an unknown sickness at the time) and it was in the freezer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for you but taste nasty!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our healthy Bloody Mary.</li>
            <li> short, the company is forced by the State of California to print a label on this product to warn consumers of toxic chemicals within.</li>
            <li> It might be good to my body, but I can&#x27;t force myself to drink it, it&#x27;s horrible...</li>
            <li> The only down side to this mix is that it tastes nasty, but when blended together with sunny d, ice, and sugar free french vanilla creamer, it tastes like a creamcicle!!!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t taste bad and I took it as a supplement to the other green drink I use (Vitamineral Green) because the Green Vibrance has more probiotics that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> one morning after I held down some oatmeal, I decided to take this out of the freezer and drink a serving.  </li>
            <li> I mix with water and guzzle it down.</li>
            <li> hands  down.</li>
            <li> I just mix a scoop with about 3 oz of water and a drop of liquid stevia and chug it down</li>
            <li> I use grape juice to her it down.</li>
            <li> Now I just mix it with ¾ cup of orange juice and ¾ cup water and use it to wash down my pills before bed.  </li>
            <li> Now I just mix it with ¾ cup of orange juice and ¾ cup water and use it to wash down my pills before bed.  </li>
            <li> i gagged and gagged and gagged and my kitchen counters had to be wiped down........</li>
            <li> It has got to be chugged down, then chased with water.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I can choke down almost any drink .</li>
            <li> I mix it with water and down it</li>
            <li> I drink my scoop every morning in about 4 oz of water and down the hatch.</li>
            <li> i mix it with some grape juice to help it down.</li>
            <li> it all came down on my digestive system.  </li>
            <li> Fifty dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way down there)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It breaks this all down.</li>
            <li> I expect my blood pressure and cholesterol to both be down.</li>
            <li> so I could down</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to choke this stuff down no matter</li>
            <li> It does not taste bad to me when I only mix it with water, because I know I am doing something positive for my health.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes I have a hard time getting the last little sip down...</li>
            <li> Maybe due to Green Vibrance providing trace nutrients</li>
            <li> the list of ingredients and vitamins in Green Vibrance is endless.</li>
            <li> (A side note, you will see a few of their other products say,</li>
            <li> I have this stored in my freezer, because I have other green powder I am using.  </li>
            <li> So I take this and a few other supplements.</li>
            <li> drink it everyday with spring water before going to sleep and wake up energized without the need for coffee or other chemical based energy enhancing products.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve used other green powders I feel this formula is an unbeatable product.  </li>
            <li> The taste as stated in other reviews is definitely green and plant like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other green drinks, and believe me, NONE of them taste like chocolate milkshakes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ive tried other cheaper superfoods, to save money, none of them work like green vibrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so unhealthy the past few years as a result because who wants to eat mushy veggies all the time?  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time eating enough green food.  </li>
            <li> My entire family came down with a bug which caused the cramping that I felt in my earlier response, so I decided to update my review because it was unfair.</li>
            <li> I blend this powder with almond milk, a few almonds, organic raw cocoa powder, raw antioxidant honey, a bit &#x27;o kelp (a tiny bit, mind you), and organic vanilla extract.</li>
            <li> the EPA limits arsenic to 10 mcg of arsenic (which includes the inorganic plus the potentially less toxic organic form --</li>
            <li> I can verify that it does give you a slight energy boost also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking half a scoop (see why, below) each day for a couple weeks now</li>
            <li> After I chug that, I immediately follow with a half glass of Rice Dream.</li>
            <li> I am a big advocate of juicing and try to have at least one green juice per day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the taste, just mix it with a half glass of juice and another half water.</li>
            <li> It keeps my blood sugar stable and makes me less hungry.</li>
            <li> I have finished half of a 720 grams (25,4 oz.) jar and noticed that this product (version 10.1) has 16.4 mg.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week, less then a week</li>
            <li> In less than a week, the pain in my hips was gone.  </li>
            <li> I no longer cough black phlegm now.</li>
            <li> Those vast fields are too toxic to walk in without serious protection and are barren of any life, with not an earthworm, bee, or butterfly to be seen for miles.</li>
            <li> Makes it not taste so bland.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our smoothies for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> This can be expensive to add to your daily supplemental diet, especially for 30 to 60 day supply.</li>
            <li> I reduced it to half of that dosage.  </li>
            <li> Considering if you got sick,and had to buy cold medicine or worse go to a doctor, you would pay way more than you would by using this product.</li>
            <li> There is a slight \\&quot;veggie\\&quot; taste to my strawberry shake</li>
            <li> There were not any hidden fees, no shipping charges and item arrived ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> It lasts 2 months and works out to cost less than 50 cents a day.</li>
            <li> I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight energy increase from the start and now can&#x27;t imagine beginning my day without it.</li>
            <li> I used this powder, but had to sweeten it with half a packet of stevia in an 8 ounce glass.</li>
            <li> I slightly lowered my dosage and it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore.    </li>
            <li> Just about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I feel a burst of energy after I drink this, I also add some protein mix and black strap molosses with distilled water.</li>
            <li> I have serious GERD and am on multiple medications.</li>
            <li> Each shake costs me less than $2.40 to make.</li>
            <li> The price needs to be $15.00 less</li>
            <li> I can now get up and down the stairs easier and am having less trouble getting up and down from the floor.</li>
            <li> I have trouble going up &amp; down stairs and getting up &amp; down from the floor.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little fruit juice and then water it down before I gulp it.  </li>
            <li> This year I was exposed to someone with a bad case of the flu and my body responded only with some slight weakness and I was a little more tired than usual.  </li>
            <li> I tried making green smoothies, but they were also hard on my stomach, and I just couldn&#x27;t possibly make them everyday with my work schedule.</li>
            <li> When at work I have access to a water cooler that despenses both hot &amp; cold water.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced this type of energy and general</li>
            <li> Out side of those 2 issues, I have not come across any other green drink that has as much in it as Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> If you are into green smoothies as I am you can put it into the green smoothie (or other smoothie).</li>
            <li> Although a little on the bland side (what would you expect from greens)</li>
            <li> I used to get sick all the time and had to be careful to get enough sleep...and this fixed me...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been full blown sick since I started taking it.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot less pain since I started taking the Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> I became slightly congested sneezed a few times and felt mucus in my chest</li>
            <li> However, about halfway through (on multiple tubs) it gets a progressively worse taste and not nearly as fresh at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that means Green Vibrance has less niacin in it or not, but regardless, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I started taking this a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of those who is too busy with work!  </li>
            <li> I purchased it a little nervous about it&#x27;s cost but believing</li>
            <li> I add this to my little ones juice</li>
            <li> I blend it with V-fusion juice and a little lemon and lots of ice.</li>
            <li> We have been on this supplement for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> The results, I had little to no energy before I</li>
            <li> I still have little to no energy.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> On the side on my container was a little sticker placed by the ingredients that said &amp;#</li>
            <li> Just a little grainy.</li>
            <li> though so you know the little probiotics in it aren&#x27;t&#x27; dying</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m feeling it little by little as I hear</li>
            <li> It amounts to over a dollar for every little scoop.</li>
            <li> For example, a colleague showed up to work sick and shirtly thereafter I developed the same symptoms and which traditionally signalled to me that I was sick (a very sore/swollen throat).</li>
            <li> toxic arsenic IS bad in our food and should be limited as much as possible even if levels are relatively low by toxicity</li>
            <li> Be careful!!!  </li>
            <li> you need to make a smoothie with strawberries or other berries, yogurt and at least half of a banana and its sooo yummy.  </li>
            <li> This product has a terrible taste but the health results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive selling process and hugely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very stressed because this, I had cold sores keep coming on my face for a year</li>
            <li> /&gt;i mix this with my algaes and rainbow vibrance everyday.</li>
            <li> Arsenic, like lead, is a heavy metal.</li>
            <li> After trying Green Vibrance for about a month I feel like i have a nuclear reactor inside my chest.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.   </li>
            <li> I make my green smoothies every morning for breakfast and lunch- 2 scoops of Green Vibrance powder, 2 scoops of Whey protein powder, 2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, 1 scoop of fiber powder, and 2 cups of frozen fruit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for about six years.  </li>
            <li> and I will be 60 in a few months.  </li>
            <li> , mix my Green Vibrance with a glass of water and drink it like tea.  </li>
            <li> &quot; of green drinks</li>
            <li> I put Green Vibrance in my smoothies which I have 3-4 times a week.</li>
            <li> I recommend Green Vibrance to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was because I was missing the Green vibrance.  </li>
            <li> Since taking green vibrance I have an energy that I haven&#x27;t felt in years.  </li>
            <li> we call it \\&quot;green stuff\\&quot; in our house -</li>
            <li> but if I ate that my Green Vibrance wouldn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every vitamin and green food out there</li>
            <li> Since I started drinking Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve come up with \\&quot;the green drink recipe\\</li>
            <li> I am now addicted and have incorporated it in to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Green Vibrance from now on.</li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance to supplement my diet.</li>
            <li> Now, reading the reviews, I saw plenty of people claiming that this gave them energy, but when I looked up Green Vibrance&#x27; ingredient list</li>
            <li> I saw that it contained green tea extract.</li>
            <li> I would tell anyone who does not eat green veggie to try this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for almost 5 years now.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to green super-foods</li>
            <li> Gotta be the green stuff</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I notice a difference within a few days if I stop taking it.</li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance with powdered vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Green Vibrance for years now.</li>
            <li> while fixing my pre-gym chocolate protein shake, I thought \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; and added a scoop of Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> I drink my serving of Green Vibrance and take 4 gel caps of fish oil and ½</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for five weeks now</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Green Vibrance is an incomplete product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m never going without my Green Vibrance again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green vibrance is truly a Green Superfood.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients found in Green Vibrance: spinach, kelp, acidophilus, broccoli, carrot, zucchini, parsley, beet juice, wheat grass, barley grass, and oat grass just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make home made protein bars, and mix in a few scoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> green vibrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proper</li>
            <li> ** Please store Green Vibrance in your freezer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a green drink...</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the category leader in phytonutrients.</li>
            <li> There are lots of green foods, probiotics and vitamins.  </li>
            <li> The joke around the office is we call it Soylent Green.   </li>
            <li> so I now take Green Vibrance 45 minutes after breakfast each day.</li>
            <li> I take it as part of my everyday regiment of vitamins and nutritional supplements.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just messed up Green Vibrance...    </li>
            <li> I like this Green Vibrance because I can sweeten it if I want.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this has ALL the green stuff, and then some you could ever want.</li>
            <li> Nasty tasting on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking Green Vibrance for years now.  </li>
            <li> I will continue drinking Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> I combine Green Vibrance, Rainbow Vibrance and Muscle Milk Lite to make a shake every morning for breakfast.</li>
            <li> You mix the green powder with 4-6oz of a non carb drink.</li>
            <li> It tastes &#x27;green&#x27;</li>
            <li> Please read what the founder of green vibrance ensures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they charge at BOTH ends... and that raised a few questions for me.</li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance in smoothies and sometimes just in flavored water.  </li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is disgusting...in smell and taste...</li>
            <li> one scoop of Green Vibrance, tablespoon cacao power, coconut oil, almond milk and my choice of fruit for the day, but</li>
            <li> I have used green powers for about two years.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the highest quality supplement that I&#x27;ve discovered.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of taking green vibrance</li>
            <li> I buy Green Vibrance on the autoship plan and start my day by adding Green Vibrance, Plant Fusion protein powder, chia seeds, Nusweet stevia to taste and water in a shaker bottle and consume it on my way to work.</li>
            <li> I found GREEN VIBRANCE</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for about 5 months.  </li>
            <li> I did try a few times.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance changed my life.  </li>
            <li> Turns everything GREEN</li>
            <li> The company needs to pledge to show heavy metal contaminant levels in this product before I will ever purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of taking vitamin pills everyday Green Vibrance does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> My son worked at Wholefoods and learned a lot about health products, he suggested this green food supplement</li>
            <li> Which leads me to my point about Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> The green powders lasts a lo-o-o-ong time....</li>
            <li> so i have probably shaved a few  years of my life expectancy:</li>
            <li> I purchased Green Vib after running out of my Dr. Schulze superfood.</li>
            <li> This also has 333% of vitamin E. D and E content is where Green Vibrance shines.</li>
            <li> There are lists on the container of all the things Green Vib contains, but again, it just doesn&#x27;t do anythig for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt the Green Vibrance has helped alot of people.</li>
            <li> It has always given me energy and supplies my body with the missing nutrients it craves and needs.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance Version 14 Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> I do feel a sense of well being and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before taking Green Vibrance, I was taking Green Max</li>
            <li> but I decided to try Green Vibrance for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have GERD and if I drink a scoop of the green vibrance with some cranberry juice every morning I Have no symptoms.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get use to it</li>
            <li> and I go to bathroom almost everyday</li>
            <li> dried green juice I use it every morning</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting on its own.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have started doing juices/smoothies and use Green Vibrance in our drinks.  </li>
            <li> this is a NUTRITIONALLY DEAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> BUT I JUST CANNOT STOMACH THE GREEN COLOR OR THE TASTE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Green Vibrance for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I got rid of my Multi-Vitamin as soon as I tried Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I start using Green Vibrance when I was put on a heavy dose of antibiotics for a sinus infection and bronchitis.</li>
            <li> you are not used to green drinks, the taste and consistency might be a bit off-putting.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Fiber On The Go (Citrus Puhch) packets as a prebiotic and decided to add one to my Green Vibrance drink.  </li>
            <li> People would be dropping dead like flies from arsenic</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, I can&#x27;t say I feel any difference</li>
            <li> I had one cold in the last 12 months and it only lasted a few days.  </li>
            <li> I take it everyday with my organic protein powder.  </li>
            <li> Being a disabled person for whom walking is always &amp;</li>
            <li> when i miss a few days i can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Because he won&#x27;t know you drink Green Vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brb, taking my Green Vibrance for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Beware of Green Vibrance mustache (like a milk mustache, but unsettingly-green).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not going to work for the few of us that are adversely affected by milk thistle.  </li>
            <li> If you are a tea-person, you will like it because it tastes just like green tea.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my frozen papaya and my green vibrance in a blender with chia seeds and flax oil and</li>
            <li> My buddy introduces me to green vibrance.  </li>
            <li> I have taken green vibrance.  </li>
            <li> Cheers to Green Vibrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 29th 2012:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until the competition stops using SILICA in their formulas I will continue to use Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> people will talk about how Green Vibrance is a cure all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the taste it is green tasting</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for over 7 years now.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after I used a 500g bottle of the Vitamineral Green (VG).</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it tastes like blended green juice and</li>
            <li> may take a few days for me to get a lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hopeful of feeling better--diagnosed with COPD and asthma a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing green drinks for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> I also add liquid ginseng to the Green Vibrance in my morning routein.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I was a few days into using it, that I looked closely at the label.</li>
            <li> I had a few aches and pains even.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like green veggies there are a few ways to mask the taste.</li>
            <li> have taken my business to Healthforce Vitamineral Green..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used for 3 weeks now and still notice a difference in my energy everyday.</li>
            <li> I have two doctors who recommended that I dring a Green Vegetabel drink every day.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives you energy, both short-term (immediately after swallowing it) and long-term (I don&#x27;t get as tired).</li>
            <li> Green Tea (extract 20mg)</li>
            <li> 300mg  Green bean powder</li>
            <li> 24% ginkgoflavonglycosides, 6% terpene lactones) 20mg  Grape seed extract (95% polyphenols, 90% proanthocyanidins) 20mg  Green tea extract (90% polyphenols, 80% catechins, 45% EGCG)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included Green Vibrance in my diet for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can &amp;#34;Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food&amp;#34; by using Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> Green has helped me in almost every way I can think of.</li>
            <li> I still take green vibrance today and swear by it.</li>
            <li> If I take it everyday, my shoulders and neck do not have the aches and pains that I feel when I skip a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking Green Vibrance every day now for well over a year</li>
            <li> it mixes well with whey protein and fruit and does not have that grassy taste that some green powders have.  </li>
            <li> I did so and started making smoothies with the Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> I have been adding this to my green smoothies for awhile now.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;TB or so of Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR QUITE A</li>
            <li> Banana, 2 TBSP Flax seed, 2 Scopes Green Vibrance, 1/2 C Blueberries, (2) TBSP Apple Cider Vinegar,  1/4 Food Grade DE,  a handful of spinach &amp; 1/4C Organic Grape Juice for taste.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was the highest rated amongst the green drink powders on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started taking the green vibrance</li>
            <li> I call green vibrance swamp thing</li>
            <li> Has everything I need in a green powder supplement.  </li>
            <li> I was missing.  </li>
            <li> As for me, I will continue to take Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> She had problems eating and Green Vibrance, along with Ensure, Ricotta Cheese and Protein powder created a milk shake that helped her gain 20 pounds in three months.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more to say, it&#x27;s a bit pricey and tastes terrible regardless of what it is mixed with and for that it loses one star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey you guys got green vibrance up here or what?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A word of advice to anyone who purchases Green Vibrance or any green drink for that matter: Mix it with fruit or fruit juice.</li>
            <li> Consumer Lab released a report in July 2014 showing that Green Vibrance was found to be contaminated with arsenic.&lt;br /&gt;mary  </li>
            <li> I take Green Vibrance, mix it with juice, I can sleep through the night, pain free,&lt;br /&gt;without taking pain medication.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would recommend Green Vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> - If I had to grab 2 items to survive this jar of green powder and water would be it.&lt;br /&gt;No pills, no food, no supplements.  </li>
            <li> ACTUALLY Biting into a multivitamin will taste much worse.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t do well one day, I know the green vibrance is supplementing my intake.  </li>
            <li> This green vibrance has tons of probiotics to protect the digestive system.</li>
            <li> Few walnuts.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Of course it will taste leafy, it&#x27;s from green vegetables.</li>
            <li> Seems like all those nutrients my body was missing are being replaced by this product.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance tastes like</li>
            <li> Day two since taking Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> I began using this product a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I make a protein shake with chocolate protein powder, Green Vibrance powder, flaxseed meal, cocoa powder and sweetener.</li>
            <li> On his&lt;br /&gt;recommendation, I tried green vibrance.  </li>
            <li> My children call it, &amp;#34;the pond water drink.&amp;#34; I will update my review in a few weeks, and report how I feel and if there are anymore changes in my energy level.</li>
            <li> Especially in the spring here in the northeast when my body is deficient in green stuff...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even less anxious, I used to have panic attacks and little OCD things...</li>
            <li> I also began to notice a small uncontrolled muscle movements in my leg when sitting down.  </li>
            <li> I usually add a little ground cayenne, a little &#x27;no salt&#x27; [potassium chloride], &amp; a little sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother with the juice anymore, just half a glass of water, a heaping scoop of the powder, stir briskly, down the hatch and be done with it!!</li>
            <li> once the right blend was found it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Yes, the taste is bad but with patience to find the right combination to mix or drink with it, you will never regret it.</li>
            <li> 18.I am 47 and use this everyday with plain water and chase it with another 44 oz of room temp water</li>
            <li> The first time I tried, I thought its humanly impossible to ingest this crappy poop dung that tastes like insides of the stomach of a grass eating goat.</li>
            <li> water - if you want a thicker smoothie, add less water - you choose&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Improved skin tone (not so pale, tan better)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like the taste with plain water.</li>
            <li> I like using a banana, oj, and a scoop of Trader Joe&#x27;s frozen plain yogurt.</li>
            <li> You are what you eat folks, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At times I substitute Almond Milk for Raw Cashews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your Green Vibrance.  </li>
            <li> No strong offsetting taste or smell.</li>
            <li> However at about week three this is when i started to experience problems, I began getting a small amount of brain fog everyday around noon, about 2 hours after I would consume my green drink.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Poliquin Primal Greens for the last few months, and I asked a friend for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> Hard to go down with just water.</li>
            <li> First of all the Bad.</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked at the price of the \\&quot;athletic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just an average sized, 30&#x27;s something mother of 3 that works a late swing shift, so</li>
            <li> I use one scoop with 4 strawberries, a few blueberries, 2 table spoons of yogurt, 4 baby carrots, a small piece of celery, and a cup of water each morning.  </li>
            <li> usually have one serving of Spirulina tabs in the morning and then have a Green Vibrance shake after I eat lunch.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Between this product, Rhasberry Ketone, green tea, CLA, flaxseed supplements and sunflower seeds (saltless) - 3 teaspoons, no more than that as they become fattening after that</li>
            <li> Doctors could find no physical reason for my IBS, sour stomach, unable to digest a large variety of foods, weight loss, bad skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks and I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent my hard earned money on this junk.</li>
            <li> I have a scoop every morning in a shake with Garden of Life RAW Meal.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t afford the RAW Meal expense anymore.</li>
            <li> At this point I can have raw spinach, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini.  </li>
            <li> so I Mix it with garden of life Raw Organic Meal-Chocolate.</li>
            <li> TB Raw honey</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, because you have to add a lot of grape juice or other sweet bottled juices to maybe mask the awful flavor, its defeating just not worth it.</li>
            <li> My acne was beyond bad at one stage, my face was literally purple and red from the massive breakouts and scars.  </li>
            <li> I really hated it at the beginning, now it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> In my late 50&#x27;s but feel half my age--my wife says I act like a child.</li>
            <li> It seems to help my extremely dry skin too, which gets worse if I miss a week of taking GV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d feel jittery and awful right after taking it, and then crash later in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little hard to take but orange juice helps.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are getting 170% of your daily RDA from this supplement, and then eat other food that contain iron (like, meat, beans, spinach, etc), you are accumulating a dangerous level of iron.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other green products that hide behind \\&quot;propietary</li>
            <li> I struggled between 4 and 5 stars just because of how hard it is to get down!  </li>
            <li> This made me feel a little wonky.  </li>
            <li> Provides a little boost of energy in the morning and may slowly be affecting my digestive track.</li>
            <li> addition, Green Vibrance is listed as gluten-free, and although there are barley and oat grass juice powders listed as ingredients, I was told that they are farmed before germination so they do not contain any or hardly any gluten (&lt;10 ppm of gluten for each serving of GV, which qualifies as \\&quot;gluten-free\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> its really that bad in taste.</li>
            <li> The taste really isn&#x27;t that bad-</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t taste too bad that way.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out that ConsumerLab.com is not the trustworthy source I had first believed.</li>
            <li> Usually take with orange juice about one hour after lunch.</li>
            <li> Lost some weight and noticed the usual afternoon slump has gone away.</li>
            <li> usually cranberry juice or apple juice.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past the taste (I hold my nose),it seems to balance what is in my body.  </li>
            <li> I take this everyday and will forever!</li>
            <li> mix in a scoop with my usual morning smoothie that consists of frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, some blueberry kefir, probiotic stony farms strawberry yogurt and almond milk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found dosing the Green in the morning late makes this happen.</li>
            <li> so small</li>
            <li> That really is not it&#x27;s primary purpose!     </li>
            <li> They were small, but they were noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not able to leap tall buildings and the x-ray vision hasn&#x27;t kicked in, but I&#x27;ll have a wait and see attitude............</li>
            <li> but I did maintained my weight for the past year.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for healthier nutrition.</li>
            <li> Usually companies stay out of it because they have no defense.</li>
            <li> However, I could not get past the taste.</li>
            <li> , Ive goten lazy and instead of mixing it in a cup</li>
            <li> However, I do believe that on a taste test comparison, this product tastes on par if not better.</li>
            <li> small scope a day, have to take with Almond Milk for the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Continuing</li>
            <li> I mixed it in water for the first year and it was awful...</li>
            <li> Too lazy to eat vegetables?</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance really sucks.</li>
            <li> I just purchased Green Vibrance  this week and then saw the negative postings concerning inorganic arsenic in this product.</li>
            <li> although a wee bit slower than usual.</li>
            <li> I have always received a credit on my card for issues in the past within 3-4 days, sometimes sooner.</li>
            <li> I no longer get UTI&#x27;s Thank you Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for the past 3 months to replace my usual multivitamin.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s rather expensive, I find the ingredients it has second to none</li>
            <li> It is green and gives you vibrance !</li>
            <li> I take these everyday and will for the rest on my life!</li>
            <li> Mornings and evenings are terrible for me, where I have everything from joint and/or debilitating muscle pain to not being able to keep my eyes, a tiredness that cannot be described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well feeling in the past 5 years years -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how much better my body was when taking this, but this stuff tasted NASTY.</li>
            <li> Friends have noticed (without knowing I&#x27;m talking this past 2-months)</li>
            <li> Not sure what to use for sweetening - don&#x27;t want to use sugar, but...</li>
            <li> I use it in small doses in my smoothies.</li>
            <li> yet so there will def be an update in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I mean, your talking 4-8 oz of juice with the green vibrance, its</li>
            <li> Very few companies take up the challenge to their testing.</li>
            <li> they always tell the truth in detail about a negative comment,  and it usually is either untrue,  exaggerated  or vastly incorrect</li>
            <li> The taste is not really that bad but its enough to warrant mixing it in with an omlet or if I choose to drink it</li>
            <li> Do a search for \\&quot;Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC Warns the Public that ConsumerLab.com is Not Independent and Labels the &#x27;CL Seal of Approval&#x27; a Worthless, Paid-For Advertising Gimmick.\\</li>
            <li> Seriously, every time someone compliments my skin/hair/nails or mentions tummy issues, I immediately recommend Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> now i very rarely get sick, even when the rest of the family comes down with a cold or flu.  </li>
            <li> I had a normal workout routine,i was getting frustrated a bit</li>
            <li> I can taste a hint of seaweed and it reminds me of broken down vitamins.</li>
            <li> Sorry not good enough!  </li>
            <li> Sorry not good enough!  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was a disgusting taste at first, but after two or three tries it&#x27;s an acquired taste.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others and they taste waaaay worse and don&#x27;t have half the stuff that this has in it.</li>
            <li> Every few days I came down with the cold, which always took a few days to rid itself.</li>
            <li> THE GREENS I&#x27;M NEEDING SO MUCH, HARD</li>
            <li> Some people may find it hard to drink the \\&quot;gritty-ness\\</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to even believe but since I have been taking this once per day my craving have dropped to non existent.  </li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t all that hard to do.</li>
            <li> so I put it in orange juice and can hardly taster or smell it.</li>
            <li> but oh no I gaged so hard and now this product is going to sit forever in my fridge.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever have stomach or bowel probs when I have taken</li>
            <li> and I hardly notice a change in flavor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to drink....</li>
            <li> Then I ran out and was running low on funds and stopped cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, I noticed that my endurance in the gym had dropped and my overall mood throughout the day was terrible.  </li>
            <li> common colds, body and joint aches, skin ailments, etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, one of the negative reviews always seems to pop up about the iron content issue.  </li>
            <li> If an astronaut at the International Space Station was to sneeze, I would catch cold here in India.</li>
            <li> I mixed 1 scoop along with 4 ounces of Cold water and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.......</li>
            <li> I found a comment on a random website that this stuff worked and naturally was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was exposed to someone with a cold for a couple of hours and had to use the same keyboard.  </li>
            <li> I believe it will improve your immune system, as I always have a cold in winter, but since taking this stuff daily, I have not had a sniffle.</li>
            <li> Sea vegetable complex:  </li>
            <li> 0.75 billion    Enzyme complex:  </li>
            <li> yoga at home at least five days a week.</li>
            <li> I try to eat at least 5 cups of veggies a day-usually 5-7 cups, 7 being the optimal.</li>
            <li> There were some negative things about this product  </li>
            <li> I feel some reviewers are confusing the honesty and integrity of the Amazon seller(s)</li>
            <li> &quot; I took the supplement again the next morning and yawned like crazy again</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced us to this product after my wife was diagnosed with late stage Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.</li>
            <li> The only i don&#x27;t vomit every time is because I mix it with COLD ORANGE JUICE.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked on what the difference is yet but came on Amazon to look at the front advertised page to check out what at least in the picture of it shows and it still shows as being vrs 10.3 so perhaps they are shipping the newer ones out now</li>
            <li> I did get a cold last week.</li>
            <li> In fact their report that Green Vibrance contains lead has been disputed as completely FALSE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking to Vitamineral Green for now (unless and until I discover it is also unhealthy in some way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then slowly started breaking out with acne.  </li>
            <li> One of the few tastes that made me nauseated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not something you would sip on slowly.  </li>
            <li> So annoyed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> However, one drink of this, and I was vomiting violently in my kitchen sink for about 5 minutes straight, my concerned son at my side.</li>
            <li> A thick chocolate shake</li>
            <li> I used to get sick farely regularly... over the last 5 years, since I started Green Vibrance, I have only been sick a handful of times!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly I will say that the taste is horrible, and with products like this that is expected and acceptable, but this one seems to be particularly bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievably my heart arrhythmia has subsided!  </li>
            <li> the price mean anything?</li>
            <li> Go Green!!</li>
            <li> usually I go for the cherries!</li>
            <li> just as it should if you know what i mean</li>
            <li> I smells terrible and tastes terrible but just mix it with your favorite juice, use a straw and swallow as fast as you can.</li>
            <li> Amazon had it for $30 less!!!  </li>
            <li> Coming straight to Green Vibrance, it is as already sufficiently mentioned - the worst tasting thing you can put in your mouth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite a bit less expensive through this supplier and delivery</li>
            <li> I should mention that in the 60 days that I was taking this product I was NOT diagnosed with cancer or any serious diseases, so maybe this product prevents cancer, we may never know.</li>
            <li> It really does not taste that bad!</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t doctored or artificial in any way, so those of you having a hard time with the chlorophyl taste of greens and other ingredients be warned.</li>
            <li> It can be a little difficult finding a beverage to use with it if you are trying, like I am, to stay away from juice.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been taking this for years, and we get sick less than half the frequency that we used to.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this powder is rather nasty tasting and can be hard to get down without some sort of sweetener.  </li>
            <li> It tastes bad but is drinkable mixed in water.  </li>
            <li> I recommend, however, even if this is a food and not really a vitamin, to still start out with a small amount because people can have bad reactions to anything.</li>
            <li> It doesnt not have a bad flavor when mixed with appke juice.  </li>
            <li> Its essential for your body and you never know if this is building something inside to stop cancer or bad things from happening inside your body.</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t taste bad considering the ingredients wrap around the entire container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is expensive, in my humble opinion, but</li>
            <li> I was reaching a point where I was REALLY tired in the late afternoon and was truly struggling to get through the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> but I told him that gluten intolerance runs in the family and he was skeptical about the barley and wheat grass, even though Green Vibrance claims to be gluten-free.  </li>
            <li> The powder tasted horrible, I didn&#x27;t see any results what so ever, wasn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> it is completely useless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> if not good...</li>
            <li> I truly thought it would have a \\&quot;green aftertaste\\&quot; and I was wrong, it is just a \\&quot;delicious\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna say right off the taste to me is horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say yes, the taste is nasty, but I found the right mix for me...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I was sick</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been sick for 2 years, even though colds and flu have made several rounds through the home and workplace.</li>
            <li> I had read about green foods and was very confused</li>
            <li> It contains no sugar, and no aspartame or other artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> Not trying to be dramatic, just sharing the negative effects it had on me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which by the way I hate doing because it seems a little extreme.</li>
            <li> He is a cancer survivor and has weak kidneys.  </li>
            <li> First off, the taste is horrible...</li>
            <li> Tried mixing it into a smoothie, it gets very thick and sticks to the blender blades, a little wasteful so tried just mixing in water, a little tough to swallow. :(</li>
            <li> I make a \\&quot;green protein drink\\&quot; for breakfast, and let me tell you .. this stuff work!!!</li>
            <li> I was all \\&quot;GREEN VIBRANCE!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drinking Green Vibrance is like eating 3 sacks of veggies, and then an additional 2 bags full of fruits and other plant life, without having to spend the 10 hours-a-day required to chew the disgusting stuff (drinking it via powder suspended in water distills that 10 hours into the worst 30 seconds of your day).</li>
            <li> however I do not find the taste to be as bad as expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m rarely tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll think of eating something unhealthy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> this could was going to do helped me put that behind me.  </li>
            <li> The size of the spoon had changed from 14.7 cc to 20 cc an increase of approximately 36% WITHOUT any explanation that I can recall.  </li>
            <li> being tired and zapped of energy is something i&#x27;m always struggling with.  </li>
            <li> It also has decreased my caffeine intake by 90%.  </li>
            <li> even became distributors, but their response time and customer service became worse after the &#x27;head&#x27; of the family died...</li>
            <li> It is getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get tired at all now.</li>
            <li> The reminder of the time I feel &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; - but never great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks nasty and tastes a bit grassy, but is VERY boosting and</li>
            <li> Of course the taste is something to get used to, but I&#x27;ve had much, much worse and</li>
            <li> The flavor is like a bloody mary, sort-of, although the drink is brownish red, it is tasty!  </li>
            <li> Consumer Reports needs to withdrawal their findings, its false and unfounded.  </li>
            <li> Why is Amazon selling outdated products?</li>
            <li> I used to take soy lecithin by itself and stopped due to the added estrogen and the bad information about soy even though it is non GMO.  </li>
            <li> I mean seriously, I already am taking cold showers, eating cinnamon, no sugar, no bread...</li>
            <li> As for this product the report unfortunately found levels of arsenic insanely beyond EPA accepted levels and being that the FDA doesn&#x27;t monitor &#x27;supplements&#x27; such as green powders its allowed on our shelves.</li>
            <li> Then my girlfriend came down with a bad case of the flu.</li>
            <li> but if you mix it with a shot of orange juice and just chug it down it is not so bad</li>
            <li> After 4 days I had a dramatic increase in energy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the least horrible of any on the market.  </li>
            <li> , I was shocked to see how much heavy toxic chemical spraying goes on to grow the vegetables we buy in the market everywhere today.</li>
            <li> It got to the point where a banana made me violently ill, an orange made everyone ask my usually thin framed self if I was expecting and apples made me curl up in a ball holding my tummy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the WORST tasting supplement I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, but I still continue to take it because it is a QUALITY product.</li>
            <li> I did get a little sick</li>
            <li> neither the taste nor the thickness is bad as some report, and I drink it plain in purified water.</li>
            <li> I was very sick back then</li>
            <li> it tastes sooo bad its almost unbelievable..</li>
            <li> Cons: very expensive of late</li>
            <li> Needless to say raw veggies have been dropping out of my diet like bad habits,</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, especially because it&#x27;s so expensive.  </li>
            <li> The secret is bananas!  </li>
            <li> but in my opinion too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Since the stuff was so expensive, I decided not to repurchase it.  </li>
            <li> (I understand not all taste buds are alike—my girlfriend finds it disgusting to the point that she won&#x27;t even try to acclimate—because I believe that would actually happen if given time).</li>
            <li> Well, maybe not *delicious*</li>
            <li> The most disgusting crap I have ever tasted!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but the benefits out weighs the cost.</li>
            <li> Not a great product from my experience!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, mixing it with just water can be distasteful.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is a miracle product.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to disappoint you -- that is the gingko at work.</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> YOU CANT GO WRONG</li>
            <li> However unless one of us sees some improvement we are unlikely to repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> it is expensive, but Amazon still seems to have the cheapest price.  </li>
            <li> Has such a nasty taste.</li>
            <li> For 11 months after my discharge I had no energy and was unable to care for and do things with my children.</li>
            <li> It is expensive buying at a retail store;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> After questionable rice protein supply issues in another brand--I have switched to this brand.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too expensive at the store</li>
            <li> Went to work and felt so fatigue and yawned all morning, my Co Worker asked me \\&quot;what is wrong with you\\</li>
            <li> (my body seems to reject cold water).For those who posted poor reviews because of the taste, I am sad</li>
            <li> She had became really ill after a while, shivers, heat sweats, migraines, fever, etc.</li>
            <li> she was deathly ill from the flu(Dr.</li>
            <li> Ill follow</li>
            <li> However, I got sick with the flu a month after I started taking it and just as I was getting over the flu, I got hit again with a bad cold a couple weeks later.  </li>
            <li> I was diagnose with diabetes and felt very tired.</li>
            <li> I feel very tired.</li>
            <li> made me very tired.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it I have not been sick to any serious degree.  </li>
            <li> I have nasty allergies and my eyes would hurt all day long.</li>
            <li> I am a gym fanatic and I don&#x27;t believe in taking a bunch of chemical crap....</li>
            <li> I have been taking it about a year and have not had a cold or flu throughout this season.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cold or flu since I started taking it</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was afraid of what GV would taste like.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I had lots of cold sores keeping coming on my face</li>
            <li> and I was really afraid</li>
            <li> and I never had any cold sores and hives.</li>
            <li> It helps to take it dissolved in cold apple juice.</li>
            <li> cold water, HOLD MY BREATH, drink it up.</li>
            <li> wish they could ship and store it cold</li>
            <li> i havent had a cold in</li>
            <li> When I received the Green Vibrance I was afraid it would have an awful taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this stuff is very difficult to choke down, it tastes awful.</li>
            <li> Except for the weird stuff in it like milk thistle extract, I didn&#x27;t think it would contain anything that I&#x27;m not already getting plenty of!</li>
            <li> I don’t think you can go wrong giving this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but look at all the organic ingredients you are getting!</li>
            <li> and they were very expensive to purchase every month.</li>
            <li> The taste (in water, milk, or juice) makes it nearly impossible to take.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is too bad.</li>
            <li> Took it for a week and got really bad constipation.</li>
            <li> The taste is not that bad.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so bad at all.  </li>
            <li> My arthritis sometimes hurts so badly at night that it keeps me awake.  </li>
            <li> not that bad, not like you need to mix it into a 2 liter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you mix it with protein powder, berries and some coconut oil, you don&#x27;t notice the bad taste.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t bad, but</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t too bad it taste like you are drinking greens.</li>
            <li> It will eliminate the bad taste of the product and will smell like lemonade.  </li>
            <li> bad sign.</li>
            <li> I feel bad to give bad review</li>
            <li> Bad flavor?</li>
            <li> The taste wasn&#x27;t to bad..</li>
            <li> bad eating habits, processed foods, stress.....</li>
            <li> Without it I think I would be in seriously bad shape.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.  </li>
            <li> because it wasn&#x27;t all bad, just the taste.</li>
            <li> because it wasn&#x27;t all bad, just the taste.</li>
            <li> My immune system was bad and I needed to recover.</li>
            <li> Please use some thought if it tastes bad to you.</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I do wish this were made with organic greens, but the taste isn&#x27;t bad (if you&#x27;re tolerant of super-healthy-tasting food) and it&#x27;s packed with nutrient-dense veggies.</li>
            <li> I dont know if this was a bad batch</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;d think that&#x27;s bad for digestion</li>
            <li> now this stuff tastes really bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a particularly bad taste.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just mad at myself for being so stupid as to getting off this product when it was working so well for me.</li>
            <li> I am sick to my stomach - literally - to find this out after using this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While everyone was getting sick with colds, I never got sick.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been sick since I have started taking it</li>
            <li> I have not gotten sick at all since I have taken this.</li>
            <li> Everyone around me at work is sick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate getting sick this year with colds or flu.</li>
            <li> We seldom get sick, our bowel movements are now regulated, I did not lose weight while taking this product</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that while my husband was away I not once became sick, not even with the sniffles</li>
            <li> and I do not get sick...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get sick.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using it for over two years and hasn&#x27;t been sick at all since using it.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of being on their autoshipment program because either I found myself stockpiling the stuff</li>

            <li> Vitamin E: (d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate) 100i.u.</li>
            <li> It was a very depressing time for me as all I ever wanted to do was be a mom.</li>
            <li> I mix it with very cold water.</li>
            <li> I would hate to have to give up this product.  </li>
            <li> I was STILL SMOKING and eating crap during this time.    </li>
            <li> I like its purpose but hate the taste.  </li>
            <li> I hate taking medicines</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance and for those who hate the taste</li>
            <li> I seldom get sick now in comparison to being sick with bronchitis, sinusitis and my IBS w/ chronic constipation was horrible.</li>
            <li> While the directions say to mix it with water, the result is very unpleasant tasting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does taste horrible, I mix it with grape juice or cranberry juice and it isn&#x27;t as bad.  </li>
            <li> smell bad and taste awful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice a bad taste at all!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star because it&#x27;s just about the worst tasting thing I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To My surprise it didnt taste as horrible as I imagined..</li>

            <li> The taste is truly awful, but this should not be recognized as food, rather, it should be considered medication.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat horribly</li>
            <li> Yes it looks disgusting when you mix it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great addition to my morning dosages of Chlorrela/Spirulina/rainbow vibrance. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i mix this with my algaes and rainbow vibrance everyday.</li>
            <li> I am pretty open to trying new things especially if it is good for my health... but this gave me a spit this out right now feeling. It tastes like the way cow manure smells....</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd jar of Green Vibrance I&#x27;ve ordered.  It really works, makes me feel good and a great way to get your &amp;#34;greens.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s helpful.  Especially if you are lacking vegetables/greens in your diet.  The taste is something to get used to, but I really don&#x27;t mind it.  Give it a shot for a month and see if you feel any different.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great price I will be a repeat buyer. Keep up the good work I will tell others about this item</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;After reading the great reviews and looking at the ingredients, I thought I had found a really great product to supplement my diet. I am a member of ConsumerLab.com. Consumer Lab is an independent laboratory that does analysis on all kinds of products. I trust them completely. Their analysis of Vibrant Health Green Vibrance revealed that each serving contains 24.3 mcg of arsenic. I don&#x27;t know if that is a \\&quot;safe\\&quot; amount or not, but I personally don&#x27;t want any amount of arsenic in my foods. I am sick to my stomach - literally - to find this out after using this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT&lt;br /&gt;After doing more research I was disappointed to find out that ConsumerLab.com is not the trustworthy source I had first believed. In fact their report that Green Vibrance contains lead has been disputed as completely FALSE. The upside to this new discovery is that I can once again enjoy the benefits of Green Vibrance with complete confidence in their product. Anyone interested in more information on this subject can find it here on Amazon.com reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Green Vibrance for only a few months, and thought I was doing my body a huge favor. Today (July 7, 2013) I got a report from ConsumerLab.com that states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Vibrant Health Green Vibrance was found to contain 24.3 mcg of arsenic per scoop (12.1 grams). Further analysis showed that 5.4 mcg of this is \\&quot;inorganic arsenic\\&quot; reported to be the most toxic form of arsenic.  Arsenic, like lead, is a heavy metal. The concern with inorganic arsenic is that it is a carcinogen (causing bladder, lung, and skin cancer and, potentially, liver, kidney, and prostate cancer) and can also have detrimental effects on organs and the circulatory system. Although there are no established federal limits for contaminants in supplements, in a liter of drinking water the EPA limits arsenic to 10 mcg of arsenic (which includes the inorganic plus the potentially less toxic organic form -- although the majority of arsenic in water is believed to [be] inorganic). No amount of arsenic is actually considered \\&quot;safe\\&quot; by the EPA. The EPA had considered a more stringent limit of 5 mcg of arsenic per liter, but concluded that 10 mcg provided a balance between safety and the cost of reducing arsenic levels. New Jersy adopted th more conservative 5 mcg limit. California, out of concern for the reproductive effects, has proposed that a product with more than 0.5 mcg of inorganic arsenic in a daily serving carry a warning label. As a carcinogen, California applies a limit of 10 mcg of inorganic arsenic per daily serving before a warning label is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;In November 2012, Consumer Reports reported finding arsenic in many rice products, finding about 4 mcg of inorganic arsenic, on average, in a standard 45 gram (dry) serving of many types of rice sold in the U.X. Although this is only slightly less than the amount of inorganic arsenic in a serving of Green Vibrance, a scoop of Green Vibrance weighs only about 12 grams, meaning that the concentration of inorganic arsenicin Green Vibrance is around 5 times that in rice. Green Vibrance consists of many ingredients and it is likely that one or more of these ingredients are highly contaminated with arsenic. Hopefully, Vibrant Health will test the ingredients in Green Vibrance to determine the source of arsenic contamination and eliminate it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be glad to use Green Vibrance again when this problem is solved, because it is otherwise a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This product, like most &amp;#34;green drinks&amp;#34; really help with your energy and health.  Two scoops in 22oz of water every morning does the trick.  Have energy all day long without additional coffee or energy drinks.  My son calls it swamp water, and it looks like it.  The taste gets better after the first couple of days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone introduced me to Green Vibrance. It&#x27;s such a great product ! Perfect with freshly squeezed juice. Hard to go down with just water.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff! I order this monthly along with the  Amazing Grass Organic Wheat Grass Powder, 60 Servings, 17-Ounce.</li>
            <li> Really helps digestion and works as a good snack substitution. Usually take with orange juice about one hour after lunch.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a while. Love the blend of different ingredients plus probiotics. A great superfood to clean and energize the system. The price is great, better than the vitamin store I used to get it at. !!!</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping to get some greens into my children&#x27;s diet. Could not even hide the taste of new mowed lawn in other foods or drinks.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for almost 2 months. I was diagnose with diabetes and felt very tired. To my amazement I notice after taking green vibrance, more energy, happier mood, and more alert. I recommend this product to anyone who wants ENERGY in a very safe way! Believe me your life will change with this product!! Thank God I found it!</li>
            <li> I work out every morning at 5:30 and spend my entire day working in construction. With the dogs and busy schedule I barely slept. I had tried numerous multivitamins from all brands. After trying Green Vibrance for about a month I feel like i have a nuclear reactor inside my chest. The energy I have for work and play is up tenfold. Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around 3 years. I didn&#x27;t use it for the 9 months I was pregnant because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was safe for pregnant women, but it probably would&#x27;ve help with the lack of energy I experienced. :\ I always drink it the first thing in the morning. I used to make a smootie with it, but now I make a quick shake, as I don&#x27;t have the time in the morning like I did before, with a little one. My shake consist of this powder, yogurt, oj, milk, chia seeds, cinnamon, and agave nectar. I put it all in a container with two ice cube... shake, and that&#x27;s my morning energy boost. I love it. I can&#x27;t say I feel a boost of energy, but I feel good. Not tired in the morning at all... and very regular. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about six months; it&#x27;s  a great product; tried many greens but this  seems to give me energy for all day. I mix  it with ground flax seed to get even more   benefits for my body so that I can perform at  maximum and have sufficient energy. It seems to  have everything you need for overall health.</li>
            <li> I was never the vitamin taking type.  When I decided to do the research on vitamins, I was overhwelmed.  Luckily, I came across the reviews for Green Vibrance.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for almost a year now and the results are like night and day.  My family was the first to notice my that I was more energetic, then my hair and skin looked better.  I&#x27;m 54 years old, but,I swear I feel 15 - 20 years younger!  This product works and I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I love! Tastes best with apple juice or another sweet juice...  TRY IT :P</li>
            <li> I decided to wait until after 60 days before reviewing this product, as I wanted to give the product time to &#x27;work&#x27;.  The main question I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering is: does it?  Well, honestly, at first I couldn&#x27;t really feel that much of a difference.  It wasn&#x27;t until recently--after having the flu for several days--that this product really shined...    After having vomited (and etc nastiness) for two days with the flu, my body was out of whack.  I didn&#x27;t have much of an appetite while recovering, so one morning after I held down some oatmeal, I decided to take this out of the freezer and drink a serving.  At first, I almost regretted ingesting it because the taste isn&#x27;t pleasant and that alone almost made it come back up.  But WOW!  Once this stuff kicked in, I actually started feeling better and had energy for the first time in days!  My stomach got back to normal fast and I have no doubt that this product helped my recovery time.    I mix this with organic apple juice in the mornings after breakfast.  Does it taste like grass-flavored dirt mixed with tomato juice?  Yep.  But does it help?  I do believe it does.  And the amount of awesome stuff (like the probiotics and organic foods) are enough to get me coming back to it despite the price.</li>
            <li> This 60 day supply is a good deal here and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.   I take it 30-45 minutes after eating once a day and know that I&#x27;ve consumed a very nutrient dense green super food.  It does cause some bloating and I haven&#x27;t figured out the resolve for that yet.  This is my last stop for green superfood so I&#x27;ll continue to reorder at this great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THESE GREENS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND BUY THEM ONLY THROUGH AMAZON.  THE PRICE IS THE BEST I&#x27;VE FOUND.  I&#x27;VE HAD THIS PRODUCT MUSCLE TESTED ( KINESIOLOGY) TO SEE IF GOOD FOR MY BODY, IT TESTS A 10 OUT OF 10!  MAKES ME FEEL ENERGIZED, HELPS CREATE ALKALINITY AND GIVES ME THE GREENS I&#x27;M NEEDING SO MUCH, HARD TO ACTUALLY CONSUME THE NEEDED DOSE OF VEGIES, FRUIT, PROBIOTICS, ETC THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME ON A DAILY BASIS.  SO HERE IT IS IN ONE BIG SCOOP! ALL INGREDIENTS ARE LISTED, THATS IMPORTANT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a health kick lately, just trying to focus eating better and healthier.  I came across this product here on Amazon and it had such great reviews so I ordered it.  It&#x27;s great!  Yes, it may not taste like candy or anything, but it&#x27;s really not bad.  I make my green smoothies every morning for breakfast and lunch- 2 scoops of Green Vibrance powder, 2 scoops of Whey protein powder, 2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, 1 scoop of fiber powder, and 2 cups of frozen fruit.  Mix it all up in my awesome Ninja blender (It makes the best smoothies!!!), and I have 2 of my meals for the day.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for 2 weeks now and I have felt so much better.  I&#x27;ve really been more energized.  Actually, a couple of people have commented to me about how much more energy I have.  For a while there, I was feeling fatigued all the time.  And as a side note, I have lost weight doing this, too, which is great!  It&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m getting more vitamins and minerals that my body needs.</li>
            <li> Good supplement. We noticed more energy and overall better health feeling. Lost some weight and noticed the usual afternoon slump has gone away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for about six years.  I first started taking Greens plus which is also a very good Green superfood, but I was introduced to Green Vibrance by a local health food clerk...she was taking it and highly recommend it to all of her family and friends.  I feel a lot better when I take Green Vibrance, it gives me lots of energy and my skin has a glow...I think it actually makes me look younger.  I usually buy the larger Green Vibrance, which is a better deal.  I purchased two (60 Day supply)from Amazon at a great price for $41.59.  I recently purchase Rainbow Vibrance and I mix a small scoop with the Green Vibrance for added nutrition.  I take it with a little water mixed with my favorite juice...usually cranberry juice or apple juice.  It does not taste bad to me when I only mix it with water, because I know I am doing something positive for my health.  I will continue to take Green Vibrance as long as they make it.  You can not beat the price from Amazon.com.  If you want to take a very good Green superfood, I would highly recommend Green Vibrance....it is a great product...give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for several years now and have to say I am very healthy for 59. I have alot of energy and feel great.  I was reading the reviews and noticed one that only had one star due to the Iron content he found in version 10.1 and below. As he stated they keep changing the formula.  I always assumed it was for the better. And still think that is true.     His complaint was that in the 10.1 version the Iron content is very high and the newer version is lower.  I have been on the automatic delivery of this product from amazon and the current jar of Green vibrance I have open and  am using is the 10.1 version.  He is correct the amount of iron in this version is 16.4 mg or 87% I have 2 other jars from amazon that are the 10.3 version and the Iron content is much less it is 3.72 mg or 20.8%.  This is a huge difference.   After learning about this from the review, I am not happy when I think about how long I have been ingesting a huge amount of Iron.  The other issue I have is the soy lecithin.  I used to take soy lecithin by itself and stopped due to the added estrogen and the bad information about soy even though it is non GMO.  I would like to see them remove this ingredient.           Out side of those 2 issues, I have not come across any other green drink that has as much in it as Green Vibrance.  It eliminates having to take a fist full of vimimins and herbs.    I have been taking this product since 2006.      People say I look like I am in my 40&#x27;s and I will be 60 in a few months.  I am not over weight, I eat organically.  I wake up in the morning and this is the first thing I do, mix my Green Vibrance with a glass of water and drink it like tea.  I know it says to take after eating but I like it better first thing.  It empties me out in the morning that way.   I am gald to see they fixed the iron issue.  I would hate to have to give up this product.  If I get another 10.1 jar it will go back, so far the last 2 deliveries have been the newer version.  In my oppinon this is by far the best green drink on the market.  I will pay closer attention to what is in it. But overall I believe it is very helpful to my health.</li>
            <li> We had been using All Day Energy Greens from the Institute for Vibrant Living before we compared ingredients to Green Vibrance. Green Vibrance is not as sweet but I feel it has had a positive change in replacing good bacteria in the intestines and helps to push waste through. I have noticed increased energy levels and just an all around sense of well being. Because I like mine sweeter,I mix mine with four to eight ounces of juice in the morning. My husband also drinks this but mixes his with water. Some people may find it hard to drink the \\&quot;gritty-ness\\&quot; of green drinks but I don&#x27;t think it is too bad. Flavor wise, this is pretty mild. I have actually found myself craving it more than once a day. This drink helps to alkalize my body and helps eliminate my acid reflux symptoms like my esophagial spasms. If you have never had a green drink, I would start with a smaller container to see if you even like it.</li>
            <li> I put Green Vibrance in my smoothies which I have 3-4 times a week. I really think it makes a difference. I couldn&#x27;t possibly get this kind of nutrition from my food. I feel like I have more energy, sleep better and I&#x27;m rarely tired. I chase 3 young children around, work full time, run/workout, and I&#x27;m never sick. I recommend Green Vibrance to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is an excellent product, priced nicely (compare it to the overpriced Athletic Greens), and with full disclosure label (no proprietary blend nonsense). I&#x27;ve been taking it for weeks now, and past the first day \\&quot;not so good\\&quot; taste (before i stored it in the freezer) i got accustomed to it and actually enjoy the taste now. When i run out i will definitely buy some more, as i do feel like taking it has improved (and still is improving) my health and energy levels. I love it! :)</li>
            <li> Brought this product based on the good review. Took it for a week and got really bad constipation. Did a search and found one person reported the same effect. I know that Spirulina, one the ingredient in green vibrant can causes constipation. I will continue to take this product since I know it&#x27;s good for my system but not on a daily basis (3 times a week ... Mon,Wed, Fri).</li>
            <li> To get the old $58  price I need to subscribe now?  Terrible idea. Love the product but won&#x27;t go for this price gauge.</li>
            <li> This product was first recommended to me by a physician friend about 15 years ago. I have been taking it ever since. I feel good when I take it. I am a very health conscious person and I take a variety of supplements; this is my favorite (although omega 3&#x27;s are also very important). There are many greens products on the market; check the ingredient labels and you will see that Green Vibrance is the best. No, it won&#x27;t cure your every health problem. No, it can&#x27;t replace a healthy diet. Yes, it is a darn good supplement.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  The delivery from amazon and the price were wonderful.  I highly recommend this product for your everyday health and stamina!</li>
            <li> I take a little less than a scoopful before a cardio workout and it gives me a big energy boost. Since I take the recommended amount stated on the package, the large container lasts me quite a while. Some people complain about the taste but just mix it with a beverage. I frankly don&#x27;t care about the taste, only about the result. I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> You will be hooked for the rest of your life. Why don&#x27;t everyone know about this amazing product. Well, I tried to help save a lot of people and they just wouldn&#x27;t listen. I said please buy this before you buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I heard about Green Vibrance through one of my favorite bloggers.  Since I am trying to cut back on processed foods and ingredients, I made sure I did plenty of research on this product.  FINALLY, I decided to purchase it.  I drank my drink every morning just to see what happened.  In the first 3 days, my skin went from average to glowing.  Usually my skin looks this way when I&#x27;m jogging and eating a VERY balanced diet.  As time went on, I noticed my nails were getting longer as well as my eyelashes....and my hair got sooooo much thicker!  I&#x27;m not sure about my energy levels because I get up and get going pretty well on my own, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t hampered it.  I can only say to try this product for yourself.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle product, but I was looking for something nutritious and as GREEN as possible.  I was juicing prior to Green Vibrance, and still do occasionally, but this is quicker (and cheaper) and it has been a great buy for me.  I just ordered another 60-day supply this morning and decided to write my review before exiting Amazon.  Being able to see as many results in a short amount of time is definitely a reason for me to keep buying!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of green veggies, but realize they are important to health and well being.  I searched for supplements and decided to go with this one based on the user reviews.  I feel much better and have more energy now!  I&#x27;m pretty much a skeptic so I was shocked at the difference!  The taste is not that bad.  I mix it with 4 ounces of oj and 2 ounces of water. It isn&#x27;t a sipping drink so knock it back in a two or three swallows!  I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> bought for $50 a month ago, now price jumps 16% to $58, will not but again, this is costing too much, it is like $2/day</li>
            <li> I noticed more energy within a week of taking it.  After two weeks my body was on a regular schedule(no need to go into details).  After three weeks I noticed my nails growing fast and strong-including my hair.  I just felt great all over.  While everyone was getting sick with colds, I never got sick. I felt mentally and physically balanced.  Then I ran out and was running low on funds and stopped cold turkey.  I started feeling sluggish and completely out of wack!  I didn&#x27;t think it was because I was missing the Green vibrance.  I chucked it to being stressed out at work.  Once I stepped back and thought about it, it clicked.  I&#x27;m now back on the band wagon and feeling fresh!  I will be honest it taste like crap and it took awhile for me to figure out how to make it work.  The secret is bananas!  Ok, fine....you need to make a smoothie with strawberries or other berries, yogurt and at least half of a banana and its sooo yummy.  Ive tried it with no banana and it was just yucky.  Hope this helps some of you!  Enjoy!  Oh, they also sell this at Super Supplement Stores for a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it on Dr Oz. Since I am not good about getting enough veggies in my diet, I feel this is a good alternative.  I put it in my morning protein shake and at first the taste was different, but edible. Now I  don&#x27;t even notice it. Sometimes I even throw in a banana. I would recommend this product. Price is also good compared to other sites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in my breakfast smoothies with bananas, strawberries, juice and protein for about 6 months and I am very satisfied.  As someone who juices fruits and veggies, Green Vibrance is very convenient for the daily routine.  I recently started a new job that to my surprise required 12-15 hour days for the last  4 weeks and my energy levels have been amazing.  At the end of the day, I marvel at how good I feel.</li>
            <li> Since taking green vibrance I have an energy that I haven&#x27;t felt in years.  If you can get past the taste (I hold my nose),it seems to balance what is in my body.  I haven&#x27;t been sick since I have started taking it and I am around sniffling, sneezing kids all day long.  It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I think I have done this before.  But I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have had digestive problems most of my adult life and since using Green Vibrance - we call it \\&quot;green stuff\\&quot; in our house - I feel better than I have in years.  It is expensive, in my humble opinion, but well worth.  It tastes terrible.  If it didn&#x27;t work so well, I would look for something else.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is an excellent product.  I have been taking it about a year and have not had a cold or flu throughout this season. I have introduced the product to family members and they say that their digestion problems have gotten better since taking the product. I&#x27;ve tried mixing it with different juices.  Although I don&#x27;t usually care for the taste of apple juice, apple juice is definitely the best for the green powder. I would say that grape juice is the second best juice to use with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try Now Phytofood at some point, but Green Vibrance is really great for joint health.  It tastes bad but is drinkable mixed in water.  I&#x27;d imagine with juice it&#x27;s ok. It mixes pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I drink this stuff every day mixed with a little juice or metamucil or nothing. It tastes OK. The health benefits are worth it. Have used it for over a year...haven&#x27;t been sick and have felt great and full of energy.</li>
            <li> This product probably does all it claims but I&#x27;ll never be able to find out because it tastes so bad I can&#x27;t bring myself to finish a glass. I have better chances of winning on fear factor. Good luck with this one fellow consumers.</li>
            <li> Although a little on the bland side (what would you expect from greens) I do like the taste when mixed with OJ or carrott juice. Can&#x27;t say I feel any difference, but it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m getting my veggies and fruits.</li>
            <li> Every household should have a jar of this product in the kitchen and everyone really ought to have a dose each day...even if someone has a great diet of veggies and fruits.  We cannot get enough greens as they are wonderfully detoxifying.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been taking this every day for the last 2 weeks. I think our skin looks better. We sleep better. We are a little less moody and seem to handle stress better. It will keep you regular. It tastes awful. My wife chugs it in juice. I choose not to. I sprinkle it over a mashed banana and add some honey to the concoction. Overall, for us, this is a safe supplement that gives us enough of a positive effect that we will continue to buy it and take it. I think it beats taking a multivitamin by a long shot. It is a good mental \\&quot;carrot\\&quot; too. I&#x27;ll think of eating something unhealthy and then I think but if I ate that my Green Vibrance wouldn&#x27;t work as well and I&#x27;m paying for that. Yeah. It does that too. I&#x27;d recommend it to most people though yes it is a shotgun approach. I just think it is funny when I&#x27;m listening to the herb guy on the radio do his show and he&#x27;ll start talking about something and I&#x27;ll look at my wife and say hey isn&#x27;t that in that stuff we are taking? More than half the time it is.</li>
            <li> Since taking I have lost weight, felt better, had more energy.  I&#x27;ve done the 30 supplements a day thing.  Turns out that Green Vibrance and a probiotic were all I REALLY needed.  If I miss it, I notice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I feel like it&#x27;s perfect for Americans who for the most part have acidic diets. I have not gotten sick at all since I have taken this. I think it&#x27;s been almost a year now. I notice on the days I miss taking it I feel more anxious, and have less energy, and tend to not be as happy. When your body is happy that makes you happy. I really believe that we are what we eat. I highly recommend this product. I recommend, however, even if this is a food and not really a vitamin, to still start out with a small amount because people can have bad reactions to anything. This is a wonderful supplement! Thanks Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li> i put a scoop in a 1/4 cup of yogurt w/ a dash of honey- great way to start your day.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has kept me healthy and regular even with a recent surgery and while taking narcotics. I take this everyday and will forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every vitamin and green food out there and this has by far the most effect for me.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to so many people I can&#x27;t count and EVERY SINGLE ONE is still taking it, despite the dollar per day cost.  All report more energy and mental clarity.  Some report clearer skin, lower blood pressure &amp; other antioxidant benefits.  Before taking this I was on daily alpha lipoic acid, green tea, grape seed, CoQ10, and a daily multi but I ditched them all for this &amp; see more positive results with less cash out the door.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not the best tasting thing but it is great for the GI tract.  Add it to your morning smoothie, fruit helps hide the taste.</li>
            <li> Want health?!!?  The price that you can get this stuff for through Amazon.com is unreal.  I paid $56 and some change with shipping for a 2 month supply.  This is the cream of the crop when it comes to nutrition.  At Whole Foods you spend close to $100 with tax.    Don&#x27;t wait another day!  GET IT! YEAH BABY!!    Chaddy Chad ;-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! If you check out my other reviews you will see I don&#x27;t rave about everything. I use one scoop with 4 strawberries, a few blueberries, 2 table spoons of yogurt, 4 baby carrots, a small piece of celery, and a cup of water each morning.  This mixture tastes delicious like a milk shake, keeps me full until lunch time (which allowed me to lose 5 stubborn pounds), and gives me so much energy I am able to go without coffee.  I have tried making this drink without the Green Vibrance and my energy level is just not the same.  This is also the 4th green drink I have tried and no other compares. This is now a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Good product but in my opinion too expensive for what you get. Now Foods has a Phytofood that is comparable but A LOT LESS MONEY FOR MORE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I take a great many supplements, which makes it hard to tell just how effective any given item is, but the Green Vibrance seems to help with regularity among other things.    The quantity provided is very generous. The bottle says 60 day supply, using one heaping scoop per day, but I tend to get closer to 90 days out of a jar.    While the directions say to mix it with water, the result is very unpleasant tasting.  I mix it with a zero-sugar-added cranberry juice, and it is much more enjoyable.  It does require frequent stirring to keep the parts that don&#x27;t dissolve mixed in, and there is often a significant amount of residue left on the inside and bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li> Since I started drinking Green Vibrance I definitely have more energy. My skin and hair look better and I am more \\&quot;regular.\\&quot;   It doesn&#x27;t taste very good, but I put it in a fruit smoothie and it&#x27;s not so bad at all.  I like this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I am a very healthy person as it is.  I exercise regularly and adhere to a very strict diet.  I purchased Green Vibrance hoping to enhance my overall health and was also hoping for a little extra energy as well.  After I finished my first 30 day supply of it, I hadn&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my health or my energy level.  Since the stuff was so expensive, I decided not to repurchase it.  A few days later, I noticed that my endurance in the gym had dropped and my overall mood throughout the day was terrible.  Since Green Vibrance was the only thing that I had changed, I decided to order another tub and immediately started feeling better once I began taking it again.  Just to be sure this wasn&#x27;t a fluke, I had this tested another time that I ran out of product before I could reorder and felt the same decline in mood and endurance until it arrived to me.  This stuff won&#x27;t magically make you into a ball of energy or instantly make you healthy, but over time this product will contribute positively to your health and mood.  I will continue to be a loyal customer, it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read the reviewed before purchasing this product and everybody was saying positive things about and since my husband and I need to add a supplement to our diet and workout program we decided to purchase it. We have been using it for about two weeks as directed and we have seen small changes mainly with digestion. As of now we don&#x27;t feel any energy boosts. We usually take in the morning and it is fulfilling and it does keep us full for a while.</li>
            <li> So I got the four hour body book and bought everything in there. I was pretty shocked at the price of the \\&quot;athletic greens\\&quot; recommended - it&#x27;s like $100+ for a 30 day supply.  It was however, delicious.  I looked forward to it. After I ran out, I bought this, which is like half the cost for double the amount--- that seemed great.  But good god, this tastes like vomit. Nothing I can do. I dread it. Really gross. Can&#x27;t manage to swallow it quick enough not to taste it.  So I think I&#x27;ll go back to the taking the pain in my wallet vs. my mouth. I mean seriously, I already am taking cold showers, eating cinnamon, no sugar, no bread... but this is a little much.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the best ever...and they are constantly improving this product..therefore each time you purchase this it is better than before...Thank You</li>
            <li> I love this product.....my skin and my hair have improved in texture and appearance.  This product gives me great energy and I no longer drink caffeine for a boost of energy.  Also....since I started using this product I have lost the craving for cigarettes.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing my mom who is 59 takes this product and she is essentials off her acid reflux medication completely. I love this product for many reasons overall health is the main thing a great way to get your greens it balances out your ph in a big way</li>
            <li> Man, this stuff is an immediate rush. It&#x27;s like main-lining vitamins. I just mix a scoop with a glass of juice and I feel energetic immediately. Do yourself a favor and get this stuff.</li>
            <li> First of all the Bad. The taste, which i don&#x27;t mind actually, is like eating your lawn ground up, no pain no gain right? I actually prefer the taste than knowing i&#x27;m downing more sugar or artificial sweeteners which i don&#x27;t need. This thing is high in fiber, and will make you regular, but not an emergency run to the bathroom. It will also make you lose weight. I assume this is from the fiber, and detox effects of having so much good stuff in your body. The miracle. I have had this weird foot fungus forever on my foot, and the only thing i have changed recently is adding this to my diet, and it&#x27;s getting better!!! I just noticed it the other day. I have been on the product for two weeks at this point and can already tell its working. Everyone around me at work is sick. EVERYBODY. I haven&#x27;t even caught a hint of a sniffle. I hope they don&#x27;t ever get rid of this product or change it in any way. I don&#x27;t know if I could find something like this elsewhere. I can verify that it does give you a slight energy boost also. If you can stay away from fast food, soda, and drink this every day you will probably be doing more than 98 percent of American&#x27;s out there for your health. Make it your sacred three food rules. I have.</li>
            <li> A very healthful additive to ones daily intake of supplements my cardiolgist was extremely happy to see this in my list of daily intake</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my 2 dogs who both have terminal illnesses.  It seems to have greatly improved their quality of life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking half a scoop (see why, below) each day for a couple weeks now and I think I do see an increase in energy. Also, my fingernails seem to be stronger and growing faster, interestingly enough.  My main reason for posting this review is for folks like me who don&#x27;t like the taste of Green Vibrance.  I&#x27;ve been doing the following and it is working like a CHARM:  1) Fill shot glass 80% full with cold water  2) Mix in half a scoop of Green Vibrance (any more, and it won&#x27;t really dissolve.)  3) Pinch nose, take shot  4) While still pinching nose, begin to chew on a Lifesaver or other candy  5) Un-pinch nose, and voila! You taste only candy!  I guess I could do two shots to get the full one-scoop dose, but so far I seem to be getting results with only half, so I&#x27;m not going to fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for a little over a week now and noticing a difference in my energy so far, no longer crave my usual two shots of espresso in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix in a scoop with my usual morning smoothie that consists of frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, some blueberry kefir, probiotic stony farms strawberry yogurt and almond milk.  Don&#x27;t notice a bad taste at all!</li>
            <li> Does not taste good, but that&#x27;s not why you take your greens, right? Would get 5 stars if they somehow figured that out. I may give them 5 after all if I see other benefits of using.  Just started taking about 2 weeks ago and I only take on days that I don&#x27;t have time to make a fresh green drink.</li>
            <li> We may not know how to technically boost our immune system, but learning how to feed our body the right nutrients can at least help us not damage our immune system further.  I have found, when taking this product regularly, a severe decrease in the amount of &amp;#34;sick days&amp;#34; I have: days when someone sneezes and you get bronchitis.  I do and would still highly recommend this product as a supplement to anyone&#x27;s diet.  OF course, you should always check with your doctor first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing is the taste.  I mix it with a little fruit juice and then water it down before I gulp it.  I&#x27;ve also mixed it in with smoothies to dilute the taste a bit.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is great. I have looked long and hard for  a natural supplement to suit my body and life style.  This is it!!</li>
            <li> I mix the scoop full in a small jar with 3 ounces of Rice Dream and shake-em-up. After I chug that, I immediately follow with a half glass of Rice Dream. I noticed it&#x27;s really easier to handle the taste if I don&#x27;t breathe thru my nose until I&#x27;ve had the glass of Rice Dream. I really hated it at the beginning, now it&#x27;s easy. I don&#x27;t eat animal products and I&#x27;m in really good health. I haven&#x27;t noticed any energy change, however I&#x27;ve noticed my hunger throughout the day is less intense and less frequent. I&#x27;ve found dosing the Green in the morning late makes this happen. Before using GV I had to discipline myself to keep from munching all the time. Now that&#x27;s easy as well....good luck</li>
            <li> Product is power packed full of nutrients. The smoothies I make are filling and I actually save money over time because I am eating less. I drink the Rainbow Vibrance in the morning, and then drink this in the afternoon. I will be adding Miracle Reds in the evening (comes as a 3 month supply), but that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so this stuff tastes as bad as many of the reviewers say it does. So...what to do? Well, I like chocolate. I blend this powder with almond milk, a few almonds, organic raw cocoa powder, raw antioxidant honey, a bit &#x27;o kelp (a tiny bit, mind you), and organic vanilla extract. YUMMY!! (if you are willing to pretend the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t really happen, hehehe). Seriously, this ends up being a solidly rich and healthy chocolate afternoon meal substitute. And, you spent less money than you would have if you had packed a lunch for the two months straight that this stuff will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...my two cents.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has become our family favorite to start the day for several reasons. Medical experts tell us that we need to reduce the acidity in our diets and increase the alkaline levels, a factor in improving general health. Selected greens in GV not only raise the alkaline pH levels, but add energy. Our family has taken one additional step with GV. We&#x27;ve come up with \\&quot;the green drink recipe\\&quot; that offers a pleasing taste, and adds more protein and fiber.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re like most can&#x27;t get your daily intake...Vibrant Health Green Vibrance Family Size Power - 60 Day Supply, 25.4-Ounce...I Juice ever day and add this in I like to juice cantaloupe and blueberries...or Apple and grapes! The taste his better hidden in the Apple grape!  Pricey but Organic Veggies aren&#x27;t cheap either!</li>
            <li> I am a big advocate of juicing and try to have at least one green juice per day. I was looking for a product I could use as a replacement for the real thing on the days that I just don&#x27;t have time to use my juicer. I came across Green Viberance and, impressed by the glowing reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I am now addicted and have incorporated it in to my daily routine. It is easy to bring a scoop with me and mix in a glass of water when I&#x27;m out and about. I was initially worried about the reviews that spoke of its aweful taste however I do not find the taste to be as bad as expected. I mix with water and guzzle it down. The taste can be muted by mixing with other jucies. There is no substitute for fresh, raw veggies and fruit juices but this powder is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> The taste of Green Vibrance is far superior to the other major green powder that I had been using.  Also I like the fact that they detail the ingredients and amount of each in the product.  Also you can actually read the label.  The other drink I was using had print so small you could barely read it with a magnifying glass and they did not detail the ingredients other than listing the ingredients (but without precise measurements of each).  I will stick with Green Vibrance from now on.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to even believe but since I have been taking this once per day my craving have dropped to non existent.  I have not had chocolate or sweets of any kind in a month.  I don&#x27;t even think of sweets.  My energy level is MUCH better and I have started back working out every day.  You will not regret this purchase plus it is a great price compared to the box stores.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a product I have been using regularly for years, and i was happy to find this source which offers the product at the lowest price I could find and in convenient autoship.  Before each shipment I receive an email and opportunity to cancel the order, which allows me time to check my stock.  And I do love the free shipping.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product.  I have bought four of these so far and take a scoop everyday along with my fiance.  It has helped balance her hormones and because of that cleared up acne.  A lot of people do not realize that this is a high Alkaline product making it very good at balancing the bodies PH.  I highly recommend those who are not sure to buy this once and take it everyday.  You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he says he has lots more energy.  The taste is a little hard to take but orange juice helps.  If it was not for the taste, I would give it 5 stars.  I am on chemo, and with so many things interfering with chemo, my doctor asked me not to take anything until after my treatments.  As soon as they are over in July, I will be using this product also.</li>
            <li> I would ;; this product choose this product to anyone who needs more energy &#x27;every day  I am 71 feel 41everytime I drink it.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the Amazon price....they sell the 30 day supply at a local health food place near me for the same price, so this price for 60 days just can&#x27;t be beat....  I don&#x27;t mind the taste, just mix it with a half glass of juice and another half water. I feel good taking it. I don&#x27;t eat as much vegetables as I should, so this is a good supplement for me.  R</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for many years. I am shocked to see the report from ConsumerLab.com that it contains high levels of arsenic (24.3 mcg) including the most toxic and carinogen type of inorganic arsenic. I researched the response from Vibrant Health and found them to be dismissive of these findings. The findings of ConsumerLab.com was confirmed by another independent laboratory. I will stop using it since the risk far outweighs the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find a summary of the report at [...] You have to pay for the detailed report, which I also read.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health is a very good product and this is a great price.  It came right away.  I hope to buy again.</li>
            <li> All is promises it really. Great product. Well worth the cost. I have recommended to many of my friends. All like it.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s fast paced world, we can sometimes neglect to take care of ourselves as well as we should. I use Green Vibrance to supplement my diet. I love this product. The ingredients in it seem very healthy, kinda like those vegetables I haven&#x27;t got around to eating. When I take Green Vibrance, I really feel like I&#x27;m taking care of myself, that&#x27;s a good feeling.  Protip: Don&#x27;t use a ton a juice when mixing.  I made this mistake, using way too much cranberry juice. It&#x27;s better to take a big scoop with less juice.  It makes it easier to drink and it&#x27;s better not having to drink a ton of sugar.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have taken other greens but this one seems to make my energy last all day and it mixes very good with other things like whey protein.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to add. It&#x27;s great stuff: unadulterated ingredients, no secret blends. It&#x27;s all on the label; buy with confidence. Note that it does not taste that great (I assume because of the Spirulina), so I mix it into my carrot juice.</li>
            <li> I must admit, even with the 100+, mostly glowing reviews, I was sceptical when I bought this. I thought that adding this stuff to my diet would have, at best, a negligible impact on my health. I&#x27;ve never been so glad to be wrong.    First off, let me address the energy boost. Now, reading the reviews, I saw plenty of people claiming that this gave them energy, but when I looked up Green Vibrance&#x27; ingredient list I saw that it contained green tea extract. So of course, I thought that the energy boost was from caffeine and nothing else. However, I&#x27;m pretty sure I can tell when I&#x27;m on caffeine. I never drank soda or coffee as a child so I&#x27;m very sensitive to it, and as far as I can tell the energy boost doesn&#x27;t come from caffeine. This product does indeed make me feel energized but it&#x27;s a clean, non-stimulating kind of energy, if that makes any sense. It lasts all day too. Simply put, I&#x27;m 25 now, but when I consume this, I feel like I have the energy I did in my late teens.     Second, I didn&#x27;t think that adding it to my daily diet would have an impact on my health because I&#x27;m already sort of a health nut. I exercise regularly and have a diet that consists almost entirely of whole grains, veggies, fruits, legumes, and lean meat. Except for the weird stuff in it like milk thistle extract, I didn&#x27;t think it would contain anything that I&#x27;m not already getting plenty of! But my hair and skin are more moist, I&#x27;m sleeping about thirty minutes less a night, and I even feel as if I can think a little more clearly.    Now, everything that I&#x27;ve written can still be chalked up to the placebo effect. However, there&#x27;s one more thing it&#x27;s done for me that cannot be attributed to placebo, the reason I&#x27;ll be buying Green Vibrance for the conceivable future. I&#x27;ve been dealing with chronic dry, red eyes and joint pain since my early teens, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, has been able to change that. I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of money on internists and rheumatologists throughout my adult life, and none of them have ever been able to find anything wrong with me. I&#x27;d resigned myself to putting in some Visine and popping some Ibuprofen whenever my symptoms flared up, but honest to God, a few days of Green Vibrance has cleared those problems right up. I wish I knew what was in this stuff that could have such an effect on me, and I know it isn&#x27;t the Vitamin D either because I get plenty of sunlight when I&#x27;m out running! What I do know is that I&#x27;m completely sold on this product.     If, after reading all of this, you&#x27;re still sceptical like I was, try a month&#x27;s supply and see how it makes you feel. I can almost guarantee that you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The taste is not that great, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that tastes good this may not be it.  As far as quality, this id fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product for some years and believe it is one of the best products for giving you energy, keeping your immune system, and helping you stay young.  Don&#x27;t go a day without it! - Dr. Lisa Love, [[ASIN:1571745564 Beyond the Secret]]</li>
            <li> Product was easy to take and did not taste bad.  It does not look good but very easy to take and very little after taste.  I would tell anyone who does not eat green veggie to try this. It is really a good source for getting the green veggie you need with out eating so much.</li>
            <li> I  use it  in power  protein  shakes  and  also  in my  fresh  juicing.  No bad  after taste,  also  compared it  with  other  products  and it  wins  hands  down.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for almost 5 years now. It gives you an extra serving of \\&quot;greens\\&quot; as well as several immune boosting benefits. I used to get sick farely regularly... over the last 5 years, since I started Green Vibrance, I have only been sick a handful of times! Unfortunately the product has become more expensive; however, Amazon offers the best price!</li>
            <li> I have put this product into my daily routine.  It provides me with my daily veggies, improves my energy level, has priorities, skin and health improves. I  mix scoop with 6-7 oz H.M. Apple juice ans sometimes when I make a protein smoothie. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but keep coming back to this one. I recommend to anyone who wants to improve their health gain vitamins and energy</li>
            <li> BEWARE.  According to ConsumerLab.com (a provider of independent test results and information on health and nutrition products), this product is contaminated with arsenic.  Inorganic arsenic is a known human carcinogen (regardless of how it is eliminated) and NO amount is considered &amp;#34;safe.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a big jar of it, but now that I have found out about this, I am throwing it out pronto.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old and have been taking green super-foods for over 20 years. I started out with a product called Exsula Iridesca (excellent but expensive). I have tried numerous others (the 2nd best for me was Boku Super-food) that were good as well. Green Vibrance has been overall the best for me. Green super-foods have detoxed my liver and has given me the nutrition my body needs and filled the nutritional voids from eating even a healthy diet.     If you are not used to green super-foods the taste may seem terrible at best. I suggest mixing it in cranberry or other strong juice to start. If you are into green smoothies as I am you can put it into the green smoothie (or other smoothie). It will however change the taste, but the nutrition you get from this supplement will be worth it.     The price Amazon has for this product (go for the autoship-you can change your mind later)is an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good quality. Since my husband started to take this, over 4 months ago, he&#x27;s noticed quite a difference on how he feels. He mixes it with 100% fruit juice and has adapted to the taste. Which isn&#x27;t all that hard to do. This was a reorder and if it doesn&#x27;t get too expensive, I certainly plan on continuing to reordering. Thanks for a great transaction, also.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both started taking this stuff about 14 days ago. We both have more energy, sleep better, all around feel better. I have nasty allergies and my eyes would hurt all day long. I was an eye drop addict. After taking this stuff, I use my eye drops once a day. Gotta be the green stuff right?</li>
            <li> Since taking it, and I have been taking it since the beginning of the year, maybe earlier, I have lost 35 lbs.  Although, that is not the reason I have been taking it, I feel a bit better about skimping on food because I know my body is getting the necessary nutrients without sending it into starvation mode which slows down the metabolism even further.  I am post menopausal and NOTHING to this point has taken off the weight, not even diet and exercise.  This boosted my metabolism, apparently.  I also take a daily chewable vitamin (Centrum, not the gummies) and Tumeric, although I didn&#x27;t begin with the tumeric until after I lost the weight.  In any case, it worked for me, besides just plain being good for you overall.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is great for supplementing greens intake... it is easily dissolved into water which makes it easy to use daily.  There is an intense green food taste which is much stronger than wheatgrass.  It is best to mix this with something other than water unless you enjoy the taste.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00014D0D4 Vibrant Health - Green Vibrance, 22.43 oz powder]]    I have been using this powder pretty much daily for awhile now - at least a year. All I can say is that I notice a difference within a few days if I stop taking it. I&#x27;m using Green Vibrance as my main source of supplementation and save money by no longer purchasing vitamins the way I formerly did. (I have come to the conclusion that vitamins in pill or capsle form don&#x27;t get processed anyway.) My only complaint is that this powder is rather nasty tasting and can be hard to get down without some sort of sweetener.  It can be a little difficult finding a beverage to use with it if you are trying, like I am, to stay away from juice. Yet, the benefits of this product far outweigh this inconvenience. I use Green Vibrance with powdered vitamin C. This combination seems to be, for me at least, a good boost for the immune system.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $70 to by this product in the store.  In my opinion it was worth the extra money, because it is the best powdered Greens available.  Being able to get it from Amazon for much less is a fantastic bonus!</li>
            <li> $100 is the normal price?  My subscription price last month was only $41.90 and this month has jumped an ASTRONOMICAL $7.31!  That is an increase of over 17%.  They say the normal price is $100??????  Come on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance every morning for the last 5 years upon my naturopathic doctor&#x27;s recommendation.  I suffered with seasonal allergies (both spring pollen and summer ragweed) for over 20 years.  Often I would end up with a case of bronchitis because of it.  I started taking GV in the spring of &#x27;05 and haven&#x27;t had seasonal allergies since!  It must do wonders for the immune system and detoxifying the body in general.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I love it! I was drinking it in orange juice but didn&#x27;t want the calories of the oj so thought i&#x27;d just try it in water. I used to drink shots of wheatgrass so I thought what the heck...I&#x27;ll just pretend it&#x27;s a shot of wheatgrass and it worked! I just mix a scoop with about 3 oz of water and a drop of liquid stevia and chug it down and it&#x27;s not bad at all! It really helps with my digestive track and I know I&#x27;m getting lots of vitamins and veggies when I take this. Great product that I recommend to anyone who will listen to me! :) I think it&#x27;s worth the money knowing I&#x27;m putting something in my body that&#x27;s good for me...even if it&#x27;s only 2-3 times a week it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Great product.everything they say it is.better than any probiotic I have used.i do wish they added kelp to this.&lt;br /&gt;The taste and texture is not pleasing but I treat it like medicine and get it over with.&lt;br /&gt;Works best with warm water,best for mixing and easier for your body to assimilate product.</li>
            <li> I am still awaiting any immense benefits, but the only way I can drink this is in orange juice while holding my nose.  It&#x27;s been just over a week, so I&#x27;ll be happy to give further updates and let you know if I get use to the awful taste.  Rating is based on taste alone.  After my first try, it sat for two weeks before I was brave enough to try again.  Hopeful :)</li>
            <li> I finished the 60 day supply and didn&#x27;t really notice any great benefits from it.  It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water.  Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after.  Other than that, it was pretty expensive and I didn&#x27;t feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews.  I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who don&#x27;t like their veggies??</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it really makes a huge difference.  Keeps your stomach feeling great.  If you wake up with an upset stomach use this product.  I swear it cures any discomfort in your gut.  5 stars all the way and priced great compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Green Vibrance for years now. It keeps my blood sugar stable and makes me less hungry. The nutrients provided satisfy my hunger cravings and revive my energy. I use this early in the morning, before my work out. I also keep some at the office to use when I need a boost before my massage work. It goes without saying that Green Vibrance is a much more beneficial boost than caffeine or sugar.    [[ASIN:B000NDME6C Green Vibrance by Vibrant Health - 24.34 Ounces (60 day supply)]]</li>
            <li> This is overall a good product. It is basically organic with some exceptions. It would be nice if it could be all organic.The taste is not so good and you have to use it in juice or it tastes like lawn mowing chips</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for over a month now and absolutely love it! Since I never purchased this for an \\&quot;energy boost\\&quot; I am puzzled by all the posts regarding that or the lack of. That really is not it&#x27;s primary purpose!     Anyway, as some said - the taste is pretty awful, but then most of them are. I make my own green smoothies at home, and actually love the taste. This stuff is different though, so it takes some time to find the best way to drink it. My doctor recommended it to me, and he said he drinks it with half a packet of the individual Crystal Light peach teas. I tried that and it was more tolerable, but not great. So one morning (I&#x27;ll probably gross someone out here...) while fixing my pre-gym chocolate protein shake, I thought \\&quot;what the heck?\\&quot; and added a scoop of Green Vibrance. The chocolate flavor almost complete drowned out the grassy taste of it and it is now my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; breakfast shake! I think the taste that stands out to me is the alfalfa grass, as I have always found that flavor to be YUCK.     Regardless, it is great stuff and I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> This get&#x27;s great reviews, and as far as &amp;#34;green shakes&amp;#34; go this has the best list of ingredients - the taste is as expected ... I wouldn&#x27;t drink this because I love the taste, i drink it for the benefits.  I am a little worried over the high amount of arsenic found in it though, and the fact that the company has neglected to address that issue with a response worries me more.  I will probably switch over to a different product strictly because of that.</li>
            <li> I thought about juicing.  But, this is so much more convenient.  It would be very hard and maybe even more expensive to juice so many fruits and veggies every day, along with adding probiotics.  This powder covers it all.  I take it on the road with me too.  The taste is also fine mixed in a smoothie.  I feel like I&#x27;m staying super healthy this way.  I just bought the all greens version (dogs can&#x27;t eat grapes, etc.) for my elderly dog.  He is a cancer survivor and has weak kidneys.  So, I think this will help him too.  Now, I don&#x27;t need to worry about making him fresh veggies every day either.  He lapped it up, mixed in with his goats milk yogurt and dog food.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very good for people but go slowly!  Other members of my family take it and feel it is good for their health.  Some of us have jumped right in and taken the required amount only to find it constipating.  It seems to work better if you start with less and slowly build up to the suggested amount.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on the DR.OZ, show, and decided to try it out. I did some research on the internet and found that Amazon had the most reasonable price. I have been using the product for a short time and find that I seem to have more energy.</li>
            <li> It works okay. Provides a little boost of energy in the morning and may slowly be affecting my digestive track. I haven&#x27;t been full blown sick since I started taking it. I did get a little sick but then I got over it. Overall I&#x27;d recommend the product but at almost $60 for a two month supply I&#x27;d say only buy it if you&#x27;re serious about taking using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had intestinal issues since I was 9 years old. Modified many times and they are getting worse. This stuff is making life bearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna say right off the taste to me is horrible!!! o have not enough courage to drink with water.....yet. I use grape juice to her it down. I have been slacking off even though I purchased the big canister. good price here too. if you want to get your veggies in drink this stuff you can&#x27;t go wrong&lt;br /&gt; I will drink some today and get back on point.  I have noticed when you have vitamins in your system you don&#x27;t crave s lot of crap!</li>
            <li> It taste like a frogs ass but it lives up to the hype my face is clear and I have more energy</li>
            <li> Great product with loads of nutirients for the price.  It does not taste very good mixed with water, but it is way better mixed with your favorite juice. Since taking this product, I have had great energy and many people hve commented on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have been buying GV for at least 1 1/2 years and have not seen GV at such a low price.</li>
            <li> This product is a great vitamin drink.  We use it every morning to start the day. We recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Takes a few drinks to get used to, but fruit helps sweeten it naturally and I use coconut milk in it.</li>
            <li> I think it would be impossible to consume ALL the fine healthy ingredients in this product on a daily basis any other way!!</li>
            <li> I have been supplementing with this product for years. I&#x27;m a clinical RN, specializing in pain/symptom management and end of life care with Hospice. I recommend this product many times to my patients with life limiting illnesses. please note, this is not a \\&quot; magic cure\\&quot; by no means, however, when a colon cancer patient in pronounced pain and irregular bowel pattern calls me literally weeping to say his pain has subsided and he just had his 3rd bowel movement that day ( previously 2 BM&#x27;s per week if fortunate) or the Crohn&#x27;s patient who is able to finally have a sabbatical from chronic diarrrhea, or the Stroke patient in a lethargic state for months who was fed this through his PEG tube for two days then awoke I must admit this product works. If I had the time I could document dozens of testimonials such as these. I have shared this with many in the health care field, Physicians, Surgeons and clinicians who now use and recommend this product with positive results, not just digestive related, but for autoimmune boost,anemia, energy and mental clarity.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in Whole Foods.  I checked the nutritional profile, and was satisfied.  I pay particular attention to the iron content: I steer clear away from anything with high iron content.  The bottle in the store had an iron content of 3.95 mg.  And, that was in the acceptable range (it&#x27;s about 40% of RDA for a man or a menopausal woman.  So, I ordered online.  When I saw the nutritional profile again on the bottle that arrived, it had whopping 16.7 mg of iron, that&#x27;s close to 170% of the RDA for a man or a menopausal woman.      Note that high concentration of iron is not a GOOD thing at all: a lot of maladies are associated with this.  The body does not have a natural way of getting rid of excess iron: only through blood donation or menstruation.  So, if you are getting 170% of your daily RDA from this supplement, and then eat other food that contain iron (like, meat, beans, spinach, etc), you are accumulating a dangerous level of iron.    I went back to the store to see whether I misread the nutritional table on the bottle sold in the store.  Then I realized that there are several versions.  The latest version, version 10.2 has a low iron content.  Older version (version 10.1) is the one with incredibly high, almost dangerous level of iron.  On the web site, they don&#x27;t tell you which version they are selling, and they don&#x27;t publish the nutritional profile.    My guess is, they want to unload the older version with this major problem without really disclosing the details of their product.    I will NOT buy any product of this company until they clearly show the nutritional profile of the product they are selling each time.    This product is going to be returned PRONTO.  Very deceptive selling process and hugely disappointing.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of servings of a greens powder I picked up at on a whim and having great results I decided to make a greens supplement a regular part of my diet.  I researched all the ones listed on here on Amazon, and a two others provided by the \\&quot;General\\&quot; health food store.  After reading all the reviews, and trying four of these supplements over the last 60 days, I have decided that Vibrant Health&#x27;s Green Vibrance is the winner by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heath claims are accurate!&lt;br /&gt;- Unbelievably my heart arrhythmia has subsided!  Maybe due to Green Vibrance providing trace nutrients I had not been getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Felt happier with better outlook.  Sharper at work with better memory, attention, and accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Arthritis pain subsiding.  My arthritis sometimes hurts so badly at night that it keeps me awake.  I have had a lot less pain since I started taking the Green Vibrance and I may add the Joint Health and see if it gets even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Sleep really well!  I have really come to appreciate how valuable a good night&#x27;s sleep is to my health and wellbeing.  I drink my serving of Green Vibrance and take 4 gel caps of fish oil and ½ a 3mg Melatonin and I sleep like a baby.  I realized something had changed drastically when I woke up and realized I had slept the whole night through without interruption!  A miracle! Now I often wake rested and ready to go even before my alarm goes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of energy during the day.  I was reaching a point where I was REALLY tired in the late afternoon and was truly struggling to get through the rest of the day.  After 60 days of taking this I have more energy than I have had in a long time.  I exercise at lunchtime.  I am getting more things done at home and at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things to note.&lt;br /&gt;- CAUTION!!!!  I had read the reviewer who cautioned that this supplement has a lot of iron.  I need a lot of iron so that is fine with me, but the \\&quot;version\\&quot; I got also has 1000 IU of vitamin D per serving.  Vitamin D in large doses can be toxic and I had planned on taking this twice a day until I felt really healthy again.  Please be cautious and read the ingredients carefully!  One of the reasons I chose this supplement over others was the very detailed listing of ingredients and nutrient levels so I was clear on exactly what I was consuming.  Many of these greens powders manufacturers wanted me to be happy with listing \\&quot;xxxx grams of a proprietary greens mixture\\&quot;.  Sorry not good enough!  I want to know EXACTLY what you are selling me.  I was especially impressed that Vibrant Health even tells me how many billions of each pro-biotic strain are included in each serving (I keep getting a picture of some scientist looking through a microscope and counting each one, Ha ha ha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- THE TASTE - ok yes, it tastes like you blended some grass and dirt together, but I really like that there is no artificial crap in there to make it taste better.  For awhile I added it to 1 cup milk, 4 large frozen strawberries, 2 raw eggs and some stevia in the blender as my breakfast and it&#x27;s delicious!  Even my 8 year old picky eater said it tasted good after he got over the fact that Mommy&#x27;s&#x27; strawberry smoothie was greenish-gray.  Now I just mix it with ¾ cup of orange juice and ¾ cup water and use it to wash down my pills before bed.  Tastes fine that way.  (For those of you who said it almost made you vomit, you should try a spoonful of cod liver oil!  Eweewwie!  I wanted to wash my tongue off with dish detergent after one spoonful, and it was even the orange flavored!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this stuff is amazing and I really think it may have saved me.  I now have it in automatic ship every 60 days and it only costs $38 that way.  Only $19/month for all those benefits is terrific!

            <li> I definitely feel great after my morning \\&quot;Vibrance\\&quot;... but sometimes I have a hard time getting the last little sip down... it is gritty. My husband makes fun of me though, and he has no problem with it, so I guess everyone wouldn&#x27;t agree with me on that one:) Overall... great product and definitely worth a little grit to have all the  benifits!!</li>
            <li> be sure to buy the 10.3 version which is the newest product versus their 10.1 version- read the label- I called the comapny and they told me this is the newest formula- they did not say it was better but they didn&#x27;t say it wasn&#x27;t ! The Amazon price is a huge savings vs the on-line or health food store price-- does 1/2 the price mean anything?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and have had acne for 20 years.  I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for a couple of months.  I stopped drinking coffee two weeks ago and continued with Green Vibrance daily. I&#x27;m happy to report that the acne has cleared up remarkably well.  My energy levels are top notch even without the coffee.</li>
            <li> My fingernails are growing, instead of breaking ! But you could have warned a person that this stuff tastes like GRASS! Ugh....but the benefits outweigh the taste. And its easy to cover it up with a little orange_pineapple juice. Overall....great product...i feel sassy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE everything about this product. It is not only LOADED with a gajillion things that benefit the human body, but the taste is quite pleasant (I understand not all taste buds are alike—my girlfriend finds it disgusting to the point that she won&#x27;t even try to acclimate—because I believe that would actually happen if given time). Too me, it is super mild and simply tastes grassy. I like it best with plain ol&#x27; filtered water (8 oz.)—I just fill a shaker bottle up to the 8 oz. mark and then add the GV. Shake and chug. It&#x27;s as easy as that. The funny thing is, I tried to mix it in a green smoothie (we&#x27;re big green smoothie drinkers) and honestly, it didn&#x27;t fare as well as I had hoped. It left my delicious green smoothie not so delicious. So see, everyone is different you just have to find what works best for you. But for ALL that you get in this product, I would find a way to make it work. I am a customer for life. Thanks Vibrant Health!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but it is also costly in the health food stores, it was cheaper here and we love the product!</li>
            <li> Okay, I am not sure on this....I have drank this, and please do so with juice, cause it does not taste good in plain water....I have noticed no change in the way I feel or look....one thing I do know is that things definitely come out green.</li>
            <li> We have used Green Vibrance in our smoothies for years and found this great price for this product on Amazon, so will continue to buy it on Amazon as long as their prices are this good. I always search for the most economical places to buy supplements because we use a  lot of them and it adds up quickly if you do not search out the best and most economical sites to buy them. I like this product because it is an organic and whole food product that is high quality and helps to keep us in good health. Better to spend money on good foods rather than doctors offices!</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for five weeks now and I can say that I don&#x27;t feel more energetic or healthier.  In fact, the use of this product has actually interferred with my past complete vitamin program.  In my opinion, Green Vibrance is an incomplete product. For example, the only \\&quot;B\\&quot; vitamin included is B12 and only at 44% daily value.  What happened to the other \\&quot;B\\&quot; vitamins. One deletion that affects us all, especially men, is the exclusion of zinc.  The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1. The manufacturer also omitted amino acids.  The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D. This prevents someone from supplementing  with a multi-vitamin because that would put A and D over the recommended dosages. The only way I see to have a balanced vitamin and mineral regimen while taking this product is to purchase individual Calcium and Magnesium, Zinc, and B complex vitamins. Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily? I&#x27;m not so sure I want that everyday.  You can make up your own mind.  For the price that this lists for (and thank heaven for Amazon&#x27;s pricing) this should be a complete supplement,(of course with the exception of omega 3 fish oil).  To be honest, I&#x27;m a little suspect of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have finished half of a 720 grams (25,4 oz.) jar and noticed that this product (version 10.1) has 16.4 mg. of iron per serving.  In my opinion, this is far too much iron for an adult male.  I dumped the remainder on my compost pile.  I understand they may have reduced the iron level in the newer version??</li>
            <li> As once reviewed on the Robert Scott Bell Show (naturalnewsradio.com)  while on location at the 2012 Natural Products Expo, this product comes highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have consumed it every day for the past 2 years and don&#x27;t go a day w/o a scoop in a glass of filtered (fluoride free) water.  The taste is good and the health benefits are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking green vibrance for a little over 60 days now consistently and I can tell you I see benefits.  I am 25 and work out periodically.  My wife particularly likes to mix it with coconut milk or almond milk, both are great.  I man up and mix mine with water.  Purified water.  This stuff definitely gives you energy and not energy like what caffeine does. It helps your skin and hair, your joints and it also makes you feel good inside.  Regardless or not if its \\&quot;psychological\\&quot; it&#x27;s still a good feeling - especially internally.  I like to take it in the morning after I work out.  All and All, I continue to see myself using this product as long as its developed.  I even got my friend taking it including his whole family who are some seriously skeptical southerners.  Lowered by friends&#x27; dad&#x27;s blood pressure almost 20% which has always been an issue for him.  Definitely recommended - at least try it 30 days and you&#x27;ll see why.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived intact and in a timely manner. Green whole food supplements are a great source especially for those of us who do not get enough in out diet.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it. Have been using Green Vibrance for years and really notice the effects on my general health when I run out.</li>
            <li> This supplement product is wonderfull,the list of ingredient is endlessly amazing and the taste is not bad at all,the more liquid you mix it with the less you taste it .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week, less then a week actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My energy is better, I feel more upbeat, less physically exhausted.  I feel like my recollection is even getting better... I&#x27;m more regular, my body is detoxing, this stuff is just amazing!  I&#x27;m even less anxious, I used to have panic attacks and little OCD things... but they are basically gone!  Though that much I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the green vibrance or the fish oil I started taking about a week and a half ago, or maybe them working together.  I cant wait to see how I feel after a month on it, or more!  This stuff is fantastic, I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know, though mostly they go \\&quot;ewww I&#x27;m not drinking that!\\&quot; haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going without my Green Vibrance again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does taste horrible, I mix it with grape juice or cranberry juice and it isn&#x27;t as bad.  My friend who takes it suggests apple juice, though I&#x27;ve never tried it.  I do alot of supplements/herbs so I&#x27;m used to drinking yucky stuff for my health, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I just drink it down, and then have something good to drink.  I mean, your talking 4-8 oz of juice with the green vibrance, its not that bad, not like you need to mix it into a 2 liter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it needs to be frozen or refrigerated after you open it, and the container is big, so its hard to fit it in there if your fridge/freezer is usually full.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been smoking since I was 13, which is about 8 years now. For my whole life I always had no energy, no attention span, no mental clarity, etc. I started taking this a little over a year ago. I kept smoking while I was taking it.    Let me tell you right now, this is what you have been looking for. I got a .73 GPA in high school, and was failing out of college. With this, all of a sudden I could understand everything in my textbooks. I was shocked. I began reading everything I could get my hands on. I was waking up at 6 am every morning on time for class, jumping out of bed full of energy. I began doing 1 mile jogs every morning. I got straight A&#x27;s and a B for the first time in my life. The mental clarity and physical energy this brought even allowed me to comprehend emotional issues I wasn&#x27;t confronting. I was STILL SMOKING and eating crap during this time.    Now I don&#x27;t smoke, eat all organic, and drink this every morning. Vibrant Health, you have no idea how thankful I am to you people for making this. If I get rich once I&#x27;m out of college I will gladly donate to your company. Everyone NEEDS to know about this.    Here&#x27;s my morning shake:  1 scoop green vibrance  1/2 banana  1 tbsp fish oil/cod liver oil (carlson&#x27;s or norwegian naturals)  1 scoop hemp or whey protein  1 cup apple or grape juice</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the most comprehensive powder you can find. It&#x27;s got everything in it! I mix it in my smoothie with emergen-c, protein powder, yogurt and blueberries, and I&#x27;ve got myself a nutritient-packed power drink to start my day. I recommend it to anyone that cares about maintaining a healthy body. Yay! Go Green!!</li>
            <li> There are enough reviews about how great this product is, so I&#x27;m not going to waste your time (Yes, it is great).  I just purchased Green Vibrance through Amazon and the product they are now sending is Version 14.0, which is the most current version as of 08/01/13.  Many reviewers have complained about receiving older versions in the past.  That is no longer the case.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews. And, I wanted to add it to my fruit smoothies with protein to get some added nutritional benefit. I will continue to use it, but I&#x27;ve not noticed any zip in energy. In fact sitting her now at 4pm I feel very tired. And I&#x27;m having some type of stomach cramp on the right side. I had my smoothy with Vibrance at 8am this morning and have not felt energized all day.    I will still use it for the health benefits. If you mix it with protein powder, berries and some coconut oil, you don&#x27;t notice the bad taste.</li>
            <li> Green vibrance is truly a Green Superfood. I used to suffer with colon problems, but not anymore. Green Vibrance keeps me healthy, my system runs smooth and clean, just like a brand new car. Green Vibrance has thousands of micro-biotics and good flora for my colon. I have a strong healthy immune system. I don&#x27;t anticipate getting sick this year with colds or flu. Green Vibrance is excellent for detoxfying your system. I don&#x27;t miss a day taking this product and it&#x27;s safe for children. Some of the ingredients found in Green Vibrance: spinach, kelp, acidophilus, broccoli, carrot, zucchini, parsley, beet juice, wheat grass, barley grass, and oat grass just to name a few. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product and especially the price. At the local organic stores here it would be at least 20 dollars more.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. Its great im 52 and have a very active job. I also like to walk or run after work this stuff gives me the energy to get it done.I plan on drinking this twice a day for the rest of my life. The probiotics are great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be delicious, but man, really have to chug this as quickly as possible. I&#x27;ve found that if you use warm water it dissolves a bit easier and becomes less gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a breakfast supplement in the morning because I have a hard time finding the time and money to invest in cooking myself proper meals with vegetables. I&#x27;ve found that I stay sated until around lunchtime without having to snack. After about a week of daily dosing, I&#x27;ve found that I have a great deal more energy in the mornings, and muscle recovery time from training for my 5k has been lessened. Going to buy another tub when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but well worth the money. I rave to all my family and friends about it and they say they are interested in it. I recently purchased some for my Dad.... I have a feeling he will like it as well.</li>
            <li> I took this to my sports nutritionist and he said it was a good green supplement.  Don&#x27;t forget to refrigerate after opening.</li>
            <li> Just to clear up the false claim that the product had too much iron. Now the version 10.3 has the TYPO corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this a few times so far, but its perfect.  Just a scoop a day in my water, juice , or protein smoothie and Im good to go.  No strong offsetting taste or smell. Its very fresh smelling, and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you mix a scoop in a food like blended greens or a salad dressing you can eat it as a food  chew), and its lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also mix a small amount in my dogs food daily.  She loves it dry from my hand also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a winner baby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon I&#x27;m going to make home made protein bars, and mix in a few scoops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic almond butter, organic dates, organic hemp seeds, organic coconut oil, green vibrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proper Care &amp; Storage&lt;br /&gt;Green Vibrance contains more friendly, healthful probiotics than any other superfood. ******* Please store Green Vibrance in your freezer *******(best) or refrigerator (good) after opening.</li>
            <li> I bought this drink more than excited after all the positive reviews that it had received.  I opened up my package and mixed a scoop with cold water right away. Taste was  bearable but the thought of all the good this could was going to do helped me put that behind me.  I didn&#x27;t notice a significant boost in energy but I felt a little better (after about 2 weeks) as far as gastrointestinal issues go.  However at about week three this is when i started to experience problems, I began getting a small amount of brain fog everyday around noon, about 2 hours after I would consume my green drink.  I shrugged this off as stress and continued to supplement with it regularly.  I also began to notice a small uncontrolled muscle movements in my leg when sitting down.  This progressed to my arms and other parts of my body.  They were small, but they were noticeable. At about the third week the brain fog had increased and the jerking was also progressing.  I had made no other changes in my diet nor were there any outside factors affecting me.  I saw my doctor a few days later and brought a copy of the ingredients.  Instantly he knew that this was the source of my problem.  He said he could not say for sure which ingredients were causing it but I told him that gluten intolerance runs in the family and he was skeptical about the barley and wheat grass, even though Green Vibrance claims to be gluten-free.  Being a previous nutritionist he said that harvesting the wheat grass could determine if it could contain gluten, since although the leaves do not contain gluten, there must be a guarantee that the leaves have completely matured, using up all the protein that the gluten intolerant are sensitive to in order to ensure that the product is completely gluten free.  He said that certain extracts could possible be causing neurtoxicity and ataxia, and that certain herbs like ginko biloba can lower things like the seizure threshold, already damaged by the immune response to the gluten, which could be causing the muscle jerking.  Now I have to discontinue immediately, a total waste of money and pay to get an EEG in a neurology.  I am all for this product for people that it works for, just because careful of these products that \\&quot;seem too good to be true\\&quot;, because they might just possibly be. One more note, after looking at several of the reviews I was curious as to the validity of all these reviews and wanted to see what other reviews people had posted throughout Amazon.  I can positively say that over 90% of the reviews were the first reviews of the reviewer, which leads me to be a little skeptical.  This is MY first review but I feel I am giving a little more insight rather than \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT WORKS\\&quot; or \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT SUCKS\\&quot;.  Take what these reviewers say with a grain of salt, it costed me money and part of my health but I plan to move on with a positive attitude.  HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY :)ich could be causing the muscle jerking.  Now I have to discontinue immediately, a total waste of money and pay to get an EEG in a neurology.

            <li> This is loaded with nutrition per serving but the taste is not all that great. Can&#x27;t have it all, I suppose. Instead of suffering through 16 or more ounces of this mixed in water, I usually just pitch a scoop full of the powder on the back of my tongue and wash it down with water. Same benefits, faster and more enjoyable, at least for me it is.</li>
            <li> I AM TRYING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.  I WILL SAY RIGHT NOW THAT THE TEXTURE AND TASTE OF THE POWDER IS PRETTY GOOD. I USUALLY SHAKE IT UP GOOD AND DRINK IT RIGHT AWAY IN A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE.  I HAVE NOT USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO TELL ANY DIFFERANCE  IN THE WAY I FEEL. I AM SURE IT JUST TAKES TIME FOR THE BODY TO GET USED TO IT. I WAS  PLEASED WITH THE NUMBER AND COMBINATIONS OF NUTRIENTS  LISTED ON THE LABEL.  I WILL PROBABLY STAY ON IT AT LEAST 2 MORE MONTHS BEFORE I MAKE ANY REAL HEALTH CLAIMS BUT I WILL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH WRITTEN REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years in my smoothy every morning.  It is a great product.  It is one of the few supplements I have tried that really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to this product but like it a lot so far. Impressive list of vitamins, phytonutrients and beneficial herbs. I found I wasn&#x27;t using others I&#x27;ve bought because the taste was too strong. This one I actually drink. Mixed with apple juice it&#x27;s even really tasty. Don&#x27;t even notice the taste when mixed in with my protein shake. So far seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> It tastes great and I feel great when I eat it.  I have a scoop every morning in a shake with Garden of Life RAW Meal. It&#x27;s a great start to the day.  I feel like I no longer need to take any multivitamins.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I use it everyday and love it. Thanks for the product being on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a green drink...It&#x27;s going to be grassy, but this one is a very fine powder and it incorporates very well in juice, which helps a lot. Much finer than I have found before. I use [[ASIN:B00110LHU0 Blender Bottle by Sundesa, Hand Blender, Sports Bottle, Blue, 20 oz.]], quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Of all various green powders, that I have tried, this one is by far the best one, it has given me a lot of energy and an overall good feeling of wellbeing.  This summer while visiting family, my sister asked \\&quot;what are you on\\&quot;.......well the only different thing in my daily consumtion was Green Vibrance, so I am truly sold by taking this product, and it makes me very happy to have this added to my daily routine. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what an associate at my local Sprout&#x27;s told me when she recommended the product to me for the first time. I had read about green foods and was very confused and she was very helpful. I almost choked on the price I paid for the product once I checked on Amazon, but her help in selecting a product was well worth it based on the reviews. I&#x27;m on-again off-again about sticking with any vitamin program, so this seems to be working for me. The list of ingredients goes the whole way around the rather fat container. As for the taste, I started out mixing it with juice and it wasn&#x27;t bad, but let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s not a drink you&#x27;ll want to sip and savor. I don&#x27;t even bother with the juice anymore, just half a glass of water, a heaping scoop of the powder, stir briskly, down the hatch and be done with it!! I&#x27;m old. I&#x27;ve been taking the stuff for about two months and I&#x27;m still old, but I have seen an improvement in the \\&quot;crepey-ness\\&quot; (not, creepy-ness) of my skin, less dry. That&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;m still not able to leap tall buildings and the x-ray vision hasn&#x27;t kicked in, but I&#x27;ll have a wait and see attitude............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2/2012---I&#x27;m a believer! Hey, my fingernails are growing and are stronger, Yay!! May be my imagination, but I do feel a little more \\&quot;get-up and go\\&quot;. So, I&#x27;m going to continue with this drink and I even add a tablespoon of Chia seed to my daily \\&quot;green cocktail\\&quot;.....</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance comes highly recommended, and your price was way lower than any others I found online or in health/vitamin stores. Also, the shipment arrived very quickly after I placed my order. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The product of greens you choose to use is your choice as there are many out there. I have tried several others and have my whole family using Green Vibrance. Everyone in the family agrees it makes you feel so much better during the day. At a health food store a salesman advised me that \\&quot;if I took no other vitamins I should consider a glass of greens a day. Most of the health books I have read support this concept. the list of ingredients and vitamins in Green Vibrance is endless. It seems a little expensive, but then again whats your health worth?</li>
            <li> Thank you for your quick shipment and excellent product at a great price. My husband and I use it virtually every day.</li>
            <li> Another excellent quality supplement to take if you are planning to go on detox. My husband and I are taking this for almost a year already and we are very satisfied with the results. It is true that our immune system got better. We seldom get sick, our bowel movements are now regulated, I did not lose weight while taking this product but I did maintained my weight for the past year. We will continue using this and would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> One of the best green foods I have used. The taste isn&#x27;t too bad it taste like you are drinking greens.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!! Great product, I highly recommend. Great product to supplement with! Keeps best in the freezer too, lasts longer. Go buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for years. Always makes me feel great. I have it in smoothies with vanilla protein powder, raw spinach, and almond milk, and it is low calorie and delicious. Well, maybe not *delicious* but I have more than gotten use to the taste and actually now quite enjoy the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to see Amazon put GV back on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on Dr. Oz by Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.  I had been using other \\&quot;greens-to-go\\&quot; type products as a way to get extra greens in my diet.  I put it in my smoothie each morning and it&#x27;s delicious.  I would recommend this product to others and feel it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> I began taking Green Vibrance after my third child was born and my husband was deployed overseas for 6 months. I needed something in my life that would be in balance so why not my health?! I have to say yes, the taste is nasty, but I found the right mix for me...I like to mix it with vanilla rice milk...and my children call it horse food since that&#x27;s what it smells like, but once the right blend was found it isn&#x27;t too bad. The bottom line is that while my husband was away I not once became sick, not even with the sniffles and I haven&#x27;t been since he has been home for 6 months either. I am so thankful I saw this product in my Amazon search!</li>
            <li> This product rocks. It has one of the highest ratings of like products. The national value exceeds most other products of its type. I don&#x27;t start my day without it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Taste isn&#x27;t great, but easily masked in a smoothie with berries and other greens. Organic, full of great pro-biotics and greens, good health benefits. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly. It tastes very good and makes me feel excellent. Would advise everyone to use. Easy to mix and dissolves fast. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for about two months now.  The only difference I notice is the white spots on my nails have disappeared. Other then that, I don&#x27;t feel or look any different. I&#x27;ve been taking it twice a day, morning and night.  I haven&#x27;t been taking a multivitamin but I wonder if I still should. I have tried other powders and they&#x27;re all pretty much the same to me, I buy this one for the probiotics which I need more than anything. The taste is ok compared to others.  Very tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for years. I put mine in capsules and take 4 at each meal. Helps to keep young!</li>
            <li> I was suffering from fatigue and bursitis in my hips.  In less than a week, the pain in my hips was gone.  I highly recommend this product.  I mix my daily scoop with Greek yogurt and chopped mixed nuts.  Tastes good.</li>
            <li> I will add to the chorus of positive reviews of this product. It is absolutely incredible and is, essentially, a pharmaceutical grade phyto-nutrient/herbal/vitamin/mineral supplement that works as advertised.  I am an internist (MD) who happens to believe in nutritional supplementation and the positive effects of \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; measures to combat everyday ills--i.e. common colds, body and joint aches, skin ailments, etc.  However, I am also very skeptical about the true benefit of many supplements.  I find it amusing that most \\&quot;alternative practitioners\\&quot; bemoan the fact that most MD&#x27;s are pharmaceutical pushers who are lapdogs for the drug companies while the \\&quot;practitioners\\&quot; preaching this are trying to sell something (to line their pockets)... but I digress.  I was suffering from lack of energy, poor mental clarity and had multiple aches and pains like many people have.  On a recommendation of a colleague, I tried Vibrant Health Green Vibrance--of course, after a bit of research.  Wow!  This is no placebo effect. Its careful balance of ingredients worked to improve my energy, mood and sense of well-being.  I highly recommend it both from an anecdotal perspective (mine) and from a medical perspective. I will begin recommending it to patients.  One word of caution.. in people undergoing chemotherapy who are neutropenic (i.e. extremely low white blood cell count--under 1000) the pro-biotics can potentially be harmful (i.e. even the good bacteria can be bad under these condtions).  On the flipside, if you are taking antibiotics (and are not neutropenic) then I would highly recommend taking this because it is a good way to protect colon health and prevent Clostridium Difficile (\\&quot;C diff.\\&quot;) colitis.  Take care and take this supplement.  You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I&#x27;ve never felt better.  i notice a difference in energy levels when I don&#x27;t take it. If I am getting a cold or flu, i double the dosage and get better twice as quickly. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love gteen vibrance, feel like Im doing somthing good for myseld every time I use it. I like the taste with plain water.I am used to the taste&lt;br /&gt; Took alittle time but I&#x27;m with it</li>
            <li> Best on the market, highly recommend this, Amazing taste good and would buy it again. Read the label, chocked with goodness .</li>
            <li> Considering cost, value AND effectiveness...Green Vibrance is the category leader in phytonutrients. I must admit though, it doesn&#x27;t give me the same \\&quot;spark\\&quot; that GofL RAW Meal used to. I just couldn&#x27;t afford the RAW Meal expense anymore. Maybe I need to give Green Vibrance a little more time, but I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself when I take this product.  My skin feels tighter and more resilient and hair seems shinier.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s good for the body.  On the other hand, it tastes like grass on it&#x27;s own.  To drink it, I mix it with a small glass of juice and \\&quot;down\\&quot; the whole thing.  Taste wise, I prefer Amazing Grass Superfood but would buy either depending on which one i on sale.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 6 months now &amp; can definitely tell a difference. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  In the beginning, I drank it with water and it tasted like grass.  I have since discovered mixing it in with fruit smoothies and, to me, that&#x27;s the only way to go.  You can barely taste it.  Your smoothie might be brown or green but it tastes so much better.  I feel like it does help with my energy levels and I do not get sick... not even colds.  Also, one of the negative reviews always seems to pop up about the iron content issue.  This does not seem to be an issue any longer.  I&#x27;m receiving version 10.3 and it has 3.74 grams of iron in it.  I highly recommend this green drink.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, Ive been using it for years.  There are lots of green foods, probiotics and vitamins.  I mix mine with a little appke juice and drink first thing in the morning.  It doesnt not have a bad flavor when mixed with appke juice.  I also keep mine in the freezer for freshness.</li>
            <li> Another highly recommended product by my sister and health store.  Amazon had it for $30 less!!!  Don&#x27;t really know how much of a difference I feel on the day to day, but it has every vitamin needed for daily nutrition and along with other good health habits, I feel confident this product is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> So much of your daily needs. I add it to low calorie gatorade and smoothies. I can really tell the difference when I don&#x27;t have it daily. The taste gets more tolerable over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star because it&#x27;s just about the worst tasting thing I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this from Athletic Greens because Athletic Greens is a rip off.  But this stuff truly tastes terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the positive side of things - it appears to be packed with nutrients :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is still a dietary supplement - so the bottom line is always: who knows if it&#x27;s actually working. I like to think it is.</li>
            <li> This product took a month to get used too...but has changed my life for the better.....rid me of toxicity and gave me energy.....love it....</li>
            <li> This product is the best on the market. It is pharmaceutical grade and I feel better taking it every day.</li>
            <li> I use this product in all of my smoothies, there is no taste and there is no need for that multivitiamin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really potent.  It&#x27;s truly the best Green Powder I&#x27;ve found to date.      You can pay less out there for other seemingly similar powders, but, no joke, do yourself a favor and buy this instead.      It&#x27;s worth way more than the regular stuff out there in potency value alone.  You get what you pay for.      I wrote this review in the spirit of saving you some time by avoiding the trial and error approach.      Just at least try this first.      You&#x27;ll be amazed at the new found energy and alertness you experience, and say goodbye to colds as long as you&#x27;re on this stuff.      It really kicks your immune system up a notch or two.  It&#x27;s like having a force field against bugs and sniffles, especially if you have kids.      You know how easy it is pass a cold back and forth from your kids.  Say goodbye to that as long as you&#x27;re on this stuff.    I truly couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff any more highly.  Just order it and see for your self.      Sincerely,    Jason Bunner</li>
            <li> Nothing like it.  Just keep it comming.  However I only need l 60 day supply every 60 days  now I am recieving a 60 day supply every 30 days.</li>
            <li> Like all green supplements, it doesn&#x27;t taste fantastic, but this one is palatable.  I prefer to take a shot of it and chase it with something.  If you put it in a shake, you will taste it.  You may or may not like it.  The taste is somewhat akin to nori (or laver, if you&#x27;ve had it).</li>
            <li> I wanted to update my review. I could not stop taking the product because it cost too much money. After a month of taking it I got used to the taste. Now it does not bother me and I feel better since taking it. The joke around the office is we call it Soylent Green.   Old Review:   I am not a wimp. I have been drinking unsweetened/unflavored protein powder for years. This stuff makes me gag though. It tastes like cucumber juice. Very gritty. I do feel more energetic when I drink it however.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000NDME6C Vibrant Health Green Vibrance Family Size Power - 60 Day Supply, 25.4-Ounce]]  I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO GIVE ME ALL THE ENERGY I NEED . IT CONTAINS SO MANY VITAMINS AND NUTRIENTS. IT IS SO NATURAL . THE DAYS THAT I CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH GREENS. iT IS A BIG HELP AND ENERGIZER.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have 1/4 tablespoon with a splash of mango juice in a bottle of water and I love the taste. Normally, I wake up several times during the night. Since I&#x27;ve been drinking this (for a week), I only wake up one time - and a few nights I didn&#x27;t wake up at all.</li>
            <li> I have taken numerous antibiotics and deal with Candida.  As a result, I have yeast infections.  I add this product to my daily protein drink after working out.  It keeps the yeasty beasties away.</li>
            <li> Would recomend this product to everyone.Seamed to energize me after approx a couple weeks use. More energy,stamina etc</li>
            <li> ever since i began using this faithfully-2 servings per day-the allergy symptoms particularly with ym eyes have disappeared.  i now am on auto order.  a bit expensive but in stores the same size container is almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> I am a healthy vegetarian, I eat alot of spinach and other healthy things. I was so excited about trying this, it looked really healthy and overall it has pretty good reviews and some people even said it tastes good...lol! Those people are nuts! So gross! The most disgusting crap I have ever tasted! I tried plugging my nose and swiging it down as fast as I could....i gagged and gagged and gagged and my kitchen counters had to be wiped down........enough said!</li>
            <li> Vibrant Healths Green Vibrance is an absolutely amazing product. I have been using it daily now for 5 years and there is only one thing I don&#x27;t know about this product and that is what my life might look like without it.&lt;br /&gt; Having been so close to this product there is only one experience that I have had that is not necessarily negative it just is what it is. Each time I have used the product and finished a container I have a habit of washing the measuring spoon which is included and throwing it in the drawer. Well you got it one day I opened the drawer and the measuring spoons were different sizes.  I opened my container that I was using to confirm that the LARGER measuring spoon was in my most recent purchase. The size of the spoon had changed from 14.7 cc to 20 cc an increase of approximately 36% WITHOUT any explanation that I can recall.  With or without notification or even a justification from Vibrant health that results in a significant increase in daily use and ultimately price..........enough out of me.</li>
            <li> this product contain all the nutrients the body needs and in most cases is lacking. A great way to add in everything you need in just one serving.</li>
            <li> I am pleased so far with this product.  It came so quickly and I&#x27;m really pleased with the amount I get for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I love all if the health benefits I get with one scoop. I add it to my morning smoothie every mornjng</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been taking these I don&#x27;t get sick. Sometimes I get the symptoms. I recommend it to anyone that hates getting colds</li>
            <li> Just think for a moment, you cannot eat all your veggies in one day.&lt;br /&gt;with this product you can, just adjust to taste, juice, water.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been taking this for years, and we get sick less than half the frequency that we used to.  Mostly organic and full ingredient disclosure makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from taking isolated vitamins and minerals so I now take Green Vibrance 45 minutes after breakfast each day. A couple sales people at Super Supplements recommended it over other brands, telling me that although there are less expensive alternatives, Green Vibrance uses high quality ingredients without cheap fillers to reduce the cost. And at $50 for a 2 month supply, it&#x27;s a great deal through Amazon. I still take fish oil, CoQ10, and vitamin D along with a good diet so I feel I&#x27;m pretty well covered health wise.</li>
            <li> I may be in the minority, but I love this green drink! I add it to some warm water with a few drops of lemon juice each morning, and it&#x27;s delicious and wakes me up and makes me feel good! I&#x27;m so glad they sell this product, as it is difficult to get enough greens in your diet, and can&#x27;t afford a fresh smoothie every day.</li>
            <li> I do not find the &#x27;foot taste&#x27; objectionable.  Honestly, I just thought it was an earthy &#x27;green&#x27; flavor&lt;br /&gt;experience.  Call it what you will. Chug it down resolutely in water or less dramatically in a glass of juice.&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent supplement to the not-so-healthy food choices too many of us make on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first canister of Green Vibrance. My second is on its way. It mixes very easily into most all liquids that I&#x27;ve used. The best mix is when I blend it with other fruits and veggies and Greek Yogurt in the blender. You do have an earthy taste, but it is easily covered up when mixed or blended with other things. As for energy, I can&#x27;t say I experienced an incredible burst of energy using this product because I am in general pretty energetic. I&#x27;m sure if you have a sluggish metabolism, you may see a boost of energy. I take it as part of my everyday regiment of vitamins and nutritional supplements. I seriously have mixed it in water with it completely dissolving, but I drink it down without taking a breath so I don&#x27;t feel like I just grazed in the hay field. :)</li>
            <li> i have been drinking it for 2 years- at first the taste is funky but mix it with cranberry or orange juice and it is ok- after awhile you wont even flinch at the taste and can even mix with water in a pinch. after all this time i can tell u that my gastrointestinal tract feels so much better (but be warned- when u first start dont leave the bathroom area for about an hour; i would walk our dogs in the morning after drinking it in the beginning and find myself running home); at some point during the first few months u find yourself craving it as a beginning to your day- i work in healthcare and am exposed to lots of infections and can tell u that this is an excellent product- i have been the butt of many jokes by friends and family, and yet i still continue my daily regiment of drinking it- 5 stars</li>
            <li> I actually liked Green Vibrance until I read the consumer labs report on &#x27;green powders&#x27;. As for this product the report unfortunately found levels of arsenic insanely beyond EPA accepted levels and being that the FDA doesn&#x27;t monitor &#x27;supplements&#x27; such as green powders its allowed on our shelves. That&#x27;s just messed up Green Vibrance...    \\&quot;One supplement, Vibrant Health’s “Green Vibrance” product, contained roughly 24 micrograms of the carcinogen arsenic per .4-ounce serving [yes, that&#x27;s a point 4 oz!], which far exceeds the 10-mcg-per-34-ounce safety limit established by the Environmental Protection Agency.\\&quot;    Heres the source: [...]  also-    [...]    Anyways, use at your own risk...</li>
            <li> I feel so much better.  More energy!!  I do not always eat right - in this product you are getting all of your vitamins &amp; then some.  I mix it with V8 juice and that definitely improves the taste.  I think its worth trying especially my age group (60).  :-)</li>
            <li> we mix this powder with our carrot, kale and granny apple juice, we drink it every day. We feels good</li>
            <li> A Berkeley Bowl employee directed me to GV and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since (2+ years). It&#x27;s the icing on the cake, not the cake, so make sure to get your fresh veggies. Love that there&#x27;s a built in probiotic.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is one of those things I discovered through the Amazon product ratings (such a helpful resource). If an astronaut at the International Space Station was to sneeze, I would catch cold here in India. I am also a smoker and started getting repeated bouts of Bronchitis every 1.5 months. The doctor told me my lungs were functioning like a 69 year old after a PFT test, I am currently 37. Loads of anti-allergics, Fumetrol &amp; Steroid inhalers will stay with me for the rest of my life, was pretty much the common verdict. I like to take matters in my own hand and take charge of the situation. Do remember that a Pulmonologist probably just read a chapter or max a book on COPD during his academics. If I am ready to read 10 books, I can  know more than him, atleast about my condition. Armed with the newly acquired enlightment, I set on to find a cure to my problems... and both my jungle and the guiding light being the internet. I also happen to have severe GERD(on Nexium 40 for 7 years) &amp; Asthma. I read somewhere that although our ancestors smoked freely, they still led a much healthier life free from side effects of tobacco use...and the reason for this was their diet. I started looking up for nutrition, was moved by Paul Stamets, Dr. Andrew Weil and the founder of &amp;#34;Garden of Life&amp;#34;. Read, read and read.... finally compiling data, conditions , nutrition and public opnion led me to select 4 products. Source Natural Wellness Formula, Nordic Naturals Omega 3, myCommunity Host Defence Musrooms caps &amp; Green Vibrance. Let me tell you that all are great products and are a result of over an year of research on the internet and Amazon product reviews. Coming straight to Green Vibrance, it is as already sufficiently mentioned - the worst tasting thing you can put in your mouth. The first time I tried, I thought its humanly impossible to ingest this crappy poop dung that tastes like insides of the stomach of a grass eating goat. Arrgghhh !.... its really that bad in taste. But the only reason I could continue to drink it was my depleting health and Bear Grylls. Every time the taste bothered me, I thought about Bear Grylls, Secial Ops. Navy Seals and the other healthy defence guys. All this gave me confidence and not being such a sissy. Used to be a real challenge to get myself to drink it in the morning, but my body adjusted slowly. Now my body craves it, I look forward to having it. The taste hasn&#x27;t changed, just my taste buds have gotten more used to it. I mix it with a big glass of water. I keep another plain glass of water next to it. Hold my breath, gulp the first glass &amp; flush my mouth and throat with the second. This takes about 30 to 40 secs. The when I release my breath I hardly feel the taste cause its almost completely flushed out. Then I put something really delicious &amp; fried with a strong sauce or chutney in my mouth ... and voila no more green burps.... This stuff is magical. What it has done to me, I can&#x27;t describe in words. I haven&#x27;t had a cold or flu since I started taking it (it even works better than the targeted solutions like Wellness Formula or myCommunity Host Defence) at keeping the cold at bay. I no longer cough black phlegm now. My breathing has improved. Energy is through the roof. Feeling of bell wieng is definately there. My throat feels better, my constant pharyngitis is gone. If you were to touch my tounge to inspect my throat ot teeth, I would instantly gag - that&#x27;s gone (I think its the probiotics). Joint pains are better. GERD is the same I guess... although was expecting improvement there. Motions are better and most importantly my body has started craving fruits &amp; veggies. You can&#x27;t even begin to imagine what all this one spoon a day is doing for your body. I recommend you start now, if you can&#x27;t bear the taste.... go enrol yourself in Kindergarten, that is the least amount of pain you can take for ensuring a healthy life. Start today!.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for what it has done to improve my digestive system and I use it every day like clockwork!  However, I must admit the taste isn&#x27;t great.  When mixed with fruit/vegetable juice (Like V8 Fusion) it becomes palatable but I cannot sip it.  It has got to be chugged down, then chased with water.  Yet, I love it nonetheless, both for how I now feel and for how my large intestine has appreciated the probiotic resurgence.  It is now on my bi-monthly subscribe and save offering and it will stay there as long as it is remains offered!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, I purchase it regularly and am completely satisfied with the results I receive each and every time that I order this great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and a RN  I have been taking Vibrant Green for 2 weeks but I&#x27;m in love with the results so far. It is expensive but the benefits out weighs the cost. My husband and I switched to a plant based diet to see if it would help with his migraines that came on suddenly and was not controlled with medication. We later switches to juicing. I travel a lot and my husband would not juice despite the fact that it made him feel better so I started juicing and freezing the juice during my trips which worked for him but was time consuming for me.  I was talking to my pastor&#x27;s wife about juicing and the whole story about traveling. She recommended Vibrant Green and blessed us with a 25 oz. we started taking and my husband has not had a migraine and the both of us has had so much energy. After my trips I usually sleep the next day until 12 pm well actually I sleep like that on any off day and sometimes more well this morning I&#x27;m up washed several loads of clothes, cleaned up the house etc and its not 12 yet. I love this products and love this type of natural energy. Does not feel over stimulated and no ups and downs of energy level.</li>
            <li> I have been using Emerald Balance which has Stevia added as a sweetener.  It was great if you were making a smoothie but much too sweet if mixed with juices.  I like this Green Vibrance because I can sweeten it if I want.  It doesn&#x27;t end up too sweet when mixed in a smoothie with a sweet fruit like a banana.    I am not sure why the directions says \\&quot;Best taken 30-45 minutes after eating.\\&quot;  This is a product that seems to be taken in the a.m. mixed with juice or in a smoothie.  Actually it would to be good to drink BEFORE eating as an appetite suppressant.  Could it upset your stomach?  Otherwise, this has ALL the green stuff, and then some you could ever want.</li>
            <li> The review that states to stay away from this product due to the iron content is incorrect.  If you read the comments people wrote replying to this review you will see some people did some research and there was a misprint on one version of this product and it has been corrected.  The Iron content is 3.74 or 20%, which is what I received.  It&#x27;s a bummer this review is in such a substantial place, I would hate for it to deter people from buying such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was afraid of what GV would taste like. I decided I was going to take a quick shot. I mixed 1 scoop along with 4 ounces of Cold water and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.......To My surprise it didnt taste as horrible as I imagined..It was totally easy to drink. I used a shaker bottle to mix it up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does smell like a fresh mowed lawn but the taste is easily doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shipped the Item Super fast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just started taking the stuff, so I cant comment on Energy or a miraculous life change,  but I wanted to give quick feedback. I will let you all know if it changes my life lol</li>
            <li> This is a powerful product with vitamins, probiotics and green food combined.  I drink it in lemon juice and it&#x27;s quite palatable.  This is a great value as I&#x27;d pay$75+ if I bought it locally</li>
            <li> As far as green powders go, this has the most wide array of ingredients.  How effective they are is difficult to know. But when bought in this larger size, it is the best deal for the quality.  I take it every day in addition to eating lots of fresh vegetables.  This ensures I&#x27;m covering my bases. Small price to pay for healthier nutrition.</li>
            <li> I love this supplement!  It&#x27;s quick nutrition and, unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of those who is too busy with work!  This makes it easy.</li>
            <li> I often feel dark greens and other important vegetable nutrients are missing in my diet.  While I tend to be Vegan, I still feel much more comfortable with going with something to supplement my morning nutritional start. I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;Greens&amp;#34; this one seems to be standing the test of longevity and is actually palatable.  As for effectiveness, well.....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and tell all my friends and family about it. Easy to incorporate in a protein drink or smoothie.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Taking it makes me feel wonderful and combining it with a healthy, plant-based diet keeps me from ever getting sick! Nasty tasting on its own. I highly recommend drinking it with some diluted cranberry juice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking Green Vibrance for years now.  I LOVE IT and it&#x27;s the number one food supplement I will not live without.  I used to suffer from frequent UTI&#x27;s and since drinking this regularly I&#x27;ve NEVER had another UTI again.  I&#x27;ve tried many different \\&quot;green drinks\\&quot; and this one is the best tasting and has the best organic products than any other.  Trust me - this one tastes the best!  Sometimes when I don&#x27;t feel well and am fatigued I will drink a glass and HONESTLY feel great right away.  This supplement is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Green Vibrance with my family for a couple of years now and it is so energizing and feels so good in our bodies.  It helps me be sure that we&#x27;re getting enough real nourishment into us.  I prepare it as a smoothie with apple juice, a banana and some ice.  Even the kids drink it right up!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been taking Green Vibrance for several years now.  We have found that this product is one of the best superfoods out there.  It contains many important items and all in one powder! For us, it seems to keep us more alkaline and we stay healthy throughout the year, very little illness. It does not replace a healthy diet for sure, but it adds alot without having to take many other items. As a homeopathic practitioner, I have used it with several of my clients, especially if they are debilitated till they can get their diets on track.  Works great! Most want to continue taking it. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have only taken Green Vibrance for about 2 months but I like the energy I feel that I get from it plus the added bonus of probiotics.  It seems to help with my digestion and my energy level.  I am planning to continue taking it for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a couple of reviews reporting that it contains arsenic based on an online consumer laboratory.  I have not read those reports because I am not a paid member of that website. I did however personally contact Green Vibrance and received a detailed response the General Manager of that company which directly addressed my questions and concerns.  The answers I received from the company, combined with the information I discovered when I googled the consumer laboratory itself, convinced me that I personally am not going to worry about arsenic levels in this product. I live in a farm community and have no illusions that the food in today&#x27;s world is toxin free. I think Organic is the safest way to go but rain from farm fields ends up in rivers that end up in the ocean. Its all one world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we just have to make our own best choices.  I will continue drinking Green Vibrance.  Having said that - its not the most pleasant tasting green food I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have to make sure its really dissolved - room temperature water works best for me.  I will continue experimenting with different ways to drink it without gagging. LOL!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m really feeling great since I started taking Green Vibrance. To me, it&#x27;s worth the money. Amazon had the best price.&lt;br /&gt;  Bob&lt;br /&gt;  Steelton Pa.</li>
            <li> I am overweight and had a complete lack of energy to make it through the day. I first got wind of this product from the 4 hour diet wanting you to buy athletic greens which is a competing product and twice the price. I combine Green Vibrance, Rainbow Vibrance and Muscle Milk Lite to make a shake every morning for breakfast. I have more energy and feel 100% better. I highly recommend this product. I will never stop taking this product as long as I am alive. I truely feel so much better.</li>
            <li> This product is not all natural, people with heart problems should be very careful in using this product.  I had shortness of breath, tightness in chest and irregular heart beat.  made me very tired. This product was not for me and my Dr. said don&#x27;t use it or I was going to end up in hospital.Took me over 2 weeks to start to feel good again.</li>
            <li> You know when you eat something that tastes horrible and so you think it is really good for you? You may feel that way after drinking this. It tastes like you fell into a pile of alfalfa and hay in the barn with your mouth open. We were interested in an alkalanizing green drink product and found this at our local health food store on a shelf \\&quot;recommended by Dr. Oz\\&quot;. I gave it my best shot, I promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily we found a better version sold by Tony Robbins that tastes a lot more neutral and includes MSM which was hard to find in a greens drink. We ran out of Tony Pure energy greens drink and a month later I tried the Vibrant Health Green drink again (we have a whole canister). I almost gagged and thought I should share this info with others who want to give their body a maximized chance of being totally alkalanized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, BEING ALKALANIZED FEELS WONDERFUL!! I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you try a travel packet first. Then you will know if you will continue to drink it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...feel vibrant and healthy! It has so many excellent ingredients to keep you healthy. Will definitely be purchasing more</li>
            <li> I bought this three times now.  It really seems to help.  Tastes like dirt at first, but you get used to it.  I mix it w/ various juices, &amp; w/ the tart cherry juice concentrate I don&#x27;t even notice the dirt flavor.  I usually add a little ground cayenne, a little &#x27;no salt&#x27; [potassium chloride], &amp; a little sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the probiotics are real, because the evidence indicates that may be the most important component.&lt;br /&gt;Time will time; until then, I&#x27;ll keep drinking my dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a GREAT day, Neighbors!</li>
            <li> It tastes great and has so many positive benefits. It helps with my digestive issues. My friei and family love it too.</li>
            <li> The powder tasted horrible, I didn&#x27;t see any results what so ever, wasn&#x27;t worth the time or money. Not a great product from my experience! Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> About 1-2 hours after drinking this, I can actually feel a burst of energy.  The first few days, I wondered if it was just a placebo effect sort of thing.  It was just hard for me to believe a scoop of powder could make any real difference, but now i&#x27;m convinced it actually does.  I&#x27;m just an average sized, 30&#x27;s something mother of 3 that works a late swing shift, so being tired and zapped of energy is something i&#x27;m always struggling with.  This has made a noticeable difference in my energy level throughout the day.  i&#x27;ve already convinced a couple co-workers who have ordered their own, and now I am taking it twice a day.  It also really seems to be &#x27;cleansing&#x27; as far as, well, you know...( the potty!).  Sorry if that was too much info, but I do feel like its worth mentioning!&lt;br /&gt;  There is just one thing though...I really think it might be the most horrible tasting thing ever.  I struggled between 4 and 5 stars just because of how hard it is to get down!  But i figure it is what it is, so it probably tastes exactly as it should.  Like a cup of grass.  I only mix it with an inch or two of water, just to get it over with quickly.  Then chase it with more water.  There&#x27;s no way i could do a full glass of it, i would never get it down!  Tried it with a few different juices and it really doesn&#x27;t make it any better LOL.  Worth it though!</li>
            <li> I work long hours and don&#x27;t always have time to eat properly. Drinking a glass in the morning helps me start my day off right. I totally feel ready for the day.</li>
            <li> I have blended this with water. other protein powders &amp; almond milk and flavored coconut water.  It&#x27;s not the best tasting item but I do know that it is a healthy addition to my sometimes unhealthy diet so I tolerate it.  I use one of those bottles with the ball in it.  I am thinking that a blender might make it more homogeneous when blended with fruit and/or veggies.</li>
            <li> My first go around using this product gave my gut fits.  But, I have tried it again because my husband pressured me to and I&#x27;m glad I listened to him.  I am an over 50&#x27;s lady who goes to give blood every other month since my Dr. said my iron was too high.  Then I  started to get turned away because my iron was too low.  I tried taking a children&#x27;s vitamins a week before I would give.  This made me feel a little wonky.  But, after using Vibrant Health for more than 6 months my iron is now at a stable level to give blood every time with not problem or having to take extra kids vitamins making my iron roller coaster.  I know it tastes a bit yucky so I put it in orange juice and can hardly taster or smell it.</li>
            <li> I want to feed vegis to my picky sons but with my busy life it&#x27;s hard to prepare all the good greens and either sneak it into food or cook it in their favorite ways. simply i make smoothy and they drink it without any complains.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product we have used this for many years now.  Just look at the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is such a great product that you will see many debates on the internet from health enthusiasts debating it and what I love is the company replies because they keep improving and refining.  they always tell the truth in detail about a negative comment,  and it usually is either untrue,  exaggerated  or vastly incorrect and if it has any truth they have already perfected it.  Usually companies stay out of it because they have no defense. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This product has so many benefits to it! I am currently using it to help keep my nutrition in check as I am dealing with lymes disease. You mix the green powder with 4-6oz of a non carb drink. To be honest, it isn&#x27;t very tasty! It tastes &#x27;green&#x27; that&#x27;s for sure! If they had this in a pill form, it would be a lot easier to want to take. I mix it with orange juice and drink it quickly! The benefits outweigh the taste though :)</li>
            <li> After reading the many concerns of arsenic I decided to do some research of my own. Please read what the founder of green vibrance ensures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because it truly delivers!!!! I was diagnose with ibs (irritable bowel syndrome) about five years ago.  Changing my diet really helped but I would still get attacks.  The night before I used this product, I had an attack and woke up the next morning still feeling the effects.  I mixed a scoop of Green Vibrance with sunny D, ice, and sugar free french vanilla creamer and drink it up.  By the end of the day I was feeling fantastic and I knew then that I had found my &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;!!!!  I wake up feeling energetic and alert and since I started drinking this, I haven&#x27;t needed any coffee!!  The only down side to this mix is that it tastes nasty, but when blended together with sunny d, ice, and sugar free french vanilla creamer, it tastes like a creamcicle!!!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to wake and feel like a million dollars!!!</li>
            <li> I have been juicing for some time now. I have to say that fresh daily juicing and home-made raw green smoothies are THE best way to get the maximum power of living greens into your system.  Nothing in a bottle or pill can ever compare. It does require significant dedication, commitment, time, and energy, not to mention the initial expense of the juicer machine and constant purchasing of all that fresh produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you can&#x27;t juice... or if you can&#x27;t juice as often as you&#x27;d like... this product (and a few others like it) are a viable and practical way to ingest all those daily greens for your optimal health. Hundreds of \\&quot;Verified Buyers\\&quot; got positive results from GREEN VIBRANCE that they could actually feel, then posted their reviews here. That alone is worth a serious second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some here are discussing the recent ConsumerLab report (Greens and Whole Foods Powders and Pills Review) about arsenic levels in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t read any of that report unless you pay to join.  I too was alarmed and almost joined myself last night until I dug a little deeper. ConsumerLab funding apparently derives NOT just from their substantial membership fee of $59 a year.  At the same time, they also charge manufacturers many thousands of dollars to get their products reviewed.  Now, I&#x27;m not a socialist and believe any business deserves to charge money for valuable services rendered.  But they charge at BOTH ends... and that raised a few questions for me. Are they interested in educating the public, or are they just interested in making money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to do further research before you claim 100% acceptance of this ConsumerLab report. Do a search for \\&quot;Renaissance Health Publishing, LLC Warns the Public that ConsumerLab.com is Not Independent and Labels the &#x27;CL Seal of Approval&#x27; a Worthless, Paid-For Advertising Gimmick.\\&quot; There are a number of valid issues raised if you read the entire article. And if you dig deeper, with more searches, you&#x27;ll find much more. This information ratcheted up my alarm level about their lab reports in general. While they appear to be doing good work, a healthy skepticism is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About arsenic in general:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL natural greens and vegetables tend to higher in arsenic then we ideally would like. Being a natural product from the earth, the arsenic levels in fresh, living food can&#x27;t be controlled in a laboratory. On the other hand, if you look at real people, and use common sense, consuming huge quantities of healthful greens seems to boost the immune system to a higher level so that energy, good health, and well-being can, and often does, last way into old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF there were a way to measure the life-time arsenic consumed by Jay Kordich (the original \\&quot;Juice Man\\&quot;) or the now deceased Jack LaLanne (both passionate, life-long green juice/vegetable advocates) their levels would probably be higher than anyone could imagine, yet they achieved supremely good health. Kordich is now 90 years-old and LaLanne almost made it to 100 years-old. Both enjoy/ed amazing health, vigor, and energy far beyond many people half their age. The testimonies here by some elderly reviewers tend to reflect much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts of the US have higher arsenic soil levels where arsenic just occurs naturally. Other parts of the US have high levels due to farming practices. For example, in some parts of the cotton-growing South, arsenic-based pesticides were used to kill boll weevils on the cotton crops and arsenic levels are extremely high. Because arsenic dissolves easily in water, rice (which is grown in water) sucks up metals and arsenic and rice crops are a good indicator of soil health. Contrary to what most people think, most US rice is actually higher in arsenic than most Basmati and Jasmine rice grown in India or Thailand. Oddly enough, brown rice has higher concentrations of arsenic than white rice because arsenic is stored in the wheat germ which is removed during white rice processing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I lived in southern California for a number of years, I was shocked to see how much heavy toxic chemical spraying goes on to grow the vegetables we buy in the market everywhere today. The Ag workers there don all manner of protective gear to work.  Those vast fields are too toxic to walk in without serious protection and are barren of any life, with not an earthworm, bee, or butterfly to be seen for miles. Unless you can afford to buy strictly organic, the fresh produce you eat is usually bombarded with a constant chemical onslaught: pre-emergent soil herbicides, seed fungicides, pesticides, more fungicides for shipping, and often further chemicals to artificially ripen in the produce bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, there are no simple answers in the supplement world.  Unfortunately, we consumers must ask a lot of questions and do our own homework first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good health and the human immune system are far more complex and mysterious than any stat from any chemical lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, arsenic consumed in higher levels is extremely poisonous and the effects are cumulative.  That said, right now there&#x27;s no serious research to show exactly what happens when we are exposed to low level, long-term arsenic consumption.  In an ideal world, we would all grow, or buy, all our own food locally in tested, organically rich soil. But that is not going to happen any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I weigh the profound benefits of consuming life-giving raw vegetables and green supplements, arsenic is a very minor issue at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL keep using this product. Meanwhile, I do hope someone from Vibrant Health Company addresses the arsenic report findings here ASAP for the benefit of all of us who consume this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I use 1-2+ times/day.  Great to mix with coconut water and drink before bed... ESPECIALLY after a night of drinking.  Makes the next morning much easier.</li>
            <li> I contacted Vibrant Health, the manufacturer of Green Vibrance, and they informed me the current version is 11.0.  Amazon is selling version 10.3.  Version 10.3 contains soy lecithin!  The current version 11.0 contains lecithin from sunflowers, a safe form of lecithin, and no soy lecithin!!  Vibrant Health also informed me they don&#x27;t directly sell to Amazon and have no idea how Amazon is getting green vibrance!  In the future I am only going to purchase fresh, current versions of Green Vibrance!!!  I did an online chat with an Amazon representative and he informed me he has no way of telling what version Amazon is selling today.  I bought mine 2months ago and a friend just bought some a week ago and both are version 10.3.</li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance in smoothies and sometimes just in flavored water.  It helps me feel better and I know I am getting my greens this way.</li>
            <li> I start the day with a smoothie using vibrant green.  The concentrated greens together with vanilla soy milk, and frozen berries packs a powerful nutritious punch.  I just love it and look forward to it every morning.</li>
            <li> I feel better when taking Green Vibrance each day. Love this product! It goes down easier when I mix it with yogurt and frozen blueberries in my Magic Bullet mixer.</li>
            <li> A great all around supplement to my diet.  I drink it before my workout and find it helps my stamina.</li>
            <li> helps you get the things you might miss in your diet. It definitely has aton of great ingredients. I buy it all the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful. I have an arrythmia and sometimes it really helps to drink this..It is great with a banana..apple, any fruit with a little water..or with V 8 juice when i want more salt..It works for me. Love it.</li>
            <li> I feel more energetic and It makes me use my blender more often ;)&lt;br /&gt;I bought the frozen berries from Costco and by adding water or coconut milk and banana making tasty shakes which taste good and you know in you busy lifestyle you are doing something that is good for your health!</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is disgusting...in smell and taste...probably the spirulina in it. (I&#x27;ve used spirulina before &amp; it smells the same.) HOWEVER, the energy I receive from drinking this in the morning is wonderful! And I have to give it 5 stars for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it 1/2 100% concord grape juice and 1/2 filtered water. I have a shaker cup that I use to blend it. My least favorite part (besides the smell of spirulina) is the foam that forms when you shake it up. At the very last gulp, you get this foam that makes it hard to get the last bit. I usually add a tad more water to finish it off. NOTE: There is a &amp;#34;Version&amp;#34; listed right under the &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34; name. This is like a batch ID and denotes changes in formula...supposedly improvements. The company says they continually look for better ingredients and try to keep up to date with new research. EX: My first cannister was 10.3. The one I just received is 14. The look of the powder was different...but same results. NOTE 2:  It is best to store this in the freezer. NOTE 3: When at work I have access to a water cooler that despenses both hot &amp; cold water. If I need a pick-me-up or haven&#x27;t eaten enough vegetables, I put my scoop of Green Vibrance in a cup, add a tad of hot water, stir to dissolve, then fill with cold water. I don&#x27;t get the foam when I do it this way. I just drink it quickly to get past the taste.</li>
            <li> However, I could not get past the taste. Tried mixing in vegetable juice, its was just too overwhelming. So now I mix w/ 8 ounces of water, and drink it as fast as I can. That was the only negative, and if fatique is your problem this works great.</li>
            <li> I feel better and know I&#x27;m healthier after taking this.  I mix mine with vanilla flax milk or vanilla almond milk.  Makes it not taste so bland.  After you get past the taste I enjoy drinking it now.  My tummy thanks me now~!</li>
            <li> Make a glass of Crystal Light Lemonade and add 2 Tablespoons of the Vibrant Green mix.  It will eliminate the bad taste of the product and will smell like lemonade.  You will still have to ignore the color, but will will taste only like lemonade.  You can divide the mix up over the course of the day until you get in the full amount of mix.</li>
            <li> I have been in a living hell food wise between oral allergy syndrome (itchy mouth, sneezing, scratchy throat, often times nearly losing my voice, and having everything come out the other end looking the same as it did when it went in within an hour or two) and fructose malabsorption (flatulence, extreme crippling abdominal pain and cramping, belly distended similar to that of a 6 to 8 month pregnant woman, on rare occasions a mild headache, and unfortunately the side effect of mild depression).  It took me way too long to come to terms with the fructose issues, never could do sodas or overly sugary products as a kid.  Around 20 years ago I became a vegetarian and survived mainly off of vegetables, dairy, and nuts.  About 15 years ago I went on oral antibiotics to treat acne and I now believe the antibiotics were killing everything in my gut, including the bacteria that go crazy when my body can&#x27;t digest fructose because suddenly I was able to enjoy fruits too!  I lived my blissful food loving vegetarian life for 18 years, 13 of which I enjoyed fruits and products that contained fructose.  Then it happened, after years of trying to go off of my acne medications, I was finally able to go a week without breakouts and completely discontinued using them.  Great news for my face, horrible news for the rest of me.  It took me way too long to figure out what was causing all of my abdominal issues, and they were plenty.  I blamed beans, dairy, hormones, everything, but it was my daily apples, oranges, and bananas.  It got to the point where a banana made me violently ill, an orange made everyone ask my usually thin framed self if I was expecting and apples made me curl up in a ball holding my tummy.  Then as age and hormone luck would have it I came down with what I thought was the flu, during my work weeks when I&#x27;d snack on raw veggie sticks for convenience I&#x27;d be stuffy nosed, scratchy throat, running to the bathroom, on weekends I&#x27;d feel a little bit better.  One weekendI had no raw veggies and was all better, went to work, a few hours in tried my snack and all symptoms returned!  Needless to say raw veggies have been dropping out of my diet like bad habits, carrots and celery were among the first to jump ship.  I can&#x27;t have onions or garlic at all in any form.  Onions are double whammy fructose and oral allergy wise.  At this point I can have raw spinach, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini.  About 2 years ago I gave up vegetarianism and have had to boil most veggies to mush just to get them in me without health issues.  I&#x27;ve been so unhealthy the past few years as a result because who wants to eat mushy veggies all the time?  I read the label before purchasing this and was admittedly terrified by the addition of apples but after careful comparison of grams and milligrams on what levels of fructose actually set me off I realized that a serving of this doesn&#x27;t even come close to the fructose load of an actual apple and the dextrose and other products set it off, thank goodness.  The only way I can seem to kill the proteins I&#x27;m allergic to in most veggies has been to boil them and I think this company freeze dries if I&#x27;m not mistaken but I&#x27;ve been able to mix this and drink it without oral issues and so far no other issues.  I&#x27;m in complete shock that my body is allowing this to pass through my system without attacking it on all fronts.  I can&#x27;t say if its actually given me any extra energy and its only been a few days so I can&#x27;t speak to the health claims but so far I want to hug this jar and every person who has a part in getting it from idea, to canister to my hands.  I wrote this review because I didn&#x27;t see anyone addressing specific allergies in the reviews and it made the purchase really hard for me to justify considering the risk.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ROCKS!!!!!!  IT KEEPS MY PH BALANCED, GIVES ME A BOOST IN MY ENERGY, SUPPLEMENTS MY DIET, AND KEEPS MY HEALTH IN CHECK!!  I DRINK 2 DRINKS DAILY,,1 DRINK I TAKE IN MY WATER BOTTLE TO THE GYM, 1 BOTTLE TO WORK.  I SWEAR BY THIS DRINK...  IF YOU WANT TO FLUSH THE DAY TO DAY TOXICITY FROM YOUR DIET, THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li> I searched for a product of this type for some time. I finally decided on Green Vibrance after reading reviews from Amazon. I could not be more happy with my purchase. This is an excellent product, I have tons of energy, and it tastes great with apple juice!</li>
            <li> If you love to get your greens in a smoothie like I do everyday for my health and well being then this is a great way to go!  This will last for a couple months and the cost savings are BIG compared to buying at the store.</li>
            <li> After reading about the 7 super foods, I told my husband I was going to buy some spirulina from Amazon to add to my smoothies. He reminded me he had ordered the Green Vibrance a year or so ago (when he had an unknown sickness at the time) and it was in the freezer. Wow, it had all the ingredients I was looking for, spirulina being the number one ingredient. I drink it every morning, or at least by lunchtime, mixed in my smoothie…one scoop of Green Vibrance, tablespoon cacao power, coconut oil, almond milk and my choice of fruit for the day, but usually I go for the cherries! Soooooo good, you cannot taste the &amp;#34;grass&amp;#34; flavor at all. Satisfies my chocolate craving and I get all the good stuff. I feel so much better, mentally and physically, and more energy. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I try to take it daily. makes me feel healthy. Go on get some, its the best of the green supplements I could find.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, I really did, but the taste was just plain offensive &amp; I can choke down almost any drink . This I could not even finish the first glass- I mean I really tried and wanted to , but ... nope.</li>
            <li> I have used green powers for about two years. Mostly wheatgrass and other greens. Last year I started having mild hot flashes, bloating, fatigue and mood swings. Hello menopause! Did not want to go on hormone replacement. Went to whole foods and since my greens had been a positive part of my dietary supplementation I thought why not change it up a bit. Bought a couple of different packs of different greens products and tried them. Liked the taste of Green Vibrance and the probiotic component. Watched a video on the website and saw the benefits to hormonal balancing and the adrenal system. Started taking it regularly. Within a couple of weeks. NO MORE MENOPAUSE SYMTOMS!!!&lt;br /&gt;One time we left on a five day mini vacation and I forgot my GV tub and by day three I got a mild hot flash. Then I knew for sure it was really my Green Vibrance that  got rid of the hormonal effects of menopause.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the highest quality supplement that I&#x27;ve discovered.  It&#x27;s a powerhouse of nutrition, and I hope never to be without it!</li>
            <li> We have been starting everyday with Green Vibrant for years and plan on continuing to do so for many more.  Great drink for a great price.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our smoothies for about a year and a half. I was buying it at a local grocery but it&#x27;s quite a bit less expensive through this supplier and delivery is always quick.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything to mask the taste of this product, but who cares?? The benefits were amazing, as a family we had more energy.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this product looked amazing and so did the ingredient list. I purchased it a little nervous about it&#x27;s cost but believing if it worked at all, it would be well worth the money for me. I have chronic fatigue so if I had ANY increase in energy, it would be very noticeable and a welcome change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short answer, this did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long(er) answer, I started with the recommended amount for the first week and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in any area of my health (or lack thereof). The beginning of the second week I took two full scoops on a daily basis because I was willing to believe my body needed more to respond. That put me at several weeks at the two scoops with literally no improvement in any area that this should affect (mental fog lifting, energy, improved digestion from the probiotics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a product like this was effective for me, I would have noticed some improvement in at least one area this should affect but I received no benefit. I followed all guidelines for taking this product (with the exception of increasing the dose after a week) and it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t exactly taste great but when mixed in with a smoothie it&#x27;s pretty good.  Been using this for several weeks now.  Health and energy results are inclusive.  Clearly a good impact on my digestive system and it&#x27;s keeping me very regularly.  Combining this with Rainbow Vibrance.  I recently went gluten free and removed most sugar and processed foods from my diet too.  Waiting to see big results.... not much yet.</li>
            <li> I am like so many others who are making attempts at eating healthier. By including  Green Vibrance as part of my diet, I really don&#x27;t have to worry much about going without  many of the major ingredients that our bodies need for optimum health..so many great compounds are stacked into one scoop! I&#x27;m low maintenance, and down mine with just 8 oz. of water. I was actually encouraged to buy double what I purchased previously because you guys featured it for dollars less than the competitors. Thanks for making the product available, and delivering it quickly!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this when looking for solutions to a health problem I had. I found a comment on a random website that this stuff worked and naturally was skeptical. After reading the reviews on amazon I decided to try it. Within a week of taking green vibrance I noticed a difference. I keep it in the freezer and drink it in the morning with a glass of orange juice. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and I would definitely recommend people try it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are the best greens. I have been using them for over 4 years and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Ok, I can&#x27;t give an honest review yet (however I just started Pilates a month ago, and yesterday&#x27;s class kicked my butt. I was able do things I never could do before.)....Ok, so this is day two for me.  Yesterday I drank this stuff with just water. It says on the container to mix with your favorite drink. I&#x27;m thinking to myself, really?? Why would I do that? I can&#x27;t imagine this tasting ok in &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; - mind you, I said &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  First day I suffered through the taste.  Today I thought I would adventurous.  I made the drink, but I added my Dasani flavoring. Omg!  Oh yeah, I can drink this now without gagging. Soooo, I am throwing this out there for you guys to try. It really helps!  I&#x27;ll be back later to give my review of the benefits of the product.  Until then....</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for myself and started taking it.  Then an RN friend wanted some so I ordered the exact same thing for her.  Each product came from a different supplier.  She called me this morning and asked me to send hers back as it had the following  additional label on it:.- &amp;#34;Product contains chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects and othe reproductive harm&amp;#34;.  So I am also sending mine back as I do not wnat to take any chances. I have had a lot of illness in the last year and I thought this would help.  I also do not know why the warning was on one of the containers and not on the other. I shall not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I buy Green Vibrance on the autoship plan and start my day by adding Green Vibrance, Plant Fusion protein powder, chia seeds, Nusweet stevia to taste and water in a shaker bottle and consume it on my way to work. It&#x27;s probably the best thing I do for myself all day.  Tastes fine to me and helps to keep me healthy all year long.  I&#x27;ll never be without it!!</li>
            <li> Eating healthy and getting enough greens in your busy daily routine isn&#x27;t easy, so I&#x27;m happy I found GREEN VIBRANCE, it makes it this important task easy and it is LOADED with all kinds of good stuff:  probiotics, vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, digestive support, antioxidants, etc.  Some people complain about the flavor (which I actually like), but if you mix it with your favorite juice, problem solved and it&#x27;s beyond worth it.  It really makes a difference, I love it and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for about 5 months.  I feel better and plan to continue using the product.</li>
            <li> First the delivery speed was amazing from this seller! I&#x27;ve read a few reviews about the taste which did concern me and but it taste great to me. I don&#x27;t get any gritty modules, I do follow the instructions about refrigeration/freezer. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days since I started to use it but I do feel more energized. Happy I found this brand because I&#x27;ve used another brand for 20yrs but they&#x27;ve changed it some and I don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li> I am autoimmune. I use this daily in my OJ. It keeps me healthy and feeling good. Also a great probiotic.</li>
            <li> This can be expensive to add to your daily supplemental diet, especially for 30 to 60 day supply. If you can afford it comfortably than do it because it really does make a difference on how you look and feel in every aspect.</li>
            <li> Everybody has been passing around sicknesses around me during the holidays and I have managed to keep well with the help of this stuff, Ive goten lazy and instead of mixing it in a cup I just dump it in my mouth and chase it with water. Its a shot of health!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several green foods supplements, and had been taking another product called Vitaforce, that had been recommended to me by a natural foods store clerk, when I decided to do a test comparison with Green Vibrance. I was very loyal to Vitaforce, but I&#x27;ve decided to make a switch to Green Vibrance for a few reasons. I outline a list of &#x27;pros&#x27; below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) CONSISTENCY: Typically, I take a full serving size of Green Vibrance (12.1 grams which is 1 scoop, scoop included), and mix that with Green Plant juice from Trader Joe&#x27;s or an organic juice, and refrigerated water.  I usually whisk it all up with a fork to make sure I get all the powder mixed up. From my perspective, I do like the consistency of this product better, as when I mix up Vitaforce it tends to sink to the bottom a little bit more. The particles of this mix tend to stay suspended more so I just tend to get more of the mix ingested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) TASTE: Let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re not taking supplements for the taste. However, I do believe that on a taste test comparison, this product tastes on par if not better. It really does not taste bad at all if you mix with a bit of juice and water, and my significant other who takes this with me concurs that it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) NUTRITION: There is a looooong list of reasons why I believe this product is incredible in terms of nutritional content, so I will try to sum up here. Not only does this include a long list of standard vitamins and nutrients, but it also contains a WIDE variety of probiotics, Spirulina, Chlorella, Organic Kelp, Organic Flaxseed concentrate, Ginger root, and a whole host of plant-based antioxidants and adaptogens. Also, I confirmed with their reps that all the vitamin content, including the Vitamin D3 (from Lichen) to Vitamin&#x27;s A, C, and K, are all from plant based sources, which means they are not \\&quot;lab produced\\&quot; and have higher bio-availability. Basically this means that your body is going to actually uptake these vitaminsversus lab-produced multi-vitamin pills which your body will not absorb. (A side note, you will see a few of their other products say, \\&quot;FROM PLANT SOURCES\\&quot; next to each vitamin listed, but I confirmed with a rep that all the vitamins in Green Vibrance are ALSO all from plant sources though it doesn&#x27;t explicity say this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Green Vibrance is listed as gluten-free, and although there are barley and oat grass juice powders listed as ingredients, I was told that they are farmed before germination so they do not contain any or hardly any gluten (&lt;10 ppm of gluten for each serving of GV, which qualifies as \\&quot;gluten-free\\&quot;). This product could also be listed as Vegan were it not for the probiotics contained; other than those, the product is vegan. In terms of nutrition, this company has really put their heart and soul into creating a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) RESULTS: I have to say that the energy boost I&#x27;ve gotten from this product, is unparalleled in any other green foods supplement that I&#x27;ve tried, and the results came much quicker. After taking this product once a day for only 3-4 days, I feel as though my brain fog is lower, and my energy level has improved I would say about 300%. I also think my skin looks better. I&#x27;m excited to continue taking this product and update my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a site note, if you are interested in their Maximum Vibrance product, I was told the main difference is that that one contains a serving of plant-based protein in addition to vitamin content...  I&#x27;m also going to be trying their Cleanse product later in 2014, will review then.</li>
            <li> Too soon for decent evaluation at this point. It is bitter to the taste, even will grape drink. I like the concept of taking all my greens at once.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a lot.  I have this stored in my freezer, because I have other green powder I am using.  I did try a few times. I can&#x27;t report anything yet due to the fact that  I Using Energy Green by Institute For Vibrant Living.  I can tell how well that makes me feel.  But I know that this is still a very good product.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance changed my life.  It gives me energy and give me mental acuity.  It also has decreased my caffeine intake by 90%.  The superfood also makes me feed good and &amp;#34;in balance.&amp;#34;  I cannot say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li> Taste like piss!!!!!!!! Taste like poop!!!!taste like grass!!!!!taste like dirty water, taste like piss with grass and poop!!!! And doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li> Consumer Lab tested this and found it contained arsenic. You can read the entire report on their website. I have an unopened container of this.  Wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I rated this so low is because of the flavor &amp; consistency. It tasted like the scrapings from the bottom of a dairy water trough, complete with chunks of grass &amp; hay. I literally gagged down one serving - and I can stomach most anything, and decided to give this a permanent thumbs down. The stuff I take is far superior all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Athletic Greens, which is fantastic, pricey but worth it to me - a 1 month supply runs $100. I was simply trying to save money but will gladly pay more to avoid the Vibrant Green experience. PS, my research has shown that the best way to take these type of greens is in its most natural state - straight H2O &amp; on an empty stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck in your search &amp; if you like this formula, you&#x27;re a better man than me! Say hello to the Jersey cows for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this product for almost a year and it has lowered my cholesterol and has raised my HDL Level. I feel more energized and healthier.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while and we have no complaints what so ever.  It&#x27;s easy to mix, easy to drink and a boatload cheaper than probiotic pills and liquids.  Works with milk, soy, banana&#x27;s, yogurt, and anything else you want to mix it with.  Turns everything GREEN but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li> I tried it in juice, in a smoothie, but there just is no way possible to choke this down.  Tastes like seaweed at low tide with raw fish mixed in - just disgusting! Couldn&#x27;t stomach it &amp; have no idea how others have managed to do it.  I switched to the pills and added fresh green juice to my diet.</li>
            <li> I add this to my little ones juice so I can feel confident they are getting healthy greens into their diet. Have been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t taste bad and I took it as a supplement to the other green drink I use (Vitamineral Green) because the Green Vibrance has more probiotics that I was looking for. Unfortunately, I come to find out it has been demonstrated by lab testing to be very high in arsenic and from other reports possibly also other heavy metal contaminants at high levels. The company responded by attacking the lab.... bad sign. The company needs to pledge to show heavy metal contaminant levels in this product before I will ever purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about the same price you can purchase another green drink that passed the arsenic and heavy metal testing - there are at least 10 out there that did in fact pass with relatively low arsenic levels - much lower (up to 5x lower) levels of arsenic according to the lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sticking to Vitamineral Green for now (unless and until I discover it is also unhealthy in some way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (June 17, 2014): Ok, so there is a lot of name-calling over this incident and the ConsumerLab finding this has elevated arsenic levels. After researching the entire mess it seems after getting called-out for high levels of arsenic in GreenVibrance (even though organically bound forms of arsenic aren&#x27;t really a concern) the company has responded to the exposure by not only committing to monitoring and lowering heavy metal levels but also to measure arsenic levels in all ingredients and do an assessment of the levels in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a scientist&#x27;s perspective (mine) I believe the lab was correct to publish the corresponding levels of arsenic in ALL the products tested but did in fact do a disservice by sensationalizing (to some extent) the \\&quot;results\\&quot; and their implications. Bottom line: toxic arsenic IS bad in our food and should be limited as much as possible even if levels are relatively low by toxicity standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short any potential concern about the arsenic levels has been addressed to my satisfaction by the commitment by the manufacturer to manage the levels in this product and actively work to reduce them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed my review to reflect these changes from one star to four - because I do otherwise like the product after using a 60-day supply.</li>
            <li> I have been using a scoop of Green Vibrance in my daily protein shakes.  I could immediately tell that this product gives me more energy and more vibrant health!!  I am 57 and truly feel as good or better than I did 20 years ago!!  I use a scoop of Green Vibrance daily along with almond milk, frozen fruit, an apple, 1/2 scoop of protein powder, and ice in my blender.  I would highly recommend this product if you are serious about having good health.  Green Vibrance is full of so many good for you vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for years with good results until I read it contains Arsenic. I would think that the company should address these concerns but I have seen no evidence. Until  they do, I would stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> My research on this type of product showed this to be one of he best.Happy so far and great price</li>
            <li> I love the product I can feel the difference I cook and clean all the time and my nails keep growing! I feel great and my energy level has increased.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  If you want to make it taste better just add a teaspoon of Y.S. Organic Bee Farm raw organic honey which you can purchase here on Amazon for a little over $12 in a 2lb glass jar.  It instantly takes away the bitter green taste and gives it a smooth pleasant taste.  I would also recommend looking at another product by this company called Vibrant Health Maximum Vibrance Digestive Supplement, 24.81 Ounces sold here on Amazon.  It has a lot more nutrients 120 compared to the 73 in this product plus it has Moringa and 23g of protein in it.  This product says to use a full scoop.  I think that is a bit much I reduced it to half of that dosage.  It makes it last longer as well.  Then just add a teaspoon of the raw organic honey and it becomes very enjoyable to drink.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Vibrant Health Green Vibrance from Amazon for many reasons; primary for rapidity and also good price.&lt;br /&gt;I do not need another vitamin, this is it, I mix 10 drops of Cellfood liquid and some honey with berries, and I have the perfect smoothie for breakfast. Good health to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;Kiki</li>
            <li> I have this every morning for Breakfast with Warrior Protein Powder and also some fiber with almond milk. Its got a ton of nutrients and makes a great breakfast.</li>
            <li> its my favorite green food. not a lot of fillers. keeps me pooping regular. i am very into it. buy</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great vitamin! Instead of taking vitamin pills everyday Green Vibrance does the trick. Also, you get your vitamins with vegetables in a liquid form. I still eat my vegetables but with this you have a double wammy!</li>
            <li> Greens in a concentrated form are the best thing you can do for your body. I have been dieting really heavy as of late, and I wanted something that was low calorie, yet highly packed with nutrients. This has been just the solution that I sought out.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really like this product.  Yes the taste is terrible.  I mix it with water and down it and it’s over.  There is a positive energy effect.  Not like caffeine which can give you the jitters, but a slight pleasant notch up in overall energy and mental capacity.  There is also significant improvement with digestion.  Let me put this recommendation in context, I am 62 and at my age am happy to find any product that I can honestly say has a positive effect on mind, body and spirit.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see just how well it works. Have only used it for a little over a onth,but have already ordered more. I have gotten used to the taste, but not the looks of this product.I blend it with V-fusion juice and a little lemon and lots of ice. I think I may have become ddicted to it.  Just hope it works, and that I really am getting all the veggies and fruits I need in one large glass of green stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of product you take just once.  It&#x27;s a commitment for me, every day, and I see the results in my digestive efficiency, my energy level and my nails!  This product delivers, and I take it every morning.</li>
            <li> I have this every day... I travel far too much and always take Green Vibrance with me. This provides a wonderful vegetable supplement and I can see the benefit!! Well worth the investment! I have been using GV for over seven years.</li>
            <li> This is by far is the best that money can buy. I mixed frozen papaya and frozen strawberries and then throw in a banana and bang. I have my morning breakfast in my togo large plastic tupperware. I really love the stuff. I wish I could get a deal for bragging about it. Because I will be a lifetime buyer.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a few years now.  I used to get sick all the time and had to be careful to get enough sleep...and this fixed me...now i very rarely get sick, even when the rest of the family comes down with a cold or flu.  Tastes nasty but it works.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance has help greatly, my arthritis has stopped hurting, hair seems thicker and general health better.&lt;br /&gt;One small scope a day, have to take with Almond Milk for the taste.&lt;br /&gt;Continuing to use and recommend to any one else.</li>
            <li> It is a transformative product that rebounds energy and a sense of wellness!!! It is a perfect supplement to re-charge and to upgrade the quality of one&#x27;s nutritional intake.....thanks Green Vibrance......your Fan for Life (a board certified physician who is student of life)</li>
            <li> Great supplement to boost your overall health. Keep it in the freezer for optimum freshness. Better than taking a daily multivitamin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, nutrient dense product, which offers undeniable benefits in the way of increased energy, improved digestive health, and immune health! Who can eat all the green veggies you really need? If I drink my Green Vibrance early in the day I feel like I have ingested a bushel of fresh, green veggies vibrant with life!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if these sorts of things work. I don&#x27;t know if I feel different. I buy this stuff and take it because several people I trust who know more than me and do this sort of scientific research for a living tell me that I&#x27;ll be glad I did it in 30 years. So I take this and a few other supplements. Is it hurting me? I don&#x27;t think so. Do I feel one iota different for having taking it? I don&#x27;t think so. Is it way cheaper than Whole Foods? Absolutely. And that&#x27;s pretty much all that matters. If you do your research and think you need this stuff, buy it here and for no other reason than it&#x27;s the cheapest place I found it.</li>
            <li> It is not as delicious as say.... a cinnamon roll but nobody expects that, right?  If you doctor it up a bit it is palatable.  I use either organic, unsweetened coconut milk or almond milk, frozen fruit or fresh fruit, spice (cinnamon, cocoa, turmeric, maca powder, camu powder, you get the idea), a scoop of Plant Fusion (unflavored) protein powder and a sweetener like Pure LoHan (monk fruit) and blitz it up with ice in my Bullet.  What could be healthier?  You get it done in one swoop!  I take additional Vitamin D, krill oil and Magnesium.  That&#x27;s it!  Bring on the day!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son worked at Wholefoods and learned a lot about health products, he suggested this green food supplement and I have to agree it is by far the best I have found on the market.  Great taste, feels alive and vibrant, just like the name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hypoglycemic, and I&#x27;ve learned through experience that there are certain herbs and herbal products that can profoundly affect my blood sugar.    There is little clinical study of many herbs, and reliable reporting on side effects (or even beneficial effects) is anecdotal. Herb popularity tends to run in fads -- there&#x27;s always a hot new herb everyone is enthused about. And the excitement over the new one lasts about as long as it did with the last one.    Still, because of the buzz, anything with herbs is considered by most people to be better than anything without herbs. Manufacturers get around the \\&quot;what&#x27;s hot\\&quot; thing by throwing in the kitchen sink -- every herb that sounds good goes in the pot.    Unfortunately that just increases the chances that some people are not going to be able to use the product. Or will use it and have reactions or side effects (or even long term effects) they don&#x27;t realize are coming from an herb or herbs in the product.     Green Vibrance happens to be one of those products with a kitchen sink full of herbs in addition to the green foods like spirulina and other beneficial ingredients.    I didn&#x27;t realize this when I took a serving. I had been looking forward to trying Green Vibrance because I had heard so much about it and read so many glowing reviews. A few hours later my blood sugar was way low -- I had the familiar and unmistakable symptoms. I was on schedule with my meals. The only thing I had done differently was try the Green Vibrance.    I read the Green Vibrance label carefully and, among the many, many ingredients, discovered the likely culprit -- silymarin (milk thistle extract). I&#x27;ve had a similar experience with milk thistle before, as well as goldenseal. Do a Google search and you&#x27;ll see silymarin has been noted as causing blood sugar drops.     I really wish companies and corporations would get past the obsession with adding faddish herbs to every manufactured good out there. If we want herbs, we can easily buy them separately. Or the company could package and sell them as a separate adjunct to the product.    For those who don&#x27;t have blood sugar problems, Green Vibrance may be as wonderful as many people claim, but I&#x27;ll just look for a green drink without all the added herb stuff.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a person who&#x27;s very much into health products. Through-out the course of my lifetime, I&#x27;ve juiced (fresh vegetables, fresh fruits) with a juicer. I&#x27;ve drank liqufied: broccolli,lettuce,celery,parsley,kale,spinach. Yes, it was a disgusting taste at first, but after two or three tries it&#x27;s an acquired taste.  The only reason I stopped juicing was because of the bacteria on vegetables. Plus, honestly it&#x27;s a lot of work to purchase tons of vegetables, clean and store them, clean the juicer afterwards and so on...on a daily basis.     Which leads me to my point about Green Vibrance. Yes, the taste is bad but with patience to find the right combination to mix or drink with it, you will never regret it. Nor will the taste bother you either. I&#x27;ve had such great health benfits: tighter, healthier looking skin, way more energy, calmness,and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a cold, regardless of being around those who do. It&#x27;s a great health benefit. Expensive, but worth every penny. Considering if you got sick,and had to buy cold medicine or worse go to a doctor, you would pay way more than you would by using this product. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar of Green Vibrance, and I really like it.  My son recommended it after I had heart surgery, as an aid to my recovery.  I think it helped a lot.  It has a very well thought out balance of nutrients.</li>
            <li> I have felt great after continued use. My Dr. said I needed more greens in my diet. And this is how i get them tho be heart healthy. I mix mine with 1 yogurt and 1 banana. It&#x27;s awsome. I have noticed a lot more energy in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I mix it in with applejuice or put it in a smoothie. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I feel stronger, have more energy and my IBS is gone! It is rather expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I eat a lot of greens in my daily diet, but it can be hard to stuff pounds of greens in during a busy schedule.  This give me the added benefit of what is good for me in a fast and easy drink.  I mix it with orange juice or apple juice and I actually think it taste great now.  I crave it when I haven&#x27;t had my daily dose.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market! Blend it in a smoothie and get all the benefits of probiotics plus all the other necessary nutrients needed.</li>
            <li> I take one scoop of this every morning and I just love knowing this is a part of my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got too many ingredients for me to list in here, but all of them will leaving you feeling good about yourself for including this in your normal food regiment. I was especially happy to see the Vegan Vitamin D in here. (I&#x27;m not vegan, but seeing a good natural source of vitamin D was great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be a repeat buyer when my container runs out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Green Vibrance, I never miss a day! It keeps my tummy happy, my skin amazing (nothing else has ever made my skin so clear and I tried everything for my acne), and my hair and nails are fantastic. I highly recommend Green Vibrance. Seriously, every time someone compliments my skin/hair/nails or mentions tummy issues, I immediately recommend Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Several years ago a friend turned me on to Green Vibrance. I have looked at other &amp;#34;comparable brands&amp;#34; - but nothing comes close to the quality and the effectiveness of this product. IT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from my local health food store, but I cannot find anyone that can beat this price.</li>
            <li> sorry had to send back, I&#x27;m sure my family wont drink it because of the taste.  I feel bad to give bad review but hey!</li>
            <li> OK, don&#x27;t buy this for taste, but if you&#x27;re buying it for the potential health benefits, then proceed.  My wife and I had to work our way up to a full scoop.  We noticed that if we did the full scoop right away we were both a bit nauseous.  We reduced the scoop to 1/2 and didn&#x27;t have the same feeling.  We worked our way up to a full scoop and now we&#x27;re enjoying it.  This is not something you&#x27;re going to want to sit around and sip.  Just mix it, chug it and move on with you life.</li>
            <li> A coworker recommended this (we both bought Vitamix blenders at the same time) and I trusted his opinion.  Wish I would have tried it first.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it does throw off the taste of my morning smoothie.  I&#x27;ve tried to compensate with other ingredients, but found that simply not using it is what works best.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, very fast shipping!  I have been using GV for almost two years.  It doesn&#x27;t make me FEEL any different, but within the first year drinking it (semi-regularly) my triglycerides dropped about 100 points.  I didn&#x27;t change much else w/ my diet...except the GV.  I have become more consistent w/ my drinking of it within this last year, so am looking forward to my labs this year at my physical. Also,  I have always had a problem w/ yeast and when I drink GV this every day, I don&#x27;t suffer w/ yeast nearly as much.  At a cellular I know it is doing something good for me so I will continue to use this product.  Oh, I tried Greens+ (Because my local store was out) and although I may have preferred the taste of Greens+, I felt like GV is a better, more holistic product.  I add a my scoop of GV to my morning protein shake with a frozen banana and the taste practically disappears. I mixed it in water for the first year and it was awful...it has been easier to be consistent since I learned the protein/banana trick.  :)</li>
            <li> Taking this gives me extra peace of mind that I&#x27;m getting enough greens in my diet, especially since I haven&#x27;t been overly disciplined with eating them. This must have a decent amount of potassium perhaps as it seems to have benefited me physically (along with other things I&#x27;ll confess). I used to put it in my smoothies, but now I just chug with some water and I&#x27;m done with it. The green powders lasts a lo-o-o-ong time....</li>
            <li> Too lazy to eat vegetables? Buy this then.</li>
            <li> Great value,  excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product was tested by cosumerlab.com and it was found to have very high amounts of ARSENIC. The article is currently up on Prevention.com, I will post the link in the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been taking this stuff for years so i have probably shaved a few  years of my life expectancy:(  The one thing i thought i was doing good for myself is actually harming me. I want all of the money back that i spent over the years on this trash. I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait 20 years for the CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT settlement check. Hopefully i don&#x27;t get brain cancer by then. F****ng Depressing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and it is very easy to see if it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job. Just stop taking it and I notice the difference that next day.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a better rating for Green Vibrance, but it just did not do anything for me. I purchased Green Vib after running out of my Dr. Schulze superfood. If you look at the vitamins in Schulze vs Green Vib, Dr. Schulze wins.Too much vitamin K, not enough C, B3, B6, B12 or A. All of these should be over 100%. Too much vit K causes blood clots. If you eat alot of salads, spinach or other forms of vitamin K, you may want to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;  I do like that this has 500% of vitamin D3, but I drink milk, so I can get my D elsewhere. Dr. Schulze has 0 vit D for some reason. This also has 333% of vitamin E. D and E content is where Green Vibrance shines. There are lists on the container of all the things Green Vib contains, but again, it just doesn&#x27;t do anythig for me. With Dr Schulze, I could feel it coming alive after 3 or 4 days of use, and Dr. Schulze was helpful in weight loss. Read my amazon review for Dr. Schulze Superfood Plus.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t doubt the Green Vibrance has helped alot of people. If it does, keep using it, but for me I will be reording another order of Dr Schulze. If Green Vibrance did nothing for you, you&lt;br /&gt;may want to check out Dr. Schulze, for your next foray into superfoods.</li>
            <li> Great base to start with....would like some discounts...:0)</li>
            <li> Just finished my first month supply and am buying two more months.  I drink my scoop every morning in about 4 oz of water and down the hatch. I&#x27;ve also done a couple of smoothies but they need honey to cover the flavor even with berries, banana and OJ.  Bad flavor? Yeah, but not so terrible that it&#x27;s undrinkable. I just think of it as my &#x27;adult shot of tequila&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately felt the rush of energy as well as a rush to go to the bathroom. After about 3 days the energy was normal more than a rush and the diarrhetic effect was not rushed any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly after a few weeks I did not notice the increase in energy as much but I am chalking that up to it just being my new norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only gets four stars for my lack of research. After a doctors checkup and some ingredient crunching I will come back and edit my review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Use it daily in smoothie made with Nutribullet!</li>
            <li> This product is always fresh and filled with pure health benefits. It has always given me energy and supplies my body with the missing nutrients it craves and needs. The taste is not for everyone but I mix it in my protein powder and it makes it easier to drink. But even if I had to drink it on its own, I would just for the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product can really do wonders for your body that you cannot see. Its essential for your body and you never know if this is building something inside to stop cancer or bad things from happening inside your body. We always change the oil in our cars, invest a lot of time and money in our homes but sometimes we neglect our bodies. This is a step in the right direction for anyone. It mixes easily and is a bit of love in a glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat your body and don&#x27;t think twice about ordering this product. I have used it for years and I love it!!! You may get hooked too...Great shipper as product arrived in a timely manner and was packed well. Tip: keep this in the freezer between drinks so it stays extra fresh.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a great source of all of the plant-based vitamins, minerals, trace minerals and probiotics that you need.  It&#x27;s easy to mix and tastes good with just cold water and gives me a nutritious and energetic start to the day.</li>
            <li> Was on different types of medications for blood pressure and overweight before staring this product now that I have been using Green Vibrance for over a year I have lost 40 pounds and I no longer have the need to take any blood pressure medications.</li>
            <li> I love the heck out of this stuff! It helped lower my blood pressure over time. Only thing is that because of the price I decided to switch over to Garden of Life&#x27;s RAW Green Super food powder instead. The price is much more feasible for me and it works just as great for me and has the same affects on helping to keep my blood pressure lowered.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and Amazon&#x27;s service is amazing as always.  Read the ingredients and you will understand why we love Green Vibrance so much.  We blend it with frozen bananas and  vanilla almond milk and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance Version 14 Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased Green Vibrance with the intent to increase energy levels for more intense workouts. After 2 weeks of drinking it with spring bottle water I dropped an additional 5 lbs while maintaining my weekly workout routine. However, it taxed my strength in exchange for energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Green Vibrance I was doing over 60 push-ups for warm ups at 160 lbs. After I started taking it, I was lucky to reach 35 push-ups. My chin ups dropped from 17 reps to about 14 reps. You would think at 5 lbs less that I would be able to do more but this isn&#x27;t the case.  Didn&#x27;t change anything in my diet with the exception of this powder. By the way I&#x27;m in my mid 30s so I&#x27;m not a teenager loaded with natural energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Vibrance is excellent for dropping weight quickly naturally and does give you more energy to remain productive all day without jitters. It&#x27;s definitely better than drinking multiple cups of coffee with sugar or drinking expensive energy drinks.  Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to remain productive all day, desires to drop weight safely and is interested in detoxification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, after a few days of taking it I felt an intense heat build up inside me. Due to other online reviews I was aware of potential detox reactions. Continued taking Green Vibrance and after a few days the side effect sub sided completely. Haven&#x27;t noticed any additional adverse reactions. I do feel a sense of well being and clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before taking Green Vibrance, I was taking Green Max Plus before they stopped manufacturing it. They still offer Green Max and some other new powders but I decided to try Green Vibrance for a few months. In any case, Green Max Plus was way more affordable and did give me the ability to engage in more intense workouts. I was drinking that for about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your objective is to increase performance strength look elsewhere unless your objective is to drop weight and detox your body before engaging in serious workouts with an alternative product. If you don&#x27;t workout at all this is still an excellent product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink it everyday with spring water before going to sleep and wake up energized without the need for coffee or other chemical based energy enhancing products. Just have some nutritional breakfast and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, make sure that you can take this if you are on meds. If not, consider suspending your meds and try this for a month to see if your health improves. Just one scoop per day in spring bottle water is all you need.</li>
            <li> I mix this with turmeric, beat powder and kale powder and it tastes great, mixes well and seems to dissolve ok</li>
            <li> This is a product I use every day. I still believe that it is a great way to supplement my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, mixing it with just water can be distasteful. I seriously gag if just drinking it straight! Just some ideas to improve (or hide) the taste:&lt;br /&gt;1. mix it with a lime airborne tablet&lt;br /&gt;2. mix it in with a fruit smoothie&lt;br /&gt;3. mix it with lime selzter</li>
            <li> I have GERD and if I drink a scoop of the green vibrance with some cranberry juice every morning I Have no symptoms. Whenever I run out, I notice the belching and indigestion return after I eat my meals.</li>
            <li> It works.  It makes a HUGE difference in my day.  You&#x27;ll feel better all over, I promise! I ran out yesterday and boom- fever back up, energy back down, aches and pains back with a vengeance...  Oh how my body misses this stuff.  It seems a bit pricey, so I thought I&#x27;d see how I do without it.  Now I know and I can&#x27;t reorder soon enough!!</li>
            <li> Very good filler though out the day during work hours. your definitely reach your goal for greens every day throughout the week</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for six months now and I definitely feel better it&#x27;s also helping with constipation</li>
            <li> I reviewed this already, but since I bought it twice... good price great product- put it in smoothies and in pasta...doesn&#x27;t change taste too much and good for you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I give it to my kids in the morning mixed with a little orange juice and they all drink it! It makes me feel better that they&#x27;re getting lots of vitamins they need when I struggle to get the daily veggies into them. I&#x27;ll even make berry smoothies with it and once they get past the green look, they&#x27;re fine. I really do think it helps them behave better, and not crave so much junk since their body is getting what it needs.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance really helps my immune system combat viruses and I overall feel so much better.  I mix it with juices and it tastes fine.  It took a few days to get use to it but it really was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It might be the healthiest thing in the world but it just tastes too nasty for me. First time I added it to orange juice I almost puked and couldn&#x27;t take more than 2 sips, the second time I tried it with miso soup thinking maybe it&#x27;ll go better with its fishy tasting properties but no, cannot tolerate the smell or taste. The third time I ate it raw as suggested by my husband who thinks that it would be the best way to down a green powder but oh no I gaged so hard and now this product is going to sit forever in my fridge.</li>
            <li> I am a gym fanatic and I don&#x27;t believe in taking a bunch of chemical crap....good ole protein and smart eating. This goes in my protein shake every morning. There is a slight \\&quot;veggie\\&quot; taste to my strawberry shake but it still is tasty. Highly recommend this product. I have tried others and they taste waaaay worse and don&#x27;t have half the stuff that this has in it.</li>
            <li> If you are buying or considering this you should have already researched the contents and benefits of it.  So,  all I will attest to here is price ad it was best here.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with purchasing my product from Vibrant Health through Amazon.  There were not any hidden fees, no shipping charges and item arrived ahead of time.  I will definitely purchase from Vibrant Health through Amazon again.  In the store the item costs almost $30 more.</li>
            <li> This is the best price that I have seen for this product!  The shipping was fast, showed up ahead of schedule. I have been taking this product for years and can honestly say that it does make you feel better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I mix it with juice at times and at times just with water.  The effects are immediate and the energy is lasting.  I mix a glass in the morning and at lunch.</li>
            <li> This is the first supplement that my husband says has really made a noticable difference in how he feels.  We love that it is organic and we can be sure we are not getting more chemicals.</li>
            <li> I put this in a smoothie every morning with berries and bananas. Very good and I feel the difference!</li>
            <li> Feel the power and the energy knowing the best is flowing throughout your body and mind. Not a bad taste either. This product has it all.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! Not a scientific statement of course but the energy I get and the overall good feeling and mental clarity make it an easy choice to purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS TASTES LIKE SHIIIIT! Buy yours today, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I used 30 days commitment the result was excellent!!! I had trouble to digest my food and my immunine system was very Low that&#x27;s why I had lots of cold sores keeping coming on my face I was very stressed because this, I had cold sores keep coming on my face for a year I didn&#x27;t know what to do I went to see dermatoligyst spent $500 for virus medicine and it didn&#x27;t work. Also I had allergies, hives on my body suddenly it was my first Time that I had allergies and I was really afraid then I heard about this product from social networks so I decided to try it and I had great result since I used it I never had any problems with digestion and I go to bathroom almost everyday and I never had any cold sores and hives. I used 30 days commitment last march and right after that I started to take &amp;#34;Green Vibrance&amp;#34; dried green juice I use it every morning and I love it Unicity and green vibrance saved me from low immunine system problems ;) thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for you but taste nasty!</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting on its own.  I think that means it&#x27;s working.  Mixed in a smoothie you can&#x27;t taste it at all, but it gives it a green tint, so everyone knows how healthy you are.  Fancy lad.</li>
            <li> Very nice - just as described</li>
            <li> My husband and I have started doing juices/smoothies and use Green Vibrance in our drinks.  It has helped with overall feeling well and my own cholesterol has dropped to a good level.</li>
            <li> Can not say conclusively if this product have me an extra lift or if it was a placebo effect. I will try for another 60 days to see if energy increase can be attributed to vibrant greens.</li>
            <li> I have found Green Vibrance to be one of the healthier choices for me to make I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Has everything I need to get started with my day. I had to take it for a week before I felt the energy effects. To get over the taste I mix it with orchards grape juice.  Can&#x27;t taste it at all that way.</li>
            <li> First day review Holy hell does it taste awful. Was far grittier than j originally thought it would be. I&#x27;m sure as time goes on ill get used to it but goodness it&#x27;s a challenge the first couple days</li>
            <li> I started taking this 3 years ago when I was having severe joint problems in every major joint.  I thought I had arthritis.  I had major inflammation, according to my blood tests.  This was recommended to me by a knowledgeable health practitioner.  After using it for 3 months, I was and still am pain free!  Needless to say, this is a miracle product.  Just mix it with some OJ.</li>
            <li> This is my very first review at amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I did not buy this stuff at amazon. Still, I consider it a civic duty to get the word out to those who are considering a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who gave this product rave reviews, I am still scratching my head as to what to say to you all. This is an incredibly inferior product. The potency, even though it has a wonderful profile, is poor. Let me get real here.... this is a NUTRITIONALLY DEAD PRODUCT. There have been many who have stated that they can feel it working within minutes. I am sorry to disappoint you -- that is the gingko at work. They must have put a ton of it in there so you can have that wonderful feeling of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for the purpose of self healing and found myself having to take vitamins with it. Green Vibrance really sucks.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff. It mixes easy in a smoothie, and no fruity taste. Helps maintain a alkaline body. Try it!</li>
            <li> I just purchased Green Vibrance  this week and then saw the negative postings concerning inorganic arsenic in this product. After reading the posting (see link below) on the company&#x27;s website, I am very satisfied and will continue using the product.  I encourage others to read the company&#x27;s detailed response so they have all the facts.  [...]</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced this to me and I have now purchased it myself.  A wonderful probiotic.  My stomach has been feeling better since I started using it.  I add it to my Protein Shakes each morning along with all the berries and a banana.  I also use almond milk mixed with coconut milk.  Add some flax in too!  This product tastes great when you use it in a shake!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted to love this product; have taken other liquid greens and can take a lot of stuff, but not this; but they refunded money so no problem!</li>
            <li> I read scientific literature stating the benefits of consuming active cultures for stress as well as brain function.&lt;br /&gt;I found this vibrant green on amazon based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to afford the time to buy yogurt on a regular basis or time it takes to consume it, so this was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mix and fast to drink. I&#x27;m a physician-resident and this works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the effects are subtle but I drink it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the price.</li>
            <li> Been using Vibrant green Vibrance for over two years.  I have two glassed per day, 7 days a week.  I only eat red meat one day per week, so its been a great subsitute for iron.</li>
            <li> Part of my daily routine for many years now.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product of them all . It has everything you need to maintain good health, along with a healthy diet. We take it every day and would never be without it. I recommend it to all my friends. I read them the label to explain why they should take and then they are convinced</li>
            <li> The headline says it all for me.  YUK  YUK  YUK  SORRY BUT I JUST CANNOT STOMACH THE GREEN COLOR OR THE TASTE.</li>
            <li> This product significantly boosted my immune system. For example, a colleague showed up to work sick and shirtly thereafter I developed the same symptoms and which traditionally signalled to me that I was sick (a very sore/swollen throat). However, overall i felt fine besides that localized discomfort -- a benefit I attribute to my regular use of green vibrance. Additionally, I could only drink half a glass of milk a day before I would get indigestion. Now, I can drink as much milk as I want thanks to the probiotics in Green Vibrance. It is recommended to take this product 30 minuted after a major meal because Green Vibrance assists the body with absorbing nutrients from the food one consumes. I take it every day religiously because I can feel the difference when I skip my dose. I already recommended this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would call one scoop of anything a super food, but at least I can see the ingredients easily. Been drinking one glass a day for 3 months now. Can&#x27;t say my wrinkles disappeared, or that I have the energy of my twenty&#x27;s, but nutrition isn&#x27;t magic. It takes years of eating the right foods, and even then, you may not know anything is working - just that you feel good, and no real diseases or problems ( which can be attributed to eating right). So- glad I&#x27;m taking this, makes my wife and I &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;, and now I can say I had my veggies, even when I just eat pasta or pizza for dinner!!! For the price, it&#x27;s cheap insurance - certainly not harmful in any way, and the small amount of nutrition in each scoop only can help.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for the body! I mix it in V-8 juice &amp; it&#x27;s really good. My daughter puts it in her fruit smoothies. I will but this forever.</li>
            <li> I do frozen Banana, frozen strawberry, frozen peanut butter cubes, regular almond milk and scoop of this in a Ninja or Nitribullet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely delicious. Sometimes I make enough for lunch as well and it is filling enough.</li>
            <li> YOU CANT GO WRONG W./THIS,,USEING THIS FOR SEVERAL YRS PRODUCT DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS &amp; MORE</li>
            <li> This is a neat product.  Taste will take some getting used to, but I keep telling my self that&#x27;s what healthy is supposed to taste like :)&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in the freezer (as instructed) and have a scoop every morning on my way to work.  It really helps to get my day off right.  If I don&#x27;t have it now I can really tell the difference.  Great price, great product</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no taste, so definitely mix it with fruit/veggies.  Good stuff though</li>
            <li> I used it for 60 days and I can say that it helped my digestive system. As for the other comments about increase energy and all that, I can&#x27;t really tell. I think my energy level always felt the same.&lt;br /&gt;Would I order again? Yes if the price hadn&#x27;t gone up $15 since I first ordered it (about 60 days ago). There are good probiotics out there for half the price. And I say probiotics, because it is the only benefit I got out of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best super food out there. I don&#x27;t get all these people complaining about the taste. All you need to do is mix with OJ and it&#x27;s fine. After a week, you&#x27;ll get used to the taste. I like using a banana, oj, and a scoop of Trader Joe&#x27;s frozen plain yogurt. THis literally makes my hair grow faster and my nails and it just makes me feel better ALL day. I no longer crave a nap (I&#x27;m 40)around 3pm. The 15 travel packets are good to use if you travel a lot. Buy this stuff now!</li>
            <li> I love Green Vibrance - I have a serving every morning in my (kale) smoothie and it makes me feel great. I have nothing to compare this to, but my roommate and I both use this powder and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Green Vibrance for 5 years. I mix it with ground flax seed and water for a good start to the day. In my late 50&#x27;s but feel half my age--my wife says I act like a child. I exercise and eat right, but Green Vibrance is a big part of my success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and really LOVE it!  I mix it with a low cal vanilla shake and it tastes really good, however, it&#x27;s not too bad by itself (just very green tasting).  This product gives me more energy and seems to help keep me \\&quot;regular\\&quot; as well.  The price for this item is around $90 in most health food stores so buying it on Amazon is the way to go.</li>
            <li> GV was recommended to me by my nutritionist and I haven&#x27;t looked back since then. It&#x27;s a natutal energy boost before or after the gym</li>
            <li> I got rid of my Multi-Vitamin as soon as I tried Green Vibrance. I&#x27;ve tried several multi-vitamins without feeling any noticeable difference. But Green Vibrance just makes me feel great!     There&#x27;s research out there from multiple sources that show capsule multi-vitamins just aren&#x27;t absorbed completely. Also, most of the store-brands contain artificially created versions of the different vitamins, the hazards of which range from poor absorption, not being used correctly by the body, or being possibly harmful. Go to the Vibrant Health website and you&#x27;ll find the vast list of ingredients in this are mostly all natural or organic superfoods. Why is this important, you ask?... Ever think we were designed to eat food and not pills, and that&#x27;s where we should get our nutrients?... hmm.    And to top it all off this comes with a good dose of probiotics, good bacteria that can really help almost any digestive problem.    I tried it with water at first, and it mixes ok--kind of clumpy like whey protein. I wound up blending it with a little fruit and veggies, coconut milk, eggs, and whey protein for a great breakfast shake.    Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is full of green foods and probiotics and the taste is okay.Good family size and good for improving bowel function.</li>
            <li> This product was really great and I used it religiously until consumerlab . com tested it and found it was heavily contaminated with arsenic; much more that any other product of it&#x27;s kind and more than legally allowed in other pruducts, one namely apple juice. I contacted the company but they refuted the claim and wrote me a lengthy letter explaining the science of their own testing and pointing the finger at consumerlab . com for fear mongering to sell their subscription service. Consumerlab . com is an independent testing lab that many supplement manufacturers submit products to for testing but the bulk of their testing is random samples collected/purchased from general commercial lines. Manufacturers actually want to get independently certified by them because they are or appear to be impartial and hold a high standing in the community. I just don&#x27;t believe that the results are skewed to sell a subscription. They review hundreds of products and welcome challenges to their testing when products don&#x27;t have the ingredients they claim, the amounts they claim or have other harmful ingredients that are not listed on the label. Very few companies take up the challenge to their testing. I&#x27;m cautious and leaning toward consumerlab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take this to imporove my health and the health of my family so that&#x27;s something I won&#x27;t play with. Until they can prove their product is safe I won&#x27;t be using it. It&#x27;s just a shame I bought the large container and we&#x27;re only less than 1/2 way through it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 8 and I can tell you that I feel great!  I suffer from blood circulation problems.  I finally felt my hands and feet on the second day!  This thing is amazing!  I also have diabetes type II and high blood pressure.  My levels are normal at this time and I feel energetic.  No need for coffee at all!  The best part is that I have lost some weight and feel great.  I also  suffer from joint pain I can tell you that since I starting taking Green Vibrance I have not taken any pain killers at all.  I can&#x27;t wait for day 30.  You need to take charge of your own health.  Everytime I go to the doctor I come back home with more and more meds that only make you feel worst.  Listen to your doctor but do not rely on a magic pill to do all the work for you.  You must change your diet and make healthy choices in order for this product to work more efficiently.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Will improve your health and quality of life. I smells terrible and tastes terrible but just mix it with your favorite juice, use a straw and swallow as fast as you can. I use V8 splash and room temp so I can drink it faster. I seldom get sick now in comparison to being sick with bronchitis, sinusitis and my IBS w/ chronic constipation was horrible. This product changed my life! Make it a daily habit!</li>
            <li> I love a cold glass of Green Vibrance to start my day! I feel assured I am getting all of the vitamins and probiotics my body needs.</li>
            <li> ordered due the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, but have not noticed much change in my sense of well being or overall health, I did finish one 60 day supply and have ordered another one to give the product a fair shake, but so far it seems in my case that this is another bottle of snake oil. I should mention that in the 60 days that I was taking this product I was NOT diagnosed with cancer or any serious diseases, so maybe this product prevents cancer, we may never know.</li>
            <li> Great probuct, that I have been using daily for several years and at a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li> It kick starts my day with abundant energy and the need to eat smaller portions. I get all the necessary ingredients in one scoop without the need to take other vitamins, enzymes and probiotics. I definitely recommend this product. This is my fourth container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why you are considering buying this product, but if you are looking for some regularity and consistency in your day to day private business this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable increase in my energy levels when I&#x27;ve drank this consistently. I regularly work 12-14 hour days and this is a key part of my nutritional plan.</li>
            <li> This supplement is the most important supplement that I use (that&#x27;s saying a lot because I take quite a few).  I use it in my smoothies along with spinach or kale, berries,  sweetener, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I start using Green Vibrance when I was put on a heavy dose of antibiotics for a sinus infection and bronchitis. I have seen many positive benefits. Increased energy (very helpful with 4 year old twins and a 6 year old), makes me feel as though my brain is awake without caffeine and it makes me want to eat healthier and get the appropriate water intake in each day. I&#x27;m not a fan of the greens taste so I mix it in with V8 Fusion and blend it with the festival blend (mango, papaya,strawberries,pineapple) from Costco.</li>
            <li> Anyone with cancer, use this in your diet!</li>
            <li> Is harder to use than expected.  You can really give a taste to whatever you put it in if not careful.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  It does help with appetite though.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now and just recently started purchasing it from Amazon.  Since I have been using it I have not been sick to any serious degree.  I was exposed to someone with a cold for a couple of hours and had to use the same keyboard.  I only had some slight sniffles with a very mild headache afterwards.  This year I was exposed to someone with a bad case of the flu and my body responded only with some slight weakness and I was a little more tired than usual.  I drank lots of water and got plenty of sleep and only had those systems for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not used to green drinks, the taste and consistency might be a bit off-putting.  Stay with it and you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I tried Athletic Greens because of Tim Ferris&#x27; book, &amp;#34;The Four Hour Body&amp;#34;.  While AG does taste pretty good, the cost and marketing scheme left me underwhelmed.  After reading a bunch of reviews, Green Vibrance seemed to be the next best choice,even though it receives low marks for taste.  I had been using Fiber On The Go (Citrus Puhch) packets as a prebiotic and decided to add one to my Green Vibrance drink.  Wow.  In a word, the combination tastes awesome.  Fiber on the go &amp;#34;is sweetened with natural Stevia extract.  It contains no sugar, and no aspartame or other artificial sweetener. As a natural prebiotic, the inulin contained in Fiber On The Go nourishes good bacteria in the digestive tract.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> SO FAR IT WORKS PERFECT 30 DAYS STRAIGHT. IT REMINDS ME THE REASON FOR THE SEASON JESUS CHRIST THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD, JOHN 3-16,17</li>
            <li> After 3 surgeries in a years time, I was so worn out.  I started taking the Green Vibrance and have noticed that I feel much better, having more energy.  I take supplements as well, but this product started to have a positive effect on my health in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I use Green Vibrance daily and have experienced a significant increase in energy and mental clarity. I&#x27;ve tried lots of powdered and chewable supplements over the years and Vibrant Health products are, in my opinion, the best. The size and price of the Family Size Green Vibrance is an amazing value for a single person like myself. Do yourself, and your body, a favor and give it a try. Toss a scoop of Green Vibrance in a blender with some fresh pineapple, raspberries, a small banana, and 4-5 oz. of orange juice or water. It&#x27;s delicious and quite filling. If you want to go a step higher, add a scoop of Rainbow Vibrance.</li>
            <li> since they added two new ingredients on the label, the taste is not as palatable. i prefer the original taste much more.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT MIX WELL WITH LIQUID. MY SON DOESNT LIKE THE TASTE. DOES NOT COMPARE TO NORMAL CHOC MILK AT ALL</li>
            <li> Lots of products out there in the powdered green drink market, but not all are equal. Definitely not the most expensive or the cheapest but the transparency of the company lends me trust them more than others. The taste isn&#x27;t doctored or artificial in any way, so those of you having a hard time with the chlorophyl taste of greens and other ingredients be warned. Take it with your favorite juice, a lil lime-aid with water and a scoop or two will do the trick. Only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t notice a huge amount of personal &amp;#34;vibrance&amp;#34;. I have faith that it&#x27;s doing good things for my body, but I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it.</li>
            <li> So, I have this undiagnosed  abdominal issue. I&#x27;ve seen so many doctors and been in so many emergency rooms...no one has any idea what causes the pain I experience. It happens in the middle of my monthly cycle, 15 days before my period. I have debilitating abdominal pains that&#x27;s leaves me in bed sobbing myself to sleep. Eating or drinking anything....including water causes peristaltic pain.  This green powder is the ONLY thing that allows me to eat or drink without pain. I take it everywhere I go during the week of pain. I. So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I did some reading and before everyone gets all out of control over the arsenic scare...here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;Arsenic is found everywhere on the Earth&#x27;s crust in fair sized amounts, comparable to other toxic metals, at about 5 ppm. In seawater, there are 2 to 5 ppb, which accounts for the fact that many seafoods have more arsenic than the FDA limits (2.6 ppm) allow: mollusks, crustacea – prawns and shrimp – fish, fish roe, cod liver oil, herring, even freshwater fish, and most sea animals and plants. This arsenic is not toxic.&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 types of arsenic, inorganic and organic. Organic arsenic is not toxic. Vibrant Health has always tested its products for the presence of arsenic and other heavy metals. Rather than an overall arsenic level test we have updated our test to determine levels of organic and inorganic arsenic separately.  By testing in this way we can keep levels of arsenic as low as possible, and make sure if it is present it’s primarily organic form.&lt;br /&gt;Do you really think that this product could be sold for this many years without being pulled from the shelf if it really had inorganic arsenic? People would be dropping dead like flies from arsenic poisoning.&lt;br /&gt;I live the stuff, been taking it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time eating enough green food.  This stuff works great in smoothies.  It doesn&#x27;t affect the flavours of the other ingredients yet gives me the greens I need.</li>
            <li> A Ladyfriend of mine talked me into trying this,and I am glad i did.I use it everyday in my Oatmeal at breakfast,sure is a great way to get alot of good things into your diet.</li>
            <li> Greens Vibrance is a green super food that helps balance acid in your system and does it at 30 to 60 calories each morning.   God Bless!</li>
            <li> I like its purpose but hate the taste.  I&#x27;m a lot more regular when I take it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and extremely reasonably priced.  Brand names of very similar products cost $60 for 1/2 the quantity of this one.  A friend at work turned me on to using Amazon to purchase and it&#x27;s an excellent value.  I love drinking this every morning.  The amount of ingredients and nutrients is phenomenal and it gives me a lot of energy.  I try in many ways to be very healthy and this is such a great additional to my lifestyle.  I tell all my friends they need to drink it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now by mixing it with a can of V-8 every morning along with red hot sauce, worcestershire sauce and a dash of prepared horseradish. Yum! So I&#x27;m not only getting a fair share of probotics I&#x27;m also getting my daily requirement of veggies. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I bought this item with high expectations after reading all the reviews...After a few weeks of use, I can&#x27;t say I feel any difference both short term (right after I take it) or long term(since I started taking it). I continue to take it, much as I do vitamins, on the good faith that it&#x27;s beneficial for me, even though I feel no difference physically.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this.  We mix it with tomato juice and love it!  It&#x27;s our healthy Bloody Mary. We  will reorder this!</li>
            <li> I wound up giving this to my dad... it tastes sooo bad its almost unbelievable.. it tastes like grass clippings.. my father likes it... he swears it makes him feel better.. but that&#x27;s only because he had a head injury and cant taste very well anymore.. i think that&#x27;s the only way he can  stomach it..</li>
            <li> I was a bit overwhelmed by the selection of this sort of product but I&#x27;m very, very happy with my choice.  I drink it with pineapple juice once a day and the taste is no barrier to all the goodness inside. I held my nose the first few times but after a week I started craving it, and now I&#x27;m hooked. Being gluten free with a sensitive stomach I find that whenever I eat something that doesn&#x27;t agree with me 2 glasses of this sorts me out faster than anything else.  I&#x27;m trying to get my senior-aged father to drink it!  No miracle for my sinus/allergies but I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Our entire family has been using this product for well over a year and we love it.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good, but we just mix it with flavored powders (like Crystal Light) and then it becomes tolerable.  It truly does boost your immune system.  I had one cold in the last 12 months and it only lasted a few days.  If you&#x27;re a family on the go and you don&#x27;t always get your full daily recommended dose of fruits and vegetables, this is the ideal way to get your daily dose.  It also has a ton of other beneficial nutrients.  My husband is a health nut and does all the research for me, and so far, this product is worth every penny. Do your research and you&#x27;ll come back to this product :)</li>
            <li> Having been a \\&quot;health-nut\\&quot; since I was 15 years old (I am 51 now) and having tried a lot of products, I must say that this one is on the very top of my list.  Like other reviewers have said, I too have not caught any flu or colds since starting my daily scoop of Green Vibrance.    It not only seems to make my immunity stronger, it also has improved the appearance of my skin and hair.  I put my scoop into my daily protein drink that has so many other ingredients, that the taste is not an issue with me.  This is some powerful nutrition.   I also agree with other reviewers that this stuff makes you very regular and that means that toxins do not stay in your body for very long.   The concentrated powerful nutrients are worth ever penny.  And by ordering it from Amazon, I saved about 30 dollars compared buying it at Whole Foods.    Very impressing stuff, I just ordered my second 25.4 oz canister.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah! a quality USA made superfood that says and does everything it claims.  The beauty is I can mix this into a sports drink or smoothie and bam! met two fruit and 3 veggie requirements for the day.  Many of the ingredients are organic and while the flavor on its own is not the best, if you mix it with flavored beverages or smoothies it is undistinquishable.  I am hooked and would not go a day without a scope.</li>
            <li> If u can&#x27;t cut up greens everyday for your juice or smoothie use this it gives u quick nutrious help</li>
            <li> I have been long time user of this product and have found it to keep my energy levels high.keeps my digestion going smooth and I know the probiotics ate keeping my immune system strong.&lt;br /&gt;Mixes well in my Vita Mix but needs to be mixed with something of flavor. I mix with Vega One Berry flavor by Sequel Naturals and get complete health in a shake for breakfast every morning !!!</li>
            <li> In MI, we recently accumulated 8-10 inches of snow.  It continuously snowed for 4 days (around new years) that resulted in that great pile of snow.  I had to shovel that snow myself, however I did it in stages. I went out there each day after the snowed had subsided and shoveled my front porch and part of the driveway.  The next day, I shoveled the sidewalk, and so on so on. Each day, I shoveled, I would drink the vibrant  health green vibrance prior to going out there. I kid you not, this drink gave me a tremendous amount of energy to do the task each day . . . and I am a 58 year old woman.  I truly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of the famous workout video brands.  It is much cheaper and is much better for you.  Stay away from the big name workout video stuff and use this. It might need some more protein if you are looking to bulk.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS INCREDIBLE. I LOVE IT. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS. I AM THANKFUL TO HAVE FOUND IT ON AMAZON.COM FOR A MUCH MORE inexpensive  PRICE THAN WERE I WAS PURCHASING IT BEFORE. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING SUCH AN AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I drink this product with orange juice in my bottle blender twice a day. I feel much more energetic and in less pain as I am gradually weaned off steroids for acerbated asthma.  The drink has also helped me sleep and improved my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> First time trying product.  Mixes reasonably well for a green powder and ok if you put it in juice.  Couldn&#x27;t handle it in water.</li>
            <li> Update/Edit: I am giving this 4 stars now instead of 2. We completed the product and have repurchased it. My entire family came down with a bug which caused the cramping that I felt in my earlier response, so I decided to update my review because it was unfair. Both my husband and I have seen an overall increase in energy, regularity, and we have noticed that our skin is no longer dry, we have experienced minor weight loss, and oddly, I am experiencing less sensitivity during tooth brushing. I am giving this  4/5 because of price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to supplement my vitamin regimen after reading all of the excellent reviews online. Since giving birth to my second child 20 months ago my energy level has been down. My husband is also a former football player, now a carpenter, who struggles with shoulder and knee pain. We have been on this supplement for a little over two weeks but we have not noticed any muscle pain relief or energy improvement. In fact, I have experienced cramping from supplementing this. Because this supplement is so pricey we are finishing it - However unless one of us sees some improvement we are unlikely to repurchase this product. I am giving this a 2 because it does help with regularity but many, more affordable products help as well.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for the immune system. My favorite way to ingest   is by way of a organic smoothie. Rice milk,banana,granola and sometimes blueberries  all organic. Keeps a person young and vibrant. 66 years old and still riding a bicycle  although a wee bit slower than usual. Got to keep it up no matter what.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different greens and this is has become my go-to favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a multi-vitamin component in it, which makes it have added value. I take this pretty much every morning I&#x27;m at work and it gives me a nice boost of energy before my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste:  I mix mine with Crystal Lite and have no complaints with it being chalky or leaving a terrible after taste in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At around $50 for the 60 day container it is expensive, but Amazon still seems to have the cheapest price.  I&#x27;ll likely buy again once I run out.  FYI my service size is two scoops per drink I make.</li>
            <li> After opening it, the product looked a little different from my last can. The taste is the same but the powder looked a bit lighter and much finer in constancy. I&#x27;m hoping I got what I actually paid for. Overall I am happy with the product I was just thrown off with the difference in appearance.</li>
            <li> I love it! I take it everyday with my organic protein powder.  Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> This is our new green juice...we used Living Fuel for years...even became distributors, but their response time and customer service became worse after the &#x27;head&#x27; of the family died...I like green vibrance better...I shake it up with some orange juice and some kefir...use a mason jar if you don&#x27;t have a store bought shaker.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I have much more stamina. Quit drinking coffee.  Lasting energy. DO NOT MIX WITH WATER. Mix with oj. Please do research, the more you do the more likely you with buy, and keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Great taste, no grit, mixes well--excellent product. I will definitely buy Vibrant Health Green Vibrance again! This is BY FAR the best green drink out there, IMHO.</li>
            <li> I love this green vibrance. When I drink it I feel a surge of energy and I love that I&#x27;m drinking something so incredibly healthy for my body!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So packed with nutrition that on (day 2) I found myself walking upright with great posture instead of slouched forward as I do normally due to lack of energy. This really surprised me as I was unaware of how much slouching I had been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was I walking taller and definitely felt more energy, a week later I found myself having a definite &amp;#34;spring to my step&amp;#34; in fact I was walking very briskly. Being a disabled person for whom walking is always &amp;#34;a task&amp;#34; and often a damn challenge . . this was AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also, felt an increase in the feeling of &amp;#34;General Well-Being&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t know how to define that except to say . . I was feeling a more positive attitude in general, a higher energy level and I can say truthfully that I FELT HEALTHIER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so satisfied with Vibrant Health that the ONLY reason I won&#x27;t continue to use it is because they company provides a similar supplement that seems to provide the same ingredients only with a BIG UPPAGE of Vitamin B12 and a HUGE amount of Protein and with the satisfaction level I have with this product, I am looking forward to trying the other one I described in the previous sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;green\\&quot; powders that taste like dirt, grass, or worse, and I&#x27;m now hooked on this product.  Not only does it not taste like you&#x27;re eating the grass off your lawn, but it has a pleasant consistency (not like some green powders which turn out lumpy or gooey).  I mix 3 scoops with a piece of fruit in some soy milk in my blender, and it&#x27;s a great addition to my day!  I&#x27;ve also noticed since I started using this product my energy level seems much higher too, and my stomach/digestive issues seem to have disappeared.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who is seeking a healthier lifestyle!</li>
            <li> just read the lab reports form consumerlab.com, this product has very high arsenic, including most toxic form (inorganic). thanks for the warning from another consumer here.I have been using this for a few years, I was shocked when I learned the significant arsenic contamination ! Until this issue is solved, I will no longer buy it.</li>
            <li> A regular staple now, I think Vibrant Health&#x27;s Green Vibrance is an amazing product and have ordered it several times (in increasing sizes!).  The lot we received is a very recent one so I felt assured that this order was fresh. I appreciate the new direction on the label to freeze this product after opening to maintain its freshness.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 9 years. Love it and love what it does for me. Phil D</li>
            <li> This is a very comprehensive vitamin and herbal powder, I absolutely love it.  I could tell a big difference in my energy level after taking it the first week.  Yes I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product pretty consistently for several years now.  It was recommended to me by a friend as I started experiencing menopausal symptoms.  I feel much better on the days I use it - more energy and better sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I like juicing but at times it&#x27;s to much work when I want to just drink and go.  Well this is what I get here just mix it and I&#x27;m out the door. Thew energy is with me all day and my workouts finish with a energy high.  try it and tell them Tony sent you</li>
            <li> This product is a great value.  More importantly, it really works.  I can feel it when I forget to take it.  I don’t think you can go wrong giving this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li> Whew! You can definately tell your eating/drinking greens or some sort of grass/hey/mixy mixy stuff.  The taste is not really that bad but its enough to warrant mixing it in with an omlet or if I choose to drink it i mix it with some grape juice to help it down. I feel a little bit more energy in my work day and a bit less hungry as the day moves along as well.</li>
            <li> best price.  Much more value for your money. I am very pleased withthe vibarnce and energy it provides. when i miss a few days i can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed this product for a year or more and was happy to find it readily available from this seller. Came fast. It is added to our smoothies and makes a great contribution to our dietary intake.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this purely looking for something that tastes like strawberry cheesecake ice cream then obviously just no.  Taste isn&#x27;t great but the product is fantastic.  Just look at the label and all the things your getting along with probiotics. Which brings up another point, I keep this in the freezer since it states on the packaging to keep it in fridge for good results and freezer for better results, I think in terms of the probiotics lasting longer, etc.  I have no problem with the cold powder from the freezer mixing with a glass of cool water, with a spoon only.  The product also recommends you take this about 30 minutes after a meal.  Again, ok taste but great stuff.  Very pleased, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Energy is up, detoxes me very well, and I am feeling healthier too!  Awesome stuff.  I just ordered another supply.  I mix white grape juice (.5 cup) with water (.5 cup) and the mixture, kills the tardiness taste, much better.</li>
            <li> Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is a great product, specially if you are not eating your veggies every day.  This way you get a large quantity of well-being in a scoopful.  Can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and love this stuff! First time buying and Im glad i did.. great in smoothies or juice... best in Mango juice so far. Some add this to their yogurt. Worth it to get it on amazon for cheaper than in the natural food stores!</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance originated when the founders of Vibrant Health declared jihad on all plant-kind. In the aftermath of their war against the flora of Planet Earth, they disposed of the millions of slain vegetables by creating a company to sell a wonderful drink made of rainbows, sunshine, and their slain foe: god-awful-tasting vegetables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drinking Green Vibrance is like eating 3 sacks of veggies, and then an additional 2 bags full of fruits and other plant life, without having to spend the 10 hours-a-day required to chew the disgusting stuff (drinking it via powder suspended in water distills that 10 hours into the worst 30 seconds of your day). After those 30 seconds though? You&#x27;ll feel like 600 million bucks. The girl and/or guy who just won Mega Millions will want to be as energetic, happy, and all-around awesome as you, but won&#x27;t know how. Because he won&#x27;t know you drink Green Vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More seriously--my junior year of college I had 8am classes and drank 5-hour energy every morning. I&#x27;d feel jittery and awful right after taking it, and then crash later in the afternoon. The following year I drank a scoop of this stuff every morning and evening (along with a small scoop of the Rainbow Vibrance they also sell), and I&#x27;m never turning back. I wasn&#x27;t sleepy, and wasn&#x27;t jacked-up, I was just awake and focused for 18 hours-a-day while drinking it. It gave me a really lucid energy-boost, and doesn&#x27;t make my heart or nervous system &#x27;splode like caffeine does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brb, taking my Green Vibrance for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Beware of Green Vibrance mustache (like a milk mustache, but unsettingly-green). After consuming the frothy beverage, the green carnage all over your face is a sure way to scare the pants off of any of your houseplants.</li>
            <li> I had a similar experience to another reviewer.  It caused extremely low blood sugar for me.  It wasn&#x27;t subtle at all, made me extremely shaky, mostly in the mornings.  I gave it a couple weeks to see if the effect wore off but it didn&#x27;t.  Had a couple times where I was stuck driving and literally felt like I was going to pass out.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem like this before and have felt like that only a couple times.  Guess it&#x27;s time for a DR checkup, might just be hypoglycemic.  Not trying to be dramatic, just sharing the negative effects it had on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives: aside for the morning shakes and low blood sugar, I definitely slept better and woke up WAY easier.  When I stopped taking I definitely feel a little like there&#x27;s a cloud overhead, not as easy to get going in the mornings.  I really wish I COULD take it because I think what people are saying here is correct.  I think it IS a great product but it&#x27;s not going to work for the few of us that are adversely affected by milk thistle.  For what it&#x27;s worth, the Trader Joe&#x27;s green powder has the same effect on me (tried it after GV), just not as pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great product, 1 star ONLY because I think people should be aware of this side effect (for some)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I started with the Rainbow Vibrance, trying to ease myself into it, and after a week, I noticed that I had more energy, so I ordered the Green Vibrance.  After a week on the two, I started exercising, getting up at 6 or 7 am to do it, and believe me, I am a sleepyhead.  I have so much energy with this, it is so noticeable, that when you don&#x27;t take it, you feel so draggy.  Also, I have horrible cramps, and my cycle was almost pleasant.  I love this green stuff, and the taste isn&#x27;t bad at all.  I eat vegetables on a regular basis, plus, I drink mine over a period of 30 minutes and I savor the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been about 5 months now, and I plan on taking this for the rest of my life.  My cycle has regulated, my cramps are completely gone, and between this and my Kangen water, I am almost never sick.  I have seen some amazing benefits from this, and I don&#x27;t understand why more people aren&#x27;t hooked.  I started off drinking this with just water, but for the last month, I have been putting this in a smoothie, and once I ate it with oatmeal (green oatmeal-not a great color).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you can ask for a review about a supplement. The only way I can review this product is when I have my Lipid profile done later this month.  When I see the HDL and LDL counts it will give me a better idea if the product is performing the way I expect it to.</li>
            <li> We love Green Vibrance!</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to brag about the wonderful benefits from this product. I mix this with the Almond Milk Mocha Ice Coffee. It&#x27;s delicious.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel any benefits from drinking this.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Green Vibrance for two weeks, and I love it!. It tastes good (to me). I feel more energetic, and my digestion seems to be improved. It is a great value for the canister size. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for years and have experienced positive results on a consistent basis. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff for you although like many other things that are good for you nutricionally the flavor sucks.</li>
            <li> We put this stuff in so many things.  I love getting the kids and I veggies and vitamins without thinking about it.  Usually get the best price for it here too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very aware of my health. I have Rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure and cholesterol problems. I hate taking medicines and so I try very hard to eat healthy, exercise and do what my Doctor says. After reading a wide variety of web reviews I bought the 15 package box of Green Vibrance By Vibrant Health. The taste is well - awful! But than I guess what do you expect with something that&#x27;s all natural and healthy. I followed my 15 pack box with the big 60 day supple, again all from here on Amazon. I figured I&#x27;d give it a chance and for those who hate the taste I&#x27;d say \\&quot;cowboy up\\&quot; and be an adult about it. For me the solution is to mix with Low Sodium V8 and add a few shots of Tabasco! It goes down pretty good than if you take a deep breath just chug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to doctor for all my blood work on Monday of this week, I&#x27;d been taking it daily now for over a month. The numbers that came back were stunning! Everything is within the normal range! My doctor told me that what ever I&#x27;m doing, just keep doing it! I have more energy and I feel totally great! Yeah, tastes bad - learn to love it! Health is more important than taste in my life. I&#x27;m 64 years old and feel like I&#x27;m 20. This has my highest recommendation! I know we&#x27;re all different and results for each of us will  be different but I&#x27;ve found my elixir of youth! Even my wife has mentioned to me how much energy and spirt I have. I plan on buying this for the rest of my life which should be about 46 more years:)</li>
            <li> smell bad and taste awful. I could not sleep well at night after having this product after dinner. quit it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is amazing!  I have more energy, clarity of thoughts, and general over all well being.  It also seems to help my hair grow faster.  There are so many good foods in this product; more then any other of the greens I have ever tried.  I know I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Wish I had stock in the company because I have turned on so many people to this product now....</li>
            <li> If you are a tea-person, you will like it because it tastes just like green tea. It&#x27;s good and you should try it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews here for Green Vibrance, I decided to try it. I am in&lt;br /&gt;the middle of the second two month can. The results, I had little to no energy before I&lt;br /&gt;tried it. After three months of daily use. I still have little to no energy.&lt;br /&gt;For me it is completely useless and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Lots of extra energy. we&#x27;ll continue using it. Wonderful in a smoothie . You can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there. Great product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. The price was right. It was shipped promply and was as advertised. I will continue to Be a customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but too expensive on this site. I buy it elsewhere and save $25. per jar</li>
            <li> And he use to suffer from anxiety, this has calmed him down and gave him more energy and he was able to stop his Coke/Pepsi soda addiction. This is freaking GREAT!!!!!! REMEMBER FREEZE OR REFRIGERATE!!!!!!!! I was looking into the Arsenic scandals this product has and I found that the usual Arsenic molecule found in water is way more acute in toxicity. Arsenic organically comes from the soil of the earth and is in our rice and fruits hence the high levels of arsenic but it isn&#x27;t acute in toxicity. Me my girlfriend and friend i recommended to are fine, and by the way all of our jars do NOT have the label saying something about child birth defects or cancer known to the state of california I guess the company took care of it, those arsenic scandals were back in july 2013 i believe, basically you should be fine and this is one HELL of an elixir. Best mixed with &amp;#34;Simply Orange&amp;#34; banana flavored orange juice, it isn&#x27;t from concentrate so it just adds nutrients to this drink.</li>
            <li> This product has a terrible taste but the health results have been amazing. My sinus drainage has stopped, my cough has stopped, my sleep has improved, I feel better, everything seems to be working better. I can highly recommend this product. I believe it will improve your immune system, as I always have a cold in winter, but since taking this stuff daily, I have not had a sniffle. It helps to take it dissolved in cold apple juice. But take it daily for thirty days and you will be very pleased at how your health improves.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my frozen papaya and my green vibrance in a blender with chia seeds and flax oil and coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Blended all up with any kind of juice I have and it is yummy. Sometimes I add honey. I have just been doing it for over a week and love it. I lost weight and feel great. I will see what happens after a month. I ordered three since my girlfriend Xiomara has been taken it for a while and told me about it.  Everyone should be on this since we don&#x27;t eat right as it is. Just hope they don&#x27;t bring up the price.</li>
            <li> A little back history about myself.  I am a 80&#x27;s born asian male.  All throughout my years in high school my face was smooth as a babies butt!  I had no issues with acne until I started college. I then slowly started breaking out with acne.  These were some of the worst years of my life.  My acne was beyond bad at one stage, my face was literally purple and red from the massive breakouts and scars.  I was socially mortified!  Not to mention I have tried numerous (name your beauty product) products in attempts to fix my face.  It would help temporarily but still I would have sporadic breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to June 2011 I am still having seldom breakouts even at this age!  My buddy introduces me to green vibrance.  He mixed a cup of cranberry juice with a scoop of green vibrance powder.  The taste wasn&#x27;t to bad.. (I actually enjoy drinking this every morning now.) He was telling me how there were so many nutritious greens and how healthy it was.  I was sold and purchased my own tub on amazon and have been taking it religiously every morning (30 mins) after breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this August 10th 2011.&lt;br /&gt;I and everyone I know has noticed that my face has cleared up significantly in the two months I have taken green vibrance.  So apparently I had some internal digestive issues which was causing my breakouts.  I believe green vibrance has &#x27;fixed&#x27; me!  I haven&#x27;t been this clear since, I can&#x27;t even remember!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to share my story!  Cheers to Green Vibrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 29th 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that I no longer have breakouts.  I began taking green vibrance daily starting from June 2011 till December 2011.  I am still taking scoops of this at seldom, not daily like before.  I feel great and face looks wonderful. I wish I had found out about green vibrance earlier in my life.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a very good product but it is expensive. I have found cheaper versions of this product from different companies but they all seem to add SILICA to their ingredient list. SILICA is just a type of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; and is mostly used to give weight to the product being sold. Until the competition stops using SILICA in their formulas I will continue to use Green Vibrance.</li>
            <li> Combined with a Spirulina supplement, I think it&#x27;s tops. Throw some omega-3 in the mix to boost it up to King level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have one serving of Spirulina tabs in the morning and then have a Green Vibrance shake after I eat lunch. I don&#x27;t mind the taste, which is acquired, so I just water it up and drink at leisure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will talk about how Green Vibrance is a cure all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I notice I generally feel better, and have more energy. I hardly ever have stomach or bowel probs when I have taken it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money, buy it and drink it, it&#x27;s a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are poor and like, &#x27;Man, I can&#x27;t really afford this&#x27;. It lasts 2 months and works out to cost less than 50 cents a day. If you can cut out some other excess, this will benefit you far more than a frap/cap/half caff or spending 50$ buying drinks for girls at a club.</li>
            <li> Great super foods selection. I bought it originally at The Vitamin Shoppe and it worked very good for me. It doesn&#x27;t taste great but it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad at all. I just put it in some water and that is it. You&#x27;ll see results right away, you feel better and your digestive system will thank you.</li>
            <li> Nothing else like it on the market. So much is packed into one scoop, just read the ingredients. If you can find another product that is better than buy it. As for the taste it is green tasting so I mix it with my smoothie in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for over 7 years now. I have been a natural health practitioner for 12 years and I fell in love with this product as soon as I was introduced to it. I haven&#x27;t felt better, stronger, healthier or more wise with any other consumable product. I know it sounds hoaky to say but it is the way I feel about it. The amount of healthy vitamins, herbs, and additives in this product are astounding. I joke with friends suggesting that I feel like a super hero when I drink my fresh juice smoothies addiing this powder to them. As a meal replacement or a supplement to a smaller meal I feel full, satisfied and physically well as I consciously ingest probiotics, amino acids, spirulina and gobs more amazing ingredients. I&#x27;m sure I sound over the top and ridiculous over my love for this product. However I really am grateful Vibrant Health continues to be consistent with value and integrity in the production of Green Vibrance Powder. I have never felt more confident in a healthcare product I consume on a regular basis. My nails are truly stronger, my hair seems healthier and thicker, I feel I also have a stronger constitution to defend communicable diseases and feel generally well over all. I typically blend this powder in my freshly juiced fruits, although I use commercially produced organic juices which are also just as good, and drink with my breakfast in replace of a meal or often over my morning cereal.  Initially it is a little odd to be drinking something so green and people less committed to natural health find that to be too much. The way I prepare it as a smoothie the flavors of the powder blend nicely and are pleasantly palatable. In complete honesty if someone is just transitioning to a green supplement powder they may want to try this product in tablet form. However the shift is fairly easy to make. Well, I guess I just can&#x27;t say enough good over this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after I used a 500g bottle of the Vitamineral Green (VG). I couldn&#x27;t afford to take 2 tablespoons of VG. Green Vibrance is more affordable, while not as fine a powder as VG, but seems to do the trick. I can take 2 tablespoons of this stuff, which I think balances out the filler that it has.  It tastes better than VG as well (more earthy than swampy).</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but look at all the organic ingredients you are getting! What I like about this product is that it tastes like blended green juice and all the ingredients are listed out. The owner of the company actually grantees it, and you are able to see the ingredient list and a full transparent disclosure with no proprietary secrecy. I just wish they would have something that would define what every ingredient is good for. I mix it with water or some juice.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too sure about this at first but it&#x27;s grown on me. I add a scoop to my morning shake and really like it. Is it a miraculous, energy producing cure-all? I doubt it but it tastes pretty good...sort of grassy and it can&#x27;t hurt. Come to think of it, I do seem to have a little more energy with this addition to my diet so who knows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties and am pretty average with few exceptions. One exception, though, is that I tend to experience the side-effects of medications rather severely. Therefore, I seldom take medications of any kind so I am sure there were none in my system to counter act with this product in a negative way. Nevertheless, after a couple of weeks, my navel itched non-stop. I checked myself: same soap, same bubble bath, same laundry detergents, etc. The only new thing in my life was this product. I stopped taking it and the navel stopped itching in less than 48 hours. Several months have passed with no more itching. It could just be me so that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. However, I thought I should mention my reaction in case someone else gets the same problem.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other \\&quot;Greens\\&quot; formulas, I came back to Vibrant Health. Its ingredients are the most well-rounded, it tastes fairly decent (for greens) and the price on Amazon is hands-down the best.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  I was introduced to it by a friend who was recommended its use to  help boost immunity and blood cell content.  I have used this product daily for the past 5 years.  I have improved my immunity against sinus infections and general sickness, my bowels are regulated, and have more consistent energy through out the day.  No more afternoon lulls, feeling so much better and as a result more active.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t buy this stuff to enjoy sipping it. On the instructions is recommends adding to your favorite beverage. I wouldn&#x27;t ruin something you like by associating it with the taste of this stuff. Just toss in a blender with a few ounces of water and chug it down with your nose closed while having a strong chaser at the ready. Does what you want it too...keeps you regular and energetic.</li>
            <li> Lets get this out of the way first, shall we. I am not sure what kind of picky eaters you all are to think this stuff is so nasty tasting, but I enjoy the flavor. It has been a few months on this now, and I absolutely do not want to live without it. I have even stopped drinking more then one cup of joe, and I even forget until the afternoon sometimes. This is huge, as I work nights, and have two young ones, and would often drink 4 cups just to get by on 3-5 hours sleep. I ran out for two days this week, and really noticed a difference. I was so excited when it arrived this morning. I am 39, and now feel 10 years younger. I used to have multiple white spots on all my nails, now there are none. My hair looks so much better, I hardly notice I am going bald anymore. Not sure if there is new growth, or just more luxurious and thick. Energy and mood is much improved. Buy it now!!!!</li>
            <li> I drink this every morning with juice it really helps give me energy. better than coffee no gidders. Try it!</li>
            <li> I follow a low carb way of eating so it is a challenge to get my vegetables in every day. I discovered this and have been using it for over a month now. I noticed a slight energy increase from the start and now can&#x27;t imagine beginning my day without it. I feel like I am doing something really good for myself! And the price is better than anything out there.</li>
            <li> I used this powder, but had to sweeten it with half a packet of stevia in an 8 ounce glass. I use orange juice and water and the stevia. I think it helps...my skin looks much healthier and it glows!  I would give it more stars except for the flavor.</li>
            <li> Have tried several other green products and did not like the taste or the fact they did not mix well in smoothies or water. This is good, clean flavor. Does not overpower other flavors, and gives me more energy than other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is so chocked full of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probiotics, that it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to find a more well-rounded, nutritious vitamin or supplement out there.  Its reviews are glowingly positive for good reason; this is one of the best supplements out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to boot, they have full disclosure on the label, telling you exactly what you&#x27;re getting.  No BS proprietary blends that mask the product&#x27;s true ingredients ratios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company has integrity and quality.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are both vegan and also take 6-7 vitamins a day on top of this blend.&lt;br /&gt;However, since adding it into our daily routine I feel WONDERFUL!  You are far far less hungry typically and I get a lot of energy not just after I drink it but throughout the day when I drink it consecutively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super awesome and I will be continuing this regiment!</li>
            <li> Recommended by both my GI Doctor and my Naturopath which helps with my Ulcerative Colitis. I usually mix it with water and tank it quickly as the taste is an acquired one.</li>
            <li> bad eating habits, processed foods, stress.....it all came down on my digestive system.  Doctors could find no physical reason for my IBS, sour stomach, unable to digest a large variety of foods, weight loss, bad skin, etc.  my sister recommended this.  i tried it, for a month, ran out and did not order again.  my many stomach woes continued.  i gave it another try a few months later.  my sister said, just give it a chance to work.  so i started again.  this time, i started blending it with smoothies of fresh fruit and or vegetables. i am now at month three.  i went from the misery of bouts of laxatives for constipation and binders for diarrhea for over a year, to actually a balanced digestive system, energy, a feeling of well being, better sleep, no mysterious headaches that were somehow connected to my stomach woes.  i thank God that i found this product.  it is well worth it&#x27;s price.  The wonderful line-up of the probiotics alone, is wonderful,  no empty promises here.  it really has helped bring good nutrition and a feeling of wellness to my physical body, which in turn has made me mentally more relaxed and focused.  i would only recommend to anyone, to make sure they are not allergic to any of it&#x27;s ingredients.</li>
            <li> I poached my husband&#x27;s low sodium V-8, poured 5 ounces into a glass, added a scoop of Green and stirred well. Tasted pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get an immediate boost of energy--may take a few days for me to get a lift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m chronologically 65, but mentally, feel 25.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful of feeling better--diagnosed with COPD and asthma a few months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to live a long time!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES THIS HEALTH PRODUCT. WE REALLY RECEIVED A BARGIN WITH THIS PURCHASE. I WISH THE MANUFACTURE EXPLAINED THWIR VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ON THE LABEL.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it has that greeny smell and could taste like the bottom of your mower IF you don&#x27;t counteract with mix ingredients.  I use protein powder, Greek yogurt, and peanut butter.  Looks like pond water but tastes just fine.  Choke it down if you must, the benefits are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing green drinks for over 25 years. A friend touted this as a decent solution. I am a health coach, so I like to try new things to recommend for clients. This stuff is horrible. It&#x27;s bitter. I couldn&#x27;t even mask it with fresh fruit blended in to the green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, because you have to add a lot of grape juice or other sweet bottled juices to maybe mask the awful flavor, its defeating just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I now order Amazing Grass for the listing of ingredients. A lot of people buy&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant Health ...everyone&#x27;s decision may be different.</li>
            <li> I mix this with white grape juice in the blender, pour it over ice and drink it fast. It does not taste good, particularly if you let it sit. Giving it four stars because I can get it down every day and it&#x27;s amazingly healthy. My husband had one sip and said no way.</li>
            <li> Complete Greens,&lt;br /&gt;Same as all the others in my opinion, but its good so dont be shy, purchase it. ..</li>
            <li> Pros:  Gluten-free, contains 73 certified organic foods and extracts, tastes good, easy to use.  Although I&#x27;ve used other green powders I feel this formula is an unbeatable product.  Cons: very expensive of late and  it doesn&#x27;t contain medicinal mushrooms.  Now, they&#x27;re offering all these different &#x27;versions&#x27; which I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about.  I also add liquid ginseng to the Green Vibrance in my morning routein. This has enabled me to quit coffee as advised my my herbalist.  Green Vibrance also produces a delicious meal-replacement bar</li>
            <li> I eat tons of fruits and vegetables, but figured an extra boost wouldn&#x27;t hurt. I received the package and was excited to start adding it to my daily nutrition. Especially after reading a lot of great reviews on here. It wasn&#x27;t until I was a few days into using it, that I looked closely at the label. On the side on my container was a little sticker placed by the ingredients that said &amp;#34;WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; Wow! Now I have a $50 container containing some chemical that is know to harm. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about six months now and really do believe that it has helped to increase my energy.</li>
            <li> First off, the taste is horrible... but thats not why you buy it!  This stuff is amazing.  The benefits I&#x27;ve experienced so far:&lt;br /&gt;- Improved digestion (so long IBS)&lt;br /&gt;- Improved skin tone (not so pale, tan better)&lt;br /&gt;- Improved energy  (no need for gallons of coffee everyday)&lt;br /&gt;- More relaxed, less anxiety/stress  (can cope with work more easily, sleep better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week or two I didnt feel anything- maybe I was detoxing.  I had a few aches and pains even.  Now, after several weeks of use I can honestly say that the above benefits are true.  I&#x27;m a believer! and think this product is definatley worth the money.  Please give it a try.  It really changed my life.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr Oz. One of his guest speakers was promoting the stuff. My understanding it is that it is chock full of vitamins and minerals you should get from eating your fruits and veggies as well as pre-biotics and pro-biotics. Cue any Activia commercial euphemistically talking about women who can&#x27;t poop.  The stuff helps with that.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few weeks ago. I received the latest version, 13.0. So if you read the reviewing saying that it is not, realize they are a bit dated and Amazon has updated their product. Even if you find that you receive the wrong item/version, ALWAYS contact support, they will set you right, either by sending you a replacement or refunding your money. I have always received a credit on my card for issues in the past within 3-4 days, sometimes sooner. Amazon offers the best deal on this product by far! If you don&#x27;t like green veggies there are a few ways to mask the taste. I notice a lot of people using fruit juices, but I go a different route. I drink mine with skim milk and chocolate cake batter protein powder. I also buy my protein powder (BSN Syntha 6) from Amazon as well. I mix it all in a glass (milk, protein powder, and G.V), but if you have a blender or a shaker, that would probably work even better. It mixes easily with a spoon. I don&#x27;t even taste the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; until I get to the bottom remnants in the glass, and even then it&#x27;s not bad. I would compare the flavor to the aftertaste you get with spinach or asparagus, and again, only when I get to the bottom of the glass, otherwise I taste just chocolate cake batter :) I like that they have all organic and natural ingredients. I wish I had more time to buy and eat healthy, but when I don&#x27;t this is a great start to my morning and gets me started on the right foot.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product , its a great product , after searching the internet  found that Amazon had the best price ,so I&#x27;ve been ordering from themon a regular basis  ....</li>
            <li> If u dont get a good amount of greens &amp; or probotics in your diet this product is for u.</li>
            <li> This was recommend to me though a friend and I am very happy he did. . . So far this is the only supplement to give a descent energy boost. .  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I am definitely one that will eat and drink products for the sole purpose of health, often ignoring taste, texture, etc. But this stuff is very difficult to choke down, it tastes awful. I am very surprised at the high star rating. Im sure this taste means high quality and quantity, but those benefits are useless if you don&#x27;t want to drink it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the holistic vet of my 13 years old lab recommended it to increase her health, and wellness during her golden years. Oh my God! after 2 weeks taking it, my dog looks like a 2 years old puppy! I mix it with her breakfast, and she loves the taste!&lt;br /&gt;After seeing her transformation, I decided to try it, and drink it every morning, with almond milk, whey protein and stevia. I make a \\&quot;green protein drink\\&quot; for breakfast, and let me tell you .. this stuff work!!! I feel so much energized, happier, and my foot pain almost vanished!&lt;br /&gt;My husband is taking it too, after seeing his girls glowing again! :) we are a green family &lt;3</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning in my smoothy. It&#x27; is an excellent source of greens and a great way to get them for those of us on the go.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to really say about this product. I did a little research after being recommended Green Vibrance only to find out that it is not a Vegan friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the probiotics come from a human cadaver.&lt;br /&gt;I had emailed the company to confirm this and I never received a response.&lt;br /&gt;Not a company I would trust.&lt;br /&gt;I have taken my business to Healthforce Vitamineral Green..it&#x27;s 100% vegan and run by people who care</li>
            <li> Easy way to get those veggies in. I&#x27;d totally recommend to family and friends. Tastes exactly like what&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I put a scoop into my proten shake every morning. Great Price on Amazon. I skipped about 2 months of use and could tell a great difference in my energy level and balance.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome about a year ago through a heart rate variability test and blood work. The blood test results showed a low white blood cell count and high AST/ALT levels. Ever since I began a daily regiment of Green Vibrance, my WBC count and liver enzyme levels have improved incrementally.  Furthermore, nothing else has changed in my daily routine besides the addition of Green Vibrance to my diet. The taste is truly awful, but this should not be recognized as food, rather, it should be considered medication.</li>
            <li> I used to mix this in my morning shake, but then after reading about taking greens on an empty stomach for maximum absorption, I switched to taking it first thing in the morning with just water. This plus Amazing Grass Wheatgrass is a powerful punch to get the day started. It gives me great energy, quality movements in the restroom, and makes me more productive. Plus, once you become accustomed to the taste, my body craves it. It&#x27;s not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, literally changed my health.  I mix it in on a smoothie every morning.  Without it I think I would be in seriously bad shape.  I don&#x27;t eat horribly but I don&#x27;t think I get enough veggies.  Even if you do eat healthy our foods are depleted of the vitamins and minerals and other micro nutrients we need.  Trust me. take this stuff every day for a week and see how it changes your appearance, (my skin looks much healthier, it got rid of some eczema around my nose) and I feel much better.  I don&#x27;t work for the company nor did I get paid for this.  It really is just a great product.  Finally science and technology do actually work to make our lives better.  I&#x27;m still waiting for the extra time in my day having a cell phone and email was supposed to bring.</li>
            <li> This is the best green powder on the market right now for the price. Maximum Vibrance is even better but servings sizes are significantly less for the same size</li>
            <li> I purchased this product recently at Sprouts my local health food shop. After finishing nearly the whole bottle I noticed a small label on the side. It said the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; Warning, this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely worried I searched on Google and found a law suit against the company claiming many of the products contained dangerous levels of lead! Another search bought me up with an article on prevention.com claiming the product contains arsenic twice above the acceptable safe levels!  (heres the link: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the company is forced by the State of California to print a label on this product to warn consumers of toxic chemicals within. The solution, buy products that are approved by the ConsumerLab which tests these products for presence of toxic chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please vote this review up to warn other people about the danger of this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope other people don&#x27;t have to feel the extreme disappointment I felt at forking out such a high price for lead and arsenic...</li>
            <li> Everything you need for a fraction of the price.  GNC has products and Isagenix is out there too but this has just as much if not more for a fraction of the price.  Mixed with water, a little yogurt and some frozen berries and this taste great!</li>
            <li> I have used for 3 weeks now and still notice a difference in my energy everyday. I no longer have that 2:30 feeling. I am sure it is doing more for me that I ever will know.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product through a video by David Wilcock and I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been on medication to keep me awake throughout the day due a &#x27;medical mistake&#x27; years ago.  With this I feel better and I stay awake with a lower dose of the medication.  **All if this was done with doctor supervision**  Consult YOUR doctor first!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Yes it looks disgusting when you mix it but it tastes like whatever you are mixing it with. I use either apple juice or apple/ pomegranate juice and I hardly notice a change in flavor. Just a little grainy. Love this. Will be buying it again when I&#x27;m out..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself a health nut, but I do like to take supplements that I know will increase my energy and well being.  Like most smart shoppers, I was a bit skeptical because let&#x27;s admit it, as a supplement this stuff is pretty pricey. It&#x27;s almost a dollar a day. The big question is, is it worth it?  You bet it is!  I take one scoop every morning with 6 ounces of water and I definitely notice a difference in my energy levels, my hair, my skin and even a film on my lower teeth is now gone!  I encourage everybody to take the supplement!  It doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either.  I take it with water straight up, but I&#x27;ve heard of many people mixing it in orange juice and other beverages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I fully investigated the ingredients and nutritional profile before I purchased this product. It&#x27;s a very high-quality product with only the best ingredients. It&#x27;s a great way to get more nutrition and greens in your diet.</li>
            <li> LOVE Green Vibrance!&lt;br /&gt;First off I have an autoimmune condition that makes my joints swell. I have been on a light dose of a drug called Plaquenil for about 4 years now. On top of this I am a long time sufferer of recurrent UTI&#x27;s. I do everything to prevent them yet I am always plagued. I use scent free soap, pee after sex, take a cranberry supplement, eat tons of yogurt, drink tons of water, the doctor has even prescribed a prophylactic antibiotic to take after sex. Which by the way I hate doing because it seems a little extreme. Anyway all this pill popping is just... its really exhausting.&lt;br /&gt;SO.... My husband comes back from a trip to whole foods with this Green Vibrance... Looks, smells, and tastes.. funky... but with OJ its tolerable if not good... And what do you know?????? OMG The UTI&#x27;s Stop! JOY JOY JOY! One scoop every morning with some OJ... Not only is it really good for you and packed with vitamins.... I no longer get UTI&#x27;s Thank you Green Vibrance! I will ALWAYS have a jar of this in my fridge! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was recommended to me by my personal vegan trainer.  She loves it! She doesn&#x27;t put anything in her body unless it&#x27;s organic!  I was diagnosed with bladder cancer on August 8th. I changed my entire program and went from eating meat to totally vegan and only drinking green drinks. I have been using this product and making smoothies with it for 2 months and I have lost 30 pounds! On Sept 24th after a biopsy was taken I found out that I am cancer free! Thanks be to God!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you might find the taste not as good as others.  If that is the case, try my favorite recipes that will most certainly turn heads at your next party or event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a blender:&lt;br /&gt;1 scoop of Green Vibrance, 1 batch of Organic Kale, 1 dash of Stevia, 1 dash of Sea Salt, 2 Organic Lemons (peeled), 2 Organic Green Apples, 1 thumb size chunk of Ginger root (peeled), slight dash of Cayenne Pepper, Mountain Spring Water or best Aqua Hydrate 9pH water, blend - serves 6. Absolutely delicious! You will thank me later.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakfast recipe:&lt;br /&gt;1 scoop of Green Vibrance, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Flax Milk, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Coconut Milk, 1 baby Coconut water &amp; meat (Use hatchet to get the coconut open), 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Almond Milk, 1 Chunk of Aloe Vera Leaf, 3 Tablespoons of: Cinnamon &amp; Pumpkin Spice, 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 tablespoons of Chia Seeds, dash of Sea Salt &amp; Stevia and 1 cup of Mountain Spring Water or more depending on the size of your blender.

            <li> I have two doctors who recommended that I dring a Green Vegetabel drink every day.  I have Celiacs. As a result, I don&#x27;t digest and absorb nutrients as I should.  With this vegetable dring I get many nutrients in a form that can bypass the digestive system and go straight into my blood stream.  My problem was, I am deathly allergic to BEETS.  And, almost all the vegetable drinks add beets.  I have ended up in the emergency room as a result of ingesting one of them.  \\&quot;Vitality Super Greens\\&quot; do not contain beets.  What a blessing to find this wonderful product.  I also need lots of probiotics.  I make kefir from fresh raw milk and I know it has many probiotics, as does all ferminted foods.  This is one of the things that first attracted me to Vitality Super Greens, the vegetables are ferminted.  I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it.</li>
            <li> Pros:  I quit taking my multivitamin because this covers basically everything it had. I quit taking my probiotic supplements because this covers everything they had, and then some! And, I quit taking my high dose vitamin D supplement, as well as various other supplements, because this covers them too.  It definitely gives you energy, both short-term (immediately after swallowing it) and long-term (I don&#x27;t get as tired). It helps with regular bowel movements and is good for constipation. It doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as I thought, it&#x27;s actually more bearable than my protein shakes, and tastes just fine in orange juice.  All in all, this will actually save me a lot of money, and I know it&#x27;s covering way more bases than I was before even with a bunch of my individual supplements. Can&#x27;t go wrong with that 4 page nutrition ingredient list! :)    Cons:  Allergies. Speaking of that 4 page ingredient list... I had a slight allergic reaction the first few times I took it. I&#x27;m rarely allergic to anything, but it&#x27;s not that surprising that I did have slight flushing and itchiness considering the amount of unique ingredients in it, many of which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve never ingested before. I slightly lowered my dosage and it doesn&#x27;t do that anymore.    Probiotics: The amounts of probiotics listed are \\&quot;at date of manufacture\\&quot; which does NOT necessarily mean \\&quot;at date of ingestion\\&quot;. Refrigerate this product immediately to prevent any further loss of included probiotic cultures.    Anticoagulant effects: You need to be aware of the many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients in this product, as well as the one big coagulant. I remember reading one review of a man who got dangerously low blood pressure after taking this. He was taking Warfarin, a blood-thinning medication. I would NOT use this product if you take Warfarin. There are too many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients that would enhance Warfarin, and possibly make your blood pressure dangerously low, AND there is 150% DV of Vitamin K in a normal dose, which very seriously conflicts with Warfarin as well as most all blood-thinners. If you aren&#x27;t taking medication for blood pressure I wouldn&#x27;t worry about it too much, though.    Interactions: Below is a list of ingredients in this product which actually conflict which each other (I entered all ingredients at [...] to get this list). I&#x27;m only posting the \\&quot;significant interactions\\&quot; because there are just too many that aren&#x27;t a big deal.  13 Significant Interactions Found:  Alfalfa (sprout powder 440mg, juice powder 570mg) + Ginger (root powder 20 mg): Significant - Monitor Closely.

            <li> I&#x27;ve included Green Vibrance in my diet for over 10 years.  It provides all the greens PLUS (just read the label to see all the other good-for-you ingredients are in there).  I mostly put it in breakfast smoothies, sprinkle it on greek yoghurt, or sometimes just mix it in a glass of water (it&#x27;s not about the taste here, just the benefit, tastes like you&#x27;d think powdered greens would).</li>
            <li> How many times have you read an article about the health benefits of a particular vegetable, herb, root, like say, astragalus and thought thats nice but how am I supposed to find let alone eat all of these great things!&lt;br /&gt;Well Green Vibrance finds ALL of these magical plants and roots from all over the world and grinds them up and all I have to do is put a scoop into a glass each day to benefit from all their health enhancing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can &amp;#34;Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food&amp;#34; by using Green Vibrance</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it with my Body and Brain Fitness clients as part of a rejuvenation drink we have developed.</li>
            <li> This is the best green powder I have ever had. I enjoy it in smoothies, juices, and even with just water and fresh lemon. I feel great drinking this.</li>
            <li> I am a TOTAL wimp when it comes to green drinks.  I want the benefits, but I have choked and gagged and spit out and cussed at every single one I tried.  Then last spring I was totally committed to doing a cleanse so I really wanted to find one I could tolerate.  I read all the reviews on this one and it seemed like the best one to take a chance on, but was still skeptical.  I&#x27;m glad I believed them.  It&#x27;s definitely the least horrible of any on the market.  I also tried the chocolate version, which I really like but I wouldn&#x27;t want that one every day.  I am definitely making concoctions like smoothies with it, not just mixing with water or juice so I cannot attest to the taste of it that way, but in a smoothie, I can definitely pull this one off.  The one caution is that if you mix in a lot of frozen fruit, you definitely raise the sugar content quickly, and in hard-core healthy mode that can sort of backfire, but if you are like me and just looking for a way to get some greens down the pipe (and stay down), I think this is the best bet.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I placed my order on a Monday and received it on a Tuesday. If you can&#x27;t stand the taste of the drink alone mix it with a sweet juice. I love this stuff. Great buy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many green-powders out there - hard to know which one to try. Good value; nice flavor and consistency, blends well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Just received my order and it is the 12.0 version.  Although I have just opened my order, I&#x27;m happy and confident that I made a smart purchase for my health. Before ordering, I picked up a smaller supply from my local healthfood store to test it and as a comparison to what I was previously using. I used to take Vitamineral Green as my daily nutrition supplement but had to stop because of cost and a change in my employment situation.  I can honestly say that I feel confident of getting the same benefit from this AND getting a two month supply for less than the cost of a one month supply of VM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of most supplements and the over the top claims made in many of them. So when my wife came home from the health food store one day with this in the shopping bag, I was upset. Fifty dollars down the drain. However, last week I had a severe burning pain in my stomach from something I ate. Too much acid. I drank some of this, figuring it was alkaline and it would help counter the acid. Not only did it take the pain away, I immediately had more energy. Also, it has a neutral taste that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> The probiotics in this product make it incredibly useful to my sluggish gut. I love the taste too, very fresh and green--slightly addictive! Especially in the spring here in the northeast when my body is deficient in green stuff...Thanks!</li>
            <li> Has such a nasty taste. If the flavor is improved maybe it will work .  I did not take it long enough to see if it was any good.</li>
            <li> For the last 2 years I have suffered tremendously from airborne allergies such as dust, pollen, and vog, and the allergies have constantly triggered a downfall of my immune system. Every few days I came down with the cold, which always took a few days to rid itself. I tried exercise, quitting a job to get more sleep, teas, ecchinacea, resveratrol, colloidal silver, astaxanthin, umcka, zinc, and lots of other supplements to boost my immune system, and they worked at first but my body eventually grew a tolerance to most and they were very expensive to purchase every month. I tried juicing, but the juices I made were too hard on my digestive system and made me very nauseus, not to mention they were a lot of work to make. I tried making green smoothies, but they were also hard on my stomach, and I just couldn&#x27;t possibly make them everyday with my work schedule. So finally after reading lots of reviews on different powders I chose Greens Vibrance because of its nutritious and adaptogenic contents, and to mask the chalky flavor I also bought a bottle of Stevia. I drink one scoop a day in milk and add a few drops of stevia, and now I can truthfully say that after just a few days I already feel healthier. The drink is easy to make, it now has some sweetness, and its incredibly convenient for me to take with me to work. As a supplement I also bought a bottle of Pure Essence labs One &#x27;n&#x27; Only women&#x27;s Formula and they seem to work well together. My diet is not very healthy and these make up for my daily nutritional deficiencies. It might seem expensive, but Green Vibrance only averages to about $1 a day, which is definitely worth it for me to feel healthy and energetic. Try blending it with a banana! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommend. I would recommend this product to everyone. This product came highly recommend. I would remmend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nutritionist nor a naturopath so what do I know but I see both and this product comes highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is ok in juice or fruit drink. The probiotics are high and it&#x27;s  all organic.&lt;br /&gt;If you have irritable bowel or any intestinal disorder this product may not be appropriate but on the other hand it can help a sluggish bowl.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great product jam packed with great nutrition, but it is organic.  If you are looking for a great taste, get ready for a disappointment. This stuff tastes awful. It is best mixed with your favorite juice or sports drink. If I&#x27;m in a pinch, I will mix it with water but it&#x27;s pretty yucky. However, don&#x27;t let that detour you, the benefits are great. Stabilized my blood sugar and seems to have helped my high blood pressure too. I highly recommend this product. You&#x27;ll pay way more in the stores too, so ordering here is a must.</li>
            <li> I drink it because of all the health benefits, but the taste is not that great, but I will continue&lt;br /&gt;to drink it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for the past 3 months to replace my usual multivitamin.  I was really excited because it&#x27;s loaded with nutrients and probiotics.  However, I got sick with the flu a month after I started taking it and just as I was getting over the flu, I got hit again with a bad cold a couple weeks later.  I am very disappointed, especially because it&#x27;s so expensive.  I was expecting great things from it that didn&#x27;t pan out.</li>
            <li> Green has helped me in almost every way I can think of. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this and recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I BEEN PURCHASING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR QUITE SOME TIME.LOADED WITH HEALTHY NUTRIENTS AND PROBIOTICS I NOTICE ENERGY. STAMINA LEVELS IN TIME WERE MUCH BETTER.I DO RECOMMEND TOO FRIENDS AND FAMILY KIND OF PRICEY BUT WORTH EVERY CENT WHEN IT COMES TOO OUR HEALTH .WELL LETS JUST SAY IT IS PRICELESS</li>
            <li> Been buying it for years. Love the subscribe and save option for this. I highly recommend this product. Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most complete green powders I have seen and in my opinion does not have a bad taste.  Also Amazon seems to offer the best price.</li>
            <li> i buy this for my ninety year old grandmother who refuses to get a computer. well she looks 60 is at the gym doing step aerobics three days a week. yoga at home at least five days a week. drives her car. cleans the house. she swears by it&#x27;s positive effects. who am i to question it. go grandma</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about 3 weeks. My GI symptoms are improved. I do not have to take stool softener any more. But I developed gradually insomnia. It is getting worse and worse. I had to take sleeping pills. I am not sure if it is from the product, but it is the only thing that was introduced in my life. I will stop taking it for a couple of week to see what happens. Please share with me if anyone has similar experience,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> After having my third child I was readmitted to the hospital and was in septic shock. My heart and kidneys were very close to shutting down as I had a strep A infection in my blood. It took me 6 days in the hospital and 10 days after discharge on a regimen of three different antibiotics to clear the infection. My body was ravaged by child birth, the infection and the enormous amount of antibiotics. For 11 months after my discharge I had no energy and was unable to care for and do things with my children. It was a very depressing time for me as all I ever wanted to do was be a mom. After taking green vibrance a couple of times I felt like my old self and as I continued taking it I felt better than I have ever felt. I had energy and an enthusiasm for life!!! I still take green vibrance today and swear by it. Stop reading and order NOW!!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff!!  I feel great when i am taking this and it can heip me with my cravings.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item several times.  It is a food supplement that helps our digestive system. The product was received timely.</li>
            <li> i put this in a smoothie everyday and it adds a level of energy and feeling good that is priceless.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good. I cannot say that I have lost weight on it or had a ton more energy, but I certainly have felt good since starting it two weeks ago. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter took this and it helped with her restless leg syndrome .  Energizing drink too.  I&#x27;ll order again in the winter .</li>
            <li> Excellent supplement and the taste is not bad just gritty. This contains the extra nutrients you need on a daily basis. I mix it with very cold water.</li>
            <li> A dear friend who is battling pancreatic cancer told us about Green Vibrance and it has been a  part of our daily supplement for close to a year.  A noticeable improvement in my nails and hair and overall health.  Several friends and relatives are also using it .</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference every day! I highly recommend this product. I use this product daily and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s rather expensive, I find the ingredients it has second to none so I&#x27;m willing to pay more for it. Great stuff, I take it daily.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after becoming sick with pneumonia about a year and a half ago.  It works so well and I have not been sick since!  My husband has been using it for over two years and hasn&#x27;t been sick at all since using it.  It is awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to eay before I exercise so I drink this in the morning before I workout. It gives me great energy and the Probiotics and a plus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does, I just know that I feel better and feel worse when I don&#x27;t take it, I also had a 3 month long headache that went away after 3 days on Green Vibrance.  Been drinking it for 18 months.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now and I must say that it&#x27;s changed my life! The taste takes a bit of getting used to, but I mix it with either apple juice or orange juice and it works well. Even my kids drink it! It has helped me get healthier and lose weight. I really appreciate this product!</li>
            <li> We drink this everyday with orange juice and love it !  It is green and gives you vibrance ! thanks</li>
            <li> I read that people don&#x27;t like the taste, I wanted a meal replacement so I Mix it with garden of life Raw Organic Meal-Chocolate. Taste great with both haven&#x27;t tried by it self, I usually have it for a quick snack-i&#x27;m big and wanted better nutrients. It came well packed in three days by Fed-ex (I live on Maui)-super quick delivery. I will buy again. I feel more energetic all day when I have it as my breakfast. I try to eat at least 5 cups of veggies a day-usually 5-7 cups, 7 being the optimal. Great ingredients, the best in its class-by my limited research. There were some negative things about this product  I found however I weighed the cons and the benefits so far anyway out way the cons. Just about a week and a half. I&#x27;ll update later after its empty.</li>
            <li> I have used Green Vibrance for about 18 months, its a great way to get total greens everyday. I am a person who eats more fruit than green leafy veggies, so this is my way to get all those necessary vitamins and minerals.</li>
            <li> I found that a combination of prune juice and orange juice with calcium stands up to the strong taste of Green Vibrance.  If there&#x27;s any residue left in the cup, I add water and get the last of it down.  I was recently away on a short vacation and didn&#x27;t take my GV for five days.  I noticed the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> We just love this supplement....All in one....We take it in our juice and really like it. Has all the vitamins and  minerals you will ever need in a day. Always up to dat on the newest version.  Cheapest price I found. Fast shipping with Prime.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year. If I take it everyday, my shoulders and neck do not have the aches and pains that I feel when I skip a few days. Been a nurse for over 20 years and my shoulders really ache when I do not take this daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking Green Vibrance every day now for well over a year and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. I feel great and it works wonders on the digestive system. On the other hand I&#x27;ve never tasted anything nastier, even when I&#x27;ve tried to mask the taste with a variety of juices and other concoctions. Plus I don&#x27;t have time to make some elaborate shake very morning. My solution? Mix one scoop of the powder with 4 oz. cold water, HOLD MY BREATH, drink it up. This takes only 30 seconds and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> These greens are an excellent way to supplement your diet and improve your health. The price is much better than any I have found anywhere. I take these everyday and will for the rest on my life!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about a year and I love it-  it mixes well with whey protein and fruit and does not have that grassy taste that some green powders have.  Great ingredients, great price and excellent service!</li>
            <li> every morning I have this in my smoothie and I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the effects of Green Vibrance.  I feel energized and also feel that my immune system is much stronger.  The only downfall according to my daughter who also takes it, is the taste.  It is a bit &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; but I put it in a blender bottle &amp; shake it up well.  I really don&#x27;t mind the taste at all.</li>
            <li> I was at Sprouts and had $300 dollars worth of supplements in my basket.  The store clerk noticed and suggested I put some of the supplements back and use Green Vibrance instead.  I did so and started making smoothies with the Green Vibrance.  It is good stuff!  I haven&#x27;t had a cold or flu in a few years and feel great on this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t taste good bur I camouflouge it with fresh fruit in a smoothie.  I am sold on the produce.  It is expensive buying at a retail store; much better deals on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I have gained so much more energy.  I like mixing it with V8 splash taste is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not for sure but feel like I&#x27;m getting the nutrition needs out of this product. Feel its a good product line and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have been adding this to my green smoothies for awhile now. Great product, arrived fast in good condition. I will buy this again</li>
            <li> Love Green Vibrance!! Don&#x27;t expect it to taste good though as I usually have to choke it down. I tried adding to smoothies but, the only one that hid some of the flavor was a bahini smoothie which is mainly bananas. I also mix it in orange juice. Gives me tons of energy! You can find the Bahini recipe online, Here&#x27;s the Bahini recipe I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 bananas&lt;br /&gt;2-3 TB Tahini&lt;br /&gt;2 TB coconut butter or manna&lt;br /&gt;2 TB Raw honey&lt;br /&gt;Dash salt&lt;br /&gt;TB or so of Green Vibrance&lt;br /&gt;1 cup ice&lt;br /&gt;add water - if you want a thicker smoothie, add less water - you choose&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great greens with SO many excellent things in it. It&#x27;s really a great, complete green. Very easy to blend into smoothies, and easy to drink...not like some greens.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.  I HAD CUT BACK FORM USING IT EVERY DAY TO ONLY 3 TIMES A WEEK WHEN I WENT TO THE HEALTH CLUB. WHEN I WENT BACK TO USING IT 7 DAYS A WEEK I COULD DEFINITELY SAY I FELT BETTER.</li>
            <li> i like it. helps me poop more regularly and i feel more energetic.  it&#x27;s got all kinds of goodies in it.  wish they could ship and store it cold though so you know the little probiotics in it aren&#x27;t&#x27; dying</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what this tastes like mixed into water and only water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snack on roasted seaweed all the time and love it so the taste doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. If it did, I was prepared to try the many recipes others were suggesting below. I actually still am curious to try it with the strawberry and banana, til then roasted seaweed in liquid form it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 5th day drinking it. I have yet to feel a HUGE boost of energy BUT I&#x27;m feeling it little by little as I hear people weren&#x27;t experiencing that until about a full week or two. Other than that, so far so good!!! ^.^</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference with overall energy levels approximately a week after starting this product. The taste as stated in other reviews is definitely green and plant like. I mix it with 8 ounces of almond milk and it gets easier as you get used to it. There again you aren&#x27;t drinking it for taste or pleasure.</li>
            <li> For several years I have had no energy . I spent most of my time on the couch. I decided to b try this product and have been using it for several months now and I have the energy to do what ever I want im on the go from the time inget up untill ingo to bed. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I heard of this product from a friend and tried it. Its taste isn&#x27;t bad and Amazon has the best price I could find. Hope this vender stays on Amazon and keeps the great price for this product. My sister tried it also and said it helps with her energy levels throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is a great supplement to a healthy lifestyle. It helps with digestive issues and adds a large variety of nutrients. The taste is less than desirable but its easy to mix and shoot quickly. Great product</li>
            <li> If we take no other supplements, we still take this.  It is full of good things for the body.  This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with the product.  My energy level has increased and I will consider purchasing another bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love Green Vibrance. I&#x27;m an acupuncturist and I have tried several green drinks. Most of them taste like grass and is very hard to mix. I feel a burst of energy after I drink this, I also add some protein mix and black strap molosses with distilled water. I recomend green vibrance to all my patients, and they love it as well. Good price at Amazon.. I get the 60 day supply..</li>
            <li> I have serious GERD and am on multiple medications. Since adding Vibrant Green to my daily regimen, my GERD symptoms are more under control and I really notice the difference if I miss a day.</li>
            <li> I was on this product for a long time and felt great- well, I got on a liquid multivitamin and felt I didn&#x27;t need this product anymore. I got a kidney stone(If you&#x27;ve never had one, pray you never do), and then I got a cold.&lt;br /&gt;So, is this coincidence?? I think not. I am getting back on and STAYING on this product. The taste really isn&#x27;t that bad- but even if you think it is, it&#x27;s better than being in the hospital isn&#x27;t it??&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other green products that hide behind \\&quot;propietary blends\\&quot; so you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting, and really, nothing has come close to green vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just mad at myself for being so stupid as to getting off this product when it was working so well for me. You know the old saying, \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t try to fix it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you have a PERFECT diet, never ever eat junk or fast food, and drink only highly purified water and lots of it, you need this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And if you have stomach issues, like I do, this product will be a godsend to you.&lt;br /&gt;I know there are some people who will knock this product because of the taste, but to be honest- I have a VERY sensitive stomach, and I just mix this in cranberry juice, and I have no issues. It&#x27;s hard to believe there are people out there who are even more sensitive to taste than I am, but I guess there are.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve tried other green drinks, and believe me, NONE of them taste like chocolate milkshakes.&lt;br /&gt;I would even go so far as to say that if you could only afford one product, this would be it as it has so many things that are good for your body.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because it is far more affordable and comparable to the other major Greens supplement out there. The price is great, the ingredients are high quality, the vitamins/minerals/ingredients are great and in good numbers, but the awful taste leads to me staring at the huge jar and praying that it will eat itself and disappear off my countertop so I don&#x27;t have to take it or feel guilty for letting it go to waste. After hearing that the taste was sub-par, I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m a man, I&#x27;ve eaten dozens of gross things, surely I could choke this down before it does me in,\\&quot; but I was wroooooong. I set up a well-mixed serving according to the directions and started drinking... I&#x27;m not 100% sure what happened next, but it ended up with me coughing, hacking, and dry-heaving at the sink and the rest of the drink going down the drain. I tried milk and juice and it made me consider throwing out the milk and juice so I wouldn&#x27;t consider using it in milk or juice again. I stopped taking it after a week of morning self-flagellation, and I finally threw the canister away last week to save myself from further guilt-tripping for purchasing and not using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry Vibrant Health Green Vibrance, but honestly, the price of the other Greens supplements out there completely justifies the higher prices they charge because I can take it every morning and actually enjoy the taste without ending up coughing and dry-heaving the taste of dirt on dirt on grass from my mouth. I will eat crickets, mealworms, and/or grasshoppers much sooner than I will ever try Vibrant Health again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- Every vitamin and mineral you&#x27;d ever need in reasonable quantities (not overdoing it)&lt;br /&gt;- They list out every ingredient and amount (no \\&quot;proprietary blends\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- The taste (in water, milk, or juice) makes it nearly impossible to take.&lt;br /&gt;- The taste is awful.&lt;br /&gt;- The taste is like dirt. Rolled in a big pile of dirt. Then sprinkled with grass on top.&lt;br /&gt;- Dear heavenly beings, the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-stars because it wasn&#x27;t all bad, just the taste. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.g pile of dirt. Then sprinkled with grass on top.&lt;br /&gt;- Dear heavenly beings, the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-stars because it wasn&#x27;t all bad, just the taste. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> if you can stand the taste, you will benefit in so many ways. It makes me feel a lot better throughout the day. I don&#x27;t get tired at all now. I usually drink it with O.J, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me taste wise.</li>
            <li> Tastes aweful no matter what you put it in. I&#x27;ve tried it in shakes and smoothies and the taste comes thru every time, not for me!</li>
            <li> Provides an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and probiotics and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also great source of sea vegetables, which are not easily available</li>
            <li> Got to get use to the taste but overall not bad. Tried it with grape juice but did not care for the sweet. Much better with almond milk.</li>
            <li> After questionable rice protein supply issues in another brand--I have switched to this brand. We have it for a morning drink. (1) Banana, 2 TBSP Flax seed, 2 Scopes Green Vibrance, 1/2 C Blueberries, (2) TBSP Apple Cider Vinegar,  1/4 Food Grade DE,  a handful of spinach &amp; 1/4C Organic Grape Juice for taste. Mix it up, makes 2 large morning smoothies and really tastes great.</li>
            <li> I am a chronic pain management patient. I have a terrible time in terms of having any energy, let alone sustaining energy. In the past year I have lost about 17 lbs , despite eating normal and healthy amounts, without explanation from doctors running labs, biopsies and more. I was already a size 00 and am currently very underweight . 80% of the time I feel terrible, as if I have chronic fatigue in addition to the condition I do have. The reminder of the time I feel &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; - but never great. Mornings and evenings are terrible for me, where I have everything from joint and/or debilitating muscle pain to not being able to keep my eyes, a tiredness that cannot be described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of research, I have tried every supplement known to mankind, in order to cope with the responsibilities of a demanding IT management job (50-60+ hours a week), a husband, 4 kids. and 2 dogs! I have modified my diet to include only whole foods, tried gluten free, dairy free, no sugar and more. All without bringing any relief or improvement other than very marginal. My latest research has been &amp;#34;the greens&amp;#34; and I can say without a doubt, Green Vibrance is in the top 3, depending on the specific nutrition and results you are looking for. I wanted something with a little more than the typical greens, and I like the fact that GV has the added and generous amounts of probiotics (as my condition is in the gastrointestinal and endocrine system - pancreas) and the adaptogen herbs. I can honestly say that I am only on my second day taking this product and I have never experienced this type of energy and general well feeling in the past 5 years years - and I am not very old - early 40&#x27;s. I feel very optimistic that I have found a whole food supplement that is providing my body with the nutrients it has been desperately seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased from Amazon for nealy 10 years and this is my very first review, which should speak for itself. I did not purchase from Amazon and decided to post my review here as I always read Amazon reviews to weigh in on my purchase decisions. I feel some reviewers are confusing the honesty and integrity of the Amazon seller(s) vs. the manufacturer of GV. The manufacturers of GV are very clear that they release new versions based on continuous research and improvements. They are the only manufacturer that actually, and very clearly, lists each and every ingredient with the individual dosage or amount for each ingredient on their label. Every other manufacturer of green supplements lists only the amount by grouping of &amp;#34;proprietary ingredients&amp;#34;. This product supplies a very generous amount of &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; of the nutrients on their label. For the few ingredients that could have more, consumers know the exact amount and can choose to confidently supplement more of that ingredient, without over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one last note, neither the taste nor the thickness is bad as some report, and I drink it plain in purified water. For those with sensitive taste buds, mix GV in your favorite organic unprocessed juice and I can&#x27;t imagine you would even taste it at all. Perhaps the green color affects the taste perception for many, you know, mind over matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the days to follow bring the same results I have experienced in a few short days and more. I plan to follow up and post my progress. I will revisit my original review in either direction to report on long term efficacy and results. I am doing this in hope of helping others as desperate as I am (hopefully was) to find a whole food based supplement, that would compliment my healthy diet and allow me to once again have energy and a feeling of wellness. Those who reported increased energy have likely understated the improvement, based in my initial results, or they may not have been as down and out on a regular basis as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, it&#x27;s worth a try and many great organic whole food ingredients!</li>
            <li> Really helps out if you have acid reflux.  Gives an energy boost.  Worth the money! I now have it on auto-ship so I never run out.</li>
            <li> It satisfies my needs and proved to be more than what I expected as for as the energy that I now have</li>
            <li> I had bought this product originally at a Health Food Store and pretty quickly saw some health benefits. I thought it was too expensive at the store so I looked for it online and found it on amazon for a better price. So I ordered it and received it in a timely manner and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of energy since I started taking this product in the fruit and vegetable mix that I take any morning.</li>
            <li> i take this every morning or afternoon with emergen c and it keeps me from getting sick.(doesnt work on my allergies though) i havent had a cold in i cant remember. great price on amazon for this 60 day supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how much better my body was when taking this, but this stuff tasted NASTY. I&#x27;m pretty good when it comes to food and I&#x27;ll eat practically anything but this stuff is off my list for life. One of the few tastes that made me nauseated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I mix Rainbow Vibrance with Field of Greens and Green Vibrance with a glass of strong flavored juice daily.</li>
            <li> I am on my second day of this powder.  Me and my spouse will both use it for 30 days and keep a journal of any extra benefits of energy and improvements to skin, etc.  Here is how I use it to make a healthy smoothie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In your blender place:&lt;br /&gt;small chunk pineapple (cut one up and put in a freezer baggie and keep in the freezer.)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 banana (can also freeze these.  It makes it so easy to plop one into the blender).&lt;br /&gt;1 cup orange juice&lt;br /&gt;1 scoop Vibrant Health green Vibrance (scoop comes in the container-dig deep, it&#x27;s way down there)!&lt;br /&gt;I put a scoop of ground flax seed (from Costco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is not bad but it&#x27;s not something you would sip on slowly.  I have to drink it right down.  I have horses and it smells similar to alfalfa hay-kind of sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Visual appeal isn&#x27;t wonderful after mixed in the above smoothie-looks very dark green.  But who cares when you can get so many good things into your body?</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I add this to my glass of apple juice every day. And since I have recently begun a vegetarian lifestyle, it will be a great benefit to me. After opening tho, it is best to keep it stored in the freezer. That&#x27;s what I do,,,,,:) lol Good Buy !!!!</li>
            <li> When I began taking this I was way over weight n I had a normal workout routine,i was getting frustrated a bit cause I was feeling drained n not in the mood to complete my weekly workouts,so I started looking for some kind of booster n something that would benefit my health so I came across this b product n so far I have came a long way,i have great energy during and after workouts n my body doesn&#x27;t feel stressed anymore.i feel the drive to get it done,now I do take other supplements as well but this helped dramatically.I&#x27;ve lost 48lbs in 9 weeks and I&#x27;m continuing to strive for more, doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all taking consideration that I have taken other greens in the past but this is the best.....try it, its awesome, by the way this is the first review I have ever took the time to complete...eric g texas</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was the highest rated amongst the green drink powders on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I will say that the taste is horrible, and with products like this that is expected and acceptable, but this one seems to be particularly bad.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have, the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green, nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had. Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product. Hope this review was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> Wow......I don&#x27;t get it!!! After reading several reviews and everyone talking about how great this product is. I rushed to \\&quot;Vitamin Shoppe\\&quot; to purchase this amazing product (yeah, right!!) I drink energy drinks and protein shakes on a daily bases. The taste was bearable like any other powder supplement I drink, no big deal nothing to fuss about. However, the benefits that everyone claims are so wonderful. I just don&#x27;t get it. I mixed the supplement with 8oz Vanilla Soy milk and a banana. Went to work and felt so fatigue and yawned all morning, my Co Worker asked me \\&quot;what is wrong with you\\&quot; I took the supplement again the next morning and yawned like crazy again etc.... This product sucks and I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent my hard earned money on this junk. (wow 295 viewers rate this almost 5 stars) I don&#x27;t get it! I read this forum and value everyones opinion like it&#x27;s the gospel truth....I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> Green vibrance has been a major factor in my recovering from pneumonia. About a year ago I came out of the Hospital and was treated with antibiotic for 8 days and nights. My immune system was bad and I needed to recover. I started taking the green vibrance and I did start to feel better quickly. The Doctor said to keep drinking it if I am feeling good on it. I have been on it for eight months now. Tip: I use Kefir milk and mix it with that for the extra pro-biotic in it. I call green vibrance swamp thing but it works!!! P.S it lowered my high bllod pressure from about 160/100 to a stable 120/75 :)</li>
            <li> I used to smoke a pack a day, Ive never done well in school because of attention and energy issues, and I rarely ever exercised, I never really understood how everyone else did so well. I started taking this stuff once a day, or every other day. Three years later Ive been riding about 10-15 miles a day, and up to 50 miles in one day on my road bike, I can run about 9-10 miles, I have not smoked a single puff in over two years, and Ive been making solid straight A&#x27;s and almost have my batchelors, going for a masters or higher. I literally feel like a completely new, better person. Careful coming off of it though, it can make you itchy. You are what you eat folks, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Ive tried other cheaper superfoods, to save money, none of them work like green vibrance.</li>
            <li> I stayed away from this for awhile because of the price but Im glad I finally made the purchase. It has a lot of ingredients, and my PH levels are better since using this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that gives you energy and the essential minerals and vitamins. Aftery trying diffrent brands i can honestly say this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I stay healthy and this product may or may not be a factor. I like to think so or I would not be using it.BK</li>
            <li> After 4 days I had a dramatic increase in energy.  I am in Chemo treatment and it was really getting me down. Now I can deal with it for the 5 days it is the worse and have good energy until the next treatment.</li>
            <li> I could feel the effect after the first time trying this!  Its now been about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m still going strong.  I will def keep this product on hand!  The taste is awful, but I add it to 12oz of Gatorade and it&#x27;s tolerable!  However, the effects make the taste well worth it!</li>
            <li> I like it my wife loves it. To me there are other similar product that don&#x27;t cost as much that do just as well. However I can&#x27;t convince my wife.</li>
            <li> first of all….i love this stuff. improved energy, improved GI health and overall fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best to dissolve it into NAKED juices Green Machine, use a Shaker. i promise this is actually palatable!!</li>
            <li> Ugh, I could smack myself for paying 2x the price and money IS an object. So for me to (up until now!!!) shell out a Ben Franklin for a container of powder-it is amazing. I used to be a regular juicer, but that involved hunting down quality organic produce, using a special wash, use plenty of the produce for decent amount of juice and then clean up the God-awful mess. With Green Vibrance, all the fuss is taken out and even more high impact special greens are involved. I mix it into almond or coconut milk with a sugar free protein powder(I like chocolate-Prograde carries a trustworthy product). It tastes great and covers the nutritional bases. An all around winner since trying to eat right with what is available is time-consuming AND expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this in my smoothies so you can&#x27;t really taste it. Has everything I need in a green powder supplement.  Great product and best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Add this daily to my morning protein shake; blended, I hardly notice the taste. Friends have noticed (without knowing I&#x27;m talking this past 2-months) my skin looks younger and overall they are saying I look healthier which is funny as I am all about physical fitness and dieting correctly.  Perhaps I have been overdoing it the past many years; this product just may be the key source of vitamins and minerals I was missing.  I feel great, too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for the past couple of years.  I take it with diluted cranberry juice and chia seeds.  The tartness makes it more tolerable.  Right off the bat, it gives me energy.  My blood work is always excellent since I&#x27;ve been taking this.  I was suffering from pain due to circulation problems and I believe this product has really helped me.  I don&#x27;t remember the last time I was sick and it&#x27;s cleared away my allergies.  I don&#x27;t know what nutrients my body was lacking...but I must say, the product makes me feel good.  I feel healthy.  I have read some negative reviews but the company has always been forthcoming and honest.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  Amazon does offer the best price.  I recommend it to everyone I know.  As with all natural remedies, you cannot expect to see immediate results but it is more of a long term investment.  As for me, I will continue to take Green Vibrance.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I get my veggies and vitamins from this stuff. Please use some thought if it tastes bad to you. I use a crystal light or mio mix to water which covers any chalky taste plus I put in frozen fruit and veggies to my smoothie mix as well as chia seeds and a banana. Best way to take it. Either use a blender or you can buy a nutribullet at Costco for 75 bucks and it will make it all good.</li>
            <li> Not as tasty as more expensive brands, but good for you.  It needs sweetening.  Not sure what to use for sweetening - don&#x27;t want to use sugar, but...</li>
            <li> This product is definitely spot on when it comes to what&#x27;s inside. I was very pleased with this product and how it breaks down every ingredient for you. It tells you what&#x27;s in it, how much, what category that ingredient falls into, etc. It is chock full of all kinds of goodies and was the only one that had everything from berries, leafy greens, sea veggies, fiber and pro-pre biotics, antioxidants, enzymes...Then it goes into the different systems it helps; liver, heart, kidneys, immune, cell membrane and nerve systems. It breaks this all down. Then, you have the many, many vitamins and minerals. The only reason, and only ONE reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does taste like you are eating the wet ground of a rainforest. It isn&#x27;t necessarily a horrible taste that causes one to not want to drink it...but it does make you want to take it with straight juice of some sort. I use Cranberry / Pomegranate and it makes it much better. You don&#x27;t have to take a lot of it, 8 oz, and so you can really chug fast. I use a NutriBullet to mix it all up and if done right there wont be granules but its not going to take them away. You will still have the granules. I would also suggest mixing it with something else to make a smoothie like a banana...even an avocado. Overall, because of all the yummy goodness inside of it, and whether the taste is what it is, its something I will continue to buy and use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a week and now I really feel better More focus, more active and overall feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been suffering IBS.  I&#x27;ve started taking the Vibrant Health Green Vibrance 3 months a-go and I am finitely feeling NORMAL! my skin looks much better, I have a lot of more energy, and my colon thanks me every day!</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced us to this product after my wife was diagnosed with late stage Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease. She had problems eating and Green Vibrance, along with Ensure, Ricotta Cheese and Protein powder created a milk shake that helped her gain 20 pounds in three months. This is&lt;br /&gt;a good product packed with vitamins and minerals. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product&lt;br /&gt;for  years  very satisfied  good results&lt;br /&gt;would recommend  to a friend. really  fantastick&lt;br /&gt;gave to my daughtr</li>
            <li> I tried several different powders, I am picky.  Important to me is fresh and no fillers, good balance.  There were a couple of others I liked as much but this one won out.  Also, Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love what&#x27;s inside but after a month I still can&#x27;t get used to the taste. I still drink it every morning but the taste is awful. If you can stand the taste this it an awesome product. My next powdered superfood I will try a berry flavored one.</li>
            <li> This product is really great.  I&#x27;m all out and haven&#x27;t had any for a week. I can really tell the difference.  My stomach is bloated. I&#x27;m not regular without it. I need to go but I just can&#x27;t. Green Vibrance helps me feel normal. I&#x27;m also due for a check up.  I&#x27;m expecting good news. I expect my blood pressure and cholesterol to both be down.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of supplements, and take careful note as to how they make me feel. some are very subtle with little to no noticeable benefit, but i really felt the difference with my first serving of Green Vibrance. my noticed it as well and commented, but it made us both feel &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;. nice energy and clean feel. great way to start the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the taste was rough with just water, but mixing with a little bit of juice made it very drinkable. the poor taste is easily offset by the benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> Way too many minerals in there for me to handle comfortably.  I was excited about the possibility of loosing caffein, but not going to happen with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Green Vibrance is the Best Veg/Fruit/ Porbiotic powder I&#x27;v bought and will continue to buy it. The $$ is Fantastic! The product arrived in 2 dys! If I could, I&#x27;d give this a ten Star Rating!&lt;br /&gt;Alex Adam, Irvine, Ca</li>
            <li> Easy way to add needed nutrients to your diet.  Use it daily in my smoothies and sometimes add to soups or other foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item. Well made and shipped professionally all at a very reasonable price. I do recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I feel really good taking this natural and organic supplement and am very happy to get extra probiotics into my gut. The taste is fine - didn&#x27;t expect it to taste &amp;#34;delicious&amp;#34; since it is free of additives like sugar. I am not buying it for the taste. That&#x27;s what chocolate is for! It dissolves easily enough in water and I most often take it this way. I also like it with Organic India Psyllium and a banana blended together. I always take small amounts of the powder with me when travelling so my body gets great nutrition and I don&#x27;t stress too much about what I eat for a couple of days. Very happy with the subscription service. Would highly recommend Vibrant Health products.</li>
            <li> great price and product! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a nasty taste to it.  I use it in small doses in my smoothies.</li>
            <li> My son is a martial artist and I bought this for him. He told me it was incredible in helping him buff up his energy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel good. I don&#x27;t take it every day any more, but I went through 2 containers of it and I think it made a difference in my energy, and my dumps (poop).</li>
            <li> This product delivers on it&#x27;s claims of helping to provide the whole range of proper vitamins/minerals/digestive enzymes, it shipped quickly and lasted exactly 3 months with the suggested serving size. There isn&#x27;t much more to say, it&#x27;s a bit pricey and tastes terrible regardless of what it is mixed with and for that it loses one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said I will probably use this product again in the future and would reccomend it to those with special diets who may be missing out on some key vitamins and minerals due to dietary deficiency, especially those who follow a vegan diet.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.Haven&#x27;t been sick for 2 years, even though colds and flu have made several rounds through the home and workplace. Back and joint pain are much better.Gerd was cured overnight and the irritation in my esophagus  healed shortly.I have lost about 20 lbs over 2 years and currently tip the scales about 7 lbs heavier than when I was 18.I am 47 and use this everyday with plain water and chase it with another 44 oz of room temp water (my body seems to reject cold water).For those who posted poor reviews because of the taste, I am sad they will never experience the amazing benefits of this product, because it wasn&#x27;t all sweet and yummy like a fruit smoothie.</li>
            <li> The just keep improving it, I will be puchasing this again. This product really works for me and has become part of my regular diet.</li>
            <li> I am taking this stuff on the advice of a friend. I like the idea of getting more greens in my diet-- I just add it to my morning smoothies. It really does not taste that bad!</li>
            <li> I take this product everyday mixed with OJ, and a bit of whey powder for breakfast.  For the first time in my life, I am not deficient in any minerals, vitamins.  My digestion is great, and I have stamina!  This blend is great, and I really love it!</li>
            <li> So I would first like to say I am one of those selfish A-Holes that never goes back to rate items though I have purchased countless items off amazon. This is my first review btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the green magic because I was looking into meal supplements. I am a college football player with no time, a huge appetite and a love for school and lifting weights. After 3 weeks of taking the powder faithfully, I noticed I felt a little more energetic and my body responded more from the things I ate. But that wasnt a good enough reason for me to believe this stuff works. Then my girlfriend came down with a bad case of the flu. I decided its time to put this to the test so I exposed myself to my girlfriend in more than a couple ways (use your imagination). She had became really ill after a while, shivers, heat sweats, migraines, fever, etc. I began feeling a little funny after a few days of being around her but continued my powder. I was waiting for the day I would be like her the 2 days she was deathly ill from the flu(Dr. Diagnosed flu for the record) and it never happened. Over a week later I am still fine. I became slightly congested sneezed a few times and felt mucus in my chest but nothing serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product and will use it until I am in my grave and if I make it to heaven I plan on asking the guards at the peraly gates \\&quot; Hey you guys got green vibrance up here or what?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered. The title truly says it all. Cheapest ce that I could find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> In my opinion the best &amp;#34;Green drink&amp;#34; out there. I can feel the difference when I have it in the morning and when I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not a coffee drinker nor do I consume caffeine through any form on a regular basis but Green Vibrance gives me better energy, it&#x27;s longer lasting and doesn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;crash&amp;#34; feeling. A word of advice to anyone who purchases Green Vibrance or any green drink for that matter: Mix it with fruit or fruit juice. I used to drink it straight with 4-6 ounces of water and god it was awful. I&#x27;ve since mixed it with 4-6 ounces of water, an apple, and a banana. Or you can substitute the apple and water for 4-6 ounces of apple juice and keep the banana and it tastes amazing.</li>
            <li> Getting my greens has never been easier. Gives me energy for a good part of the day and I feel healthy because I&#x27;m having my greens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Athletic Greens for over a year.  I got sick of being on their autoshipment program because either I found myself stockpiling the stuff (because I had gone out of town a couple of times and stopped using it) or I would run out (because their shipping department takes a week to get it to you).  I wanted to find an Athletic Greens alternative so after finding this product on Amazon, I decided to give it a go.  I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for about a month now and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that it&#x27;s more drinkable than Athletic Greens.  I mix it in Orange Juice every morning.  I notice the mornings when I skip my Vibrant Health drink, I feel it in lack of energy and overall well-being.  This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about paying an arm and a leg for Athletic Greens (which costs MORE for a 30-day supply than a 60-day supply of Vibrant Health Greens does) while being stuck on some auto shipment program just to drink a nasty shake every morning.  I am sticking with this product because I can order it when I want, it tastes much better, it&#x27;s much less expensive, and it gives me more energy.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like food pellets you feed the animals at the petting zoo!  I really have a strong stomach and drink all kinds of pure juices and I like all kinds of veggies, but this stuff is pretty strong tasting and extremely noticeable even with a lot of other greens and veggies mixed in,  Other than the smell and taste the product seems to have the best mix of everything healthy on this planet in it and is part of my smoothies whenever I make them.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis and absolutely love it!  Green Vibrance helps supplement my diet in all the right ways.</li>
            <li> Big difference in the way I feel and my overall wellness goals! People have commented that I look more healthy! This is easy to take and mix in and it works!</li>
            <li> I have been using a similar product by the same company for over six months when I saw this product. It certainly has more nutritious value than the one I had been using , however the taste is aweful ! I have been trying to find something to add to it to cover the taste. I won&#x27;t be buying this one again!</li>
            <li> The benefits Ive already experienced from this product are amazing.  I have been diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that attacks my liver and have had absolutely zero energy.  I started taking the G.V. in the morning and have had energy I didnt think possible, also my liver pain has disappeared completely. I actually feel better than I did in my 30&#x27;s.  My son is a nurse and he bought me this, and he couldnt have given me a better gift!  What kind of price can you put on your health?&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d also like to address the people who 1 starred this product because of the arsenic claim..should have done your research.  For those of you concerned about it, go to this site and read for yourself, do your own research.  Consumer Reports needs to withdrawal their findings, its false and unfounded.  http://wolfcrowell.wix.com/wolf#!vibrant-health-arsenic-response/chpn  Use your own judgement after reading this.</li>
            <li> Be careful!!!  Consumer Lab released a report in July 2014 showing that Green Vibrance was found to be contaminated with arsenic.&lt;br /&gt;mary  Livewell-eatwell</li>
            <li> I have been using pretty consistently for a few weeks now, but there seemed to be quite a bit of hype with this product that I am not sure of.  How long does it take to make a huge difference? I mix one scoop with a banana, other fruit, almond milk, and ice. Really doesn&#x27;t taste too bad that way. I would just like to see a difference before I try to reorder it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old, my back was hurting me, even though I was undergoing rehab for it.&lt;br /&gt;When I take Green Vibrance, mix it with juice, I can sleep through the night, pain free,&lt;br /&gt;without taking pain medication.&lt;br /&gt;I feel better as well.&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will be buying Green Vibrance on Amazon, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Fairway.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Green Vibrance.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the taste, mix it with apple juice.&lt;br /&gt;Works for me.</li>
            <li> Great price for a 60 day supply, and it mixes well with V8 fruit drinks, apple juice, but make sure you mix it in a shaker bottle to fully saturate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nasty and tastes a bit grassy, but is VERY boosting and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> All I am going to say is: WOW!&lt;br /&gt;1 - it doesn&#x27;t taste bad considering the ingredients wrap around the entire container.&lt;br /&gt;2 - If I had to grab 2 items to survive this jar of green powder and water would be it.&lt;br /&gt;No pills, no food, no supplements.  You could survive a long time on this, lose weight and still be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The energy is amazing.  Use with caution.  It&#x27;s the bomb!  Really!</li>
            <li> I have never taken any supplements before OTHER than my multi-vitamin. I just got mine in today so not enough time for a review yet so there will def be an update in a few weeks! I would like to take a BIG stick and smack all the whiny reviews/folks about complaining about the taste!!!REALLY? Sounds like a kid crying over eating veggies lol anyways, I guess some taste buds can&#x27;t hack it. This does NOT taste like mud or dirt or like licking a pond! I can taste a hint of seaweed and it reminds me of broken down vitamins. ACTUALLY Biting into a multivitamin will taste much worse. The taste kind of reminds me of the smell of a farm hahaha IDK if that makes sense. It is very tolerable to me, I tasted it on it&#x27;s own and I mixed it with OJ in a shot glass so I could down it alot faster and it is NOT bad at all! I have eaten foods from all around so I guess I broke my taste buds in. My son barely turned 4 and i gave him 1/4 of a tablespoon mixed in a shot glass with OJ and he drank the whole thing! Will update in a few weeks, it&#x27;s only been 30 min since I drank it and I feel much better but IDK if my mind is playing tricks on me &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> This product sent was exactly as depicted in photos.  Fast delivery.  And want to say this is best health product I have taken since way back.  I was lethargic, but only after about 3 days of taking this product it is awesome on the energy I have. And best of all taking this has cured my insomnia.  After 60 day supply gets low will look into a larger quantity to order.  Thanks seller.  Give you an A+ rating in the way you accurately depicted and advertised this product.  Aloha from Hawaii...s.k.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product consistently for a long time now. I was very sick back then and so made a lot of positive changes in my life, and taking Green Vibrance regularly was one of those changes.  I don&#x27;t know if Green Vibrance is the sole reason why my health improved, but it has so many good things in it, I am convinced that it definitely played an important role, which is why I intend to take this product for the rest of my life.  I highly recommend it to anyone trying to improve his/her health.</li>
            <li> I am a person who leads a very healthy lifestyle. I can&#x27;t even begin to choke this stuff down no matter what I mix it with. It has by far the grossest aftertaste EVER! It may be good for you...if you can find a way to ingest it. I definitely cannot. Don&#x27;t waste your money, it smells gross, it tastes worse and it won&#x27;t do anyone a bit of good if it stays in the container it was purchased in. YUCK!! I don&#x27;t even think it deserves one star. So annoyed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Price: 6/10&lt;br /&gt;Solubility: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;Taste: 1/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the WORST tasting supplement I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, but I still continue to take it because it is a QUALITY product. The only i don&#x27;t vomit every time is because I mix it with COLD ORANGE JUICE. I will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple - read the ingredients.  Green Vibrance wins hands down.  Cheap is cheap - pay for the best.  You deserve it!</li>
            <li> I have used it evryday for the last 4 months. I feel better than I than I could have imagined. At 61 years old I have more energy than I did several years ago. You never know the real reasons behind these kinds of things, but for me it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Been taking Green Vibrance for over a year and can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t take it. Taste isn&#x27;t bad but I usually mix it in a smoothie with Macro Reds and my day is exponentially better than the days I don&#x27;t take it. I highly recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;m an RN and work long hours for days at a time and this is what keeps me going. I&#x27;ve been told that my skin and hair look great when I&#x27;ve been taking this regularly. I&#x27;ve noticed my nail grow faster also. All around great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning with a glass of juice. Makes me feel great and I&#x27;m getting my veggies. I&#x27;d suggest to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This review is a copy of my review of the Kilo size GV but I wanted to rewrite it for those who may only want to buy it in the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY leery about trying this product, BUT, to my surprise, it is the best tasting drink on the market. I truly thought it would have a \\&quot;green aftertaste\\&quot; and I was wrong, it is just a \\&quot;delicious\\&quot; taste.&lt;br /&gt;I mix mine with either 8 oz of pineapple juice or orange juice (or a 1/2 and 1/2 combo, add 1/2 scoop of ON Platinum Hydrowhey or ON Gold Standard Whey Strawberry flavor, and a scoop of Vibrant Health&#x27;s Rainbow Superfood. Each shake costs me less than $2.40 to make. IMHO, MUCH cheaper and better for you than any other shake on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It is so good, that I will occasionally have another shake in the afternoon. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but compared to other products, this is far superior in quality. Amazon does have the BEST prices and if it is purchased in the bulk size,you get a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also believe that Vibrant Health&#x27;s policy of letting the consumer know EXACTLY what is in each scoop of powder is terrific. God only knows what is in the \\&quot;proprietary\\&quot; blend of my former shake! So, I would try it and buy the small size first, then if you like, buy in bulk, because it will be cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly mother and myself. Been using this for several months now and she feels great and loves drinking this once a day.I think I wrote a review on this several months ago but just wanted to let others know that there is a new version out. Version 12.0  . I had just reordered our supply and just tonight noticed that the version on the bottle was newer and well to me the taste is better and looks more greener. It seems to mix much better as well.I loved version 10.3 but this 12.0 seems much nicer. I haven&#x27;t looked on what the difference is yet but came on Amazon to look at the front advertised page to check out what at least in the picture of it shows and it still shows as being vrs 10.3 so perhaps they are shipping the newer ones out now but picture has yet to be updated? Anyways I would highly recommend getting the newer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Yep just checked the main site Vibrant health and they are selling version 12.0. Why is Amazon selling outdated products? Getting rid of older supply? Anyways I had just re-ordered this newest order of mine thinking version 10.3 was the newest and Amazon did send me the version 12.0 so perhaps they just did not change the picture? Be sure you check before ordering though. Nothing wrong with 10.3 but to me 12.0 is much better.</li>
            <li> It takes like swamp water, but my husband would experiment mixing it with different juices and mixes to see if we could get it to taste better.  But I have to say, it has everything you could possible need in a day for vegetables and that made me feel better.</li>
            <li> I do wish this were made with organic greens, but the taste isn&#x27;t bad (if you&#x27;re tolerant of super-healthy-tasting food) and it&#x27;s packed with nutrient-dense veggies.</li>
            <li> Knowing all the wonderful things in Green Vibrance makes the taste very bareable. We drink it everyday either in smoothies (with some cilantro that helps cancel out the taste) or mixed with water (usually hold my nose). Love this stuff though for all of the WONDERFUL ingredients and for good health...we feel great!</li>
            <li> Wholesome goodness in a package. I get this product regularly for my mom. Although Green Vibrance is a bit pricier than other supergreen products, my mom said the taste is the most tolerable among other brands that she has tried. She&#x27;s happy to take it daily and has even recommended it to her friends.</li>
            <li> Of course the taste is something to get used to, but I&#x27;ve had much, much worse and 8 oz is nothing - one big gulp. Extremely easy to make and it really does make me feel like I have more energy and I&#x27;m more alert and digestion has improved.  All around goodness, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the 12.0 version and it is great.  I use it daily and it is an excellent supplement.  I try to have healthful veggies, but if I don&#x27;t do well one day, I know the green vibrance is supplementing my intake.  I have stomach problems due to bacteria and have allergies to antibiotics.  The recent endoscopy and colonoscopy shows no damage due to the bacteria.  This green vibrance has tons of probiotics to protect the digestive system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of greens and none have proven as good as this.  They all taste pretty much the same (if they&#x27;re just greens, that is) but this delivers the most nutrients in a very convenient form,  The price is good, much better than what I&#x27;d pay locally.</li>
            <li> Really didnt expect an energy boost as its always a claim. After much research I landed here at this product for a super shake including a green powder.&lt;br /&gt;This mixes well and isnt as much a dominent flavor as many others. I froze mine after opening and mix with my regular Almond milk shake. After 3rd day I woke up really with a boost that just may be this product. Ill follow up.&lt;br /&gt;I mix with fresh Pineapple, mango,bananna, non fat plain yogurt, unsweetened almond milk(pure), currently trying titan 1 protien but will return to Optimum Nutrition Pro complex vanilla. Table spoon milled flax seed. Few walnuts.&lt;br /&gt;Also Schif fish oil tablet&lt;br /&gt;1/3 of recommended dose of Opti-Men vitamin(too much B vitamin).&lt;br /&gt;small dose aspirin.&lt;br /&gt;Now with 2 espresso&#x27;s we are rolling!.</li>
            <li> Best pro-biotic supplement out there. Makes yogurt seem like a children&#x27;s aspirin in comparison. Of course it will taste leafy, it&#x27;s from green vegetables. It helped me (and continues to help) with my colitis.</li>
            <li> I feel so good when I drink this but the taste is something to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Green Vibrance for several years now, and I feel great after my daily shake that includes other ingredients such as oats, flax/hemp/chia seeds, bananas, blueberries, leafy greens (kale/spinach) , Coconut Oil and whatever else I happen to have lying around!  Not only do I feel energy but I am extraordinarily &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; and experience no digestive issues whatsoever and I believe this is due to the high amount of probiotics included in every serving.</li>
            <li> At first had trouble drinking it. After finding the right combination to mix with no problem. I feel more energized and no longer feel constant  hunger. Seems like all those nutrients my body was missing are being replaced by this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that Vibrant Health has put out. I have been using for a couple years and I have other people also using.</li>
            <li> Dosen&#x27;t mix well at all with anything.  Try Kylea, use discount program.  That&#x27;s what I switched to.  A little bit more, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! All my main nutrients in one scoop!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple months. I do feel more energy and awake. I skipped it for a couple weeks and went back to my sluggish self. I do think the price is a little high. It amounts to over a dollar for every little scoop. Im sure they make a lot of profit on this product. Pretty tight squeeze for someone on a fixed income. Otherwise it is great</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for three days and I am now totally constipated. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased for $47.50. This product fluctuates more than any other I keep track of. Goes from $47.50 all the way up to $68.00.</li>
            <li> My whole family has been using this product for 3 months. I believe that this has helped us all stay healthy through the flu season and is also helping to regulate my weight. Fantastic product from a fantastic company.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels and I keep the container in the freezer, as suggested.  I&#x27;ve been an Amazon subscribe &amp; save user of this for over a year.  However, about halfway through (on multiple tubs) it gets a progressively worse taste and not nearly as fresh at the beginning.  I&#x27;m suspecting that the tub itself is not very good for in the freezer and need to put in a different storage container.  Anyone else have same experiences or storage suggestions?</li>
            <li> Love this powder.Gave me more energy!! .I mixed it with V8 juice and a little pickle juice and it was yummy!!</li>
            <li> I spent many hours trying to find a better choice than the Amazing Grass GreenSuperFood I was using before. I had descided I didn&#x27;t like the way it tasted even with the banana and frozen strawberries blended together with my brown rice protein powder. I wanted the best I could find out there that didn&#x27;t contain any sweeteners like Stevia, which all have a terrible aftertaste. I wanted a greens powder that had a very wide variety of nutrients in generous amounts as well. I also wanted the best bang for my buck as they say.. and I found this product to be everything I was searching for. After receiving and making my &#x27;greens &amp; protein&#x27; smoothie I found it to have a much better taste than the product mentioned above that I was previously using. Yes, this costs a bit more, but not so much more that it doesn&#x27;t make it totally worth it, in quality and taste!</li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the taste, but I have tried other products similar, all with similar taste.</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old male suffering from lymphedema and it SEVERLY effects my immune system. Usually during the year and especially the winter time i will get a stomach virus of some sorts that means i get 101-103 degree fever and all kinds of rough things for 24 hours happen. Along with a VEGAN diet, this product mixed with the Sunwarrior Warrior protein greens in the morning i went from getting sick roughly 8-10 times a year down to 1-2 at most. This year was the first time in 10 YEARS thats TEN YEARS!!! Plus amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> This product might be healthy but what a taste?!&lt;br /&gt;How can you stand that?&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that it is tolerable only with orange fresh. It still takes a while to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;You would expect some better quality/taste for this price!&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that the price is weigh too high.This should not be more than $20...</li>
            <li> Not only does this boost my energy it also seems to have kept my immune system functioning great because I have not gotten sick since my detoxing prior to being the Vibrance Green.  I highly recommend this product to others working out, need a boost or just trying to be healthy and feel better.  I&#x27;m going to try the Junior Vibrance for my grand-daughter to help her grow healthy organs and feed that little growing brain of hers.</li>
            <li> It might be good to my body, but I can&#x27;t force myself to drink it, it&#x27;s horrible...I have tried all the recommended serving and mixing suggestions found on the &#x27;reviews&#x27; pages but....</li>
            <li> I had been using Dr. Schulze&#x27;s Super Food, another green powder supplement, when my son and I compared the ingredient list of that and the one he was using, Green Vibrance. Based on the ingredients and what I had read about it on their website, I ordered the Green Vibrance when I needed more. The price on Amazon was much better than what my son had paid in a health food store! The taste of Green Vibrance and Super Food is about the same to me--Nasty!!! I don&#x27;t want to ruin a good glass of juice by mixing in this stuff, so I just mix a scoop in about 1/3 cup of water and glug it down, followed by a glass of good water. I am very faithful in drinking it every night before I go to bed. I think it has improved my energy level tremendously. I had been suffering from extreme fatigue.  Armour thyroid and Calm magnesium made a big difference in improvoing that, but I noticed a definite increase in energy after using GreenVibrance. Super Food gave me \\&quot;niacin flush\\&quot; and Green Vibrance doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if that means Green Vibrance has less niacin in it or not, but regardless, I will keep using it. I&#x27;m trying to get my husband to use it but so far he uses it very sporadically. I highly recommend it, as long as you can get by the taste! I came back to add that I am 65 years old, I am raising our 3 year old grandson, we still have teenagers in our home, I clog dance and am very active, and I know for sure this has been helping me.</li>
            <li> I can tolerate just about anything for health benefits. However, one drink of this, and I was vomiting violently in my kitchen sink for about 5 minutes straight, my concerned son at my side. I couldn&#x27;t even stop to tell him I was ok! No exaggeration. Green Vibrance tastes like ****. I will go back to my usual Amazing Grass Amazing Meal original flavor. Forget saving a dime or two...not worth it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t given this enough time to see how well it works. Still haven&#x27;t figured out the best way to take it. Tried mixing it into a smoothie, it gets very thick and sticks to the blender blades, a little wasteful so tried just mixing in water, a little tough to swallow. :( If anyone else has suggestions let me know.</li>
            <li> From all the amazing reviews I now take this every day.  However, how do we measure health.  If this gives me energy and gets my body healthier then it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purchasing another box because I think it&#x27;s very nutritive and so, a very good supplement but I have to tell you that the easiest way to drink this product is to mix it with some orange juice or pineapple and cucumber ortherwise it&#x27;s really hard to drink....</li>
            <li> Day two since taking Green Vibrance and I&#x27;ve been getting the most explosive diarrhea I&#x27;ve had. The s*** is greenish.  t first I thought this might have to do with me smoking one and a half pack of cigarette and drinking a lot of wine the night before, but I&#x27;ve been doing that since college. Also, none of my friends had the same jolly fun time on the toilet seat as I had.    I was all \\&quot;GREEN VIBRANCE!!! YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS SOCERY\\&quot;, but then I read that this was a detoxing reaction. I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> When I received the Green Vibrance I was afraid it would have an awful taste.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to lose weight and become more health conscious. So I bought this product. Well, it surprised me ! Green Vibrance not only has a nice flavor to it, especially if you add (Raw Honey and some fresh squeezed orange juice) but it also gives me energy and keeps me full for most of the day.</li>
            <li> The taste is more mild on this product than Perfect food, so people who are more picky about taste would like this. Clean, pure and healthy, and less taste interference with your juice or protein drinks. I even drink it with pure water.</li>
            <li> Bought this 4 months ago on the recommendation of a health coach. Opened it, it smelled awful, so I put it in the frige &amp; forgot about it. Three wks ago Dr Oz said you should take veg powder every day (he no longer gives brand names) &amp; he mixed it in O.J. I went straight to the kitchen, got it out, &amp; started taking it. I&#x27;ve had M.S. for yrs &amp; feel poorly more than I feel well. After a couple of days I started feeling almost like a normal person again. I cannot believe how much better I feel since starting this product. I try to eat well but don&#x27;t eat enough veg. I mix it in O.J. &amp; it kind of grows on you after awhile. Not the best taste but I don&#x27;t enjoy my weekly shot, either. I do it so I can function &amp; feel as well as possible. I&#x27;ve already ordered enough to get through the summer. Prefer that it not sit in a 140 degree truck all day during delivery. I did get a cold last week. It&#x27;s one of the mildest colds I&#x27;ve ever had. I would given this 10 stars if I could. Highly recommend if you have a chronic illness. Haven&#x27;t felt this good in yrs. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I began using this product a few weeks ago. I make a protein shake with chocolate protein powder, Green Vibrance powder, flaxseed meal, cocoa powder and sweetener. A thick chocolate shake it isn&#x27;t but it is pretty good. I am overweight and have Type 2 Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome, fatty liver, and very low energy. I am 53 and feel 93. I have trouble going up &amp; down stairs and getting up &amp; down from the floor. I don&#x27;t eat enough vegetables and thought that this would help me get more greens in my diet. Within 1-2 days I noticed more energy and have been feeling better since. I can now get up and down the stairs easier and am having less trouble getting up and down from the floor. I&#x27;ve been trying to drink two shakes a day. Just last week I doubled the Green Vibrance powder in my morning shake and wow what a difference! Tons of energy. I&#x27;m now wanting to exercise and work around the house. Anyone who is on the fence about this supplement should take the plunge. If the taste is a problem for you find a way to take it. If I were to go outside and eat the grass in my yard it wouldn&#x27;t taste good. Don&#x27;t expect this or any green supplement to taste good. Find a way to make it taste good. My way was a protein shake. Yours might be orange juice or some other juice. I&#x27;m thinking about putting this in oatmeal with sweetener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef with the supplement is the price. No matter where you buy it it&#x27;s too high. The price needs to be $15.00 less that what it&#x27;s being sold for.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better green drinks on the market that I&#x27;ve found.  And while I prefer to mix with juice, it is sweet enough to be stomached alone with water.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for such a great product!Can&#x27;t buy it this cheap anywhere else.And it arrive so quickly. Highly reccomend this vendor.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews that different vendors had different versions I decided to order from Amazon and I received the 10.3 version (same as the one at wholefoods).  I am really active and notice how much more I sweat during workouts while taking this product I also notice a major difference in how my skin looks. The taste is pretty grassy but I do not mind it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty new to going \\&quot;green\\&quot; ;) and have been trying a couple different green drink products. I consider this the professional grade compared to the others because others worked ok, but nothing like this brand. It took me a while to get used to the taste, but honestly it magically became more of just a neutral taste and I now I actually crave it. I keep a nalgene bottle full of it everywhere I go and I feel more engeritic throughout the day drinking it. I will warn you, you will get a lot of attention from people at work asking why you&#x27;re drinking what they call \\&quot;pond water\\&quot; which leads to a great conversation on the healthy benefits of greens. I am in no way a vegetarian or vegan, not saying that&#x27;s bad, just normal guy trying to live a longer more enjoyable life with the people I love. A+ product, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Rosie O&#x27;Donnell mentioned this product on Dr. Oz, so I had to try it. I&#x27;ve used it now for about six months, and I feel great!  Between this product, Rhasberry Ketone, green tea, CLA, flaxseed supplements and sunflower seeds (saltless) - 3 teaspoons, no more than that as they become fattening after that, I feel wonderful and even though I&#x27;m 54, I run circles around the younger agents at the major airline I work for!  I&#x27;d recommend this to any one who wants to live a healthy livestyle (I don&#x27;t even work out) and have energy!  I like it best mixed in Silk Mango and Strawberry or Banana fruit drink that you can buy from Wal-Mart and have even started putting it in my coffee when I run out of that product!  I know my insides are thanking me and I&#x27;ve lost over 16 lbs!  (I&#x27;d hit 158 lbs for my 5&#x27; 10\\&quot; frame and I couldn&#x27;t seem to lose any weight.  I finally got down to 145 and seemed to plateau, however, this morning I weighed 142! - something I haven&#x27;t done since high school!) I&#x27;m also tickled to be able to buy a two-month&#x27;s supply for $50 because the one-month supply I&#x27;ve been buying from a health food store for $50 was getting to be a little harder to purchase each month - so I was tickled to purchase it online, shipping, tax and all for the same amount of money, only double the amount of product!  And it arrived within days! Amazon - you&#x27;re absolutely terrific!  Ginger in Texas</li>
            <li> I have been using Poliquin Primal Greens for the last few months, and I asked a friend for a less expensive alternative.  On his&lt;br /&gt;recommendation, I tried green vibrance.  There are tons of great reviews.  I don&#x27;t get it.  The taste was awful. My wife, son and I&lt;br /&gt;all tried this and there was no comparison.  So I am returning it.  I dont know if this was a bad batch (thought I doubt it), but I cannot&lt;br /&gt;understand how anyone could stomach this product, despite the health benefits.</li>
            <li> I have used many different greens but this one by far has it all. I mixed it with orange juice to make it more palatable or mixed it in a smoothy.</li>
            <li> The other reviews were right...it tastes like hay. But mixed with a little OJ and you can&#x27;t really taste it. I have to say I feel a lot better after using this for a month, just a general improvement in health.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now, great product!!! I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> I started taking this for nutritional support related to diverticulitis.  Every year or two an inflammation flareup requires me to take a one or two week juice and probiotic fast.  I was looking for added nutrition that I could add to juices and broths while keeping to a milk-free low residue and low fiber diet.  After the first purchase, I liked it so well I take it every day now.  It seems to help my extremely dry skin too, which gets worse if I miss a week of taking GV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix it with 8 oz V-8 or tomato juice, 2oz carrot juice, a tablespoon of flax seed oil, 5 drops vitamin E oil, a dose of Reuteri probiotic, 1T liquid calcium-magnesium supplement, a splash of hot sauce and a splash of home made garlic-rosemary vinegar (you&#x27;d think that&#x27;s bad for digestion but it is the opposite for me, this drink has a high pH). The flavor is like a bloody mary, sort-of, although the drink is brownish red, it is tasty!  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to juice my own tomatoes, that would make it a more perfect drink, I think.  I use the V-8 usually for convenience but it would be better to juice the real thing.</li>
            <li> now this stuff tastes really bad but if you mix it with a shot of orange juice and just chug it down it is not so bad, i feel so much better since i have been taking it and everything is moving along just as it should if you know what i mean</li>
            <li> I just feel better when I use Green Vibrance and plan to continue forever.  This product is everything it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Arrived with lid of container smashed, but  seal on product still intact. Don&#x27;t know if container damaged before or during shipping, but product itself sealed &amp; ok, no air exposure or spillage.</li>
            <li> This product is great but beware of subscription. I was charged two different prices so far...a difference of $15 more than what I initially subcribed to, it&#x27;s like subscribing to a magazine and every issue has fluctuating price.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an error on Amazon&#x27;s part but I hope their subscription is not misleading people to think that we are buying through Amazon for better price but then the price you subscribe to will change.  I&#x27;m hoping to get this issue fixed and get my refund but if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll be buying somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews on this product and I def. feel better when I use it. I just put a scoop into a cup, add very cold water to cover- maybe a tiny but more. I stir it well and suck it up fast thorugh a big straw. I am holding my breath so I am tasting nothing. It gets done in 3 seconds. It doesn&#x27;t have a particularly bad taste. I just don&#x27;t want to put it into a smoothie, etc.</li>
            <li> I take a glass of green powder smoothy every day and have tried many over my lifetime. I like this one this best. I feel the increased energy over the day and have come to trust it. What I like best is the transparency of the labeling. They fully disclose with no proprietary formulas! I highly recommend this product for your health.</li>
            <li> I have taken this about for two weeks. I generally feel like I have more energy, I wake up much easier in the mornings.  It however tastes, and looks pretty gross. Even mixing it with OJ and every other liquid in my fridge still makes it taste like gross OJ or whatever I mix it with.  That said, I&#x27;m going to keep on drinking it because I have noticed a change already. My children call it, &amp;#34;the pond water drink.&amp;#34; I will update my review in a few weeks, and report how I feel and if there are anymore changes in my energy level.</li>
