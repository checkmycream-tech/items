    <ol>
            <li>I think Kanon makes the very best scents for men.  </li>
            <li>excellent product and service</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s endurance is legendary.</li>
            <li>Best of the Kanon scents!</li>
            <li>Very good scent for the price !</li>
            <li>This cologne is very pleasant and smells like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>We were so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Longetivity is good if you like it.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and love it!</li>
            <li>Its nice to have in my collection to change up my scent from time to time.</li>
            <li>Nice Woodsy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li>Very nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase and shipping was excellent and quick.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is very cheap</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>the scents of sandalwood and cedar seem to predominate, but I&#x27;m not a fragrance expert, so there&#x27;s probably a lot more going on than I can differentiate.     </li>
            <li>Sure beats settling for another scent that costs an arm and a leg at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love it too.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any great expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>In all actuality I thought it smelled cheap.</li>
            <li>I originally found this scent discounted at Ross.  </li>
            <li>Unique scent.</li>
            <li>I want it to mix with my husband&#x27;s clean, mountain man smell and not detract from it.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only worn it a couple of times since Christmas, but it seems it has fair staying power</li>
            <li>There is nothing truly unique or special about this fragrance, but it is inexpensive, long-lasting, and a great everyday type of scent.</li>
            <li>It works so well, especially for him :)</li>
            <li>They delivered it as was promised, and we will order more in the future!</li>
            <li>The initial application does not go on strong</li>
            <li>The sandlewood, mixed with rich warm winter/autumn spices, with a slight smoky woodsy smell was JUST what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very woody...</li>
            <li>The scent does fade fast though.</li>
            <li>It has a very woody aroma.  </li>
            <li>the scent is strong, a little on the sweet side, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new product for after shave using.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pleasant smelling cologne to spray on in the morning before work, or before running about town during the day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li>I can see an older gentleman wearing this, but not a  young guy.  </li>
            <li>bottle is much bigger than it looks in the picture, and it really give the impression that it is much more expensive than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Picked it up at a store as a birthday gift for a full blooded Norwegian and as it would turn out it smells like something that could become a usual scent.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for a cologne for my husband, spent the time at Macy&#x27;s smelling coffee, cologne, coffee, cologne, etc.</li>

            <li> This bottle will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> She accidentally left the price tag on it so my expectations were low, especially because I tend to use premium colognes like Chrome Azzaro and Polo Black.</li>
            <li> I found this at Ross for $7 and it was a shot in the dark because they couldn&#x27;t even open the case</li>
            <li> Not sure if it smelled like Norwegian trees or Norwegian boners.  </li>
            <li> The dry down is musk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say half a day going in and outdoors.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does soften a little quicker than some I used but in close my wife says she can smell it on my all day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell changes after a few hours of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This scent is woodsy and mossy, just as described, just doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe 3-4 hrs and by then it is very faint.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect it to turn heads and smell as complex as a $200 bottle of Creed.</li>
            <li> However this is a pleasing and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to get the other one at that outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Not an overly complicated scent, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the car and boy did it do its job, made me crazy.</li>

            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Like the Smell&lt;br /&gt;It is very cheap&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is much bigger than it looks in the picture, and it really give the impression that it is much more expensive than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell changes after a few hours of wearing it. I don&#x27;t like how it smells by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I think Kanon makes the very best scents for men.  This one is my favorite.  I found out about it by going to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon and seeing it listed.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new product for after shave using.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as part of a gift package (EDT and Aftershave) at a ridiculously low price. I didn&#x27;t have any great expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s very woody...the scents of sandalwood and cedar seem to predominate, but I&#x27;m not a fragrance expert, so there&#x27;s probably a lot more going on than I can differentiate.     One caution...the scent is strong, a little on the sweet side, and lasts all day. Apply judiciously if you don&#x27;t want to knock over your office mates.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a cologne for my husband, spent the time at Macy&#x27;s smelling coffee, cologne, coffee, cologne, etc. I found this at Ross for $7 and it was a shot in the dark because they couldn&#x27;t even open the case so I could smell it. I got it in the car and boy did it do its job, made me crazy. The sandlewood, mixed with rich warm winter/autumn spices, with a slight smoky woodsy smell was JUST what I was looking for. I want it to mix with my husband&#x27;s clean, mountain man smell and not detract from it. It works so well, especially for him :) He&#x27;s only worn it a couple of times since Christmas, but it seems it has fair staying power I&#x27;d say half a day going in and outdoors.

            <li> Not my type of cologne.  I can see an older gentleman wearing this, but not a  young guy.  You definitely get the sandlewood in the basenotes.  The middle notes are of vanilla.  The dry down is musk.  All togethor this cologne is sandlewood, vanilla, and musk.  Not an overly complicated scent, but not for me.  Longetivity is good if you like it.  My biggest problem with this cologne is that the notes don&#x27;t mix well, it does nothing for the nose.  In all actuality I thought it smelled cheap.</li>
            <li> excellent product and service</li>
            <li> This cologne is very pleasant and smells like sandalwood. There is nothing truly unique or special about this fragrance, but it is inexpensive, long-lasting, and a great everyday type of scent. If you are looking for a pleasant smelling cologne to spray on in the morning before work, or before running about town during the day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Just don&#x27;t expect it to turn heads and smell as complex as a $200 bottle of Creed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s power is instant. It&#x27;s endurance is legendary. Let it shoot you like a musketball.  Behold, Kanon.</li>
            <li> This scent is woodsy and mossy, just as described, just doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe 3-4 hrs and by then it is very faint. Not a bad purchase and shipping was excellent and quick.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this for Christmas. She accidentally left the price tag on it so my expectations were low, especially because I tend to use premium colognes like Chrome Azzaro and Polo Black. However this is a pleasing and subtle scent. Its nice to have in my collection to change up my scent from time to time. This bottle will probably last a long time. Good value.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and love it! I applied some this morning and the scent is still going.Nice Woodsy, spicy scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice light scent. The scent does fade fast though.</li>
            <li> I originally found this scent discounted at Ross.  It has a very woody aroma.  The initial application does not go on strong so I had to apply liberally.  The fragrance does soften a little quicker than some I used but in close my wife says she can smell it on my all day.  Always a plus.</li>
            <li> Best of the Kanon scents!</li>
            <li> Earthy without being overpowering. Unique scent.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Picked it up at a store as a birthday gift for a full blooded Norwegian and as it would turn out it smells like something that could become a usual scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent.  We were so happy to find it on Amazon.  I love it too.  They delivered it as was promised, and we will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it smelled like Norwegian trees or Norwegian boners.  I took a chance and it smells like neither, what luck!</li>
            <li> Very good scent for the price !</li>
