            <li>Omg I so love this shadows</li>
            <li>I was trying to look for more like this</li>
            <li>I love all of the colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in love with this pallet for the price.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I am incredibly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors</li>
            <li>I love it love it</li>
            <li>love it  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything so affordable with such great color pay off either!</li>
            <li>but once u use the top surface first its all good</li>
            <li>Great fun to play with for the price ;-)</li>
            <li>And not bad at all for the price!</li>
            <li>They are super pigmented and if you like glitter you will love these.</li>
            <li>And i also got my free gift, tube of eyelid primer.</li>
            <li>These colors are silky and go on smooth.</li>
            <li>If you use the primer, which comes as a free gift, the colors will show up on your eyes very vibrantly!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that shimmered and it looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>I love my new eye shadow.</li>
            <li>, I began 2 like it more and more in a subtle kind of way.</li>
            <li>And the second day I showered with it on and it remained mostly intact!</li>
            <li>Packaged great - eyeshadow wasn&#x27;t broken, love the look of the palette cases.</li>
            <li>All of the eyeshadow i&#x27;ve tried so far has been some of my favorite go to</li>
            <li>I worked a Renaissance faire this weekend, and I was excited to start using my brand new palette for faire.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with more applicators, there is only 2.</li>
            <li>at first I thought it would make my eyelids look like a big explosion of glitter which is ok because I&#x27;m looking 4 something 2</li>
            <li>Another reviewer stated that the glitter is only on the top of the shadow, but there is glitter in the shadow as well, just finer grade.</li>
            <li>There is a big choice of colors and I love them all.</li>
            <li>it was glittery for the first application, but then then the glitter went away.</li>
            <li>I would probably not wear any of the &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; colors from one pallet to a professional workplace, but the other pallet that comes in this shipment is perfect for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li>They are pretty gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>All of these colors are so pretty and vibrant...</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>They all blend really well</li>
            <li>The color really popped IRL and stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>They have a very powdery smell that is a tad offensive to my nose.</li>
            <li>(If there was more you&#x27;d start looking like a drag queen.)</li>
            <li>The yellow in one of the pallets is worth buying it just for that!</li>
            <li>get more of a intense glitter effect (or use less of the product).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup at all, but it&#x27;s nice to have for when I do wear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really particular about my eyeshadow too.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be different from the last one I love the colors</li>
            <li>for me it&#x27;s highly pigmented</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I want vivid color.</li>
            <li>it came with a free little bottle of eye primer.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I added a little more glitter to the inner corners if my eyes.</li>
            <li>I only have tried a few colors, and it seemed like all of the glitter was on the top?</li>
            <li>I will absolutely continue to buy this product as long as it is in stock.</li>
            <li>Not like I expected but still pretty colors.</li>
            <li>but when u get right down to it</li>
            <li>In my pictures I used the light dove/white, the darker grey and put the purple over it to create a little color.</li>

            <li> In my pictures I used the light dove/white, the darker grey and put the purple over it to create a little color.</li>
            <li> The glitter is not overwhelming but it is certainly noticable.</li>
            <li> Lasts at least ten hours, very diverse color selection.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple color patterns, but the pictures I&#x27;ve taken don&#x27;t do the colors justice other than the one I&#x27;ve provided.</li>
            <li> the other, it stayed both days until the night.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that there is not a perfect white in this pallet, therefore the white you see on my picture is from another pallet I have from another brand.</li>
            <li> Colors are a little darker than I expected but I like them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about glitter falling down your clothes while you&#x27;re applying it...</li>
            <li> You should, however, give the primer at least 3 minutes to dry before you put eyeshadow over it.</li>
            <li> It will crease, of course, but show me an eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I think because I was in a hot location, like a club for example, I was sweating really bad.</li>
            <li> I think the ONLY bad thing i can say about Emori shadows is the smell.</li>

            <li> I just got mine today. I gotta say i love it! I&#x27;m really particular about my eyeshadow too. I want something That&#x27;s gonna pop. I want vivid color. I want sparkle. This stuff delivers. And i also got my free gift, tube of eyelid primer. Yay! Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> I love these colors! They all blend really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of glitter on my eyes the Glitter stays on brushes.  The colors are great tho.</li>
            <li> I like all the colors. They are pretty gentle on my skin. I definitely recommend them and will also buy again.</li>
            <li> Not like I expected but still pretty colors. Good for the price (:</li>
            <li> Nice and glittery. Bright colors. I got an extra gift,  a primer. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I was in awe when I saw this advertised! I love shimmer, and the one shimmer eyeshadow I had then was almost gone. I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup at all, but it&#x27;s nice to have for when I do wear it. I only have tried a few colors, and it seemed like all of the glitter was on the top? But there is about every color you can imagine, as shown. I do wish it came with more applicators, there is only 2. But when I have worn it, (out in the sun) people have noticed the glitter and complimented. And not bad at all for the price! When I do wear eyeshadow, this is the one I use.</li>
            <li> This set is fabulous !  One of my must haves. With using over the primer it won&#x27;t smudge or rub off even after along night out. Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> Great fun to play with for the price ;-)</li>
            <li> The glitter sits on top of the shadow put does not go all the way through it...it is nice shadow but not truly diamond glitter.</li>
            <li> Love them so did my daughter beautiful colors..</li>
            <li> Beautiful colour&#x27;s do recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and I&#x27;ve worn it out 2 times in 3 different colors and 2 different colors!!!! at first I thought it would make my eyelids look like a big explosion of glitter which is ok because I&#x27;m looking 4 something 2 make my eyes POP, but after I started 2 use some color(s), I began 2 like it more and more in a subtle kind of way. for me it&#x27;s highly pigmented, it has enough glitter in the product and u can always increase the application of color 2 get more of a intense glitter effect (or use less of the product). I did have some fallout that hit my face and I&#x27;d 2 wipe that off but I was using a brush and applying more of the eyeshadow. I use a primer 2 make the product and color last longer when I&#x27;m out. I&#x27;ve no complaints!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be different from the last one I love the colors but once u use the top surface first its all good but when u get right down to it I don&#x27;t see glitter that&#x27;s what I was paying for so now what do I do with it I can&#x27;t afford to send it back cost a arm and a leg so what do u suggest that I do?</li>
            <li> it came with a free little bottle of eye primer. but  I wish the yellow in the night pallet was brighter but that&#x27;s just ME!!! if the yellow was brighter I would have given it a five star!</li>
            <li> I love these. They are super pigmented and if you like glitter you will love these. Great variety of colors. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great color choices and highly pigmented!</li>
            <li> these shadows are &#x27;diamond&#x27; shadows. They are sparkly like diamonds but not glittery. These colors are silky and go on smooth. In my pictures I used the light dove/white, the darker grey and put the purple over it to create a little color. The color really popped IRL and stayed on all day. I loved it. I think the ONLY bad thing i can say about Emori shadows is the smell. They have a very powdery smell that is a tad offensive to my nose. Below you an see the look i created wit these, there are thousands of looks you could possibly do and these will last you a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - i received these items in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> Packaged great - eyeshadow wasn&#x27;t broken, love the look of the palette cases. I don&#x27;t know if it was the primer they added in there with it, or just the eyeshadow itself, but it STAYS. It will crease, of course, but show me an eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t after a few hours. I worked a Renaissance faire this weekend, and I was excited to start using my brand new palette for faire. Well, with being out in the rain one day and glaring sun (sweating!) the other, it stayed both days until the night. (Different colors each day, but both stayed the same.) And the second day I showered with it on and it remained mostly intact! (It will rub off the brow line a bit, but the lids still looked perfect.) Best of all, when my boyfriend saw me on the sunny day, he said it really POPS in the sunlight. Great product! I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I love how this eyeshadow goes in smooth! Don&#x27;t have to worry about glitter falling down your clothes while you&#x27;re applying it...thanks I love it!!!</li>
            <li> All the awesome colors, and they really do stay. I think because I was in a hot location, like a club for example, I was sweating really bad. It IS Summer in Texas afterall! :D</li>

            <li> Omg I so love this shadows I use them every day . Great product   I was trying to look for more like this but I count find them</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS! Great pigment. Will buy again. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I love all of the colors. If you use the primer, which comes as a free gift, the colors will show up on your eyes very vibrantly! You should, however, give the primer at least 3 minutes to dry before you put eyeshadow over it. I have tried multiple color patterns, but the pictures I&#x27;ve taken don&#x27;t do the colors justice other than the one I&#x27;ve provided. All of these colors are so pretty and vibrant... I&#x27;m just in love with this pallet for the price. The only flaw is that there is not a perfect white in this pallet, therefore the white you see on my picture is from another pallet I have from another brand. Additionally, I added a little more glitter to the inner corners if my eyes. Regardless, I am incredibly satisfied with this product. The glitter is not overwhelming but it is certainly noticable. I would probably not wear any of the &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; colors from one pallet to a professional workplace, but the other pallet that comes in this shipment is perfect for a more subtle look. I will absolutely continue to buy this product as long as it is in stock.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors</li>
            <li> I love it love it love it  the colors are just bright blend really good use the makeup brushes blend and you will look  wonderfull</li>
            <li> Colors are a little darker than I expected but I like them.</li>
            <li> All of the eyeshadow i&#x27;ve tried so far has been some of my favorite go to&#x27;s. I have never found anything so affordable with such great color pay off either! The yellow in one of the pallets is worth buying it just for that! Here is a look I did with both pallets. Mascara is from them as well.</li>
            <li> Not has glitter as I thought it was!! You can&#x27;t see the glitter on ur eyeshadow at all!! It&#x27;s ok nothing to be happy with!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love love, this eye shadow!!!! Very beautiful, vibrant, and who doesn&#x27;t love sparkles!?</li>
            <li> Christmas gift that was loved.</li>
            <li> bought and only have used it a handful of times. i have to apply it multiple times to get the color to actual stick. it was glittery for the first application, but then then the glitter went away.</li>
            <li> one application....next day, eye lids swollen.</li>
            <li> After one use the glitter is gone</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived on time</li>
