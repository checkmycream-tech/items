    <ol>
            <li>perfect waxer!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>I just used it two days ago and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Great value, no complaints!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>it smells great</li>
            <li>feels great all around great product</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Great waxing pot.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>What a wax wamer, perfect for use with most waxes.</li>
            <li>So I am using Satin Smooth wax now that fits perfectly, and can be refilled, which is a plus point</li>
            <li>Nothing works as good as this.</li>
            <li>It heats up even the thickest of waxes in a good time frame.</li>
            <li>Good warmer.</li>
            <li>I wish they made a more compact warmer and waxes.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>could use better description on the waxes that can be used, and if they will work with cloth strips or not.</li>
            <li>I love this warmer.</li>
            <li>and i still love it and use it alot.</li>
            <li>It shipped 5 days before the expected delivery which was awesome!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Good quality-easy to use but price is too high</li>
            <li>This works fine and keeps wax at a comfortable temperature.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to clean off and does the job well.</li>
            <li>very useful.</li>
            <li>Simply the best you can get - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Seller was quick to mail.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>heated up wax quickly and stayed warm for a long time.</li>
            <li>This product comes with a few cardboard rings to go around the top of the machine and keep wax drips off of the top rim.  </li>
            <li>This is my first wax warmer to use and my friend recommended this one to me.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would have bought $110 salon style warmer that has a deep metal can whose edges protrude all the way to the top, eliminating any risk of wax seepage into the electric coil.</li>
            <li>it still gets hot.</li>
            <li>I had used the warmer that had two wax warmer sand wanted to get one for myself and got the single warmer and just love it.</li>
            <li>warmer is a bit large for keeping in the bathroom all of the time.</li>
            <li>More opitions for the temperature control, fast to heat up and cool down!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and basic, but works very well and is responsive to the temperature adjustments.</li>
            <li>It seemed very helpful and esay to use so</li>
            <li>This works very well with ALL waxes you can put into it.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot to be effective - no more scalding</li>
            <li>I used one time so far and it worked very well!</li>
            <li>so I went right back to get my trusted DIY wax pot.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a small clearance between top plastic and the top edge of the inner can, which can allow molten wax to seep into down to the heating coil whenever you wipe excess wax from your spreader with the edges.</li>
            <li>I was either stupid or very brave to have my wife put some wax on my whiskers&#x27; of my face; never again...</li>
            <li>Professional level wax warmer.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to pour the wax directly</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for the beauty professional like myself.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for someone who is not a licensed professional.</li>
            <li>Just thinking about a bikini line makes me shake with apprehension and I do not relish the thought of a woman using this product in sensitive areas...</li>
            <li>Warms quickly and wax heats evenly as long as you stir occasionally as the directions indicate.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s simple to use, better than the one I had previously since it is clear and has different settings as well as the on and off switch.  </li>
            <li>Same high quality product, professionally made and looking.</li>
            <li>I really do not know why a person would put themselves in a position for so much pain.</li>
            <li>It is a little larger unit, but the functionality is worth the loss of counter-top space.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this warmer a lot. The brand of wax that coordinates with it works well on tough hair and it doesn&#x27;t need to get too hot to be effective - no more scalding myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer is a bit large for keeping in the bathroom all of the time. I wish they made a more compact warmer and waxes. I love it though. This one is easy to clean off and does the job well.</li>
            <li> perfect waxer! Seller was quick to mail. This product does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> What a wax wamer, perfect for use with most waxes.</li>
            <li> Love it. It can&#x27;t get any simpler to use.</li>
            <li> I have bought the blue satin wax and this warmer works as expected.  I was afraid that it would not heat up the wax but it does just like the machines I see used by salons.</li>
            <li> Excellent. The product was on time in my home</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s simple to use, better than the one I had previously since it is clear and has different settings as well as the on and off switch.  very useful.</li>
            <li> This is my first wax warmer to use and my friend recommended this one to me. I just used it two days ago and it worked great! heated up wax quickly and stayed warm for a long time. Overall a great product and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Good quality-easy to use but price is too high</li>
            <li> Had the personal version for YEARS and it finally got so messed up and started heating slow, so I decided to get a new one.  Not entirely sure why I went with this one, but I really like it!</li>
            <li> could use better description on the waxes that can be used, and if they will work with cloth strips or not.</li>
            <li> Professional level wax warmer.  Simply the best you can get - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I had hoped it would be. It&#x27;s easy to use and basic, but works very well and is responsive to the temperature adjustments.</li>
            <li> Greattttt.  I loveeeeeeeeee it it smells great feels great all around great product would order again n again and again</li>
            <li> I chose this one coz I saw it on the video that somebody was showing how to do hair waxing. It seemed very helpful and esay to use so I ordered it online. I used one time so far and it worked very well! More opitions for the temperature control, fast to heat up and cool down!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant in buying this warmer, but read other reviews and bought it. This works very well with ALL waxes you can put into it. I wanted to pour the wax directly but there&#x27;s a small clearance between top plastic and the top edge of the inner can, which can allow molten wax to seep into down to the heating coil whenever you wipe excess wax from your spreader with the edges. So I am using Satin Smooth wax now that fits perfectly, and can be refilled, which is a plus point and that&#x27;s why I bought this. Otherwise I would have bought $110 salon style warmer that has a deep metal can whose edges protrude all the way to the top, eliminating any risk of wax seepage into the electric coil. This works fine and keeps wax at a comfortable temperature. The Lid will not close after you insert the wax Canister maybe because of the wax collars.</li>
            <li> Salon quality!  Warms quickly and wax heats evenly as long as you stir occasionally as the directions indicate.  This product comes with a few cardboard rings to go around the top of the machine and keep wax drips off of the top rim.  It is a little larger unit, but the functionality is worth the loss of counter-top space.</li>
            <li> I love this warmer. I had used the warmer that had two wax warmer sand wanted to get one for myself and got the single warmer and just love it. Same high quality product, professionally made and looking. I recommend this product for the beauty professional like myself.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected,  but for less $ then the beauty supply stores. Would not recommend for someone who is not a licensed professional.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for a year and i still love it and use it alot. it still gets hot. i would give 10 stars if i could. its alot cheaper waxing yourself than going to get it done at a spa.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Great waxing pot. Nothing works as good as this. It comes with two of the protective collars as well. I&#x27;ve had one of these for years until a spill covered it in wax and I couldn&#x27;t get it off so I went right back to get my trusted DIY wax pot. It shipped 5 days before the expected delivery which was awesome! except that the wax has not arrived as yet which I purchased from a different seller. It heats up even the thickest of waxes in a good time frame. Its not instantaneous so plan ahead!</li>
            <li> This time I waspleased to have received my order correctly</li>
            <li> Good warmer. Great value, no complaints!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! It works great.</li>
            <li> Product heats up the insert wax containers in a timely manner. I was either stupid or very brave to have my wife put some wax on my whiskers&#x27; of my face; never again... I really do not know why a person would put themselves in a position for so much pain. My hat is off to those that use wax to pull out unwanted hair growth. Just thinking about a bikini line makes me shake with apprehension and I do not relish the thought of a woman using this product in sensitive areas... It works, but I guess I do not have the pain threshold I thought I had.</li>
            <li> works extremely well!</li>
    </ol>
