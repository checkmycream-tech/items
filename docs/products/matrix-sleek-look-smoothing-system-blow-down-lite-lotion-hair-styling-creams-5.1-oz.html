            <li>This works ok, but have to wash more often.</li>
            <li>I really do love it.</li>
            <li>The cream keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking when I use my hair straightener or blow dryer.</li>

            <li>EXACTLY!!!  </li>
            <li>so I was thrilled that Amazon carried it and for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>went from being like a brillo pad to being much more manageable and frizzy free.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that you do not need a lot of this product if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much! :)</li>
            <li>I like this product, it keeps my hair smooth and silky, I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, but prevents frizzing as well.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>AND much, much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Also, amazon had it at the right price!</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it here.  </li>
            <li>This product is no longer available in stores and I really missed it.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the product...</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for my slightly wavy frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>The LITE lotion works better for me as my hair stays soft feeling and can be touched up the next day by wetting it and applying a bit more Matrix Lite.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair smooth and nice and I have fine long blonde hair that will frizz in humidity.  </li>
            <li>in all, great product, but I will buy from a different seller next time.</li>
            <li>The bottle makes it look like it may be a knockoff, so I&#x27;m not convinced it is the real deal!</li>
            <li>but I still love the Matrix sleek shampoo and regular sleek conditioner</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product on the shelves recently</li>
            <li>Used this for many years but the Company does not make it the same anymore.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my mom, at department stores this runs for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Love having my Sleek back.</li>
            <li>Great cream to style hair but hard to find!</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair, Matrix sleek gives it a very smooth</li>
            <li>It makes my hair easier to blow dry and makes is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>This product helps to keep my bumpy/wavy hair straight and stops the fizz.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>Does not work as well or the same as I use to buy from the store when it was available in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very diluted and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair much smoother after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it smooth even if I choose not to wash it the next day.</li>
            <li>The lotion is lite and my hair does feel really silky after drying.</li>
            <li>This product is lite, does not make the hair stiff, and gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li>They charged me 6.00 more than the actual shipping cost, so there was no excuse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this blow down lite lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li>Since JC Penney doesn&#x27;t carry this same prduct any more, I ordered it from Amazon and was so dissapointed to find the quality of the cream not meeting the standard.</li>
            <li>I blow dry only and my hair stays sleek and frizz free ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for the past 10 years from JC Penney Saloon and was quite pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>the silky smooth texture I desire with out weighting it down or making it staticy.</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh down my fine blonde hair and it makes it SO soft!</li>
            <li>and when I use this product I can dry it straight</li>
            <li>Have been using this product line for nearly 10 years for my out of control naturally curly hair ( especially in the humidity of summer).  </li>
            <li>My daughter, who has naturally curly hair uses it whenever she comes home for a visit, she loves to use it after she flat irons her hair!</li>
            <li>I have very thick fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for those with curly hair, but don&#x27;t mix it with another hair product as then your hair will get weighed down.  </li>

            <li> Tired many other products, that one I&#x27;m sticking with.</li>
            <li> In the past when I used this product it was much thicker and easier to use because of this.  </li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time, several months.</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the last purchase due to my buying four</li>
            <li> One tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I allow my hair to air dry and NEVER use a dryer.</li>
            <li> Helps with her frizz and only uses a little, 1 bottle lasts her a year or so.</li>
            <li> This Blow  Down Lite Lotion Hair Styling Cream tames it whether I blow it dry or air dry.</li>
            <li> It was delivered when I expected it, packed well</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might not be exactly the same thing as I buy at hairdresser, but it IS....</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount for coverage and the bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I bought it due to price</li>
            <li> I have short hair and use just a small amount after washing and conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not aware of.  </li>
            <li> and the seller squashed all four into a small box with no padding or anything and the tubes broke open in shipping.</li>
            <li> I used the extreme cream one.</li>
            <li> and then I usually style my hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> What a mucky mess.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a product that will tame it without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these days</li>
            <li> This product controls the frizz on my thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> My course hair is very difficult to blow dry with a brush</li>
            <li> The cream is lathery and had poor consistency and didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Matrix has discontinued this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is no longer available in stores and I really missed it.  Luckily I found it here.  My course hair is very difficult to blow dry with a brush but this product makes the brush just glide through.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, Matrix sleek gives it a very smooth look.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this is the first product that helps it stay in beautiful ringlets and keeps it from fizzing no matter what the weather.  I have been using it for a couple of years.  The LITE lotion works better for me as my hair stays soft feeling and can be touched up the next day by wetting it and applying a bit more Matrix Lite.  I allow my hair to air dry and NEVER use a dryer.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Thank you very much! :)</li>
            <li> This works so well for me, so of course, they have stopped making it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and I would use it again!  It makes my hair easier to blow dry and makes is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and when I use this product I can dry it straight and it gives it a nice sheen</li>
            <li> The bottle makes it look like it may be a knockoff, so I&#x27;m not convinced it is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This product controls the frizz on my thick wavy hair.  I only need a small amount for coverage and the bottle lasts for months. I apply this product before I use a blow dryer and then I usually style my hair with a flat iron.  My hair is smoother, shinier, and softer when I&#x27;ve applied this product than when I haven&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that you do not need a lot of this product if you have fine hair. It smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> This product helps to keep my bumpy/wavy hair straight and stops the fizz.  Bottle lasts about 2 months using a pea size about. Love it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair but I still love the Matrix sleek shampoo and regular sleek conditioner I purchase them regularly</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the product...I bought it due to price but I don&#x27;t really like it.  Just me I guess</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Hair went from being like a brillo pad to being much more manageable and frizzy free.</li>
            <li> Matrix has replaced this product with another that is not the same.  This product is lite, does not make the hair stiff, and gives a nice shine. I have short hair and use just a small amount after washing and conditioning my hair.  One tube lasts a long time, several months. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well or the same as I use to buy from the store when it was available in stores. The texture is not the same and&lt;br /&gt;does not work as well for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this blow down lite lotion for many years.  The smell is wonderful, it&#x27;s light and is wonderful for styling my hair and controlling frizz.  It&#x27;s hard to find these days so I was thrilled that Amazon carried it and for such a great price.  It was delivered when I expected it, packed well and  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> In the past when I used this product it was much thicker and easier to use because of this.  I don&#x27;t know if the company changed their product or something happened I&#x27;m not aware of.  So, I&#x27;m sort of happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product line for nearly 10 years for my out of control naturally curly hair ( especially in the humidity of summer).  it&#x27;s the best product I have found for control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and couldn&#x27;t find anymore. I bought from this site and the product is not the same. It&#x27;s very diluted and doesn&#x27;t work as well. If it didn&#x27;t cost me $ to send back I would have sent back immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I usually buy it at y hairdresser but can get pretty pricey.  I was afraid it might not be exactly the same thing as I buy at hairdresser, but it IS....EXACTLY!!!  AND much, much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Have been using it for probably 8 years or so.  It makes my hair much smoother after blow drying.  Some of these types of products have a lot of alcohol which is not the greatest for your hair and causes a lot of dryness.  I don&#x27;t find this to be a problem with Matrix 3.  My hair is somewhat coarse and curly.  I put this on before blow drying and my hair is silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair smooth and nice and I have fine long blonde hair that will frizz in humidity.  I had an issue with the last purchase due to my buying four and the seller squashed all four into a small box with no padding or anything and the tubes broke open in shipping. What a mucky mess.  So for you sellers, please ship properly.  They charged me 6.00 more than the actual shipping cost, so there was no excuse. BUT the good news is that Amazon refunded me promptly with no hassle :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product, but I will buy from a different seller next time.</li>
            <li> I ordered Matrix Sleek Look Smoothing System from Amazon. I have been buying this product for the past 10 years from JC Penney Saloon and was quite pleased with the quality of the product. Since JC Penney doesn&#x27;t carry this same prduct any more, I ordered it from Amazon and was so dissapointed to find the quality of the cream not meeting the standard. The cream is lathery and had poor consistency and didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for making my frizz behave. Unfortunately Matrix has discontinued this product. That&#x27;s why I bought over a dozen of them.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheap. Works well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; (?) to use before blow-drying and straightening my hair. Never feels greasy, smooths my hair and leaves it shiny, silky and &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Gets my wavy hair the silky smooth texture I desire with out weighting it down or making it staticy. Keeps it smooth even if I choose not to wash it the next day. Tired many other products, that one I&#x27;m sticking with. Order it here and got a wonderful extra gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s great for taming frizzes. One tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick fine hair.  Hard to find a product that will tame it without weighing it down.  This works ok, but have to wash more often.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for someone that loves it.</li>
            <li> May daughter loves this...says it works great!</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and frizzy. This Blow  Down Lite Lotion Hair Styling Cream tames it whether I blow it dry or air dry. I really do love it.</li>
            <li> Great cream to style hair but hard to find! So I bought several.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product on the shelves recently so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The cream keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking when I use my hair straightener or blow dryer. My favorite part is the fragrance. Matrix Sleek Look is my favorite hair product because the smell makes me happy all day.</li>
            <li> Used this for many years but the Company does not make it the same anymore. It does not work the way it used to before. I used the extreme cream one.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it keeps my hair smooth and silky, I have been using it for years. The seller had  great price and quick shipping. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This smoothing lotion is great for curly hair.  Not only does it smell great, but prevents frizzing as well.  Would highly recommend it for those with curly hair, but don&#x27;t mix it with another hair product as then your hair will get weighed down.  Product arrived on time and as pictured.</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for years and it works well with my hair.  Also, amazon had it at the right price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my slightly wavy frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident. From the first time I used it, I fell in love with it. After I wash my hair, I put some conditioner on and then I put the Matrix product on.  Then I blow dry my hair flat. It makes my hair shiny and smooth.  Love it.  Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. The lotion is lite and my hair does feel really silky after drying. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This blown-down lite lotion is awesome, it protects my hair from the heat of the blow dryer. I love how sleek it makes my hair look.  My daughter, who has naturally curly hair uses it whenever she comes home for a visit, she loves to use it after she flat irons her hair!</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly effective smoothing tool. I blow dry only and my hair stays sleek and frizz free ALL DAY! It does not weigh down my fine blonde hair and it makes it SO soft!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my mom, at department stores this runs for a much higher price. Mom says she LOVES it! Helps with her frizz and only uses a little, 1 bottle lasts her a year or so.</li>
            <li> Love having my Sleek back. Nothing tames my hair better.</li>
