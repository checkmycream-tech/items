            <li>she now wants me to buy her more!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love bare minerals foundation,it feels natural and it looks awesome  .i</li>
            <li>Certainly looks like nice even with out make up.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and silky ,smooth on you face.  </li>
            <li>Although light weight and does not settle into wrinkles, it made my skin feel itchy.</li>
            <li>Apply with a light hand.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy, I can&#x27;t feel it on me, but it still makes my skin looks smooth and perfect.</li>
            <li>try to clean it...</li>
            <li>The color of this is quite yellow(called golden medium).  </li>
            <li>One, you need the right brush (the one that comes in the starter kit.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling light, fresh, and natural.</li>
            <li>Last, just make sure you get the right color.  </li>
            <li>Quick &amp; Easy to apply, covers evenly, light &amp; breathable, provides some protection from the sun, a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the third time I buy it</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of weeks to figure out how exactly to use this, but, once I got it, I was and am hooked.  </li>
            <li>Lightly and in a circular motion start at the outer edges, near your jawline, and start applying.  </li>
            <li>Add more foundation in the same way and then go over your eyes, nose, cheeks.  </li>
            <li>There is a smaller brush (again, it comes with the starter kit) for more concentrated application.  </li>
            <li>if only they saw me without makeup :) )  </li>
            <li>When it first changed they used to stay locked, seemed to work well.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey for a tiny little jar but works great</li>
            <li>In fact, I recommend the starter kit because it gives you absolutely everything you need to begin).  </li>
            <li>But, this brightens your whole face.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve never had any big skin problems, so I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage, just a foundation that will smooth and even where</li>
            <li>and you have nothing on, but you could add any amount to your skin, depending on how much you need for any given event or just how much help your skin needs, and it will look natural.  </li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I purchased it to do, and was worth every penny that I spent on it.</li>
            <li>be prepared to live with that stain.</li>
            <li>This looks like it is so natural</li>
            <li>In the last year or so, Bare Minerals came up with a new container design, and the item shipped to me was in the old container.</li>
            <li>This color is supposedly for those with golden or olive skin, but what I found out from a representative at a local makeup store (after trying and HATING this color) is that the \\&quot;golden\\&quot; color line was created for people of Asian descent, so the Golden Medium base made me look like I had a nice case of jaundice.  </li>
            <li>I just started using the Bare Minerals line this year</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for about 6 years and don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
            <li>unfortuneately, the last three bare minerals products i have bought, all have a flaw in the locking mechanism.</li>

            <li> unfortuneately, the last three bare minerals products i have bought, all have a flaw in the locking mechanism.</li>
            <li> bought several at once, shipping cost a little high though at 11.99 for 3.</li>
            <li> Love the color match to my skin,it really lasts all day long and never feels heavy or fake.</li>
            <li> and I will probably keep on buying it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to jamming a screwdriver into the holes to break up when I&#x27;m getting low -- there&#x27;s always some left down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does tone down the red skin, but it takes awhile to get used to how yellow the product is.</li>
            <li> cause you only have to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Generally I love BareMinerals products, this was just a bad description for color matching purposes.</li>
            <li> Also, do use the warmth, which is not really a bronzer although it looks like one...but don&#x27;t use it like one.  </li>
            <li> I am living with a stain now,  when you wet it...</li>
            <li> Actually, I often sleep with this because I&#x27;m just too lazy to remove it, and I have never had a breakout.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other foundation.</li>
            <li> The couple of times I&#x27;ve grabbed something from the drugstore or tried something new from Sephora, I have either broken out or it just looked cakey and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t remove the sifter part when it starts getting low, which makes it hard to get the makeup out.</li>
            <li> This can only mean that the product is at least a year old, if not more.</li>
            <li> then move to my temple and down the edge of my cheekbone.  </li>
            <li> i will never use any other make up!</li>
            <li> Two, if you have never used this type of foundation it is going to take a little practice.  </li>
            <li> Get a little of the powder on the brush and then tap off the excess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> have been using it for at least 5 years now</li>
            <li> 50+ skin not a good combo.</li>
            <li> it gets worse.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone, so finding a base color can be tricky.  </li>
            <li> do hate the newer containers, though.</li>
            <li> I use medium beige but look horrible in just the medium.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I mix this with the Light foundation and get the perfect shade for me. Love love love BareMinerals!</li>
            <li> I just started using the Bare Minerals line this year and I will never go back to liquid foundation!  Bare Minerals feels great on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  The coverage is great and it looks so natural.  Make sure that you have one of the Bare Minerals brushes to use with this product for the best results.  There are so many shades that you can find the perfect shade for any skin color!  I recommend this to all skin types!</li>
            <li> It feels light and silky ,smooth on you face.  Certainly looks like nice even with out make up.  I like it for this foudation.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the third time I buy it and I will probably keep on buying it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Same product I have been using for years.  This is the &#x27;larger size&#x27;of the product.  Good deal.  bought several at once, shipping cost a little high though at 11.99 for 3.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone, so finding a base color can be tricky.  This color is supposedly for those with golden or olive skin, but what I found out from a representative at a local makeup store (after trying and HATING this color) is that the \\&quot;golden\\&quot; color line was created for people of Asian descent, so the Golden Medium base made me look like I had a nice case of jaundice.  Generally I love BareMinerals products, this was just a bad description for color matching purposes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She requested it as a gift because she uses it...she now wants me to buy her more! It must be good. It&#x27;s lasted her more than a year.</li>
            <li> 50+ skin not a good combo. Although light weight and does not settle into wrinkles, it made my skin feel itchy.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I purchased it to do, and was worth every penny that I spent on it. Would definitely purchase this brand and product again if a similar need arises.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals is the best makeup for me! I love it. I have been using Bare Minerals for about 6 years and don&#x27;t want to change.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; Easy to apply, covers evenly, light &amp; breathable, provides some protection from the sun, a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it!!! A bit pricey for a tiny little jar but works great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years...I would not use another foundation.  There are several things to consider when you use this.  One, you need the right brush (the one that comes in the starter kit.  In fact, I recommend the starter kit because it gives you absolutely everything you need to begin).  Two, if you have never used this type of foundation it is going to take a little practice.  It took me a couple of weeks to figure out how exactly to use this, but, once I got it, I was and am hooked.  Get a little of the powder on the brush and then tap off the excess.  Lightly and in a circular motion start at the outer edges, near your jawline, and start applying.  Add more foundation in the same way and then go over your eyes, nose, cheeks.  It takes all of 10 seconds to apply and it absolutely is flawless.  You can add more and never overdo it.  There is a smaller brush (again, it comes with the starter kit) for more concentrated application.  This is great under your eyes, on your eyelashes to make them thicker when you apply mascara, on a blemish, or wherever.  Trust me.  I always get compliments on my skin and how great it looks (if only they saw me without makeup :) )  Actually, I often sleep with this because I&#x27;m just too lazy to remove it, and I have never had a breakout.  The couple of times I&#x27;ve grabbed something from the drugstore or tried something new from Sephora, I have either broken out or it just looked cakey and unnatural.  This looks like it is so natural and you have nothing on, but you could add any amount to your skin, depending on how much you need for any given event or just how much help your skin needs, and it will look natural.  Last, just make sure you get the right color.  I use medium beige but look horrible in just the medium.  It does make a difference.  Also, do use the warmth, which is not really a bronzer although it looks like one...but don&#x27;t use it like one.  Again, it is a tap on the lid of the container then I start at my cheekbone then move to my temple and down the edge of my cheekbone.  This looks like the shape of a \\&quot;3\\&quot; or \\&quot;E\\&quot;..hope that make sense.  But, this brightens your whole face.  Add the mineral veil and I promise you will never go back to anything else.  P.S.  Don&#x27;t try ANY of the ones from drugstores or elsewhere.  While they do try to replicate this product, they do not come close.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Have tried others but Bare Escentials is the best.</li>
            <li> this make up is light and beautiful. I am 53 and really love how it makes me feel and look . Love the color match to my skin,it really lasts all day long and never feels heavy or fake.</li>
            <li> Chalky. Not like the ones I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for almost ten years. It still works just as well for me. It isn&#x27;t heavy, I can&#x27;t feel it on me, but it still makes my skin looks smooth and perfect. That being said, I&#x27;ve never had any big skin problems, so I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage, just a foundation that will smooth and even where needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hate the newer containers, though. You can&#x27;t remove the sifter part when it starts getting low, which makes it hard to get the makeup out. I&#x27;ve taken to jamming a screwdriver into the holes to break up when I&#x27;m getting low -- there&#x27;s always some left down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I love BareMinerals. I won&#x27;t use any other foundation.</li>
            <li> unfortuneately, the last three bare minerals products i have bought, all have a flaw in the locking mechanism. Where in my makeup bag, it will unlock and dump alot of product in the top. Then when you open it, powder goes everywhere.  If it happens to you with the &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34;...be prepared to live with that stain. I love bare minerals and thought it was a wonderful idea to put the lock on there, to avoid loss or stain.  When it first changed they used to stay locked, seemed to work well. But now, why put it on there if it doesnt stay locked? I am living with a stain now,  when you wet it...try to clean it...it gets worse.</li>
            <li> Great price and it&#x27;s authentic. I have been using this for years. I&#x27;m an Asian and have olive skin and this Golden Medium fits my skin just perfect.</li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals has a great product. It leaves my skin feeling light, fresh, and natural. There are a plethora of powder foundations but I have found bare escentuals to be the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My aunt got me the starter kit and got me hooked on it. I break out easily. I don&#x27;t notice this stuff making me break out.</li>
            <li> In the last year or so, Bare Minerals came up with a new container design, and the item shipped to me was in the old container. This can only mean that the product is at least a year old, if not more. I&#x27;m sure it is just fine, but that&#x27;s the reason it&#x27;s cheaper than what you find at Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> The color of this is quite yellow(called golden medium).  Apply with a light hand.  It does tone down the red skin, but it takes awhile to get used to how yellow the product is.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love bare minerals foundation,it feels natural and it looks awesome  .i have been using it for at least 5 years now and i&#x27;m really happy with the product.also it lasts forever cause you only have to use a little at a time. i will never use any other make up!</li>
