            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>Both are excellent, but at $80.00 more, it&#x27;s not justification if you are not doing makeup for a living.</li>
            <li>Top of the line and no doubt one of the best products out there!</li>
            <li>All in all, the sigma kabuki brushes are good quality brushes, but they are pricey.</li>
            <li>Puts on product perfectly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good selection of brushes.</li>
            <li>I thought I had good brushes until I received the Sigma brushes.</li>

            <li>just received my new set of brush from sigma today, OMG, I am very happy with them, great quality, I even ordered a brush case that I am already totally in love with.</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes.</li>
            <li>The tapered brush is also amazing</li>
            <li>They are amazing @__@</li>
            <li>They are truly the best high end brushes !</li>
            <li>but I just bought a set from LAMORA, and I honestly cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I am new to this makeup world, was desparate for a flawless foundation makeup.</li>
            <li>Each one is so soft and allows for great buffing and definition!</li>
            <li>These are by far the best quality and priced well.</li>
            <li>but I use the more rounded angled one to contour cheekbones and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>(and also there weren&#x27;t many good quality \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; brushes available during that time</li>
            <li>so much they arrived before the estimated date and the packaging was beautiful</li>
            <li>The brushes are very full, soft and just perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, there are better brushes out there now and for even cheaper.  </li>
            <li>cuz i was told they were top of the line</li>
            <li>/&gt;100 % satisfied</li>
            <li>Better them my Mac ones</li>
            <li>i have to say i love these sigma brushes and to my surprise</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is a better idea as the shipping is faster :)</li>
            <li>You would have never known this product was top of the line if you would see the packaging it arrived in.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I did.</li>
            <li>and i get such a flawless finish!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love sigma brushes and compared to my MAC ones</li>
            <li>With these brushes my makeup looks so much better</li>
            <li>Bout it as a gift to a makeup artist that is a friend of mine and she love it</li>
            <li>out onto my face upon every use and one of my wood handles came out of its metal top...</li>
            <li>The flat kabukis is the best one and my hg foundation brush.</li>
            <li>They were great - very satisfied would definitely recommend to anyone to buy them.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I love them so much, easy to use</li>
            <li>Great brushes, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li>Great soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I liked these they are good quality for daily use but not as structured as the MAC brushes</li>
            <li>They are full instead of being so light like most brushes.</li>
            <li>They are still a cheaper alternative to MAC brushes, but not THAT cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them almost everyday and still they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>so they will last me a while and their a great add to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and the makeup goes nice and smooth with them !</li>
            <li>I am surprised since this brand enjoys a good reputation.</li>
            <li>Also, while washing, there was some shedding... very minor which i&#x27;m impressed about since these brushes are pretty dense.  </li>
            <li>ends with flawless finish with the use of very less products.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t very convincing to where I was like WOW!</li>
            <li>These brushes are AMAZING quality that are very soft on the face do applying makeup is going to be fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to receive my brush set today.</li>
            <li>I compared these brushes to the original ones sold on sigma.com.</li>
            <li>I love them all with the flat top and tapered being my favorites!</li>
            <li>I am loving how soft the bristles are and how smoothly it touches my skin n</li>
            <li>It does a great job with liquid, loose, or pressed powder.</li>
            <li>Not to say super soft brushes apply products better, but these sigmax brushes are OK in terms of \\&quot;softeness\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The F84 is good for blush/bronzer, but I don&#x27;t apply those on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon and sigma :)</li>
            <li>Overall brushes are good.</li>
            <li>well they are soft, very dense, of good quality</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes because my regular foundation brushes were OK, but i needed something better.</li>
            <li>If you put to much blush on these brushes help you lighten the amount you put on easily with some pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li>I CAN PUT LIQUID FOUNDATION EASILY AND FAST, AND</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think that I would use all 5 of the Kabuki brushes but that is not the case at all!</li>
            <li>and i will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li>First of, the F86 tapered Kabuki is not as pointed as the original one.</li>
            <li>You can absolutely tell the difference in brushes after using these… they take perfection to a whole new level.. amazing for contouring, foundation, blush and getting into fine lines on the face</li>
            <li>These brushes are very thick and perfect for me.</li>
            <li>They are soft and blend so well and on top of that, they&#x27;re synthetic.</li>
            <li>however, are they as soft as many claim?</li>
            <li>I really am loving my recent discovery of Sigma.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>These brushes worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The finish isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth to buy.</li>
            <li>They are defininitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy the full kit with the 16 brushes but thought that I would try this first.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in a timely manner and in tact which is a rare find in itself.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>They work amazing, the application is so much better, less product waste, blends amazing!  </li>
            <li>They can right on time for my birthday</li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently upgraded all my makeup to natural and non-toxic and needed to find great synthetic brushes to accompany all the new cream formulas I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li>wow that was really quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer synthetic brushes; they dump more of the product on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will absolutely repurchase !</li>
            <li>On most brushes as you put pressure on them you can actually feel the handle of the brush on your face.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my MAC brushes that I&#x27;ve had for several years, and after asking many people as well as reading reviews I purchased these through Sigma.  </li>
            <li>but I know it will last longer that the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>I had to hot glue</li>
            <li>If you just need a foundation brush I would just get the f80 flat top brush.</li>
            <li>So sad i waited so long to get them, they are of great quality and the price is fair for what you get.</li>
            <li>All the brushes seems a bit taller/higher than the original, and the writing between the description and the word USA is too far apart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update (9/9/2016):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these brushes for 2 years now and they&#x27;ve really held up.</li>
            <li>I would say that after having tried out MAC brushes and now these Sigma/max ones, I much prefer MAC ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about these brushes ad just had to have them ...</li>
            <li>Really dense-</li>
            <li>Really well made and legit.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to buy them since the E25 and E30 brushes have a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li>my make up is so much easier</li>
            <li>SO MUCH YOUTUBE TUTORIALS AND RAVES ABOUT THESE BRUSHES THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>Brushes totally are worth it!  </li>
            <li>Lastly, it didn&#x27;t come with the original box as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality as advertised and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>and she need it for high quality works</li>
            <li>I wanted to get this set since it contained all 5 face brushes, including the infamous \\&quot;flat top kabuki\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong, a great buy.</li>
            <li>Considering that these brushes are still $20+ per brush, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was a big success.  </li>
            <li>Very soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>U can get the exact same ones for about 5$</li>
            <li>Good copy but not good enough.</li>
            <li>There heavy duty and strong</li>
            <li>it is very strange that one day these brushes are available &amp; the next day they are no longer listed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little obsessed with these brushes, I am a freelance make up artist and these brushes are perfect for blending and applying setting powder, foundation, and pressed powder.  </li>
            <li>- Soft to the touch&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are totally generic hahaha</li>
            <li>They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li>It looks so professional.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the brushes weren&#x27;t packaged in a box like the one shown in the images it was just in plastic wrappings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much use out of the flat angled one</li>
            <li>Flat angled is not angled as much.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I even gave it any stars is that I haven&#x27;t tried out the other brushes in the kit very much.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy sigma brushes in the near future!</li>
            <li>This brush set was going to be one of the presents for my adult daughter - but the cheap box they came in was crushed (not surprisingly).  </li>
            <li>They are soft, but not SUPER soft.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i have to say i love these sigma brushes and to my surprise</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon is a better idea as the shipping is faster :)</li>
            <li> You would have never known this product was top of the line if you would see the packaging it arrived in.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I did.</li>
            <li> and i get such a flawless finish!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes and compared to my MAC ones</li>
            <li> With these brushes my makeup looks so much better</li>
            <li> Bout it as a gift to a makeup artist that is a friend of mine and she love it</li>
            <li> out onto my face upon every use and one of my wood handles came out of its metal top...</li>
            <li> The flat kabukis is the best one and my hg foundation brush.</li>
            <li> They were great - very satisfied would definitely recommend to anyone to buy them.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love them so much, easy to use</li>
            <li> Great brushes, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li> Great soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked these they are good quality for daily use but not as structured as the MAC brushes</li>
            <li> They are full instead of being so light like most brushes.</li>
            <li> They are still a cheaper alternative to MAC brushes, but not THAT cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them almost everyday and still they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> so they will last me a while and their a great add to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and the makeup goes nice and smooth with them !</li>
            <li> I am surprised since this brand enjoys a good reputation.</li>
            <li> Also, while washing, there was some shedding... very minor which i&#x27;m impressed about since these brushes are pretty dense.  </li>
            <li> ends with flawless finish with the use of very less products.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t very convincing to where I was like WOW!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING quality that are very soft on the face do applying makeup is going to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive my brush set today.</li>
            <li> I compared these brushes to the original ones sold on sigma.com.</li>
            <li> I love them all with the flat top and tapered being my favorites!</li>
            <li> I am loving how soft the bristles are and how smoothly it touches my skin n</li>
            <li> It does a great job with liquid, loose, or pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Not to say super soft brushes apply products better, but these sigmax brushes are OK in terms of \\&quot;softeness\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The F84 is good for blush/bronzer, but I don&#x27;t apply those on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon and sigma :)</li>
            <li> Overall brushes are good.</li>
            <li> well they are soft, very dense, of good quality</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because my regular foundation brushes were OK, but i needed something better.</li>
            <li> If you put to much blush on these brushes help you lighten the amount you put on easily with some pressure on the brush.</li>
            <li> I CAN PUT LIQUID FOUNDATION EASILY AND FAST, AND</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think that I would use all 5 of the Kabuki brushes but that is not the case at all!</li>
            <li> and i will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> First of, the F86 tapered Kabuki is not as pointed as the original one.</li>
            <li> You can absolutely tell the difference in brushes after using these… they take perfection to a whole new level.. amazing for contouring, foundation, blush and getting into fine lines on the face</li>
            <li> These brushes are very thick and perfect for me.</li>
            <li> They are soft and blend so well and on top of that, they&#x27;re synthetic.</li>
            <li> however, are they as soft as many claim?</li>
            <li> I really am loving my recent discovery of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The finish isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth to buy.</li>
            <li> They are defininitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the full kit with the 16 brushes but thought that I would try this first.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in a timely manner and in tact which is a rare find in itself.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> They work amazing, the application is so much better, less product waste, blends amazing!  </li>
            <li> They can right on time for my birthday</li>
            <li> They are very soft and easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently upgraded all my makeup to natural and non-toxic and needed to find great synthetic brushes to accompany all the new cream formulas I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li> wow that was really quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer synthetic brushes; they dump more of the product on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will absolutely repurchase !</li>
            <li> On most brushes as you put pressure on them you can actually feel the handle of the brush on your face.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my MAC brushes that I&#x27;ve had for several years, and after asking many people as well as reading reviews I purchased these through Sigma.  </li>
            <li> but I know it will last longer that the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> I had to hot glue</li>
            <li> If you just need a foundation brush I would just get the f80 flat top brush.</li>
            <li> So sad i waited so long to get them, they are of great quality and the price is fair for what you get.</li>
            <li> All the brushes seems a bit taller/higher than the original, and the writing between the description and the word USA is too far apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update (9/9/2016):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these brushes for 2 years now and they&#x27;ve really held up.</li>
            <li> I would say that after having tried out MAC brushes and now these Sigma/max ones, I much prefer MAC ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about these brushes ad just had to have them ...</li>
            <li> Really dense-</li>
            <li> Really well made and legit.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to buy them since the E25 and E30 brushes have a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li> my make up is so much easier</li>
            <li> SO MUCH YOUTUBE TUTORIALS AND RAVES ABOUT THESE BRUSHES THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Brushes totally are worth it!  </li>
            <li> Lastly, it didn&#x27;t come with the original box as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality as advertised and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> and she need it for high quality works</li>
            <li> I wanted to get this set since it contained all 5 face brushes, including the infamous \\&quot;flat top kabuki\\&quot;!!!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong, a great buy.</li>
            <li> Considering that these brushes are still $20+ per brush, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was a big success.  </li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> U can get the exact same ones for about 5$</li>
            <li> Good copy but not good enough.</li>
            <li> There heavy duty and strong</li>
            <li> it is very strange that one day these brushes are available &amp; the next day they are no longer listed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed with these brushes, I am a freelance make up artist and these brushes are perfect for blending and applying setting powder, foundation, and pressed powder.  </li>
            <li> - Soft to the touch&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are totally generic hahaha</li>
            <li> They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
            <li> It looks so professional.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the brushes weren&#x27;t packaged in a box like the one shown in the images it was just in plastic wrappings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much use out of the flat angled one</li>
            <li> Flat angled is not angled as much.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I even gave it any stars is that I haven&#x27;t tried out the other brushes in the kit very much.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy sigma brushes in the near future!</li>
            <li> This brush set was going to be one of the presents for my adult daughter - but the cheap box they came in was crushed (not surprisingly).  </li>
            <li> They are soft, but not SUPER soft.  </li>
            <li> I use two of them almost daily, the flat brush and the tapered highlighter one.  </li>
            <li> If taken care of, they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like to use the flat kabuki for my liquid foundation to stipple it on.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m sure Mac or other expensive brushes would be.</li>
            <li> I use the other brushes with the flat one is dirty :)</li>
            <li> Absorbs so much foundation, it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> When you spend over $80 for brushes, the least they can do is provide decent packaging.  </li>
            <li> Some of the brushes were loose and coming apart.</li>
            <li> the will lighten it for you with not much pressure.</li>
            <li> They are big brushes and would be hard to use if your looking for a small area for application, the bristles are extremely soft and dense!</li>
            <li> After reading thorough reviews from amazon, and other medias, I decided on going for Sigma.</li>
            <li> I wish sigma didn&#x27;t raise their prices ever other day though.</li>
            <li> I do use the other brushes significantly less.</li>
            <li> There are other lower cost brands that you can compare with Sigma (Morphe is one!)</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife as a gift and since then 8 months ago, I&#x27;ve had to glue the black handle to the silver collar thing on all but one of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They looked as though they had been previously used.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the other reviewers realize that even ordering from Sigma, you don&#x27;t get a case with the brushes.</li>
            <li> used to buy my brushes from MAC and they shed a few months in.</li>
            <li> if you are looking to spend less, else spend away!</li>
            <li> but if and I doubt that I would try this brand again for this brush (at least), I would buy from the factory store and demand a refund.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> For reference, I put myself through nursing school as a cosmetologist , and I&#x27;ve used thousands of brushes because I&#x27;m a little obsessed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are a few things I noticed.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, whenever she cleans them the hairs/fibers fall off.</li>
            <li> I hope amazon can uncover the truth behind these.</li>
            <li> The #80 which was the main brush that I was looking to try was truly awful!!!!  </li>
            <li> These makeup brushes were extremely expensive and arrived in a bent, beat up thin carboard box.  </li>
            <li> and they do not seem to be fake.</li>
            <li> I honsetly dont think that they are fake at all</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived dirty looking &amp; broken.  </li>
            <li> Kinda expensive</li>
            <li> The brushes are very thin.</li>
            <li> They are not worth the money and the brushes have a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the time i decide to purchase these, sigma raised their prices!  </li>
            <li> I was actually disappointed when I received my order.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed at the quality of the bristles and handles.  </li>
            <li> again I will say, you will not go wrong with Sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!!  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this seller- do not buy from them!  </li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times and basically it is worthless to me!  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> For the price this kit is a snag! These are some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve worked with. They are soft and blend so well and on top of that, they&#x27;re synthetic. Personally, I prefer synthetic brushes; they dump more of the product on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Great Brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Great price on the kit&lt;br /&gt;-prime elligible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-requires maintenance (weekly washing) *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*not a con of these brushes but of make up brushes in general!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (9/9/2016):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these brushes for 2 years now and they&#x27;ve really held up. (I&#x27;ve included a photo of what they look like now)&lt;br /&gt; - No noticeable fiber loss.&lt;br /&gt; - Continue to apply my makeup evenly&lt;br /&gt; - Soft to the touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma F80 continues to be my bread and butter for foundation. It does a great job with liquid, loose, or pressed powder. I do use the other brushes significantly less. The F84 is good for blush/bronzer, but I don&#x27;t apply those on a daily basis. All in all, the sigma kabuki brushes are good quality brushes, but they are pricey. There are other lower cost brands that you can compare with Sigma (Morphe is one!) if you are looking to spend less, else spend away!</li>
            <li> I was actually disappointed when I received my order. The brushes weren&#x27;t all in the box and they were not all in perfect condition. Some of the brushes were loose and coming apart.</li>
            <li> They were the best mother&#x27;s day gift ! They are so soft and the makeup goes nice and smooth with them ! They are truly the best high end brushes ! Will absolutely repurchase !</li>
            <li> So i finally decided to purchase these Sigmax brushes after hearing such raves about it on youtube.  Unfortunately, the time i decide to purchase these, sigma raised their prices!  They are still a cheaper alternative to MAC brushes, but not THAT cheap. I wanted to get this set since it contained all 5 face brushes, including the infamous \\&quot;flat top kabuki\\&quot;!!! These brushes are quite dense I will say....however, are they as soft as many claim? I don&#x27;t think so.  They are soft, but not SUPER soft.  Not to say super soft brushes apply products better, but these sigmax brushes are OK in terms of \\&quot;softeness\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for makeup application.  They do give you a somewhat flawless application, but not OMG... they apply soooo flawlessly.  Also, while washing, there was some shedding... very minor which i&#x27;m impressed about since these brushes are pretty dense.  Considering that these brushes are still $20+ per brush, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this set again.  Also, there are better brushes out there now and for even cheaper.  I started out with MAC brushes cuz i was told they were top of the line (and also there weren&#x27;t many good quality \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; brushes available during that time 10+yrs ago lol).  I would say that after having tried out MAC brushes and now these Sigma/max ones, I much prefer MAC ones.</li>
            <li> Great brushes&lt;br /&gt;100 % satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about these brushes ad just had to have them ... well they are soft, very dense, of good quality and you do not have to worry about the hairs coming out  ... they just were not for me.  I have used 3 of them and prolly will use them periodically but not my favs.</li>
            <li> Yesssss, you are now MINE! I really am loving my recent discovery of Sigma. I&#x27;ve recently upgraded all my makeup to natural and non-toxic and needed to find great synthetic brushes to accompany all the new cream formulas I&#x27;m experiencing. These work wonderfully!! Each one is so soft and allows for great buffing and definition! LOVE!</li>
            <li> great brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> THE BEST BRUSHES I&#x27;VE EVER BOUGHT!&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy my brushes from MAC and they shed a few months in. I&#x27;ve had these for about 6 months and they are the most amazing brushes I have ever used! I&#x27;ve used them almost everyday and still they&#x27;re perfect. Must have! Well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work well for me. They are very soft and easy to use but they weren&#x27;t very convincing to where I was like WOW! I returned them a week later.</li>
            <li> I love them so much, easy to use</li>
            <li> Very good but I just bought a set from LAMORA, and I honestly cannot tell the difference. Both are excellent, but at $80.00 more, it&#x27;s not justification if you are not doing makeup for a living. For reference, I put myself through nursing school as a cosmetologist , and I&#x27;ve used thousands of brushes because I&#x27;m a little obsessed.</li>
            <li> Received these and looked over thoroughly and they do not seem to be fake. Feel amazing and work even better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed with these brushes, I am a freelance make up artist and these brushes are perfect for blending and applying setting powder, foundation, and pressed powder.  They are big brushes and would be hard to use if your looking for a small area for application, the bristles are extremely soft and dense! Its worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.  They work well with powder or liquid makeup.  Clean up wonderfully.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes worth every penny. I have been through a ton of brushes/brands. These are by far the best quality and priced well.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife as a gift and since then 8 months ago, I&#x27;ve had to glue the black handle to the silver collar thing on all but one of the brushes. To make matters worse, whenever she cleans them the hairs/fibers fall off. I hope amazon can uncover the truth behind these.</li>
            <li> Absorbs so much foundation, it&#x27;s ridiculous. The finish isn&#x27;t even worth it</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes. The flat kabukis is the best one and my hg foundation brush. The tapered brush is also amazing and I use for my concealer. I don&#x27;t get much use out of the flat angled one but I use the more rounded angled one to contour cheekbones and does an amazing job. Definitely worth to buy. If you just need a foundation brush I would just get the f80 flat top brush.</li>
            <li> wow that was really quick shipping! its a xmas present for my daughter, shes great at make up! will be attending school next spring.</li>
            <li> Best synthetic brushes I&#x27;ve used for a while! Great quality for the price. If taken care of, they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Everything I could ever want in a brush with our spending double or triple the amount like I&#x27;m sure Mac or other expensive brushes would be. Puts on product perfectly and smoothly. Good job Sigma!</li>
            <li> What can I say? Top of the line and no doubt one of the best products out there! Good selection of brushes.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think that I would use all 5 of the Kabuki brushes but that is not the case at all! I love them all with the flat top and tapered being my favorites!</li>
            <li> They were great - very satisfied would definitely recommend to anyone to buy them. Good quality and great price Happy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are full instead of being so light like most brushes. These brushes are the brushes doing the job. On most brushes as you put pressure on them you can actually feel the handle of the brush on your face. The brushes are very thin. These brushes are very thick and perfect for me. If you put to much blush on these brushes help you lighten the amount you put on easily with some pressure on the brush. The angles on the brushes are great&lt;br /&gt;on the will lighten it for you with not much pressure.</li>
            <li> I honsetly dont think that they are fake at all they work perfectly at my skin its amazinnng geeett it</li>
            <li> After reading about these sigma sigmax kabuki kit 5 brushes, I decided to buy them as I needed a good set of brushes and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great quality ! Better them my Mac ones</li>
            <li> I am new to this makeup world, was desparate for a flawless foundation makeup. After reading thorough reviews from amazon, and other medias, I decided on going for Sigma. I am happy that I decided for it.&lt;br /&gt;The products were sent in proper package. Each brush was covered with protection case. I am loving how soft the bristles are and how smoothly it touches my skin n ends with flawless finish with the use of very less products.&lt;br /&gt;Its awesome n again I will say, you will not go wrong with Sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li> i have to say i love these sigma brushes and to my surprise the gift was the smaller version i was in cloud nine thank u so much they arrived before the estimated date and the packaging was beautiful</li>
            <li> just received my new set of brush from sigma today, OMG, I am very happy with them, great quality, I even ordered a brush case that I am already totally in love with. Thank you sigma for making my day.</li>
            <li> U can get the exact same ones for about 5$ they are totally generic hahaha</li>
            <li> Legit brushes. Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish sigma didn&#x27;t raise their prices ever other day though. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  I use two of them almost daily, the flat brush and the tapered highlighter one.  I use the other brushes with the flat one is dirty :)</li>
            <li> Great brushes for creating a flawless face!</li>
            <li> These brushes were  NOT standard sized brushes. They are travel sized.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. The brushes are very full, soft and just perfect. I can use them to apply foundation, concealer, blush and bronzer. They are defininitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> You can absolutely tell the difference in brushes after using these… they take perfection to a whole new level.. amazing for contouring, foundation, blush and getting into fine lines on the face</li>
            <li> great brush and price</li>
            <li> This brush set was going to be one of the presents for my adult daughter - but the cheap box they came in was crushed (not surprisingly).  I am surprised since this brand enjoys a good reputation.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great! Really dense- if you like flimsy brushes, these aren&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing for foundation/bronzer/concealer. Really well made and legit. The packaging is flimsy (as others have indicated) however, the brushes come wrapped etc. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the other reviewers realize that even ordering from Sigma, you don&#x27;t get a case with the brushes. They are always sold separately. Just a head&#x27;s up. Ordering from Amazon is a better idea as the shipping is faster :)</li>
            <li> The order was shipped in a timely manner.  The brushes are high quality as advertised and well packaged.  These were bought for a friend of my wife&#x27;s in Thailand, so I haven&#x27;t actually used them, just received them and checked them out.</li>
            <li> Love my Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, so soft, no shedding.</li>
            <li> I liked these they are good quality for daily use but not as structured as the MAC brushes&lt;br /&gt;One brush was dented , but the others were perfect , will reorder the dented brush to replace&lt;br /&gt;Overall good.product</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived dirty looking &amp; broken.  They looked as though they had been previously used.  I was so disappointed in this seller- do not buy from them!  This seller doesn&#x27;t always have items for sale- it is very strange that one day these brushes are available &amp; the next day they are no longer listed.  Notice how their 5 star has nothing written!</li>
            <li> Brushes totally are worth it!  I needed to replace my MAC brushes that I&#x27;ve had for several years, and after asking many people as well as reading reviews I purchased these through Sigma.  They work amazing, the application is so much better, less product waste, blends amazing!  Will continue to replace my brushes with Sigma!</li>
            <li> Heard of these via Youtube. So sad i waited so long to get them, they are of great quality and the price is fair for what you get. I like to use the flat kabuki for my liquid foundation to stipple it on. Cant wait to try the rest.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality of the brushes!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes were extremely expensive and arrived in a bent, beat up thin carboard box.  When you spend over $80 for brushes, the least they can do is provide decent packaging.  You would have never known this product was top of the line if you would see the packaging it arrived in.  I would not recommend this purchase to anyone.  They are not worth the money and the brushes have a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> Happy with this brushes. I was really nervous to buy them since the E25 and E30 brushes have a lot of shedding. This brushes don&#x27;t have any shedding. My makeup looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the full kit with the 16 brushes but thought that I would try this first. Glad that I did. The #80 which was the main brush that I was looking to try was truly awful!!!!  It must be a manufacturing problem or something but the fibers/hairs are coming out in clumps. I have used it 3 times and basically it is worthless to me!  I am going to try the others but if and I doubt that I would try this brand again for this brush (at least), I would buy from the factory store and demand a refund.  The only reason that I even gave it any stars is that I haven&#x27;t tried out the other brushes in the kit very much.</li>
            <li> These make up brushes are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Great price, excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Doing my make up is so much easier and i get such a flawless finish!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying these brushes!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because my regular foundation brushes were OK, but i needed something better. These brushes are the softest ones i have ever used and it applies the foundation unlike anything that i have ever used. I love sigma brushes and compared to my MAC ones they are so much better for the amazing price! The package arrived in a timely manner and in tact which is a rare find in itself. With these brushes my makeup looks so much better and i will definitely be back for more! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive my brush set today. They can right on time for my birthday so I was supper happy. These brushes are AMAZING quality that are very soft on the face do applying makeup is going to be fantastic. There heavy duty and strong so they will last me a while and their a great add to my brush collection. Thanks amazon and sigma :)</li>
            <li> i just receive the brushes and i feel it is awsome! i like the touch of the brushes and the look of it! perfect!!</li>
            <li> Bout it as a gift to a makeup artist that is a friend of mine and she love it she said it&#x27;s an awesome kit and she need it for high quality works</li>
            <li> I thought I had good brushes until I received the Sigma brushes. I have a brush for every type of application. They are so soft and the brushes do not shed. The case is the icing on the cake. It looks so professional. I am very happy with my purchase. I have returned for additional brushes.</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> Great soft brushes. Kinda expensive but I know it will last longer that the cheap ones! Definitely will buy sigma brushes in the near future!</li>
            <li> I use these daily.  I am disappointed at the quality of the bristles and handles.  Some bristles&lt;br /&gt;come out onto my face upon every use and one of my wood handles came out of its metal top...I had to hot glue it together.&lt;br /&gt;They  work well.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and it was a big success.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I use to think all brushes were the same...but boy was I wrong!!  These brushes are a dream.  My foundation, concealer, and powder glides on my face effortlessly and looks almost airbrushed.  Yes, they are an investment...but well worth it.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR THIS BRUSHES I CAN PUT LIQUID FOUNDATION EASILY AND FAST, AND GREAT PRICES ALTHOUGH I DONT USE ALL OF EM IT BREAKS MY HEART NEGLECTING THEM LOL</li>
            <li> Love them! Speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the brushes weren&#x27;t packaged in a box like the one shown in the images it was just in plastic wrappings. Overall brushes are good. The packaging just sucked for it.</li>
            <li> They are amazing @__@</li>
            <li> The best ever. You can&#x27;t go wrong, a great buy.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH YOUTUBE TUTORIALS AND RAVES ABOUT THESE BRUSHES THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE. WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND LEAVES A FLAWLESS FINISH. A MUST HAVE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I compared these brushes to the original ones sold on sigma.com. Unfortunately, there are a few things I noticed. First of, the F86 tapered Kabuki is not as pointed as the original one. Flat angled is not angled as much. All the brushes seems a bit taller/higher than the original, and the writing between the description and the word USA is too far apart. Lastly, it didn&#x27;t come with the original box as shown on the picture. Good copy but not good enough.</li>
