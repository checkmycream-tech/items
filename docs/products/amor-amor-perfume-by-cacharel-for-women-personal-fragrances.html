            <li>Perfect !</li>
            <li>Very great customer service, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, excellent choice as a gift :)</li>
            <li>It is great, my boyfriend loves it when I spray some on.</li>
            <li>Great size for travel</li>
            <li>besides that the fragrance was great.</li>
            <li>It was a good perfume.</li>
            <li>and my sister loved it, so I bought it for her birthday this year.</li>
            <li>On my best friend however, it loses all vanilla and rose and takes on an almost acidic orange peel smell which isn&#x27;t really pleasant</li>
            <li>and it arrived safely in the packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this smell</li>
            <li>Love this perfume....</li>
            <li>He also says the bottle is really cool looking, I just love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Most days on me it mellows nicely and the rose and vanilla notes come to the foreground but retains just enough citrus to have a clean smell.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it for daytime wear as it&#x27;s more flirty and fun than sensual-smelling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you love the scent of roses.</li>
            <li>I love my new fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will say that the perfume finishes very nicely, but takes a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>My typical perfume application consists of spraying one good time in front of me and then walking through.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an aggressive burst of juicy citrus and sweet vanilla, mingled with a sort of green, fresh rose scent.</li>
            <li>This perfume was too sweet and strong for my taste, and it is definitely not from over-application.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume, since my local Palais Royal did not have it anymore, I knew Amazon would have it.</li>
            <li>like such an exotic smell.</li>
            <li>it seems like they advertise it for more than it actually is, when you receive it</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>thank you greetings from Venezuela 100% positive</li>
            <li>Fast delivery .</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Straight out of the bottle</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s price I&#x27;m struggling with whether or not I&#x27;d be better off finding a similar smelling alternative that might have a little more longevity as far a shelf-life goes.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying from this buyer because it was on time, and the perfume was in new condition.</li>
            <li>But in general, as far as scent goes this perfume definitely gets a thumbs up and will most likely earn you more than a few compliments.</li>

            <li>Upon moving into my new apartment-- Which is cooled primarily by a window unit in the living room and a fan in the bedroom where I keep my perfumes, I noticed that a large amount of the perfume in the bottle appeared to have evaporated when exposed to temperatures ranging from the mid-seventies to lower eighties during a few of the scorchers last summer and fall.</li>
            <li>for better or for worse, I can&#x27;t say for certain.</li>
            <li>For reference, I typically wear perfumes that would be classified as light, romantic such as Tiffany.</li>

            <li> As a young girl Amor Amor always caught my eye, probably had something to do with the candy apple red bottle and edgy design on the box, definitely wasn&#x27;t the perfume itself at that time because my mind always tells me that this perfume smells like roses, then reality sets in...</li>
            <li> considering she typically wears perfumes that have fresh green notes mixed with green tea and have a powdery finish to them.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Wouldve given the product 5 stars but its too expensive for the tiny bottle, overall my mom loves this perfume!</li>
            <li> Something which didn&#x27;t appear to be happening with my Alien, Fame and Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab oil blends...</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this perfume!</li>
            <li> The product the smell so bad and no hold nothing I don&#x27;t like parfumes nobody noticed I have on me</li>
            <li> I hated that</li>

            <li> I love this perfume, since my local Palais Royal did not have it anymore, I knew Amazon would have it. It smells just like I can remember...like such an exotic smell. It is great, my boyfriend loves it when I spray some on. He also says the bottle is really cool looking, I just love this perfume!

            <li> Everything as expected. Fast delivery . Well packaged . Perfect !</li>
            <li> Great size for travel and it arrived safely in the packaging. I love my new fragrance.</li>
            <li> it seems like they advertise it for more than it actually is, when you receive it, it&#x27;s tiny, like bordering tester/sample size. besides that the fragrance was great.</li>
            <li> This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.</li>
            <li> I love this smell it&#x27;s the only one I would pay a lot of money for. I will be buy again</li>
            <li> thank you greetings from Venezuela 100% positive</li>
            <li> The product was open already when I got it.</li>
            <li> The product the smell so bad and no hold nothing I don&#x27;t like parfumes nobody noticed I have on me I hated that</li>
            <li> As described. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> As a young girl Amor Amor always caught my eye, probably had something to do with the candy apple red bottle and edgy design on the box, definitely wasn&#x27;t the perfume itself at that time because my mind always tells me that this perfume smells like roses, then reality sets in...Straight out of the bottle it&#x27;s an aggressive burst of juicy citrus and sweet vanilla, mingled with a sort of green, fresh rose scent. Body chemistry could definitely alter the way this perfume smells and it&#x27;s silage, for better or for worse, I can&#x27;t say for certain. Most days on me it mellows nicely and the rose and vanilla notes come to the foreground but retains just enough citrus to have a clean smell. On my best friend however, it loses all vanilla and rose and takes on an almost acidic orange peel smell which isn&#x27;t really pleasant considering she typically wears perfumes that have fresh green notes mixed with green tea and have a powdery finish to them. So I suppose this is a hit or miss sort of perfume. It wears well in the Spring months and I would recommend it for daytime wear as it&#x27;s more flirty and fun than sensual-smelling. My biggest problem with this perfume is that you don&#x27;t get a lot for your money and that you have to be mindful of where you are storing it. Upon moving into my new apartment-- Which is cooled primarily by a window unit in the living room and a fan in the bedroom where I keep my perfumes, I noticed that a large amount of the perfume in the bottle appeared to have evaporated when exposed to temperatures ranging from the mid-seventies to lower eighties during a few of the scorchers last summer and fall. Something which didn&#x27;t appear to be happening with my Alien, Fame and Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab oil blends...&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this perfume to a friend? Yes. Would I buy it as a gift? Probably not. Would I buy it again? For it&#x27;s price I&#x27;m struggling with whether or not I&#x27;d be better off finding a similar smelling alternative that might have a little more longevity as far a shelf-life goes. So that one has yet to be determined.

            <li> I had this perfume YEARS ago and my sister loved it, so I bought it for her birthday this year. only thing is I should have bought her a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, excellent choice as a gift :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume....the only one that I wear. Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this perfume! The smell is so seducing...lots of men comment on it when I wear it out. I highly recommend this product if you love the scent of roses.</li>
            <li> I cant believe i paid 50 dollars for a bottle thats the size of practically of my middle finger. It lasted my sister a week.</li>
            <li> GF loves it. I would spring for the bigger bottle though...</li>
