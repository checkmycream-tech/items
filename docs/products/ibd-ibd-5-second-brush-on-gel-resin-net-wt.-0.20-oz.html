            <li>To use a resin it is always best to follow up with an activator.</li>

            <li>Great temporary fix.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great product-</li>

            <li>Greatly recommended for nail use.</li>

            <li>Great for strengthening your nail .  </li>
            <li>More like, 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Still have some after four months stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any pre-coating on my nail before the silk and I am glad because  I was able to peel off the silk after 3 weeks which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own fiberglass nails now for more then 10 years.</li>
            <li>The price is fair and it was quick to ship.</li>
            <li>So to remove some of  the resin from the bristles do not run the brush across the top of the bottle (</li>
            <li>Purchased this again and like last time it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Not at all pleased with this.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Holds nail wraps through many flamenco guitar sessions.</li>
            <li>When it peels, it takes the top layer of my nail with it, and leaves them thinner and weaker than they were before.</li>
            <li>and i like it :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite nail glue, you have a brush so that you don&#x27;t end up with a glob of glue anywhere.  </li>
            <li>will prevent your nail tip from becoming thicker at the side ends of your nail.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>I used this stuff on a swiss silk nail repair and it worked fine with 4 coats.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my nails</li>
            <li>I buff and smooth then apply.</li>
            <li>This really works great with the silk for patching real fingernails that are cracked.</li>
            <li>Transacrion was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and it works true to form.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>Glorified super glue?</li>
            <li>I finally got a chance to use this and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>best results with this product is to use 3 or 4 thin coats , rather then thicker layers.</li>
            <li>hope this helps anyone reading , take your time , relax and just have fun</li>
            <li>, take your time , relax and just have fun , that&#x27;s what acetone was made for .&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>After applying to your nail , very lightly tap the tip of your nail on a double folded piece of paper towel once or twice .This</li>
            <li>price is very reasonable, and it doesn&#x27;t call for activator.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Really stays put!</li>
            <li>It is working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am a classical guitar player and need to keep my nails strong and protected.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s holding up really well through many polish changes, and the patch is barely perceptible.</li>
            <li>will be ordering a few more of these!</li>
            <li>if you really prefer to use a thicker gel resin or glue</li>
            <li>and it really helped my nails.</li>
            <li>I find it very helpful.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>The product is a good buy, As a professional nail technician I have seen the best alongside the worst.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>and when I was finally able to get it out of the bottle it was a gloppy mess.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the aerosol accelerator.</li>
            <li>If you do get resin on the rim take a piece of paper towel not cotton ball or pad with acetone free polish remover and wipe a rim off while the resin is still wet.</li>
            <li>This product works as it should and the dispenser is very thrifty and does not waste glue.</li>
            <li>I usually use the a.s.p. resin , but I haven&#x27;t ever been able to find it in brush on bottles.</li>
            <li>Used this to repair my natural nails</li>
            <li>although when i first opened it i thought it was not thick enough, because i was expecting a Gel density and not as the regular nail glue.</li>
            <li>it works nice holding my broken nail</li>
            <li>This way the layers will be more even, with less filing in the long run.</li>
            <li>But I have noticed that by using activator the product dries much faster (than the 5 seconds posted on the bottle) but it does dry by itself which can save a lot of time and money*!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found i had major yellowing on my naila after using this product :</li>
            <li>It holds like no other I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use the resin under way my nail polish to add extra support without damaging my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Ez to open and close, no waste.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> unless you keep pliers in your nail kit , resin will dry up inside the brush/cap).</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than you might think from such a small bottle and does not dry out.</li>
            <li> This is very sad because I intended on continuing to purchase and more than just one at a time.</li>
            <li> Just keep in myond the glue takes a little long to dry</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s different</li>
            <li> Not worth a buck, junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this with silk wraps as a patch since I broke my nail so far down the nail bed that cutting it wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than crazy glue due to brush on application.</li>
            <li> I also place this little shot glass</li>
            <li> and it was dried out and goopy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go a few weeks by reapplying resin before I buff it all out to start again.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any tears in the corners like I usually get.</li>
            <li> The brush was hard to get out</li>
            <li> I just spent $10.00 for crazy glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that my second time purchasing this it only lasted one set of nails!!  &#x3D;(  </li>
            <li> Now this states GEL, but it isn&#x27;t very thick like the gel for gel nail applications.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this along with some silk wrap to save a broken nail.</li>
            <li> I have used this resin on split or broken nails when nail glue does not work.</li>
            <li> Just what I need to fix a broken nail.</li>
            <li> This is useless.</li>
            <li> Useless, useless, useless, and garbage.</li>
            <li> I use a yempered glass cutting board on my workspace.</li>

            <li> 💅 I have been doing my own fiberglass nails now for more then 10 years. I usually use the a.s.p. resin , but I haven&#x27;t ever been able to find it in brush on bottles. I have been using this for about 5 years , followed by the a.s.p. resin activator. Now this states GEL, but it isn&#x27;t very thick like the gel for gel nail applications.  To use a resin it is always best to follow up with an activator. Holding the actitvator spray bottle about 6 &amp;#34;  from your nail , or this resin along with any resin or nail glue will take some time to dry. Using the activator speeds up the dry time &amp; hardens the resin you applied to your nails.🌟if you really prefer to use a thicker gel resin or glue try wonder bond , it to is a great product🌟.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When taking the brush out of the bottle , it will have plenty of resin on the brush. So to remove some of  the resin from the bristles do not run the brush across the top of the bottle ( unless you keep pliers in your nail kit , resin will dry up inside the brush/cap). Instead, run the brush pull up on the inner side wall of this bottle . If you do get resin on the rim take a piece of paper towel not cotton ball or pad with acetone free polish remover and wipe a rim off while the resin is still wet. I also place this little shot glass so it doesn&#x27;t tip over and because the shot glass has slanted inner walls , the resin bottle rests inside the glass at an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best results with this product is to use 3 or 4 thin coats , rather then thicker layers.This way the layers will be more even, with less filing in the long run. After applying to your nail , very lightly tap the tip of your nail on a double folded piece of paper towel once or twice .This will prevent your nail tip from becoming thicker at the side ends of your nail. And the folded paper towel protects whatever table finish your working on. I use a yempered glass cutting board on my workspace. I only wish it came in a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone reading , take your time , relax and just have fun , that&#x27;s what acetone was made for .&lt;br /&gt;💅THANKS FOR READING, BYE💅&lt;br /&gt;Ireading , take your time , relax and just have fun , that&#x27;s what acetone was made for .&lt;br /&gt;💅THANKS FOR READING, BYE💅&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great with silk wraps to strengthen nails and repair tears.  Much easier to use than crazy glue due to brush on application.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with silk wraps! Lasts longer than you might think from such a small bottle and does not dry out. I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Holds nail wrap on for about a week, just enough time for the nail to grow out for proper trimming.</li>
            <li> Purchased this again and like last time it worked great!  Went on smooth and dried quickly.  I will be purchasing this product again when I run out!  UPDATE: I&#x27;m really disappointed that my second time purchasing this it only lasted one set of nails!!  &#x3D;(  After that I went to do another set and it was dried out and goopy.  The brush was hard to get out and when I was finally able to get it out of the bottle it was a gloppy mess.  This is very sad because I intended on continuing to purchase and more than just one at a time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with some silk wrap to save a broken nail. Worked great!</li>
            <li> Product was just what I wanted.  Works great for splitting nails. Transacrion was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This is great gel-resin! It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my nails and I have not had any tears in the corners like I usually get.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I finally got a chance to use this and was very pleased.  Easy to apply and it really helped my nails.</li>
            <li> I always chip, nick or crack a nail.  The Brush-On Gel Resin gives a temporary fix until my nail grows out.  Great temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I am a classical guitar player and need to keep my nails strong and protected.  I used this stuff on a swiss silk nail repair and it worked fine with 4 coats.  Lasted 3 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t use any pre-coating on my nail before the silk and I am glad because  I was able to peel off the silk after 3 weeks which is a good thing.  It worked out for me because I didn&#x27;t want to resort to grinding it off. It works perfect for me, put it on, use it for 3 weeks, then peel it off and put another silk on.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do any damage to my nail.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product- you don&#x27;t get a lot, but one coat seems to be sufficient. I used this with silk wraps and also by itself. Really stays put!</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be alot stronger than it is. However with the swisse silk wrap it did hold it on for sometime. I found i had major yellowing on my naila after using this product :(&lt;br /&gt;So now it just sits in my nail box... kinda wish i could get my money back..</li>
            <li> Keeps peeling off my nails within a day or two. I can&#x27;t figure out how to keep that from happening. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this resin on split or broken nails when nail glue does not work. I find it very helpful. I cannot find it in any store so was happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically just glue, but you can brush it on.  That&#x27;s awesome. It makes it so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Still have some after four months stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Needs to be called &amp;#34;IBD wait an hour for a sticky mess&amp;#34;. Tried using it with cure drops but they didn&#x27;t take. Not at all pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I use the resin under way my nail polish to add extra support without damaging my natural nails. I buff and smooth then apply. I&#x27;ll go a few weeks by reapplying resin before I buff it all out to start again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what this product is supposed to do. It came with no instructions and its name is truly unclear.</li>
            <li> My thumbnail is split.  I am using this product to keep the nail together while it grows out.  It is working pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product works as it should and the dispenser is very thrifty and does not waste glue. You will need to purchase a aerosol can of accelerator though unless you like waiting 20 min for the glue to harden! I highly recommend the aerosol accelerator.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described.  Used this to repair my natural nails and it worked perfectly.  Greatly recommended for nail use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this with silk wraps as a patch since I broke my nail so far down the nail bed that cutting it wasn&#x27;t an option. So far, it&#x27;s holding up really well through many polish changes, and the patch is barely perceptible. This is a great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Same thickness as brush on glue. Not sure why it&#x27;s different</li>
            <li> My nails have to be on point. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> To patch your nail with Supernail China Silk Wrap, when you break your nail don&#x27;t cut it but patch it!</li>
            <li> The product is a good buy, As a professional nail technician I have seen the best alongside the worst. This product is among my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable, and it doesn&#x27;t call for activator. But I have noticed that by using activator the product dries much faster (than the 5 seconds posted on the bottle) but it does dry by itself which can save a lot of time and money*!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering a few more of these!</li>
            <li> Glorified super glue? Holds nail wraps through many flamenco guitar sessions.</li>
            <li> Great for strengthening your nail .  I apply a couple of layers under my nail polish for extra strength. Just keep in myond the glue takes a little long to dry</li>
            <li> I apply this product after I polish my nails and it works true to form.  My polish last longer than it would without it.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps peeling off of my nails no matter what I do. When it peels, it takes the top layer of my nail with it, and leaves them thinner and weaker than they were before.</li>
            <li> The best ever glue application.  Ez to open and close, no waste.</li>
            <li> This is useless. Basically just shiny polish, don&#x27;t know how it could ever mend a nail. Useless, useless, useless, and garbage. Not worth a buck, junk.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry. 5 seconds? More like, 10 minutes! But it does hold a nail together. You&#x27;ll have to reapply if you remove nail polish or put hands in a lot of water.</li>
            <li> it works nice holding my broken nail although when i first opened it i thought it was not thick enough, because i was expecting a Gel density and not as the regular nail glue. it works and i like it :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail glue, you have a brush so that you don&#x27;t end up with a glob of glue anywhere.  It holds like no other I have ever used.  The price is fair and it was quick to ship.</li>
            <li> I just spent $10.00 for crazy glue. [same ingrediants]</li>
            <li> This really works great with the silk for patching real fingernails that are cracked.</li>
            <li> Just what I need to fix a broken nail.</li>
