            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and NO scent, which I love.</li>
            <li>, in fact, it feels like my under eye area and lids are getting every more wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>I can say with confidence that my under eye area is healthy and being taken care of.</li>
            <li>Totally love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with Neutrogena product line than dermalogica.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite SPF eye cream.</li>
            <li>There are better products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye moisturizers or varying costs.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly under my eyes for firmness and sun protection</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product which I&#x27;ve been using for several years.  </li>
            <li>Most products for wrinkles give me puffiness, so I truly love this.</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Packaging and everything was okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product, have been using for years.</li>

            <li>I ordered this eye cream after reading a lot of reviews and am pleased with the texture and tinted color of this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Great cream for 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>So far, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>One time, she said that she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Although I find most of their products to be overpriced for the ingredient quality this is a great beginner eye cream for younger buyers.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>In a perfect arch below my eyes, I developed a row of &amp;#34;pimple&amp;#34; like bumps and after 3 mornings of use my skin became very tender and puffy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect all around under eye moisturizer w/ SPF / dark circle corrector / wrinkle filler...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but will buy again just because it nourishes and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive/lensed eyes.</li>
            <li>Total Eye care is by far the most effective at keeping my skin happy.</li>
            <li>I personally like their Intensive Eye Care better but this product is cheaper and works good.</li>
            <li>and my eyes are super sensitive, hides under eye darkness fairly well.</li>
            <li>The price was fair, I paid double for this in a day spa.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for good makeup.</li>
            <li>Even when I could use a lot more sleep I still look rested thanks to this eye care cream.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t hinder my eye make up from staying on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Goes great with or without other make up and moisturizers</li>
            <li>As well as quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, my dark circles are lessened greatly when I use it.</li>
            <li>The reviews were great, but I guess I was one of the few it didn&#x27;t work on.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for me at this point.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>It does great with my dark circles without being too much.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get rid of the dark circles around my eyes and thought this might be a good addition to my morning and evening ritual.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not thick, it&#x27;s pretty light- to mid-weight.</li>
            <li>In the summer I will try to find an eye cream with higher SPF.    </li>
            <li>Although I recently started doing facial building exercises,  which has made a huge difference in reducing the wrinkles and bags under my eyes, I continue to use this cream because it smooths out my under eye area nicely.  </li>
            <li>I tried this one from Amazon because it was quite a bit cheaper than what you&#x27;d pay in a salon for the same product, and I was pleased with the freshness and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, so good , no puffy eyes, and no more under eye darkness.</li>
            <li>But you have to be patient, it took me a bottle and half for showing the  amazing results.</li>
            <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell the difference</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I just hope that price doesn&#x27;t go up so much though.</li>
            <li>But i haven&#x27;t noticed much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>I love all of their products, especially for my eyes and adult acne.</li>
            <li>But it works better than another other cream that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I like that this eye cream has SPF in it, but so do many other eye creams that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>I like the highlighting effect as well as the light beige color, tube lasts a long time and product does not hurt my eyes at all</li>
            <li>am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
            <li>I love this product it has protected the skin around my eyes for years it has a slight tint and so helps to hide the darkness under your eyes, If you have any.</li>
            <li>Most inexperienced buyers want to buy the strongest creams meant for the deepest wrinkles when really what they need is gentle ingredients and a solid SPF.</li>
            <li>After 2 months of use, I can say this really hasn&#x27;t done anything for me other than maybe some light moisturizing and SPF.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, yet I would not go as far as to call it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the tinted moisturizer (when I was in my 30&#x27;s) with this line too, and pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also reflects light to diminish dark circles &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is a little light colored for my skin but does blend in.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because i have black circles around my eyes and after one week if usage i notice significant change in color.</li>
            <li>Still use my others but this really does instantly brighten the eye.</li>
            <li>It leaves the eye area skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I really like the extra coverage in my eye area.</li>
            <li>this is what i use every morning to keep my eyes looking young.</li>
            <li>The product is to old and smell  like mold.</li>
            <li>Expensive but of good quality</li>
            <li>the Total Eye Care does not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dark circles, it just has optical light diffusers to help reflect light to make the circles less visible.  </li>
            <li>I used some of the highly advertised products that you can find at your local drugstore.  </li>
            <li>It avoids puffyness and helps with wrinkles around the eye area like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams with higher SPF and whether it&#x27;s just the higher SPF or the use of a different ingredient, the other eye creams make my eyes tear up.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any worsening of the circles and my skin has not aged in this area where I apply it</li>
            <li>Having allergies and wearing contacts makes my eye area very dry and sensitive.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the tinted moisturizer (when I was in my 30&#x27;s) with this line too, and pretty much the same results.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also reflects light to diminish dark circles &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is a little light colored for my skin but does blend in.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i have black circles around my eyes and after one week if usage i notice significant change in color.</li>
            <li> Still use my others but this really does instantly brighten the eye.</li>
            <li> It leaves the eye area skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the extra coverage in my eye area.</li>
            <li> this is what i use every morning to keep my eyes looking young.</li>
            <li> The product is to old and smell  like mold.</li>
            <li> Expensive but of good quality</li>
            <li> the Total Eye Care does not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dark circles, it just has optical light diffusers to help reflect light to make the circles less visible.  </li>
            <li> I used some of the highly advertised products that you can find at your local drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It avoids puffyness and helps with wrinkles around the eye area like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams with higher SPF and whether it&#x27;s just the higher SPF or the use of a different ingredient, the other eye creams make my eyes tear up.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any worsening of the circles and my skin has not aged in this area where I apply it</li>
            <li> Having allergies and wearing contacts makes my eye area very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is really doing anything except just moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using long enough to offer long term results.</li>
            <li> The size tube is deceiving, it lasts a LONG time</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time also!</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, and for me, a tube will last a year.  </li>
            <li> I use twice daily, only apply a little or will burn your eyes .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for less than a month though</li>

            <li> I purchased this product for my dark circles and just as an anti aging.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my dark circles have not improved.</li>

            <li> They were dark and I did not like to look at them.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of a tint to it so it helps to conceal dark circles.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dark circles (just very thin skin) and nothing has really ever covered them up (except for airbrushed make-up).  </li>
            <li> This means I use less concealer, and sometimes none at all.</li>
            <li> But, I could never use it alone without concealer as my eyes are REALLY dark all around combined with a pale complection.</li>
            <li> This cream covers it a little</li>

            <li> Takes just a very small amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, but I guess the expensive creams are much better.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay. A small little tube with skin-colored eye cream. Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but will buy again just because it nourishes and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive/lensed eyes. Freshens up a bit because it is like a bb cream for the eyes, but don&#x27;t expect coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use, no fingers dipping into jars causing bacteria and contamination. The size tube is deceiving, it lasts a LONG time bc you don&#x27;t need a lot of product for the job.  This both moisturizes and protects the eye area with a sunscreen. No stinging either. The price was fair, I paid double for this in a day spa. For all these reasons, I feel this is a good multi-tasker and performs well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in a department store, (therefore losing out on Amazon&#x27;s lower price) I paid $40. It works great as a moisturizer. It also does cover up dark pigmented circles because it has a reddish orange tinge to it. But, I could never use it alone without concealer as my eyes are REALLY dark all around combined with a pale complection. It also does nothing for those tiny under-eye wrinkles which is another problem I have. I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect all around under eye moisturizer w/ SPF / dark circle corrector / wrinkle filler...</li>
            <li> I personally like their Intensive Eye Care better but this product is cheaper and works good.</li>
            <li> I am an eyecream junkie! Still use my others but this really does instantly brighten the eye. Use during the day with no makeup or at night when going out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Recovering from Chemo and my skin needs help. This product is supposed to help, along with all the other&lt;br /&gt;Bare Minerals and Dermalogica my skin rep. recommended. The products feel wonderful on my face and I don&#x27;t look like I caked it on. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for good makeup. Just keep in mind, it is expensive,</li>
            <li> It is at the same time a concealer and a treatment for tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt have any allery with it, I have been using it for one year now and still liking it.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody is asking me what i am using</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermologica line for 2yrs now and have been very impressed with it. I wanted to get rid of the dark circles around my eyes and thought this might be a good addition to my morning and evening ritual. In a couple of days the skin around my eyes began to lighten up perfectly. Even when I could use a lot more sleep I still look rested thanks to this eye care cream.</li>
            <li> Ive used and worked with dermalogica for years. Although I find most of their products to be overpriced for the ingredient quality this is a great beginner eye cream for younger buyers. Most inexperienced buyers want to buy the strongest creams meant for the deepest wrinkles when really what they need is gentle ingredients and a solid SPF. Great cream for 20&#x27;s and early 30&#x27;s. I would purchase!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. It leaves the eye area skin hydrated and soft. It also contains &amp;#34;deflectors&amp;#34;, which help minimize dark circles. This means I use less concealer, and sometimes none at all. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome setvice and product</li>
            <li> Sadly, nothing changed when I used this product. I was hoping to see changes after 6 months, however it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Another hyperbole description by a cosmetic manufacturer.  Maybe others have been successful, but I don&#x27;t know how.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It&#x27;s a moisturizer/sunblock that you can apply all around the eye without fear of stinging.  Since it is not a chemical sunscreen you can apply it at night, too, if you wanted.  It makes a good travel companion that way.  One tube lasts me about 6 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find eye creams with SPF and this cream has an SPF of 15.  If it had an SPF of 30+, I would have given it five stars.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t sting.  I don&#x27;t see any visual benefits - no lightening of my eye area, but I use concealer for that.  In the summer I will try to find an eye cream with higher SPF.    Update 12/29/14:   I&#x27;ve upgraded my rating to five stars - this is the only eye cream with SPF that doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to tear up.  I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams with higher SPF and whether it&#x27;s just the higher SPF or the use of a different ingredient, the other eye creams make my eyes tear up.</li>
            <li> I really like the extra coverage in my eye area. Worth the money for me at this point. It is a little light colored for my skin but does blend in. and NO scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> Stay away!  Very disappointing.  Wanted to give it a try.  Can&#x27;t really tell the difference, in fact, it feels like my under eye area and lids are getting every more wrinkled.  Would give it 0 stars except that I need to rate the product with at least 1 star.  I&#x27;m going back to my regular cream.  Will not buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This is a good eye cream. It is very moisturizing, yet I would not go as far as to call it i &amp;#34;miracle in a tube&amp;#34;. I can say with confidence that my under eye area is healthy and being taken care of. It has SPF 15 protection which is an essential ingredient in an eye cream. If you are looking for an effective product, go for it! I doubt you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this cream under my eye before applying my BareMinerals concealer. I notice a difference in the way that my eyes appear - brighter &amp; wider. Although I recently started doing facial building exercises,  which has made a huge difference in reducing the wrinkles and bags under my eyes, I continue to use this cream because it smooths out my under eye area nicely.  I can notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Totally love this eye cream. My 66 year old skin is very happy with this eye cream &amp; sun protectionDerm</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It is simple to use and can be worn with or with out makeup. Takes just a very small amount and I can really tell a difference. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s (almost no wrinkles yet!) and ordered this to see if it would help tighten/camouflage/moisturize up under eye bags/dark circles since the reviews on another site were glowing.  I&#x27;ve always had dark circles (just very thin skin) and nothing has really ever covered them up (except for airbrushed make-up).  After 2 months of use, I can say this really hasn&#x27;t done anything for me other than maybe some light moisturizing and SPF.  I&#x27;ve tried the tinted moisturizer (when I was in my 30&#x27;s) with this line too, and pretty much the same results.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with Neutrogena product line than dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i have black circles around my eyes and after one week if usage i notice significant change in color.</li>
            <li> It does great with my dark circles without being too much.  Goes great with or without other make up and moisturizers</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my dark circles and just as an anti aging. Unfortunately, my dark circles have not improved. This cream covers it a little but it wears off and does nothing!</li>
            <li> The best eye cream I have ever used! Lasts a long time also!</li>
            <li> I love this product it has protected the skin around my eyes for years it has a slight tint and so helps to hide the darkness under your eyes, If you have any.</li>
            <li> This eye cream works as well as any I have used, but with the added bonus of a sun protection factor of 15. Since the sun is the number one cause of signs of aging, I always look for that in my products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite SPF eye cream. Other  that have SPF protection are not comfortable to use and cause a burning sensation. This demalogica cream protects without irritating. I love it!</li>
            <li> this is what i use every morning to keep my eyes looking young. the eyes are the window to the soul, right? plus, i&#x27;m an eye surgeon. enough said. the best!</li>
            <li> I have used this and other Dermalogica products for years. I was pleased to find it offered at a good discount. Only thing is the shipping cost for such a tiny item cut into the discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in a very timely manner. Thank you</li>
            <li> Expensive but of good quality</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I used this several weeks, but didn&#x27;t see any changes in my undereyes.  There are better products.  I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Does lighten and brighten the eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye moisturizers or varying costs. Having allergies and wearing contacts makes my eye area very dry and sensitive. Total Eye care is by far the most effective at keeping my skin happy. Also, my dark circles are lessened greatly when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only day time eye care I use. It is not oily, yet it is moisturizing. I can apply mineral make up with no problem. I wear contacts. It gives great sun protection and does not melt into the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love all Dermalogical products, but the eye cream has made a great difference on me. I just turned 46 and having used it for the last 5...you could not tell I am 46..most people calculate 38!</li>
            <li> I just buy this product for my wife as a gift on her birthday. One time, she said that she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than ten years and it is the best kind on the market. I just hope that price doesn&#x27;t go up so much though.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have been using it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a years. I am in my 60&#x27;s. I use it mostly under my eyes for firmness and sun protection but it has the added benefit of giving an iridescent effect like a concealer for any dark circles. I love it and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> A really good eye cream.  I like the tint in it.  It doesn&#x27;t color under the eyes but it does blend into the skin hiding any darkness.</li>
            <li> Perfect daytime eye protection</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product which I&#x27;ve been using for several years.  It avoids puffyness and helps with wrinkles around the eye area like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  Most products for wrinkles give me puffiness, so I truly love this.</li>
            <li> After turning 30 I noticed I had eye circles. They were dark and I did not like to look at them.  I used some of the highly advertised products that you can find at your local drugstore.  They only made my eyes worst. Fortunately I found dermalogica!! I love all of their products, especially for my eyes and adult acne. I will never need to search for skin care products again.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t hinder my eye make up from staying on. Def can see a difference after using it a week or two. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is to old and smell  like mold. I have bought this product before from a store and there are big difference.</li>
            <li> good product and I use it daily</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend eating this delicious product but instead, using it for your eyes...they work marvelously well for your under eyes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool. But It&#x27;s not as great as I thought it was going to be. But that is because I have little skin around my eye sockets. So that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> So far, this is a great product. I have seen results using this, but I have not been using it in the morning and at night, only about once a day when I remember. But it works better than another other cream that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream. It has a bit of a tint to it so it helps to conceal dark circles. Love it!</li>
            <li> The reviews were great, but I guess I was one of the few it didn&#x27;t work on.  There was no difference in my eye care. I used it faithfully for 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m very disappointed, but I guess the expensive creams are much better.  You get what you pay for.  I gave it try, but it wasn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer...not sure if it is really doing anything except just moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve only been using for less than a month though and I know it takes some time and regular use.  We&#x27;ll see.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product with chemical-free sunscreen.  Been on the hunt for awhile.  Also reflects light to diminish dark circles &amp; blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 years and I am absolutely happy with it. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, so good , no puffy eyes, and no more under eye darkness. But you have to be patient, it took me a bottle and half for showing the  amazing results.</li>
            <li> Packaging and everything was okay. As well as quick shipping. But i haven&#x27;t noticed much of an improvement. I&#x27;d buy multi purpose concealer instead.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 years to help with under eye circles.  You only need a little bit, and for me, a tube will last a year.  I tried this one from Amazon because it was quite a bit cheaper than what you&#x27;d pay in a salon for the same product, and I was pleased with the freshness and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- the Total Eye Care does not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; dark circles, it just has optical light diffusers to help reflect light to make the circles less visible.  I have not seen any worsening of the circles and my skin has not aged in this area where I apply it, so I think it helps maintain and prevent further signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I like the highlighting effect as well as the light beige color, tube lasts a long time and product does not hurt my eyes at all and my eyes are super sensitive, hides under eye darkness fairly well.</li>
            <li> You know, I thought this product was going to be great because so many people rave about and swear by Dermalogica products. I like that this eye cream has SPF in it, but so do many other eye creams that are cheaper. This product did not &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me; was just an average, forgettable eye cream in my opinion. Also, it&#x27;s not thick, it&#x27;s pretty light- to mid-weight. If you enjoy lighter creams, you may like this! Good for summer/humid weather, doesn&#x27;t cut it once the temp drops below 60s.</li>
            <li> Great product @ an amazing price, with service to match. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Use all these product . I have very dark circles under my eyes, hereditary . This product brightens. I use twice daily, only apply a little or will burn your eyes .</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, this product caused a bad reaction to my skin, right below my lower eyelids.  In a perfect arch below my eyes, I developed a row of &amp;#34;pimple&amp;#34; like bumps and after 3 mornings of use my skin became very tender and puffy.  Probably the sunscreen in the product, but in any event, if you have sensitivities, beware.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye cream after reading a lot of reviews and am pleased with the texture and tinted color of this eye cream. I have not been using long enough to offer long term results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for years.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product and portable so easy to toss in a bag and go.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  It has a pale pink tone to it which does wonders for brightening under the eye.</li>
