            <li>I use the day cream which I love, this product is also very good.</li>
            <li>Weleda Skin food is a good substitute.</li>
            <li>I cannot purchase or feel good using it knowing that.  </li>
            <li>Good for me</li>
            <li>Just because it came from a plant doesn&#x27;t make it good for you.</li>
            <li>It smells good but leaves my skin greasy for hours yet dries out my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>It makes skin look and FEEL good.</li>
            <li>I have good skin</li>
            <li>Really good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>So it didn&#x27;t seem a good protectant for my skin.</li>
            <li>good cream for hands and body for the winter time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>The product is good</li>
            <li>Smells good, absorbs well into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy but it didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized at all.</li>
            <li>Although there were already good reviews, I was unsure of the texture.  </li>
            <li>Really good for my skin</li>
            <li>Every time I put it on my husband comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin cream and my father-in-law fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>this is my very favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of guy that likes a good, intensive treatment for those situations.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, smells good and its kind of addicting.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes the skin very effectively and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to  go all-natural in my search for the perfect product, and Skinfood was the first.  </li>

            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>tip for best application is to squirt it onto your finger then dab it around on your hand, then when you rub it in it will be pretty evenly distributed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Keeps my nails very healthy and lets them get to a nice length.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it smells divine - like oranges in warm sunshine!</li>

            <li>I use this on my throat area and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This cream is really amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>their face balm is amazing but they changed it over to peanut oil a couple years ago ...</li>

            <li>is amazing</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, but not greasy, and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Now that my babies are all grown, I am seeing another challenge - my own face which is aging with the passing of time.</li>
            <li>Smells nice,  works well.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s nice, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wanna-be faux rose essence.  </li>
            <li>Good SKIN CUISINE :)</li>
            <li>I need to use some more to see if it&#x27;s good for my skin or not .Until</li>
            <li>A miracle product for winter, it also works well in the warmer months for a kind of deep-hand-conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a lemon smell which is nice.</li>
            <li>I was kind of oily, greasy.  </li>
            <li>Also received a sample of their Buckthorn hand lotion and really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Nice, neutral smell.</li>
            <li>It does go on fairly greasy feeling at first, but then it melts into your skin and it feels great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and came quickly</li>
            <li>And best of all its a natural product!  </li>
            <li>My pregnant daughter is in love with this product!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this product based on reviews, because I&#x27;ve used some of Weleda products and have been happy, and also because I loved the ingredients at a quick glance.  </li>
            <li>Well, I bought this product as many folk have testified before me, because of the enthusiastic and gushing commentary from blogs and magazines.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for keeping (or getting) the bottoms of your feet (soles) soft and supple.</li>

            <li>This product greatly exceeded my expectations, you have to try it to truly know its worth.</li>
            <li>That being said, some 60 minutes after application, the product has absorbed into my skin and my hands are very smooth and happy.  </li>
            <li>It smells very nice, fresh and almost lemony but not like a household cleaning product.</li>
            <li>love this cream, it is amazing for the hands and body, moisturizes so nicely, love the smell, the feeling it leaves on the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, but it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li>This smells great and feels very pampering, I use it on both my face and my feet!</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off after washing your hands (okay,</li>
            <li>It will, however, make your hands feel &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; for over 15 mins after you apply it--like most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>This cream does have a pronounced scent, but I love it.  </li>

            <li>I particularly love it on my feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; a gardener &amp; my hands are like sandpaper and most winters</li>
            <li>to mention, many Weleda products use peanut oil ...</li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>It is lovely smelling and does the job.</li>
            <li>I read so many comments and done research on this product, still is not &#x27;the one&#x27; product that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more of an ointment than a cream.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and things are much better by morning.  </li>
            <li>You fphave to use it more than once a day</li>

            <li>This is such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel of it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am going to order more now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like it though to continue using it because I absolutely love Weleda products for the purity, holistic approach and the fact that they work well</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>Very rich and moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>This s a very rich creme.</li>
            <li>As I sniff my skin, it&#x27;s developed a more beautiful tone and is more robust.  </li>
            <li>And well, she looks pretty good</li>
            <li>it makes skin wonderfully hydrated, and this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>A little oily, but otherwise a great great product.</li>
            <li>For dry Boston winter skin the best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>The best creme for dry skin and winter time.</li>
            <li>The BEST lotion for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li>Super effective.</li>
            <li>I have to say it is an excellent product for your face if you want something creamier and heavier for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best cream for dry skin we have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes work in a extremely dry room wearing nitrile gloves all day, so if I didn&#x27;t have access to an excellent moisturizer like this one, I&#x27;d have the hands of a 99-year-old man.</li>
            <li>This cream works the best for my dry hands -- not greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>The cream is super rich, not water down or runny, giving you a very amazing feeling that every drop of oil carrying all of its wonderful properties is nourishing your cells.  </li>
            <li>This is the best for dry skin in the winter!</li>
            <li>results-wise, it is probably the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be greasy at first, but it dries pretty quickly and makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>so I probably will not use it during the summer but for winter and very dry skin; it is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy too and non-fragrant, which is great on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cream for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s free of parabens.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance and smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome on rough skin, like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li>Bought this to use on a fresh scar, it&#x27;s helped the area fade nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique putty like texture that is very light not to be deceiving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and nourishing and I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not pow!  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is very mild and dissipates soon after use.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and</li>
            <li>smells herbal, not too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell of the cream is strong but not too over powering.</li>
            <li>Weleda skin food is it if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I first began using it when I lived in France as it was quite popular there at the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even given it as gifts on occasion and those lucky folks love it and now are true converts!  </li>
            <li>I use this for my face, very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>recently as last year (I am now in my fifties)--at one party--I received three separate compliments on my smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as a hand cream and it works fine,</li>
            <li>My hands got smooth very quickly and have stayed that way.</li>
            <li>Love, love this lotion, smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Thicker than most hand creams, but does not get sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>now , nothing extraordinary !</li>
            <li>(their calendula baby products have been wonderful for our little one&#x27;s skin).</li>
            <li>Love this, have used it for years to create a fresh glow on my face after make up application - warm it in your hands and tap it on your cheek bones, above eye brows, jawline and cleavage - you will look refreshed and healthy!</li>
            <li>Now I wake up with smooth moist nourished feeling skin.</li>
            <li>The skin is thicker in those areas, and this stuff keeps that skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample when I ordered from Ulta.</li>
            <li>I use it lightly around the eyes and cheeks and etc.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item when it was grouped with another free trial item and listed for $15.</li>
            <li>so I feel better over using this fresh smelling product.</li>
            <li>Also works to smooth my bald head.</li>
            <li>it is so light and nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer especially during winter.  </li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I got this primarily for my hands, elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy using it everywhere else.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Another fantastic Weleda product, quality is guaranteed.  </li>
            <li>it is also so great for the entire body!</li>
            <li>(this is a chemical ingredient in Aveeno 24 hour moisture), just good quality natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have used this very emollient cream, mostly on my hands, for many years.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really strong at first and not my favorite</li>
            <li>Lovely clean scent, not quite floral, is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with what it has done for my 54 year old skin!</li>
            <li>This smells great, but I would only use this super sparingly on something like an excema patch.</li>
            <li>Now that I wear gloves to wash items in soapy water, I don&#x27;t need this rich hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>I quess I prefer natural moisturizers that absorb better and feel more comfortable on the skin than this one.</li>
            <li>The overall scent is nice and herbaceous, so if not for the lanolin, this would get five stars!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described and has more competitive pricing than in stores.</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this because I had read an article that Victoria Beckham uses it.</li>
            <li>Any residual gets rubbed into my hands and simultaneously gets absorbed by my nails, which has had a strengthening effect on them as well!</li>
            <li>I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it and it leaves a rich feel to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Too rich to wear on my face even if I am on the drier side.</li>
            <li>It is totally pure, has a light lemony scent which I love, and nourishes my skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li>Great for winter dry hands.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin issues</li>
            <li>Great for dry elbows.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for feet but leaves hands feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time...love the smell (clean) and the results...</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR my favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li>I have a rose refreshing spray from Jurlique that is true rose essence--just the flower, no more.  </li>
            <li>Other wise, I am really enjoying this.</li>
            <li>;  She was so right!  </li>
            <li>It is very effective on dry hands after doing the dishes, while flying, or just during the winter.</li>
            <li>Great for rough hands and  cracked feet.</li>
            <li>A few days use of this and my hands and nails are smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love this skin food it has helped me so much</li>
            <li>and I love this one as much.</li>
            <li>Always loved this company, especially the baby products.</li>
            <li>I have since tried the Weleda Wild Rose night cream, and after just a couple of days I can say...</li>
            <li>Does not absorb into the skin very well and the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>product did come with a sample of Wild Rose Pampering Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>(INCI)Water (Aqua), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Lanolin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li>Nice earthy, natural scent.</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this stuff at Whole Foods two years ago, and purchased it for a whopping $17 there--which is $5 more than at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Water, Sunflower Seed Oil, Lanolin, Sweet Almond Oil, Alcohol, Beeswax, Glyceryl Linoleate, Hydrolyzed Beeswax, Fragrance, Pansy Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Calendula Flower Extract, Cholestrol, Limonen, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral, Coumarin.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I don&#x27;t use lotion very often.</li>
            <li>It rehydrates my skin in the winter and gives it a nice soft glow again.</li>
            <li>But I love it so much I literally spread it all over.</li>
            <li>Feel younger and look gorgeous everyday...fills in and creates youthful glow...</li>
            <li>My metro male loved this.</li>
            <li>The dates were all the same they were good til 2015</li>
            <li>Some people find it &#x27;nice&#x27;, &#x27;herby&#x27; or &#x27;natural&#x27; here in the reviews.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad one...</li>
            <li>Hands down the absolute BEST hand &amp; foot cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is the best thing for my feet, in fact, because it is better absorbed than other creams, and, if used overnight, will keep the skin smooth and protected from cracking or simply drying out.</li>
            <li>This is a superb cream for extremely dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all sorts of dry skin lotions and this is far and away the best.</li>
            <li>slightly greasy but in a good way :)</li>
            <li>Seems greasy when you first put it on, but soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s got pretty strong smell to it...</li>
            <li>Since it is very moisturizing, it helps plumps the skin and smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li>Its also a great healer for sun burns or other damage to the skin.</li>
            <li>Has a nice  citrusy light scent from essential oils that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know (think) that I would try this product on my face as it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as easily (quickly) as I would like.  </li>
            <li>This is the most luxurious and thick hand cream, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>There is some oil separation so each time I need to use there is greasy factor, however it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It also has a medicinal smell but dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick healing.</li>
            <li>but I find that it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have switched over to the African Botanics balm and love it even more.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>The color of my skin changed it became more vibrant and glowing, the tone seems to be golden.</li>
            <li>After one use my hands felt smooth and replenished, and when i tested it on my face at night I experienced no breakouts or oiliness the next morning, only plush smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really impressed by the scent at first, but the nourishment it provides is hard to match.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a cream that is rich and natural enough for my thirsty skin.</li>
            <li>At first the scent is fresh and light, but then undertones of patchouli emerge.  </li>
            <li>Also good for dry hands.</li>
            <li>Gets absorbed relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>I would not want to put this on and then be touching my eyeglasses or cell phone screen or pretty much anything that I do not want smudges on.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but a little strong.</li>
            <li>Helps the hands so much!!</li>
            <li>This product has a distinctive but pleasant scent, my husband even likes it and has been using it more than me lately.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and is rich and helps dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my whole body including a light layer on my face.</li>
            <li>My adult daughter recommended it to me because she was so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my complexion a fresh, dewy look.  </li>
            <li>is Fresh&#x27;s CrÃ¨me Ancienne.</li>
            <li>But it is all worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Love how soft it makes me skin feel after using it.</li>
            <li>and I see that people have had a lot of success with using it for eczema.</li>
            <li>My mom loved it so much on her last visit that she took it home!</li>
            <li>And she rarely tries/likes unfamiliar products.</li>
            <li>I love that its all natural though.</li>
            <li>I love the natural smell and products.  </li>
            <li>I have already seen a change with my skin as it seems to be creating more natural oils.</li>
            <li>in)&lt;br /&gt;the name is fun</li>
            <li>its a little greasy on your hands, but very effective and protective.</li>
            <li>It is rich and wonderful for a daily hand lotion or trouble spot fixer.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasing, light smell and is a very nice, thick consistency.</li>
            <li>The price is great as opposed to Whole Foods and other stores...</li>
            <li>A bit oily at first, but it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little interesting, not bad, but more vegetative or medicinal than perfume-y.</li>
            <li>This product is very hydrating and rich.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before, nor had she ever used it, but bought it from other reviews looking good.  </li>
            <li>well it doesn&#x27;t for me, but I take care not to wash right after applying it) though.  </li>
            <li>I squirt the strip onto my hand right after I get out of the shower, rub my hands together and then apply 1 hand to each foot.  </li>
            <li>Just the right creme for every skin</li>
            <li>(right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for my cuticles, small scrapes and cuts and even on my psoriasis, all with great success.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hands feeling very soft and helps heal cracks and redness very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as though your skin is thirsty, and this is like a cool smoothie that applies richly and yet not heavily.</li>
            <li>And Weleda is my favorite brand - everything is natural and the packaging is very mindful.</li>
            <li>A nice hand cream for the dry hands</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want a lot of chemicals on my face and they are amazed that this relatively inexpensive cream does such a great job on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hands are very soft and smooth the morning after.</li>
            <li>Weleda is a very natural and paraben free company</li>
            <li>I gave this to the boyfriend, who washes his hands a great deal and uses a degreaser product called Goo Gone that completely desiccates the skin, and this stuff prevents the extreme cracking and dryness that he used to get.</li>
            <li>I suppose it could have been quickly absorbed into the skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t feel like it to me.</li>
            <li>It is just a little bit greasy when you first apply it, but in this case I think that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs at a perfect rate, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was hooked from the first application.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Weleda!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, have used it daily for years as my moisturizer as well as an impromptu hand-creme.</li>
            <li>Skin Food is an essential part of my healthy skin tool kit.</li>
            <li>I first used it on my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li>You can even use it in your face and lips and will notice a difference in the dryness of your skin within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I distinctly remember my mom using some sort of lanolin product, so I&#x27;m not creeped out about that whole sheep by-product thing.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I want in a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I had read to try it on your face after exfoliating and so that is what I did the first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks a Bunch  Slainte!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>On the box it claims \\&quot;\\&quot;QUALITY, CERTIFIED NATURAL SKIN CARE, FREE OF</li>
            <li>and I really think it helped it heal faster!</li>
            <li>When you first put this on, you think it is going to be too think and never soak in.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fragrance -- it&#x27;s similar to the Baby line that is based on calendula, which is what turned me on to Weleda in the first place.</li>
            <li>Pretty greasy but does moisturize.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, here is the funny thing about this cream</li>
            <li>Okay, I wish they would make this bigger and specifically for the body all over.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a combination of organic and biodynamic-based skin care products (Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food and Acure), as well as a potent anti-aging serum from Visual Changes (Resurrection) and a bi-weekly routine with Nu-Face Trinity.</li>
            <li>It does have a shine when you apply it at first but within an hour or so, it does absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this!  </li>
            <li>its pretty oily</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is the first winter where the skin on my thumbs and index fingers have not split or bled.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although this seems greasy at first, your skin just drinks it up and that feeling goes away.</li>
            <li>If I used it more regular that would not be the case.</li>
            <li>It is a staple in my first aid like antibiotic cream is a must to others.</li>
            <li>Skin Food does not do that; the moisturizing and softening effects it has are pretty darn persistent.</li>
            <li>better to buy another similar brand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Thanks Weleda!</li>
            <li>The consistency is more like toothpaste than a traditional hand cream.</li>
            <li>Why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European made - much higher standards for ingredients (and safer ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>Trying new products is often intimidating for me since so often, they lead to breakouts that take a week or more to clear up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;only downside: if it gets VERY VERY hot, like all day in the dash of a car during summertime, the oils can separate and you may get a lap full of liquid if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfumy, just a natural clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream and have been buying it for years at my local Mrs.Greens and Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>my skin feel fresh, moisturized, and soft, at the beginning is a little bit greasy, but after the skin absorb the cream feels really good..</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be so uptight about it if the cream had a very light smell (indicating small quantities), but when it smells this strong, you know the levels of these ingredients are very high.</li>
            <li>Weleda makes good quality natural skincare but this one is very greasy and sticky, and not really all that moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But it absorbs pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I have bought several tubes so far and will continue happily shelling out the cost in the future.</li>
            <li>I like that it is full of natural and even some organically derived ingredients.</li>
            <li>After applying a product I like my skin to say, &amp;#34;Oh, thank you for the drink, kind lady&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m telling you, and I have dry skin in winter, live in Alaska, if I used this product on my face, I&#x27;m-a thinking my face would unfriend me on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, so I am not sure what another reviewer was referring to, other than it could have been the Weleda Sea Buckthorn, which was a lighter, greaser cream with the most amazing scent (I almost purchased that instead!)</li>
            <li>I have been lucky enough to have great skin; no breakouts ever and very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Great for that dry winter skin of New England and similar environments.</li>
            <li>It just works magic on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess it might be ok to use on dry skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use stuff with artifical ingredients, or perfumes because my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews on this product, and given how dry my skin gets during the winter i gave it a try.</li>
            <li>not true rose essence.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hand cream, it is very soothing for dry hands.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry and rough hands, it will really soften them up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed some significant changes in my face and neckline over the past 2 years, namely sagging jowl-line, chin lines, more eye wrinkles and sagging eyelids.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the prior review (minus that i would buy it again):  its not as easy as most creams to put on because its so dense (there&#x27;s almost a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasy, but for dry skin, this is a good thing!   </li>
            <li>Great for rubbing into hands and feet at night before bed but do not recommend as a &amp;#34;pocket book&amp;#34; moisturizer because it is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but very good for skin.  </li>
            <li>As advertised was very effective for my dry and rough skin.  </li>
            <li>A bit greasy when first applied but seems to dry or be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>It was such a huge relief.</li>
            <li>This was very helpful for my hands when I was not wearing gloves.  </li>
            <li>The smell really fades fast though.</li>
            <li>Seems to absorb readily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>, I found this at Marshall&#x27;s for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I received it without the free item, no receipt,  and now (not even a week later) it&#x27;s up for $11...</li>
            <li>It does seem to be very hydrating, but a tad bit greasy.</li>
            <li>This skin food works really well</li>
            <li>I use it just like a very nourishing hand cream or as a overnight treatment under cotton gloves.</li>
            <li>Within 2 minutes intense itching.</li>
            <li>This is a super enriching lotion that is not greasy at all and really makes a difference for super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Really protects the skin.</li>
            <li>Some will find the scent objectionable because scents are very subjective.</li>
            <li>If your skin is wet when you apply it, you know to hold the moisture in, it just slips over the top if you skin and won&#x27;t spread or stay in place at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not so much lotion as a treatment.</li>
            <li>Really, if you can afford the price, try this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 6 years now and have NEVER broken out.</li>
            <li>I put too much on my elbows</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really use it before going out as it will make my&lt;br /&gt;face too shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li>It can be greasy if you put too much of it on.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m barefoot most of the time living in Hawaii, this is the only lotion I use to keep my legs, especially my heels, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li>I really like the way he works on my sons skin.</li>
            <li>I did not like this product very well.  </li>
            <li>It really helps hydrate my hands after working in the dirt.</li>
            <li>Also makeup applies much easier.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well</li>
            <li>It might be a bit much for men in warmer months and depending how much your skin takes in.</li>
            <li>Really highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My cat likes it just as well as coconut oil when she gets ready to kiss me goodnight.  </li>
            <li>I found the cream to be very greasy, even after wearing over night.</li>
            <li>I have oily/combo skins, its just too much for my face to absorb.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend that you buy!</li>
            <li>It has also really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize and works on the elbows.</li>
            <li>Gold Bond&#x27;s makes a couple different formulas but this by far is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>in a nice sturdy tube to preserve freshness (no light or air gets</li>
            <li>You need to know that it is thick but don&#x27;t let that scare you - it&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, now I want to try The other products</li>
            <li>I just hope, like many other companies, they dont change the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face every other night and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Based on the other reviews, I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>I usually look for nice smell and hydrating hand lotions.</li>
            <li>Its also a better than average hand cream.</li>
            <li>hands have been full of moisture ,that actually is retained, ever since.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t really care what Victoria uses per se, but the gist of the article was that this was a low-priced lotion that even a wealthy and discerning customer would prefer over the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>A little to thick to use during the morning, but perfect for a night cream</li>
            <li>I bought this to apply to my face during the super cold and dry winter but haven&#x27;t been that impressed.</li>
            <li>My hands are smooth and no longer dry</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I no longer wake with a shaving rash from the previous day; and my shaves are closer and far more comfortable because my skin is properly moisturized/lubricated/replenished/softened, as is my growing stubble.</li>
            <li>I am more satisfied with it than with the expensive face creams I have used.</li>
            <li>The entire family loves it because it&#x27;s super moisturizing yet never greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this cream steadily for 1 year.  </li>
            <li>After trying so many different hand lotions this is the only one that worked and stopped my hands from cracking.  </li>
            <li>it has a light yellow hue to it and you can clearly see that it has a lot of oil in it.</li>
            <li>Smells fine, creme is thick and rich.</li>
            <li>so if you have other than extremely dry skin you will break out, for dry skin its very good</li>
            <li>Seems to improve the skin, high quality face cream.</li>
            <li>Was highly touted, but not for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this skin cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I read about this product in a magazine because some actress whose name escapes me was using it and highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Everything I have ever tried from Weleda has been a high quality product and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>very cheap package first impression and thick cream makes me feel oily.</li>
            <li>This is a very heavy cream, which is great for really dry skin!</li>
            <li>But the cost is so much cheaper that I still come out far ahead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick cream, so may be too much for most faces, but I&#x27;d recommend this for whole body application as well.</li>
            <li>I normally use it before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed and lasting results.</li>
            <li>Skin food may not be packaged beautifully and perhaps it&#x27;s thick consistency seems it would be too much for one&#x27;s face, but for me this product sinks in and leaves me with an even tone and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is too thick to use regularly on my face, but sometimes I just slather it on and in the morning the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>Weleda skin food actually gets absorbed into my skin and increases the moisture retention.</li>
            <li>For a long time I was only able to find it in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit oily and thick, but nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>And when I use it on my hands, it gets absorbed quickly without too much of that sticky feel left by other creams.</li>
            <li>People have started asking me what am I doing to my face, am I wearing new makeup because I look brighter and refreshed (music to my ears).</li>
            <li>and there is hands down absolutely NOTHING better than this product, which I accidentally won in a contest at Chuck&#x27;s in Florida several years ago.  </li>
            <li>After a few minutes it&#x27;s sunk deeply into my skin and the after effects are amazing.</li>
            <li>Skin Food is my go to when my hands and cuticles are super dry.</li>
            <li>Heals dry or razor burned skin quickly and without an oily build-up.</li>
            <li>absolutely my first choice for healing parched dry skin--excellent pure ingredients</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and often breaks out from skin care products.</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft with a feeling of protection.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>It seems very natural</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and you only need the size of a pea to do your whole face!  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning and my skin was the softest it has ever been and for the first time aside from photoshop, my skin looked &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and it stayed that way throughout the day and well into the night.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold, if you&#x27;re on the fence don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li>It feels really heavy when you initially put it on but absorbs nicely and you will wake up with baby soft nourished skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s funny as I have never used it for anything but a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>I had used coconut oil x2, Jojoba Oil x 2, wearing nitrile gloves at night--and this product cleared it up 75% first time I used it and the balance was gone by the 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li>granted, my skin is very dry and it drinks up the lotion quickly.</li>
            <li>I saw reviews of a bad scent, but I find the product mild smelling to slightly pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly strong smelling citrus/lime scented paste-like cream that is moderately greasy and takes a minute to soak in that, in my experience, will heal and then prevent dry, cracked and calloused skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks a few years younger and while it doesn&#x27;t last after a few days it&#x27;s great anyway!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and thick but you don&#x27;t need much, and it really does do the job.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend that amount or less and get a huge bottle of Gold Bond.</li>
            <li>Fixed my super dry skin!</li>
            <li>My hands will occasionally get kind of dry, and I get dry skin on my elbows.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more and just an FYI that the larger size (2.5) seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s the best in cold and dry weather for replenishing skin and keeping one&#x27;s hands soft.</li>
            <li>It is very strong so a little goes a very long way, plus</li>
            <li>As for the irritation: my skin is very sensitive, and when I buy a new lotion or body wash, I usually expect that it will cause some sort of rash/reaction, so the irritation is more my personal problem than a shortcoming of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>A little greasy but great right after the shower for tough skin areas such as elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great during the cold weather though.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face when it&#x27;s cold and windy and it&#x27;s a great help.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s common with most natural creams that don&#x27;t have chemical binders.</li>
            <li>All the same, it does moisturize really well, naturally.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>so I can wake up with soft hands.</li>
            <li>But I gotta say that it does make your hands soft.</li>
            <li>Skin Food doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my go-to lotion-</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Totally unexpected surprise:</li>
            <li>there natural oils</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it hasnâ€™t caused any problems.</li>
            <li>When I was young</li>
            <li>I figured this would cost an arm and a leg but was surprised that it was rather affordable.  </li>
            <li>The cream leaves your skin moisturized and soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every skin moisturizer ever made, almost -- natural and chemical, mixtures of the two,</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old with very&lt;br /&gt;dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I tolerate it for soft hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>During the day I use Nivea Post Shave lotion for sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>nose is too sensitive to it</li>
            <li>Have only seen it at Vitamin Cottage and Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>of holistic, naturally healing ingredients</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m particularly sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I never &#x27;judge&#x27; natural lotion for it&#x27;s scent unless there is added perfume in it that doesn&#x27;t need to be there, which is in this case how I feel about this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have never had so many complements in the last few months.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll use Aveeno as a benchmark (most of the people I know have used it), and this is twice as thick maybe?  </li>
            <li>this may be too thick for many to use on their faces, but i tell you it makes</li>
            <li>I started developing dry, flaky patches on my arms, and my normal moisturizing routine of pure organic coconut oil wasn&#x27;t doing anything to help.  </li>
            <li>I usually squeeze a little onto my hands before bed, and the next morning my hands are clean, soft, and good all day long.  </li>
            <li>It is a little greasy, but when you&#x27;re really looking for moisturizing that lasts, well, I&#x27;ve learned to live with it and don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li>I applied a dab to the top of my hands, and immediately got a subtle burning sensation.</li>
            <li>It is usually much more expensive and isn&#x27;t a very big tube, so it goes too quickly for the price.</li>
            <li>Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product on my hands, elbows, feet, etc--any body part that is really dry that needs a little more TLC.  </li>
            <li>But in the last few years, since moving to the Pacific Northwest coast, my skin has had major dry patches and a kind of dullish appearance.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, slightly greasy texture but necessary to nourish the skin.</li>
            <li>When nothing else will work, when everything else feels thin  and is absorbed way too quickly, this does the trick.</li>
            <li>This thick cream healed the dry patches in a week, which I&#x27;m thrilled with.  </li>
            <li>The purity of the ingredients is apparent: my skin is sensitive to minerals and additives.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for very cracked fingertips and dry feet.</li>
            <li>It is a heavier cream but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and really helps fix those problem dry patches.</li>
            <li>Really helped with the dry areas that nothing else would touch.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this for those dry, cracked winter hands.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, sensitive or older skin and are considering a lactic or glycolic peel in the fall or winter WELEDA</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it is a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with in need of a slightly heavier hand or face or even body moisturizer, as well as anyone with psoriasis or eczema (I have mild eczema and my father who also uses this product daily has psoriasis).</li>
            <li>Is good for super dry feet, I used a few times on my face, I can barely stand the smell, is pretty bad as a &#x27;nature scents&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine using it as a general body creme.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>She also washes her hands frequently since she works with the public all day.</li>
            <li>I read a review (and will leave one shortly) regarding this product, and must agree with the reviewer who said the scent wasn&#x27;t natural</li>
            <li>The smell of the cream is definitely apparent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Since using Weleda Skin Food, I have not had this problem; it is the only cream that keeps my hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because apparently Julia Roberts just \\&quot;loves it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It offers the level of moisturization that you would expect and it is lasting.  </li>
            <li>So far the reaction from my friends has universally been &amp;#34;yeah, it has a scent</li>
            <li>It is a combination of an old leather jacket mixed with lemons and some car tires.</li>
            <li>Light smell, Thick moisture, that melts into your skin like an oil.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a hand and cuticle cream because it is so thick and lux.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s way overpriced and smells kind of weird and grassy.</li>
            <li>Like a previous reviewer mentioned the scent is so strong, like pine sol or some other cleaning agent.</li>
            <li>For dry skin I highly recommend...</li>
            <li>This is great for the dry cold winters, and anytime.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product especially for dry hand skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, mentioned it to a few friends with dry heels, they purchased and have seen a positive difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and used it as my moisturiser (on my face and under my eyes)</li>
            <li>The cream is very oily at first but the moisture sinks in and you don&#x27;t even notice it after a little while.</li>
            <li>It does seem a bit greasy when it goes on, but it just sinks right into my combo dry skin</li>
            <li>I will use it on any dry spots all year and wish they had a slightly lighter version for a full body lotion in winter</li>
            <li>I did leave this in my car once and the oil separated from the  other stuff so after that it wasn&#x27;t much use to me because I couldn&#x27;t get the lotion to remix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thick and rich.</li>
            <li>Little citrus-y and very much of Calendula, part of the Marigold family.  </li>
            <li>the old alcohol- and dye-free formulation; the new one says Active Sport System</li>
            <li>My fave moisturizer for normal to dry skin!</li>
            <li>Finally a natural deeply moisturizing product that actually does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but definitely not any better.</li>
            <li>Of course sun has been a major factor in this, but my easy-to-care for skin had finally taken on its toll...</li>
            <li>A little greasy at first</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and natural, but not overpowering--it reminds me ever so faintly of citrus.  </li>
            <li>My other complaint is/was, it&#x27;s greasier than most creams.</li>
            <li>While Weleda Skin Food may be all natural, it has a strange smell and leaves a greasy film on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had success with Weleda products in the past but Skin Food is number one.</li>
            <li>, I slowly went from diaper cream and baby soap to many of their other products.</li>
            <li>I live in CO which has a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very thick and could easily be called a paste.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased at least a dozen tubes and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>For starters I have sensitive and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my dry skin shine like a young girl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Super thick and moisturizing - one tube lasts forever</li>
            <li>it is super thick</li>
            <li>It can leave your face with a little bit of a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; but feels great on skin if you live in dry or cold climate.</li>
            <li>This is suppose to be used in certain rough or dry chapped areas.</li>
            <li>A homeopathic doctor told me that if I held something and it made me either strong or weak, then the product is good or bad for my body respectively.  </li>
            <li>great if you have bad dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>It costs 75% less than my normal products!</li>
            <li>but I blot when I forget and put a little too much on.  </li>

            <li> Weleda Skin food is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> I cannot purchase or feel good using it knowing that.  </li>
            <li> Good for me</li>
            <li> Just because it came from a plant doesn&#x27;t make it good for you.</li>
            <li> It smells good but leaves my skin greasy for hours yet dries out my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> It makes skin look and FEEL good.</li>
            <li> I have good skin</li>
            <li> Really good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> So it didn&#x27;t seem a good protectant for my skin.</li>
            <li> good cream for hands and body for the winter time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The product is good</li>
            <li> Smells good, absorbs well into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy but it didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized at all.</li>
            <li> Although there were already good reviews, I was unsure of the texture.  </li>
            <li> Really good for my skin</li>
            <li> Every time I put it on my husband comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream and my father-in-law fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> this is my very favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of guy that likes a good, intensive treatment for those situations.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, smells good and its kind of addicting.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes the skin very effectively and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> tip for best application is to squirt it onto your finger then dab it around on your hand, then when you rub it in it will be pretty evenly distributed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails very healthy and lets them get to a nice length.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> This cream is really amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> their face balm is amazing but they changed it over to peanut oil a couple years ago ...</li>

            <li> is amazing</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker, but not greasy, and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Now that my babies are all grown, I am seeing another challenge - my own face which is aging with the passing of time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice,  works well.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s nice, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wanna-be faux rose essence.  </li>
            <li> Good SKIN CUISINE :)</li>
            <li> I need to use some more to see if it&#x27;s good for my skin or not .Until</li>
            <li> A miracle product for winter, it also works well in the warmer months for a kind of deep-hand-conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a lemon smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> I was kind of oily, greasy.  </li>
            <li> Also received a sample of their Buckthorn hand lotion and really liked the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Nice, neutral smell.</li>
            <li> It does go on fairly greasy feeling at first, but then it melts into your skin and it feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and came quickly</li>
            <li> And best of all its a natural product!  </li>
            <li> My pregnant daughter is in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this product based on reviews, because I&#x27;ve used some of Weleda products and have been happy, and also because I loved the ingredients at a quick glance.  </li>
            <li> Well, I bought this product as many folk have testified before me, because of the enthusiastic and gushing commentary from blogs and magazines.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for keeping (or getting) the bottoms of your feet (soles) soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best skin product for my face.</li>
            <li> I love this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product greatly exceeded my expectations, you have to try it to truly know its worth.</li>
            <li> That being said, some 60 minutes after application, the product has absorbed into my skin and my hands are very smooth and happy.  </li>
            <li> It smells very nice, fresh and almost lemony but not like a household cleaning product.</li>
            <li> love this cream, it is amazing for the hands and body, moisturizes so nicely, love the smell, the feeling it leaves on the skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, but it&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
            <li> This smells great and feels very pampering, I use it on both my face and my feet!</li>

            <li> I wish I could give this product more stars.</li>
            <li> I got to try it, and found out how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off after washing your hands (okay,</li>
            <li> It will, however, make your hands feel &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; for over 15 mins after you apply it--like most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This cream does have a pronounced scent, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not greasy, after a couple of minutes it is absorbed into your skin and even smells good.</li>
            <li> Okay, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I plan to give them a try tonight:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and very creamy.</li>
            <li> - I love the smell and</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this cream</li>
            <li> My hand and nails LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li> And now you require more words to evaluate something I bought from you.</li>
            <li> My feet love it and so do my nail beds.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better products.  </li>
            <li> Love it and may order more.</li>
            <li> Also helped reduce redness and irritation on my skin and kept my skin healthy while recovering from my peel.</li>
            <li> I really like it and think it is a great quality.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> , I can safely say it&#x27;s been 10 hours</li>
            <li> I particularly love it on my feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; a gardener &amp; my hands are like sandpaper and most winters</li>
            <li> to mention, many Weleda products use peanut oil ...</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> It is lovely smelling and does the job.</li>
            <li> I read so many comments and done research on this product, still is not &#x27;the one&#x27; product that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> i love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually more of an ointment than a cream.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and things are much better by morning.  </li>
            <li> You fphave to use it more than once a day</li>
            <li> my favorite intensive hand cream</li>
            <li> This product is thicker than most moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel of it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am going to order more now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like it though to continue using it because I absolutely love Weleda products for the purity, holistic approach and the fact that they work well</li>
            <li> I love this cream</li>
            <li> Very rich.</li>
            <li> Very rich and moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> This s a very rich creme.</li>
            <li> As I sniff my skin, it&#x27;s developed a more beautiful tone and is more robust.  </li>
            <li> And well, she looks pretty good</li>
            <li> it makes skin wonderfully hydrated, and this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A little oily, but otherwise a great great product.</li>
            <li> For dry Boston winter skin the best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> The best creme for dry skin and winter time.</li>
            <li> The BEST lotion for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Super effective.</li>
            <li> I have to say it is an excellent product for your face if you want something creamier and heavier for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin we have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes work in a extremely dry room wearing nitrile gloves all day, so if I didn&#x27;t have access to an excellent moisturizer like this one, I&#x27;d have the hands of a 99-year-old man.</li>
            <li> This cream works the best for my dry hands -- not greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> The cream is super rich, not water down or runny, giving you a very amazing feeling that every drop of oil carrying all of its wonderful properties is nourishing your cells.  </li>
            <li> This is the best for dry skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> results-wise, it is probably the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be greasy at first, but it dries pretty quickly and makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> so I probably will not use it during the summer but for winter and very dry skin; it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy too and non-fragrant, which is great on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cream for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s free of parabens.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome on rough skin, like elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on a fresh scar, it&#x27;s helped the area fade nicely.  </li>
            <li> It has a unique putty like texture that is very light not to be deceiving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and nourishing and I am in love with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not pow!  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is very mild and dissipates soon after use.</li>
            <li> The smell is very mild and</li>
            <li> smells herbal, not too strong.</li>
            <li> The smell of the cream is strong but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Weleda skin food is it if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I first began using it when I lived in France as it was quite popular there at the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even given it as gifts on occasion and those lucky folks love it and now are true converts!  </li>
            <li> I use this for my face, very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> recently as last year (I am now in my fifties)--at one party--I received three separate compliments on my smooth, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a hand cream and it works fine,</li>
            <li> My hands got smooth very quickly and have stayed that way.</li>
            <li> Love, love this lotion, smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Thicker than most hand creams, but does not get sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> now , nothing extraordinary !</li>
            <li> (their calendula baby products have been wonderful for our little one&#x27;s skin).</li>
            <li> Love this, have used it for years to create a fresh glow on my face after make up application - warm it in your hands and tap it on your cheek bones, above eye brows, jawline and cleavage - you will look refreshed and healthy!</li>
            <li> Now I wake up with smooth moist nourished feeling skin.</li>
            <li> The skin is thicker in those areas, and this stuff keeps that skin smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample when I ordered from Ulta.</li>
            <li> I use it lightly around the eyes and cheeks and etc.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item when it was grouped with another free trial item and listed for $15.</li>
            <li> so I feel better over using this fresh smelling product.</li>
            <li> Also works to smooth my bald head.</li>
            <li> it is so light and nourishing to my skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer especially during winter.  </li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> I got this primarily for my hands, elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy using it everywhere else.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Another fantastic Weleda product, quality is guaranteed.  </li>
            <li> it is also so great for the entire body!</li>
            <li> (this is a chemical ingredient in Aveeno 24 hour moisture), just good quality natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have used this very emollient cream, mostly on my hands, for many years.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really strong at first and not my favorite</li>
            <li> Lovely clean scent, not quite floral, is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with what it has done for my 54 year old skin!</li>
            <li> This smells great, but I would only use this super sparingly on something like an excema patch.</li>
            <li> Now that I wear gloves to wash items in soapy water, I don&#x27;t need this rich hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> I quess I prefer natural moisturizers that absorb better and feel more comfortable on the skin than this one.</li>
            <li> The overall scent is nice and herbaceous, so if not for the lanolin, this would get five stars!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and has more competitive pricing than in stores.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this because I had read an article that Victoria Beckham uses it.</li>
            <li> Any residual gets rubbed into my hands and simultaneously gets absorbed by my nails, which has had a strengthening effect on them as well!</li>
            <li> I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it and it leaves a rich feel to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too rich to wear on my face even if I am on the drier side.</li>
            <li> It is totally pure, has a light lemony scent which I love, and nourishes my skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Great for winter dry hands.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin issues</li>
            <li> Great for dry elbows.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for feet but leaves hands feeling dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time...love the smell (clean) and the results...</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR my favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li> I have a rose refreshing spray from Jurlique that is true rose essence--just the flower, no more.  </li>
            <li> Other wise, I am really enjoying this.</li>
            <li> ;  She was so right!  </li>
            <li> It is very effective on dry hands after doing the dishes, while flying, or just during the winter.</li>
            <li> Great for rough hands and  cracked feet.</li>
            <li> A few days use of this and my hands and nails are smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this skin food it has helped me so much</li>
            <li> and I love this one as much.</li>
            <li> Always loved this company, especially the baby products.</li>
            <li> I have since tried the Weleda Wild Rose night cream, and after just a couple of days I can say...</li>
            <li> Does not absorb into the skin very well and the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> product did come with a sample of Wild Rose Pampering Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li> (INCI)Water (Aqua), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Lanolin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li> Nice earthy, natural scent.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this stuff at Whole Foods two years ago, and purchased it for a whopping $17 there--which is $5 more than at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Water, Sunflower Seed Oil, Lanolin, Sweet Almond Oil, Alcohol, Beeswax, Glyceryl Linoleate, Hydrolyzed Beeswax, Fragrance, Pansy Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Calendula Flower Extract, Cholestrol, Limonen, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral, Coumarin.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t use lotion very often.</li>
            <li> It rehydrates my skin in the winter and gives it a nice soft glow again.</li>
            <li> But I love it so much I literally spread it all over.</li>
            <li> Feel younger and look gorgeous everyday...fills in and creates youthful glow...</li>
            <li> My metro male loved this.</li>
            <li> The dates were all the same they were good til 2015</li>
            <li> Some people find it &#x27;nice&#x27;, &#x27;herby&#x27; or &#x27;natural&#x27; here in the reviews.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad one...</li>
            <li> Hands down the absolute BEST hand &amp; foot cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is the best thing for my feet, in fact, because it is better absorbed than other creams, and, if used overnight, will keep the skin smooth and protected from cracking or simply drying out.</li>
            <li> This is a superb cream for extremely dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of dry skin lotions and this is far and away the best.</li>
            <li> slightly greasy but in a good way :)</li>
            <li> Seems greasy when you first put it on, but soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s got pretty strong smell to it...</li>
            <li> Since it is very moisturizing, it helps plumps the skin and smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li> Its also a great healer for sun burns or other damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> Has a nice  citrusy light scent from essential oils that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know (think) that I would try this product on my face as it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as easily (quickly) as I would like.  </li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious and thick hand cream, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> There is some oil separation so each time I need to use there is greasy factor, however it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It also has a medicinal smell but dissipates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick healing.</li>
            <li> but I find that it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have switched over to the African Botanics balm and love it even more.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> The color of my skin changed it became more vibrant and glowing, the tone seems to be golden.</li>
            <li> After one use my hands felt smooth and replenished, and when i tested it on my face at night I experienced no breakouts or oiliness the next morning, only plush smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed by the scent at first, but the nourishment it provides is hard to match.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a cream that is rich and natural enough for my thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> At first the scent is fresh and light, but then undertones of patchouli emerge.  </li>
            <li> Also good for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Gets absorbed relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> I would not want to put this on and then be touching my eyeglasses or cell phone screen or pretty much anything that I do not want smudges on.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but a little strong.</li>
            <li> Helps the hands so much!!</li>
            <li> This product has a distinctive but pleasant scent, my husband even likes it and has been using it more than me lately.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and is rich and helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my whole body including a light layer on my face.</li>
            <li> My adult daughter recommended it to me because she was so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my complexion a fresh, dewy look.  </li>
            <li> is Fresh&#x27;s CrÃ¨me Ancienne.</li>
            <li> But it is all worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Love how soft it makes me skin feel after using it.</li>
            <li> and I see that people have had a lot of success with using it for eczema.</li>
            <li> My mom loved it so much on her last visit that she took it home!</li>
            <li> And she rarely tries/likes unfamiliar products.</li>
            <li> I love that its all natural though.</li>
            <li> I love the natural smell and products.  </li>
            <li> I have already seen a change with my skin as it seems to be creating more natural oils.</li>
            <li> in)&lt;br /&gt;the name is fun</li>
            <li> its a little greasy on your hands, but very effective and protective.</li>
            <li> It is rich and wonderful for a daily hand lotion or trouble spot fixer.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasing, light smell and is a very nice, thick consistency.</li>
            <li> The price is great as opposed to Whole Foods and other stores...</li>
            <li> A bit oily at first, but it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little interesting, not bad, but more vegetative or medicinal than perfume-y.</li>
            <li> This product is very hydrating and rich.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of it before, nor had she ever used it, but bought it from other reviews looking good.  </li>
            <li> well it doesn&#x27;t for me, but I take care not to wash right after applying it) though.  </li>
            <li> I squirt the strip onto my hand right after I get out of the shower, rub my hands together and then apply 1 hand to each foot.  </li>
            <li> Just the right creme for every skin</li>
            <li> (right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for my cuticles, small scrapes and cuts and even on my psoriasis, all with great success.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hands feeling very soft and helps heal cracks and redness very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as though your skin is thirsty, and this is like a cool smoothie that applies richly and yet not heavily.</li>
            <li> And Weleda is my favorite brand - everything is natural and the packaging is very mindful.</li>
            <li> A nice hand cream for the dry hands</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want a lot of chemicals on my face and they are amazed that this relatively inexpensive cream does such a great job on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hands are very soft and smooth the morning after.</li>
            <li> Weleda is a very natural and paraben free company</li>
            <li> I gave this to the boyfriend, who washes his hands a great deal and uses a degreaser product called Goo Gone that completely desiccates the skin, and this stuff prevents the extreme cracking and dryness that he used to get.</li>
            <li> I suppose it could have been quickly absorbed into the skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t feel like it to me.</li>
            <li> It is just a little bit greasy when you first apply it, but in this case I think that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs at a perfect rate, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was hooked from the first application.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Weleda!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, have used it daily for years as my moisturizer as well as an impromptu hand-creme.</li>
            <li> Skin Food is an essential part of my healthy skin tool kit.</li>
            <li> I first used it on my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> You can even use it in your face and lips and will notice a difference in the dryness of your skin within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I distinctly remember my mom using some sort of lanolin product, so I&#x27;m not creeped out about that whole sheep by-product thing.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I want in a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I had read to try it on your face after exfoliating and so that is what I did the first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks a Bunch  Slainte!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> On the box it claims \\&quot;\\&quot;QUALITY, CERTIFIED NATURAL SKIN CARE, FREE OF</li>
            <li> and I really think it helped it heal faster!</li>
            <li> When you first put this on, you think it is going to be too think and never soak in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance -- it&#x27;s similar to the Baby line that is based on calendula, which is what turned me on to Weleda in the first place.</li>
            <li> Pretty greasy but does moisturize.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, here is the funny thing about this cream</li>
            <li> Okay, I wish they would make this bigger and specifically for the body all over.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a combination of organic and biodynamic-based skin care products (Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food and Acure), as well as a potent anti-aging serum from Visual Changes (Resurrection) and a bi-weekly routine with Nu-Face Trinity.</li>
            <li> It does have a shine when you apply it at first but within an hour or so, it does absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  </li>
            <li> its pretty oily</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the first winter where the skin on my thumbs and index fingers have not split or bled.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although this seems greasy at first, your skin just drinks it up and that feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> If I used it more regular that would not be the case.</li>
            <li> It is a staple in my first aid like antibiotic cream is a must to others.</li>
            <li> Skin Food does not do that; the moisturizing and softening effects it has are pretty darn persistent.</li>
            <li> better to buy another similar brand&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Thanks Weleda!</li>
            <li> The consistency is more like toothpaste than a traditional hand cream.</li>
            <li> Why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European made - much higher standards for ingredients (and safer ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> Trying new products is often intimidating for me since so often, they lead to breakouts that take a week or more to clear up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;only downside: if it gets VERY VERY hot, like all day in the dash of a car during summertime, the oils can separate and you may get a lap full of liquid if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfumy, just a natural clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream and have been buying it for years at my local Mrs.Greens and Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> my skin feel fresh, moisturized, and soft, at the beginning is a little bit greasy, but after the skin absorb the cream feels really good..</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be so uptight about it if the cream had a very light smell (indicating small quantities), but when it smells this strong, you know the levels of these ingredients are very high.</li>
            <li> Weleda makes good quality natural skincare but this one is very greasy and sticky, and not really all that moisturizing.</li>
            <li> But it absorbs pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have bought several tubes so far and will continue happily shelling out the cost in the future.</li>
            <li> I like that it is full of natural and even some organically derived ingredients.</li>
            <li> After applying a product I like my skin to say, &amp;#34;Oh, thank you for the drink, kind lady&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m telling you, and I have dry skin in winter, live in Alaska, if I used this product on my face, I&#x27;m-a thinking my face would unfriend me on Facebook.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, so I am not sure what another reviewer was referring to, other than it could have been the Weleda Sea Buckthorn, which was a lighter, greaser cream with the most amazing scent (I almost purchased that instead!)</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to have great skin; no breakouts ever and very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Great for that dry winter skin of New England and similar environments.</li>
            <li> It just works magic on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess it might be ok to use on dry skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use stuff with artifical ingredients, or perfumes because my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this product, and given how dry my skin gets during the winter i gave it a try.</li>
            <li> not true rose essence.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream, it is very soothing for dry hands.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry and rough hands, it will really soften them up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed some significant changes in my face and neckline over the past 2 years, namely sagging jowl-line, chin lines, more eye wrinkles and sagging eyelids.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the prior review (minus that i would buy it again):  its not as easy as most creams to put on because its so dense (there&#x27;s almost a</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but for dry skin, this is a good thing!   </li>
            <li> Great for rubbing into hands and feet at night before bed but do not recommend as a &amp;#34;pocket book&amp;#34; moisturizer because it is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but very good for skin.  </li>
            <li> As advertised was very effective for my dry and rough skin.  </li>
            <li> A bit greasy when first applied but seems to dry or be absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> It was such a huge relief.</li>
            <li> This was very helpful for my hands when I was not wearing gloves.  </li>
            <li> The smell really fades fast though.</li>
            <li> Seems to absorb readily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> , I found this at Marshall&#x27;s for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received it without the free item, no receipt,  and now (not even a week later) it&#x27;s up for $11...</li>
            <li> It does seem to be very hydrating, but a tad bit greasy.</li>
            <li> This skin food works really well</li>
            <li> I use it just like a very nourishing hand cream or as a overnight treatment under cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> Within 2 minutes intense itching.</li>
            <li> This is a super enriching lotion that is not greasy at all and really makes a difference for super dry skin.</li>
            <li> Really protects the skin.</li>
            <li> Some will find the scent objectionable because scents are very subjective.</li>
            <li> If your skin is wet when you apply it, you know to hold the moisture in, it just slips over the top if you skin and won&#x27;t spread or stay in place at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not so much lotion as a treatment.</li>
            <li> Really, if you can afford the price, try this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 6 years now and have NEVER broken out.</li>
            <li> I put too much on my elbows</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really use it before going out as it will make my&lt;br /&gt;face too shiny and oily.  </li>
            <li> It can be greasy if you put too much of it on.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m barefoot most of the time living in Hawaii, this is the only lotion I use to keep my legs, especially my heels, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> , I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> I really like the way he works on my sons skin.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product very well.  </li>
            <li> It really helps hydrate my hands after working in the dirt.</li>
            <li> Also makeup applies much easier.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well</li>
            <li> It might be a bit much for men in warmer months and depending how much your skin takes in.</li>
            <li> Really highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My cat likes it just as well as coconut oil when she gets ready to kiss me goodnight.  </li>
            <li> I found the cream to be very greasy, even after wearing over night.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combo skins, its just too much for my face to absorb.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend that you buy!</li>
            <li> It has also really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> It really does moisturize and works on the elbows.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond&#x27;s makes a couple different formulas but this by far is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> in a nice sturdy tube to preserve freshness (no light or air gets</li>
            <li> You need to know that it is thick but don&#x27;t let that scare you - it&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion, now I want to try The other products</li>
            <li> I just hope, like many other companies, they dont change the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every other night and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> I usually look for nice smell and hydrating hand lotions.</li>
            <li> Its also a better than average hand cream.</li>
            <li> hands have been full of moisture ,that actually is retained, ever since.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t really care what Victoria uses per se, but the gist of the article was that this was a low-priced lotion that even a wealthy and discerning customer would prefer over the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> A little to thick to use during the morning, but perfect for a night cream</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply to my face during the super cold and dry winter but haven&#x27;t been that impressed.</li>
            <li> My hands are smooth and no longer dry</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I no longer wake with a shaving rash from the previous day; and my shaves are closer and far more comfortable because my skin is properly moisturized/lubricated/replenished/softened, as is my growing stubble.</li>
            <li> I am more satisfied with it than with the expensive face creams I have used.</li>
            <li> The entire family loves it because it&#x27;s super moisturizing yet never greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using this cream steadily for 1 year.  </li>
            <li> After trying so many different hand lotions this is the only one that worked and stopped my hands from cracking.  </li>
            <li> it has a light yellow hue to it and you can clearly see that it has a lot of oil in it.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, creme is thick and rich.</li>
            <li> so if you have other than extremely dry skin you will break out, for dry skin its very good</li>
            <li> Seems to improve the skin, high quality face cream.</li>
            <li> Was highly touted, but not for me</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this skin cream.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine because some actress whose name escapes me was using it and highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Everything I have ever tried from Weleda has been a high quality product and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> very cheap package first impression and thick cream makes me feel oily.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy cream, which is great for really dry skin!</li>
            <li> But the cost is so much cheaper that I still come out far ahead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream, so may be too much for most faces, but I&#x27;d recommend this for whole body application as well.</li>
            <li> I normally use it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed and lasting results.</li>
            <li> Skin food may not be packaged beautifully and perhaps it&#x27;s thick consistency seems it would be too much for one&#x27;s face, but for me this product sinks in and leaves me with an even tone and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is too thick to use regularly on my face, but sometimes I just slather it on and in the morning the difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> Weleda skin food actually gets absorbed into my skin and increases the moisture retention.</li>
            <li> For a long time I was only able to find it in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily and thick, but nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> And when I use it on my hands, it gets absorbed quickly without too much of that sticky feel left by other creams.</li>
            <li> People have started asking me what am I doing to my face, am I wearing new makeup because I look brighter and refreshed (music to my ears).</li>
            <li> and there is hands down absolutely NOTHING better than this product, which I accidentally won in a contest at Chuck&#x27;s in Florida several years ago.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes it&#x27;s sunk deeply into my skin and the after effects are amazing.</li>
            <li> Skin Food is my go to when my hands and cuticles are super dry.</li>
            <li> Heals dry or razor burned skin quickly and without an oily build-up.</li>
            <li> absolutely my first choice for healing parched dry skin--excellent pure ingredients</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and often breaks out from skin care products.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft with a feeling of protection.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> It seems very natural</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and you only need the size of a pea to do your whole face!  </li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning and my skin was the softest it has ever been and for the first time aside from photoshop, my skin looked &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and it stayed that way throughout the day and well into the night.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold, if you&#x27;re on the fence don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> It feels really heavy when you initially put it on but absorbs nicely and you will wake up with baby soft nourished skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s funny as I have never used it for anything but a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> I had used coconut oil x2, Jojoba Oil x 2, wearing nitrile gloves at night--and this product cleared it up 75% first time I used it and the balance was gone by the 3rd time using it.</li>
            <li> granted, my skin is very dry and it drinks up the lotion quickly.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews of a bad scent, but I find the product mild smelling to slightly pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly strong smelling citrus/lime scented paste-like cream that is moderately greasy and takes a minute to soak in that, in my experience, will heal and then prevent dry, cracked and calloused skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks a few years younger and while it doesn&#x27;t last after a few days it&#x27;s great anyway!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and thick but you don&#x27;t need much, and it really does do the job.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend that amount or less and get a huge bottle of Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> Fixed my super dry skin!</li>
            <li> My hands will occasionally get kind of dry, and I get dry skin on my elbows.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more and just an FYI that the larger size (2.5) seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s the best in cold and dry weather for replenishing skin and keeping one&#x27;s hands soft.</li>
            <li> It is very strong so a little goes a very long way, plus</li>
            <li> As for the irritation: my skin is very sensitive, and when I buy a new lotion or body wash, I usually expect that it will cause some sort of rash/reaction, so the irritation is more my personal problem than a shortcoming of the product itself.  </li>
            <li> A little greasy but great right after the shower for tough skin areas such as elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great during the cold weather though.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face when it&#x27;s cold and windy and it&#x27;s a great help.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s common with most natural creams that don&#x27;t have chemical binders.</li>
            <li> All the same, it does moisturize really well, naturally.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> so I can wake up with soft hands.</li>
            <li> But I gotta say that it does make your hands soft.</li>
            <li> Skin Food doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my go-to lotion-</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Totally unexpected surprise:</li>
            <li> there natural oils</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and it hasnâ€™t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> When I was young</li>
            <li> I figured this would cost an arm and a leg but was surprised that it was rather affordable.  </li>
            <li> The cream leaves your skin moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every skin moisturizer ever made, almost -- natural and chemical, mixtures of the two,</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old with very&lt;br /&gt;dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I tolerate it for soft hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> During the day I use Nivea Post Shave lotion for sensitive skin (</li>
            <li> nose is too sensitive to it</li>
            <li> Have only seen it at Vitamin Cottage and Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> of holistic, naturally healing ingredients</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m particularly sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I never &#x27;judge&#x27; natural lotion for it&#x27;s scent unless there is added perfume in it that doesn&#x27;t need to be there, which is in this case how I feel about this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have never had so many complements in the last few months.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll use Aveeno as a benchmark (most of the people I know have used it), and this is twice as thick maybe?  </li>
            <li> this may be too thick for many to use on their faces, but i tell you it makes</li>
            <li> I started developing dry, flaky patches on my arms, and my normal moisturizing routine of pure organic coconut oil wasn&#x27;t doing anything to help.  </li>
            <li> I usually squeeze a little onto my hands before bed, and the next morning my hands are clean, soft, and good all day long.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy, but when you&#x27;re really looking for moisturizing that lasts, well, I&#x27;ve learned to live with it and don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li> I applied a dab to the top of my hands, and immediately got a subtle burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It is usually much more expensive and isn&#x27;t a very big tube, so it goes too quickly for the price.</li>
            <li> Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product on my hands, elbows, feet, etc--any body part that is really dry that needs a little more TLC.  </li>
            <li> But in the last few years, since moving to the Pacific Northwest coast, my skin has had major dry patches and a kind of dullish appearance.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, slightly greasy texture but necessary to nourish the skin.</li>
            <li> When nothing else will work, when everything else feels thin  and is absorbed way too quickly, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This thick cream healed the dry patches in a week, which I&#x27;m thrilled with.  </li>
            <li> The purity of the ingredients is apparent: my skin is sensitive to minerals and additives.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for very cracked fingertips and dry feet.</li>
            <li> It is a heavier cream but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and really helps fix those problem dry patches.</li>
            <li> Really helped with the dry areas that nothing else would touch.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this for those dry, cracked winter hands.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, sensitive or older skin and are considering a lactic or glycolic peel in the fall or winter WELEDA</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it is a bit greasy at first</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with in need of a slightly heavier hand or face or even body moisturizer, as well as anyone with psoriasis or eczema (I have mild eczema and my father who also uses this product daily has psoriasis).</li>
            <li> Is good for super dry feet, I used a few times on my face, I can barely stand the smell, is pretty bad as a &#x27;nature scents&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine using it as a general body creme.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> She also washes her hands frequently since she works with the public all day.</li>
            <li> I read a review (and will leave one shortly) regarding this product, and must agree with the reviewer who said the scent wasn&#x27;t natural</li>
            <li> The smell of the cream is definitely apparent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Since using Weleda Skin Food, I have not had this problem; it is the only cream that keeps my hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because apparently Julia Roberts just \\&quot;loves it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It offers the level of moisturization that you would expect and it is lasting.  </li>
            <li> So far the reaction from my friends has universally been &amp;#34;yeah, it has a scent</li>
            <li> It is a combination of an old leather jacket mixed with lemons and some car tires.</li>
            <li> Light smell, Thick moisture, that melts into your skin like an oil.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a hand and cuticle cream because it is so thick and lux.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way overpriced and smells kind of weird and grassy.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer mentioned the scent is so strong, like pine sol or some other cleaning agent.</li>
            <li> For dry skin I highly recommend...</li>
            <li> This is great for the dry cold winters, and anytime.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product especially for dry hand skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, mentioned it to a few friends with dry heels, they purchased and have seen a positive difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and used it as my moisturiser (on my face and under my eyes)</li>
            <li> The cream is very oily at first but the moisture sinks in and you don&#x27;t even notice it after a little while.</li>
            <li> It does seem a bit greasy when it goes on, but it just sinks right into my combo dry skin</li>
            <li> I will use it on any dry spots all year and wish they had a slightly lighter version for a full body lotion in winter</li>
            <li> I did leave this in my car once and the oil separated from the  other stuff so after that it wasn&#x27;t much use to me because I couldn&#x27;t get the lotion to remix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick and rich.</li>
            <li> Little citrus-y and very much of Calendula, part of the Marigold family.  </li>
            <li> the old alcohol- and dye-free formulation; the new one says Active Sport System</li>
            <li> My fave moisturizer for normal to dry skin!</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deeply moisturizing product that actually does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but definitely not any better.</li>
            <li> Of course sun has been a major factor in this, but my easy-to-care for skin had finally taken on its toll...</li>
            <li> A little greasy at first</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and natural, but not overpowering--it reminds me ever so faintly of citrus.  </li>
            <li> My other complaint is/was, it&#x27;s greasier than most creams.</li>
            <li> While Weleda Skin Food may be all natural, it has a strange smell and leaves a greasy film on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have had success with Weleda products in the past but Skin Food is number one.</li>
            <li> , I slowly went from diaper cream and baby soap to many of their other products.</li>
            <li> I live in CO which has a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick and could easily be called a paste.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased at least a dozen tubes and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> For starters I have sensitive and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin shine like a young girl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Super thick and moisturizing - one tube lasts forever</li>
            <li> it is super thick</li>
            <li> It can leave your face with a little bit of a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; but feels great on skin if you live in dry or cold climate.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be used in certain rough or dry chapped areas.</li>
            <li> A homeopathic doctor told me that if I held something and it made me either strong or weak, then the product is good or bad for my body respectively.  </li>
            <li> great if you have bad dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> It costs 75% less than my normal products!</li>
            <li> but I blot when I forget and put a little too much on.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, I had been tried body lotion of different brands, but there were a few spots on my legs were very stubborn, the skin was still rough, itchy from time to time and discolored until I use this cream.</li>
            <li> I feel like this may be a little too heavy this summer for my skin, but for winter use, this has been unmatched by so many other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> It is very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> I will never waste money on other brands again.</li>
            <li> what I did is mix a little water with the amount I&#x27;d like to apply to help with absorption and water the powerful formula down to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really very moisturizing for dry skin and kind of expensive to use as just a hand cream.</li>
            <li> Adjust how much you use - a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have always been one to follow fads and  try new and exciting (expensive)  face products.</li>
            <li> It totally cleared up the deep (and sore) cracks on my heels and smoothed the chapped &amp; dry skin on my hands &amp; feet.  </li>
            <li> It is thick enough to last the night without feeling like you have too much product on your skin.</li>
            <li> At least this purchase brought the price down significantly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> In the winter my husbands fingers get so dry they crack open.  </li>
            <li> My hands, especially in the winter time, get really dry - to the point that I get cracks on the sides of my index fingers.</li>
            <li> but it tends to get a bit dry especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s dry heat in the winter or forgetting to use my gardening gloves in the summer, this is THE product that actually does relieve and heal my skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using Retin-A, and my face was incredibly dry, peeling, and irritated.</li>
            <li> So, I went to buy a small tube at the local natural food drugstore, and have not looked back!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose, and can smell that slight \\&quot;sheepie\\&quot; smell when I put it on!</li>
            <li> Weleda Skin Food works wonders on my extra dry hands!</li>
            <li> I keep it around and use it at the first sign of skin irritant or serious dryness.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing I have tried that has worked on the very dry skin around my nose.</li>
            <li> so wash my hands constantly and as a result they are very dry.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very oily and hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely helpful to me as a frequent hand-washer due to my career.</li>
            <li> not surprised why Victoria Beckham is using</li>
            <li> After it soaks in (a min or so), my hands stay moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> , why did I wait so long to try it.  </li>
            <li> Takes way to long to sink into my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is a harder to get all of the product out when the tube is metal because it has no bounce back.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I used to use La Mer as part of my regular morning routine and although pleased with that product, it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> The cream is so thick, I don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Thick and takes a bit to sink in, but moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> recommended for dry skin, especially for instance when your hands are dry and chapped or rough.</li>
            <li> only problem is that the tube is small and doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> Maybe only adaptable to other body parts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without it this long!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day due to the thickness but it has definitely earned a permanent spot in my nighttime skin care!</li>
            <li> Your hands stay greasy for a very long time, if not for all time.</li>
            <li> My Swedish daughter-in-law recommended Weleda products to me and this one seems to be targeted to my dry skin for winter.</li>
            <li> This works so well on my dry, painful skin that I am willing to pay the still pretty pricey rate for it.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it during the day once or twice to get rid of dry skin flakes</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Even though I use gloves, I still get dry hands.</li>
            <li> The lady at our health food store recommended this cream for my really dry and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> My hands are constantly dry.  </li>
            <li> Too oily even for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am a health care clinician and I have to wash my hands a lot at work which makes my hands dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had cracked or dry heels or feet since I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> My hands were dry again within minutes.</li>
            <li> When it comes to really dry skin, I have found nothing that helps like this Skin Food</li>
            <li> The skin around my nails is constantly dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for the purpose of healing my dry hands</li>
            <li> This disappeared and didn&#x27;t seem to help with my dry hands.</li>
            <li> Was trying to find something to help for dry, cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab on cuticles, dry face.....good for winter chapping.and summer protection.  </li>
            <li> and I do have dry skin so for that this product works well</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and ran out within two weeks.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had to contend with the effects of dry air on his extremely dry and itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my hands and face and dry winter skin is healed.</li>
            <li> Works wonders in elbows and dry</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my husband&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> It has been a life saver for my dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> Coumarin is a carcinogenic ingredient, formerly used as the active ingredient in rat poison.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horribly dry, rough elbows that nothing ever seemed to help, and with just a few uses, they are completely repaired.</li>
            <li> This lotion is super thick and requires you apply very little.</li>
            <li> It may be a little to rich for problem skin or skin that breaks out alot, but for normal skin, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my poor dry skin needs in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Sad but true</li>
            <li> It lasts longer and it actually healed my dry skin so ended up using less in the end.</li>
            <li> For less dry parts I use other moisturizer and use this product for the extremely dry parts, so it does last a long time despite its quantity.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle for those with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I think if I used a smaller amount of product, less than a pea-sized droplet, I would have been happier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous foot cream.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry from being a hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, even my face when it is very dry.</li>
            <li> This thick skin food slathers on and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> During the cold and dry North East winters my hands are so dry they crack open, especially when I&#x27;m in soapy water too much.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small the tube of lotion is, but since it requires you to use such a small amount it has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I even like to wrap a little saran wrap around the areas to lock in extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Maybe throw in a little poison ivy next time?</li>
            <li> My cuticles are soft now instead of hard.</li>
            <li> Working with stone dries my hands badly and this material, a bit in the AM and more at bedtime, does the trick.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t make a bigger size.</li>
            <li> But, I had to wonder, would it work for the rough patches on my face???</li>
            <li> Although I saw the ingredient list before purchasing this, I assumed or hoped that the quantities of fragrant plant extracts would be small and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on fancy products touting grandiose results.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> seems they just made tracking number but did not ship out until few days later....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now and it is the only thing that works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use it a few times a week (before bed) and it keeps my hands from cracking and being like sand paper.  </li>
            <li> ~ I bought it, with the hope it would help my extremely rough hands.</li>
            <li> Its very thick...just extremely thick and heavy</li>
            <li> ~ The Skin Food was thick, very little scent and very healing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is very pricey for such a small amount and is VERY thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs well, but does leave a sticky/oily film behind, which is not an issue for me because I mainly use it before</li>
            <li> With this product, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used to wake up with dry tight skin on my face.</li>
            <li> (Victoria Beckham and other celebrities are said to use this product.)</li>
            <li> I learned about the product from Mailonline.com that mentioned that Victoria Beckham and some other celebrities use this product.  </li>
            <li> and this product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> have friends that pay a lot of money for Chanel and Clinique and other moisturizers</li>
            <li> I exchanged this for my nightly other regimen in an effort to save some dough.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products for moisturizing skin and preventing shaving rash, none worked as efficiently as Weleda Skin Food.</li>
            <li> I mean I can slather coconut oil on my skin and my skin is dry an hour or two later.</li>
            <li> I bought this tube of green lotion labeled &amp;#34;skin food&amp;#34; in search of a cure for my extremely dry, cracked winter skin.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer for the face that was heavy in order to help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken me out, and the red marks left from previous breakouts had faded after just two days of use.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover a relatively large</li>
            <li> so now I do it every night and as a woman who is older and is really skeptical about face creams, I couldn&#x27;t believe this cream which is made for rough skin could do this to my face.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We use a lot of Weleda products for our little one (diaper cream and toothgel), and when our little one began to suffer from dry skin on her cheeks and hands, I turned to Weleda.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> oil is supposed to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m tempted to try this, but it is thick enough that it might be difficult to cover the whole body).  </li>
            <li> In the end, it is expensive and comes in a tiny bottle, but then the packaging is aluminum (I think), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go bad quickly like you&#x27;d expect for a natural moisturizer--I guess bc of the packaging?  </li>
            <li> The scent of this product brought it down a star for me, though.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hands, and in the winter they become quite raw.</li>
            <li> No more dry elbows!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t care less about the fact the product contains lanolin.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, but was slightly dented.  </li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;s odd, I wonder what caused that,</li>
            <li> but it has a slightly greasy feel and is just not as moisturizing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Smells plant based and slightly medicinal.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing like the previous formulation).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just find it odd.</li>
            <li> Really odd.</li>
            <li> It is thick and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> greasy, and the product smelled a slight bit rancid, tried to use it a few times, gave up</li>
            <li> The fragrance was little off putting, and the lotion a bit sticky.  </li>
            <li> I started rubbing a little skin food on my nails before bed every night and now my nails are nicer than they have ever been.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily but that helps it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not familiar with Calendula, you might want to skip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but it has cured my skin problem that was bothering me for years.</li>
            <li> but just a little at a time</li>
            <li> but it stays a little greasy for my liking.</li>
            <li> I find it helpful to put a little on my hands and emulsify it a little before applying.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy</li>
            <li> Shaving is tough on the skin, but delivers a close shave in ridding one of daily stubble.</li>
            <li> (Note: some people say it is a bit heavy and filmy</li>
            <li> This has been my staple winter weather face cream for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This cream is heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it soaks into skin after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I even used some on my face a few times when I had some peeling after using retinoids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but it LASTS.</li>
            <li> While I do like it, a lotâ€¦ it has a few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> handle paper and cardboard almost everyday</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, almost greasy.  </li>
            <li> My youngest has had an eczema breakout after a round of antibiotics</li>
            <li> so I need a heavy lotion.  </li>
            <li> and it is heavy</li>
            <li> I use it at night, it&#x27;s a bit too heavy (it also adds some sheen to one&#x27;s skin) to use during the day.</li>
            <li> Expensive but works like no other!  </li>
            <li> Very thick and soothing - requires only a small amount but some might find it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have never had a product show such dramatic and immediate results.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand lotion I use in the cold weather and dry indoor heat.  </li>
            <li> this came in a larger size and less expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband had a bicycle accident and scraped up his hand pretty bad.</li>
            <li> You have to use very little do the product.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick, and a little goes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> purchased the 2.5 oz tube and squeezed out what I thought was a small portion for my hands.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for delicate skin,  like the face or neck.</li>
            <li> The tube is metal and looks small but contains a substantial amount of product.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for :/</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy/oily for a few minutes, at least in the generous amounts that I apply.</li>
            <li> Usually when I use a moisturizer on my hands, I can tell there&#x27;s a film on my hand to protect the outer layer.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten quite expensive though so my future daughter in law looked on line.  </li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but one tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve found that stops my skin from itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> but it is not effective and leaves me feeling like an oil tanker</li>
            <li> i have at least 2 tubes at all times</li>
            <li> It goes on thick but is not oily.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is luxuriously thick and nourishing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to thick and doesn&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> It is really thick, it reminds me of acrylic artist paint.</li>
            <li> Well, I must admit, it was akin to encouraging a slow moving drain to well, drain.  </li>
            <li> Now, some ppl may not like the thick consistency,</li>
            <li> Thick cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this holy grail product for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Smells to me like lime and cashews, but it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> It is my go-to for moisture in the cold dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, there is nothing like this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the product to buy, if your skin is in need of serious help.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience at all.</li>
            <li> Delivery time took way too long and when it was received the box was badly damaged.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin and even helped take the sting out of a really bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very thick</li>
            <li> Very thick and had an odor.</li>
            <li> Very thick oily paste squeezed from a tube.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream.</li>
            <li> In solely my opinion, it would be an improvement without any of the perfume, or at the very least it probably couldn&#x27;t get any worse without</li>
            <li> Anyway, the product is moisturizing enough for what I wanted to use it for (a hand lotion that I could keep in my purse), but I hate the smell and it irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a million creams (expensive and not so expensive) in my lifetime and there are very few that I think truly work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little oily but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> My real complaint is the scent.  </li>
            <li> its very thick and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry, just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> i bought this to apply to my skin after doing a scrub and it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> But wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into stuff that leaves a waxy film, or merely sits on the surface of the skin to be sweated or wiped away in minutes.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin Food for thirty-five years every day without fail.</li>
            <li> I used LancÃ´me&#x27;s Hydrix, which was a lot like Skin Food, but sadly it was discontinued</li>
            <li> unkind/unfair to sheep ~ and unnecessary!</li>
            <li> The product works for me and has yet to fail on repairing and replenishing skin.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it on my acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It became so bad I had to wash my feet and soak them in the sink.</li>
            <li> It has a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Even gave it to my coworker who has really bad eczema</li>
            <li> The scent is a mixture of lemongrass/Citrus that is packs a punch in a bad way.</li>
            <li> but too bad ... :(</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> did not know till now that this cream has lanolin in it :(</li>
            <li> Buy this product you wont be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had a horrible reaction using this cream.</li>
            <li> I now use it in EXCESS on my feet with socks on and even then it&#x27;s terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my favorite lotion of all time ...not surprised why Victoria Beckham is using</li>
            <li> My Swedish daughter-in-law recommended Weleda products to me and this one seems to be targeted to my dry skin for winter.</li>
            <li> I use Weleda Skin Food daily on my face and hands. I used to wake up with dry tight skin on my face. It would actually feel taut and sort of hurt. Now I wake up with smooth moist nourished feeling skin. I put this on my face every night before going to sleep. I also put in on my hands especially on my nails and cuticles. What a difference it has made in my nails and cuticles. My cuticles are soft now instead of hard. My cuticles no longer grow up onto my nails. My nails are noticeably stronger and no longer peel off in layers like they used to. I am so pleased with this product I have added it to my Amazon monthly Subscribe and Save order. My adult daughter recommended it to me because she was so pleased with the product. She has very sensitive skin and often breaks out from skin care products. She has had no issues using Weleda. She also washes her hands frequently since she works with the public all day. Weleda Skin Food has been a lifesaver for her in keeping her hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet, elbows, and knees. The skin is thicker in those areas, and this stuff keeps that skin smooth and supple. I enjoy the scent as well.</li>
            <li> Love the way this lotion feels on my skin. Like the packaging too. Although you have to keep reapplying often.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found anywhere for Weleda Skin Food. It is usually much more expensive and isn&#x27;t a very big tube, so it goes too quickly for the price. This works so well on my dry, painful skin that I am willing to pay the still pretty pricey rate for it. At least this purchase brought the price down significantly. The lotion itself is a bit oily, so just know that. It smells citrusy and yummy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. A little pricey but worth it. It has a pleasing, light smell and is a very nice, thick consistency. I use this product on my whole body including a light layer on my face. It seems to make my complexion a fresh, dewy look.  (Victoria Beckham and other celebrities are said to use this product.)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, now I want to try The other products</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I learned about the product from Mailonline.com that mentioned that Victoria Beckham and some other celebrities use this product.  I thought I&#x27;d use this product on my face but I don&#x27;t see any result just yet. It has a pleasant smell...more of herbal and citrus.  The price is great as opposed to Whole Foods and other stores...they charge $18 and up.</li>
            <li> We use a lot of Weleda products for our little one (diaper cream and toothgel), and when our little one began to suffer from dry skin on her cheeks and hands, I turned to Weleda. I&#x27;ve been using this cream on my hands and face, as well, and have immediately noticed a difference. There&#x27;s something about the formula that immediately locks in moisture into the skin. It smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> My husband hands are much better :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  This product is very hydrating and rich.  I will use it on any dry spots all year and wish they had a slightly lighter version for a full body lotion in winter (I&#x27;m tempted to try this, but it is thick enough that it might be difficult to cover the whole body).  It is just a little bit greasy when you first apply it, but in this case I think that is a good thing.  It is very effective and has a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love this skin food it has helped me so much</li>
            <li> This was very helpful for my hands when I was not wearing gloves.  Now that I wear gloves to wash items in soapy water, I don&#x27;t need this rich hand lotion.  I can get by with a regular skin lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and this product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> For dry Boston winter skin the best product I&#x27;ve used is Fresh&#x27;s CrÃ¨me Ancienne. However, it is extremely expensive. Weleda Skin food is a good substitute. I have to reapply it during the day once or twice to get rid of dry skin flakes (yes, I do use this on my face too). But the cost is so much cheaper that I still come out far ahead. I saw reviews of a bad scent, but I find the product mild smelling to slightly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I order it over and over again. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t make a bigger size.</li>
            <li> In the winter my husbands fingers get so dry they crack open.  This is the only product that takes care of it.  Rub it on the fingertips in the evening before bed each night and the problem is gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered another tube of Skin Food in anticipation of the coming winter.  This is the only hand lotion I use in the cold weather and dry indoor heat.  The smell is fantastic.  It goes on thick but is not oily.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I started using Weleda products when my daughter was born (1988). The creme for diaper rash was perfect. Then I found this skin creme for adults. I have never used anything else. It&#x27;s as though your skin is thirsty, and this is like a cool smoothie that applies richly and yet not heavily. It absorbs at a perfect rate, and a little goes a long way. The purity of the ingredients is apparent: my skin is sensitive to minerals and additives. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily: it feels dewy and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another indication of the quality is the scent of this creme. It&#x27;s floral without being overbearing. It smells of health and cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As recently as last year (I am now in my fifties)--at one party--I received three separate compliments on my smooth, beautiful skin. I was wearing no foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly. I love love love Skin Food.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream!  I have it on auto shipment now.  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this skin creme!!! It has been the only thing I have tried that has worked on the very dry skin around my nose. I got this as a free sample when I ordered from Ulta. I was hooked from the first application.It works great! The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant (for me) but its all a matter of preference. Some like the smell. The smell really fades fast though. It&#x27;s GREAT</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinfood for two years, with the BEST results! I love this product!  I have always been one to follow fads and  try new and exciting (expensive)  face products. I have been lucky enough to have great skin; no breakouts ever and very few wrinkles. But in the last few years, since moving to the Pacific Northwest coast, my skin has had major dry patches and a kind of dullish appearance.  Of course sun has been a major factor in this, but my easy-to-care for skin had finally taken on its toll...so I wanted to  go all-natural in my search for the perfect product, and Skinfood was the first.  A lady I work with had been using it on her elbows, and she let me try some.  WOW! I was amazed! No more dry elbows! But, I had to wonder, would it work for the rough patches on my face??? So, I went to buy a small tube at the local natural food drugstore, and have not looked back! I LOVE this product!  It feels like silk on my skin, and leaves it looking like I just came from a facial! It smells great, and guess what? It costs 75% less than my normal products! It may be a little to rich for problem skin or skin that breaks out alot, but for normal skin, you cannot go wrong! I will continue using this product until the day I die! Thanks, Weleda!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this product based on reviews, because I&#x27;ve used some of Weleda products and have been happy, and also because I loved the ingredients at a quick glance.  However, upon close inspection, I saw the last ingredients listed, COUMARIN!  Coumarin is a carcinogenic ingredient, formerly used as the active ingredient in rat poison.  WHY WHY Weleda would you ruin an otherwise PERFECT product with this ingredient?  I cannot purchase or feel good using it knowing that.  Sorry, just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face, very good for dry skin. The cream is so thick, I don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Weleda makes good quality natural skincare but this one is very greasy and sticky, and not really all that moisturizing. If you&#x27;re gonna use it on your face I would only recommend it for nighttime, it&#x27;s way too greasy for daytime and definitely too sticky under make-up. I&#x27;ve been using it as a hand cream and it works fine, but it&#x27;s not really very moisturizing for dry skin and kind of expensive to use as just a hand cream. I quess I prefer natural moisturizers that absorb better and feel more comfortable on the skin than this one.</li>
            <li> I use it lightly around the eyes and cheeks and etc.  Seems to absorb readily into the skin.  Your eyes won&#x27;t like it if you get it in them.  Seems to improve the skin, high quality face cream. Good for me</li>
            <li> Worth every penny - it never fails to do the job, this is great stuff!! My pregnant daughter is in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> recommended for dry skin, especially for instance when your hands are dry and chapped or rough. i love this stuff and it smells good. its very thick and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> greasy, and the product smelled a slight bit rancid, tried to use it a few times, gave up</li>
            <li> I enjoy this cream a lot! I have been using the baby version on my daughter for about a year and I love this one as much. Isn&#x27;t greasy at all and didn&#x27;t cause any pimple of anything. It&#x27;s a great price as well!</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft with a feeling of protection. Thicker than most hand creams, but does not get sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE CREAM. An excellent moisturizer that smells great and does not leave a residue. Great for winter dry hands. It leaves your hands feeling very soft and helps heal cracks and redness very quickly.</li>
            <li> Picked this up at target. Always loved this company, especially the baby products. I have the rosemary hair oil so I decided to give this a try. It is simply wonderful. Light smell, Thick moisture, that melts into your skin like an oil. I dont know how they did it, but it is magic to my feet and hands. I just hope, like many other companies, they dont change the ingredients. For now, I will dwell in my bliss.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is rich and wonderful for a daily hand lotion or trouble spot fixer.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I used to use La Mer as part of my regular morning routine and although pleased with that product, it&#x27;s very expensive. This was recommended by a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on it. It&#x27;s a fraction of the price and I&#x27;m just as pleased with the results. I have dry skin and it takes a lot to keep it moisturized. This works. It&#x27;s a thick cream, so may be too much for most faces, but I&#x27;d recommend this for whole body application as well. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Provides great hydration to my skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cream and my father-in-law fell in love with it.  He has psoriasis, and it has really alleviated them dryness and itchiness on his arms.  It is non-greasy too and non-fragrant, which is great on sensitive skin.  I could even use this on my face.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry from being a hairdresser. Even though I use gloves, I still get dry hands. Skin Food is my go to when my hands and cuticles are super dry. It is loaded with great ingredients too. Has a nice  citrusy light scent from essential oils that dissipates quickly. I keep one at the shop and one in my purse. It makes a great gift too!</li>
            <li> Nice quality product.  It can also be bought in health food stores.</li>
            <li> Greats!! Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife while looking for some &amp;#34;stocking stuffers&amp;#34; at Christmas time.  I had never heard of it before, nor had she ever used it, but bought it from other reviews looking good.  She loves it and gives it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when I found a sample size on sale at Target, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did. I&#x27;ve had horribly dry, rough elbows that nothing ever seemed to help, and with just a few uses, they are completely repaired. It&#x27;s a little greasy, but for dry skin, this is a good thing!   I have since tried the Weleda Wild Rose night cream, and after just a couple of days I can say... I will never waste money on other brands again. This is the best I have found, ever.</li>
            <li> This is very pricey for such a small amount and is VERY thick and greasy. Does not absorb into the skin very well and the fragrance is overwhelming. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The lady at our health food store recommended this cream for my really dry and chapped hands. She said that it worked wonders on her feet too.  Well, this is a miracle cream.  It totally cleared up the deep (and sore) cracks on my heels and smoothed the chapped &amp; dry skin on my hands &amp; feet.  I use it every night on my feet.  It&#x27;s thicker, but not greasy, and has a nice fragrance. It&#x27;s not perfumy, just a natural clean smell.  I have tried several creams but this one blows all of them away.  It just works magic on dry skin.  I was paying quite a bit for this in the health food store, so I&#x27;m very happy to have found it on Amazon at a lower price!</li>
            <li> My hands are constantly dry.  This is one of the only lotions that help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little oily but not too bad.  I did leave this in my car once and the oil separated from the  other stuff so after that it wasn&#x27;t much use to me because I couldn&#x27;t get the lotion to remix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found this at Marshall&#x27;s for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I began using Weleda products in 1992 when my son was born. After visiting an Anthroposophic doctor who recommended this brand., I slowly went from diaper cream and baby soap to many of their other products. Now that my babies are all grown, I am seeing another challenge - my own face which is aging with the passing of time. When I saw that they have Skin Food - it sounded like just what my face needed - to soak in some of the goodness for healing and a radiant shine that I have missed. I have been on skin food for almost 3 weeks and have gotten compliments that I look &amp;#34;so good&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;so rested&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34;... so it is working. Thank you again Weleda... you have taken great care of my family&#x27;s skin from top to bottom over the years! (Note: some people say it is a bit heavy and filmy, that is why I recommend using it as a night cream).</li>
            <li> Great multipurpose lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion is luxuriously thick and nourishing. It is a bit greasy so I use it before bedtime so I can wake up with soft hands. Skin food is the perfect name for it because my skin just eats it up. This will definitely be a repeat purchase for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream, it is very soothing for dry hands.</li>
            <li> One in the car, one at work, one at home, and one in my backpack.  That&#x27;s how much I love it.  I give it away as gifts.  Thank you for making such a great product.  Greasy for a second (which I actually like) and then it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only downside: if it gets VERY VERY hot, like all day in the dash of a car during summertime, the oils can separate and you may get a lap full of liquid if you&#x27;re not careful.  That&#x27;s common with most natural creams that don&#x27;t have chemical binders.</li>
            <li> This has been my staple winter weather face cream for a few years now. It&#x27;s rich and thick but you don&#x27;t need much, and it really does do the job. Also good for dry hands. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product, mentioned it to a few friends with dry heels, they purchased and have seen a positive difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, have used it daily for years as my moisturizer as well as an impromptu hand-creme. Lovely clean scent, not quite floral, is absorbed almost immediately.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but great right after the shower for tough skin areas such as elbows and knees.  I even like to wrap a little saran wrap around the areas to lock in extra moisture.  With this product, a little goes a long way.  Be patient, you will see results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item when it was grouped with another free trial item and listed for $15. I received it without the free item, no receipt,  and now (not even a week later) it&#x27;s up for $11...</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience at all. I had a horrible reaction using this cream. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.  The fragrance was little off putting, and the lotion a bit sticky.  Was highly touted, but not for me</li>
            <li> This smells great, but I would only use this super sparingly on something like an excema patch. I tested this on my knuckles and it reminds me of the consistency of Desitin- the baby diaper rash ointment. It&#x27;s way to thick and doesn&#x27;t rub in. I ended up washing my hands, yuck.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s free of parabens. However I don&#x27;t see any improvements in my hands after 3 weeks of multiple daily applications.</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews about Weleda Skin Food, I thought I would give it a try. I like that it is full of natural and even some organically derived ingredients. But I somehow overlooked that it has lanolin in it! I have a very sensitive nose, and can smell that slight \\&quot;sheepie\\&quot; smell when I put it on! I think I will just use it as a nighttime foot lotion so that I don&#x27;t have it all over my hands and have to smell it all day! The overall scent is nice and herbaceous, so if not for the lanolin, this would get five stars! It does seem to be very hydrating, but a tad bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin issues</li>
            <li> This skin food works really well if you put it around your eyes at night and on your lips and hands.  It&#x27;s a great product and came quickly and you only need the size of a pea to do your whole face!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My wife gave it a five star recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s the only cream I&#x27;ve found that stops my skin from itching like crazy.  Since it is very moisturizing, it helps plumps the skin and smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after being recommended by my sister. I use the day cream which I love, this product is also very good. The value is great! The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is it is a little greasy. The great thing is the morning after your skin feels great, not greasy! I have combination oily skin also! Great for all over the body!</li>
            <li> My hands, especially in the winter time, get really dry - to the point that I get cracks on the sides of my index fingers. Because of my job, I wash my hands constantly. This cream is heavy and greasy. After it soaks in (a min or so), my hands stay moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It does seem a bit greasy when it goes on, but it just sinks right into my combo dry skin and I don&#x27;t have to reapply accept for after the daily shower. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I get eczema on my hands time to time. And this cream is my saver. I use it just like a very nourishing hand cream or as a overnight treatment under cotton gloves. My hands are very soft and smooth the morning after. And Weleda is my favorite brand - everything is natural and the packaging is very mindful.</li>
            <li> I was trying to grow my nails but they kept splitting and peeling. I started rubbing a little skin food on my nails before bed every night and now my nails are nicer than they have ever been. This stuff is not like any hand cream I have ever used before. It is really thick, it reminds me of acrylic artist paint. But it absorbs pretty fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy. The smell is a little interesting, not bad, but more vegetative or medicinal than perfume-y. you only need a tiny bit so a tube, while pricey does last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love, really in love. It works wonders on my eczema and works for the face as well!</li>
            <li> my favorite hand cream. Thick and takes a bit to sink in, but moisturizes really well. I even like the smell, it&#x27;s not too girly so my guy coworkers don&#x27;t seem to mind using it</li>
            <li> Skin Food is an essential part of my healthy skin tool kit. It is very effective on dry hands after doing the dishes, while flying, or just during the winter. Smells to me like lime and cashews, but it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> Although I saw the ingredient list before purchasing this, I assumed or hoped that the quantities of fragrant plant extracts would be small and barely noticeable. Wrong. This product has an overwhelming and aggressive fragrance like Lemon Pine Sol. What&#x27;s most disturbing is that ingredient items like Limonene, Linalool, and Geraniol are known skin irritants (Go on, google them.) Not to mention the item only listed as &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; (supposedly from essential oils). Who knows what&#x27;s in there? I wouldn&#x27;t be so uptight about it if the cream had a very light smell (indicating small quantities), but when it smells this strong, you know the levels of these ingredients are very high. I applied a dab to the top of my hands, and immediately got a subtle burning sensation. Just because it came from a plant doesn&#x27;t make it good for you. Maybe throw in a little poison ivy next time? Shame on Weleda.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time . Great product at a great price !</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for hands and feet.  It is a little oily but that helps it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Great Smell&lt;br /&gt;Really moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Oily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled on this but it&#x27;s awesome! It has a unique putty like texture that is very light not to be deceiving. It has a smell that reminds me of virgin margaritas or lemon lime. After a few minutes it&#x27;s sunk deeply into my skin and the after effects are amazing. My skin looks a few years younger and while it doesn&#x27;t last after a few days it&#x27;s great anyway! It&#x27;s extremely helpful to me as a frequent hand-washer due to my career. Weleda is a very natural and paraben free company so I feel better over using this fresh smelling product. I have bought several tubes so far and will continue happily shelling out the cost in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells nice,  works well.  I get big cracks in my hands in the winter time and this seems to be holding them off.</li>
            <li> You have to use very little do the product. It is not greasy and it soaks into skin after a few minutes. I highly recommend this skin cream. I am more satisfied with it than with the expensive face creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Too oily even for dry skin. I have used it on my face once and it&#x27;s really a big mistake. Maybe only adaptable to other body parts.</li>
            <li> I love the cream.  The packaging needs work.  The cap won&#x27;t stay screwed on and the tube cracked and leaks.</li>
            <li> this lotion is amazing. smells herbal, not too strong. works so well. my skin just loves to soak it up. slightly greasy but in a good way :)</li>
            <li> This is great for dry and rough hands, it will really soften them up. It does go on fairly greasy feeling at first, but then it melts into your skin and it feels great. tip for best application is to squirt it onto your finger then dab it around on your hand, then when you rub it in it will be pretty evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the smell too.</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer out there.  I look forward to putting it on my face every night.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist, who also does facial treatments, including Botox, etc.  She had beautiful skin and I had to try it.  I have been very pleased with what it has done for my 54 year old skin!</li>
            <li> Found this product by chance while reading online reviews and have been reordering ever since. The entire family loves it because it&#x27;s super moisturizing yet never greasy.  Wasn&#x27;t really impressed by the scent at first, but the nourishment it provides is hard to match.</li>
            <li> Wonderful face cream. You only need a small amount and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for very cracked fingertips and dry feet. I first used it on my hands and fingers. It did moisturize my hands but did nothing for my cracked fingertips. It made them feel drier for some reason. Then I put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels. Within 2 minutes intense itching. It became so bad I had to wash my feet and soak them in the sink. Once I removed the cream the itching stopped. I will be returning it tomorrow. I don&#x27;t know what caused such severe itching on the toes. Perhaps the lanolin which is animal fat. I just don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Very rich. I normally use it before going to bed. It feels amazing on your skin and the results are amazing. Love it.</li>
            <li> A great healing skin cream.  My sister introduced me to this product seven months ago and it works wonders.  I&#x27;ve used it for my cuticles, small scrapes and cuts and even on my psoriasis, all with great success.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this hand lotion but the smell doesn&#x27;t allow me to. I like that it hydrates your hands very nicely but the smell ain&#x27;t doing it for me. I usually look for nice smell and hydrating hand lotions. But I gotta say that it does make your hands soft.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy for my liking.  It smells good but leaves my skin greasy for hours yet dries out my fingertips.  How is that even possible??  I am definitely not a fan of greasy lotion PLUS Skin Food doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as my go-to lotion- Gold Bond&#x27;s Ultimate Healing with Aloe.  This is a super enriching lotion that is not greasy at all and really makes a difference for super dry skin. Gold Bond&#x27;s makes a couple different formulas but this by far is my favorite.  You can even use it in your face and lips and will notice a difference in the dryness of your skin within the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this lotion as so many others do but it is not effective and leaves me feeling like an oil tanker so I just can&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply to my face during the super cold and dry winter but haven&#x27;t been that impressed.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this product as many folk have testified before me, because of the enthusiastic and gushing commentary from blogs and magazines.  Do I like it?  I&#x27;m not sure.  I couldn&#x27;t care less about the fact the product contains lanolin.  I&#x27;m a product of the 70&#x27;s and I distinctly remember my mom using some sort of lanolin product, so I&#x27;m not creeped out about that whole sheep by-product thing.  That and mom used to keep Vitamin E oil in the fridge next to the Carob, so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 2.5 oz tube and squeezed out what I thought was a small portion for my hands.  Oh, the grease!  I felt as if I was hit by the Exxon Valdez!  The product sat on my hands, and sat, and sat.  Oooh.  I didn&#x27;t like this not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; absorption.  Then, after a glass of wine, decided that I should try, as the packaging recommends in three languages, into my skin.  Well, I must admit, it was akin to encouraging a slow moving drain to well, drain.  The product did absorb into my skin, albeit reluctantly.  I think if I used a smaller amount of product, less than a pea-sized droplet, I would have been happier.  That being said, some 60 minutes after application, the product has absorbed into my skin and my hands are very smooth and happy.  And shiny.  I have shiny happy hands.  Erhm.  Then again, I&#x27;m a fan of REM, so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know (think) that I would try this product on my face as it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as easily (quickly) as I would like.  After applying a product I like my skin to say, &amp;#34;Oh, thank you for the drink, kind lady&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m telling you, and I have dry skin in winter, live in Alaska, if I used this product on my face, I&#x27;m-a thinking my face would unfriend me on Facebook.  Just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this product on my hands, elbows, feet, etc--any body part that is really dry that needs a little more TLC.  Oh, and my cuticles and nails.  This worked wonders on my cuticles and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful!  Little citrus-y and very much of Calendula, part of the Marigold family.  It&#x27;s an acquired like, so if you&#x27;re not familiar with Calendula, you might want to skip.  That being said, Calendula is known for it&#x27;s soothing properties--especially for  folk who have tender skin.  I did read the reviews of folk who used and said this product inflamed their skin.  It didn&#x27;t inflame mine, but then again, I have Rosacea and didn&#x27;t use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did come with a sample of Wild Rose Pampering Body Lotion.  I read a review (and will leave one shortly) regarding this product, and must agree with the reviewer who said the scent wasn&#x27;t natural--it&#x27;s nice, but not true rose essence.  It&#x27;s wanna-be faux rose essence.  It&#x27;s not bad, just not pow!  If that makes sense.  I have a rose refreshing spray from Jurlique that is true rose essence--just the flower, no more.  This one has a ... I don&#x27;t know.  As I sniff my skin, it&#x27;s developed a more beautiful tone and is more robust.  Oh, and the lotion?  My body drank it in as it it were Peter O&#x27;Toole from Lawrence of Arabia.  This is exactly what I want in a lotion.  As I said, will leave a separate review, veddy, veddy, nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.  Would I order again.  Not sure.</li>
            <li> As advertised was very effective for my dry and rough skin.  Lovely fragrance and smooth texture.  Great for that dry winter skin of New England and similar environments.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I can use on my skin that doesn&#x27;t burn. I would recommend this to anyone who has extremely sensitive skin. The cream is very oily at first but the moisture sinks in and you don&#x27;t even notice it after a little while. I have purchased at least a dozen tubes and will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Alright, so I saw this product all over &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; lists across the net so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Best cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I had read to try it on your face after exfoliating and so that is what I did the first use. I woke up the next morning and my skin was the softest it has ever been and for the first time aside from photoshop, my skin looked &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; and it stayed that way throughout the day and well into the night. I am completely sold, if you&#x27;re on the fence don&#x27;t hesitate! I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived without it this long!</li>
            <li> I love Weleda products.  This truly is &#x27;skin food&#x27;.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it.  Not greasy.  Easily absorbed and lasting results.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this cream. A bit greasy when first applied but seems to dry or be absorbed quickly. The smell of the cream is definitely apparent but not overpowering. I apply it at bedtime and slip my hands into Malcolm&#x27;s Jamzz Moisturing Gloves. Love the results: softer hands in the morning. Just ordered a second tube.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of the product that had been sitting for some time.  I was afraid to try it on my acne-prone skin.  But after seeing my flaky skin that was magnified by the foundation I had put on, I had to try it.  All I can say is, why did I wait so long to try it.  It hasn&#x27;t broken me out, and the red marks left from previous breakouts had faded after just two days of use.  I feel like this may be a little too heavy this summer for my skin, but for winter use, this has been unmatched by so many other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Weleda line for over 7 years and plan to continue. Great product, has always worked well and I never feel as if they are skimping on the great ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricy. But it is all worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Will be back for it !</li>
            <li> I have only recently been introduced to this product.  So far it works like a charm.  Thanks a Bunch  Slainte!</li>
            <li> Great product. Really protects the skin. Use it daily.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every other night and my skin has never looked better. It feels really heavy when you initially put it on but absorbs nicely and you will wake up with baby soft nourished skin. No breakouts either. I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day due to the thickness but it has definitely earned a permanent spot in my nighttime skin care!</li>
            <li> I love buying this product as it moisturizers well. I am a health care clinician and I have to wash my hands a lot at work which makes my hands dry. This has worked to counter all that dryness. It is greasy but I don&#x27;t mind as it moisturizes that well.</li>
            <li> This cream is magnificent.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it on my face its helped with the texture of my skin and has evened out the tone to the point where I don&#x27;t feel the need for foundation! I see this cream as a lifetime product for me. Its also a better than average hand cream. Try it! You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Did like the way the product worked</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a cream that is rich and natural enough for my thirsty skin. I swear by this stuffâ€¦even have on regular delivery now.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Works very good on my skin! Buy this product you wont be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> It has a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Fixed my super dry skin!</li>
            <li> Love how soft it makes me skin feel after using it.</li>
            <li> A friend put me onto this product. Working with stone dries my hands badly and this material, a bit in the AM and more at bedtime, does the trick. Also works to smooth my bald head.</li>
            <li> This product is just o.k. It is way to greasy for my skin. Takes way to long to sink into my skin.</li>
            <li> On the box it claims \\&quot;\\&quot;QUALITY, CERTIFIED NATURAL SKIN CARE, FREE OF FRAGRANCES\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients has FRAGRANCE (PERFUME), so which one should be trusted. Never knew Skin Food should contain FRAGRANCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (INCI)Water (Aqua), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Lanolin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Alcohol, Beeswax (Cera Flava), Glyceryl Linoleate, Hydrolyzed Beeswax, Fragrance (Parfum)*, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Limonene*, Linalool*, Geraniol*, Citral*, Coumarin*.</li>
            <li> I like that the lotion is not greasy. It seems to absorb into the skin well and it makes my skin feel firmer.</li>
            <li> When nothing else will work, when everything else feels thin  and is absorbed way too quickly, this does the trick. Great for rough hands and  cracked feet. Too heavy for delicate skin,  like the face or neck.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on skin. The tube is metal and looks small but contains a substantial amount of product. The smell of the cream is strong but not too over powering. It makes skin look and FEEL good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product especially for dry hand skin.  Just put a dab on each hand and rub it in.  Moisturizes the skin very effectively and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR my favorite hand cream! Nothing makes my hands silkier or feel nicer. My husband had a bicycle accident and scraped up his hand pretty bad. When it started to heal I put some skin food on it and I really think it helped it heal faster! Totally worth the money, a little goes a long way! Nice earthy, natural scent.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product more stars. I have very sensitive combination skin. Trying new products is often intimidating for me since so often, they lead to breakouts that take a week or more to clear up. I have had success with Weleda products in the past but Skin Food is number one. I use it on my face as well as my body. It never caused me any irritation.</li>
            <li> Finally a natural deeply moisturizing product that actually does what it says it will do! I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on fancy products touting grandiose results. As I age my skin ages with me and I need a moisturizer- esp. for my face, that replenishes and restores. Skin food may not be packaged beautifully and perhaps it&#x27;s thick consistency seems it would be too much for one&#x27;s face, but for me this product sinks in and leaves me with an even tone and soft skin. It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;discovered&amp;#34; this stuff at Whole Foods two years ago, and purchased it for a whopping $17 there--which is $5 more than at Amazon.  Nevertheless, it was a deal then bc I got to try it, and found out how much I love it.  It is very thick and rich.  Now, some ppl may not like the thick consistency, if they are used to thinner moisturizers, it is a LOT thicker. I guess I&#x27;ll use Aveeno as a benchmark (most of the people I know have used it), and this is twice as thick maybe?  I guess it would be somewhere between Aveeno moisturizer and clay mask in terms of thickness.  All the same, it does moisturize really well, naturally.  No dimethacone in here (this is a chemical ingredient in Aveeno 24 hour moisture), just good quality natural ingredients.  I usually squeeze a little onto my hands before bed, and the next morning my hands are clean, soft, and good all day long.  The scent is very clean and natural, but not overpowering--it reminds me ever so faintly of citrus.  Ingredients are as follows: Water, Sunflower Seed Oil, Lanolin, Sweet Almond Oil, Alcohol, Beeswax, Glyceryl Linoleate, Hydrolyzed Beeswax, Fragrance, Pansy Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Calendula Flower Extract, Cholestrol, Limonen, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral, Coumarin.  Now the cost is prohibitive perhaps, but you don&#x27;t have to continually reapply.  In the end, it is expensive and comes in a tiny bottle, but then the packaging is aluminum (I think), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to go bad quickly like you&#x27;d expect for a natural moisturizer--I guess bc of the packaging?  It doesn&#x27;t come off after washing your hands (okay, well it doesn&#x27;t for me, but I take care not to wash right after applying it) though.  It will, however, make your hands feel &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; for over 15 mins after you apply it--like most moisturizers.  I just like to keep it simple and apply before bed.  It works best for me.  In the end, I like it, but I realize it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and has more competitive pricing than in stores. This is the most luxurious and thick hand cream, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for keeping (or getting) the bottoms of your feet (soles) soft and supple. You can really tell the difference after just a few applications. Use it before you go to bed. It is thick and lasts a long time. I even used some on my face a few times when I had some peeling after using retinoids. I will buy this again for sure and Amazon seems to have the best price.</li>
            <li> this cream is like milk going on to your body. it is so light and nourishing to my skin. you should buy it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer especially during winter.  It is very thick and creamy. Even gave it to my coworker who has really bad eczema and he even said it worked so well for him.</li>
            <li> A little oily, but otherwise a great great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using this cream steadily for 1 year.  My sister bought it for me because &amp;#34;it smells like a gin and tonic!&amp;#34;  She was so right!  Some will find the scent objectionable because scents are very subjective. This cream does have a pronounced scent, but I love it.  To me, it smells like zingy limes.  Yum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and could easily be called a paste.  I use about a 1 - 1.5&amp;#34; strip every morning on my feet.  I squirt the strip onto my hand right after I get out of the shower, rub my hands together and then apply 1 hand to each foot.  I haven&#x27;t had cracked or dry heels or feet since I started using this cream. It is greasy, it does take a minute to soak in, but it&#x27;s also incredibly moisturizing and in my experience, these things go hand in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream.  Individuals should understand what they&#x27;re getting - This is a fairly strong smelling citrus/lime scented paste-like cream that is moderately greasy and takes a minute to soak in that, in my experience, will heal and then prevent dry, cracked and calloused skin. It works and it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> After trying so many different hand lotions this is the only one that worked and stopped my hands from cracking.  And best of all its a natural product!  I work with tools and work outside often and it&#x27;s not greasy, after a couple of minutes it is absorbed into your skin and even smells good.</li>
            <li> My mom (a makeup artist) recommended that I use Weleda Skin Food on my face.  I have never had so many complements in the last few months.  Last week, my friend described my skin as &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34;.  It does make it oily in the summer but I blot when I forget and put a little too much on.  It&#x27;s been great during the cold weather though.</li>
            <li> Very thick and soothing - requires only a small amount but some might find it greasy. I like it but the cost to me is prohibitive. I would rather spend that amount or less and get a huge bottle of Gold Bond.</li>
            <li> This product has a distinctive but pleasant scent, my husband even likes it and has been using it more than me lately.  It is a heavier cream but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and really helps fix those problem dry patches.</li>
            <li> I use this on my throat area and it is amazing. I have never had a product show such dramatic and immediate results. I think it is too thick to use regularly on my face, but sometimes I just slather it on and in the morning the difference is remarkable. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> my skin feel fresh, moisturized, and soft, at the beginning is a little bit greasy, but after the skin absorb the cream feels really good..</li>
            <li> Love this! Helps with dry skin and even helped take the sting out of a really bad sunburn. Best product out there. Plus I swear the Mosquitos leave me alone when I wear it. It has a citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this holy grail product for a few years now.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Great for dry elbows.</li>
            <li> i bought this to apply to my skin after doing a scrub and it&#x27;s useless. If your skin is wet when you apply it, you know to hold the moisture in, it just slips over the top if you skin and won&#x27;t spread or stay in place at all. I guess it might be ok to use on dry skin but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for :/</li>
            <li> Seems greasy when you first put it on, but soaks in very quickly.  My hands got smooth very quickly and have stayed that way.</li>
            <li> When you first put this on, you think it is going to be too think and never soak in. But wrong. It is skin food and you skins drinks it up in about 10 seconds. Not greasy. You can trust Weleda to make products from the very best ingredients. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, but was slightly dented.  There is some oil separation so each time I need to use there is greasy factor, however it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t use lotion very often. But when I need it, I want something that works. My hands will occasionally get kind of dry, and I get dry skin on my elbows. I&#x27;m the kind of guy that likes a good, intensive treatment for those situations. That&#x27;s what this stuff delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not so much lotion as a treatment. It is a bit greasy/oily for a few minutes, at least in the generous amounts that I apply. I put it on while watching a movie or something like that. I absolutely love the fragrance -- it&#x27;s similar to the Baby line that is based on calendula, which is what turned me on to Weleda in the first place. It seems very natural and I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cheap, but it LASTS. Definitely give this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li> I recently moved back to the east coast from the desert, and was reminded how damaging winter could be to your skin.  I started developing dry, flaky patches on my arms, and my normal moisturizing routine of pure organic coconut oil wasn&#x27;t doing anything to help.  I turned to Skin Food in desperation.  This thick cream healed the dry patches in a week, which I&#x27;m thrilled with.  The scent of this product brought it down a star for me, though.  At first the scent is fresh and light, but then undertones of patchouli emerge.  Even the faintest whiff of patchouli makes me scrunch my nose, hence the lost star.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use. I&#x27;m not into stuff that leaves a waxy film, or merely sits on the surface of the skin to be sweated or wiped away in minutes. Weleda skin food actually gets absorbed into my skin and increases the moisture retention. I can&#x27;t use stuff with artifical ingredients, or perfumes because my skin is super sensitive. Weleda skin food is it if you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that works and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long. Based on the other reviews, I was hoping for better. Okay, but will not purchase again. My hands were dry again within minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this on everything! Super thick and moisturizing - one tube lasts forever</li>
            <li> Ever since a friend told me about Skin Food, I&#x27;ve been using it and nothing else compares! It is totally pure, has a light lemony scent which I love, and nourishes my skin like nothing else. It can even be used on the face, it even works wonders on chapped lips!  I have good skin but it tends to get a bit dry especially in winter. You need to know that it is thick but don&#x27;t let that scare you - it&#x27;s a good thing.  Adjust how much you use - a little goes a very long way. Totally unexpected surprise: The package I received had a bonus pair of cotton gloves for overnight moisturizing! I plan to give them a try tonight:) I keep a tube of this in my purse, one on my desk, and another in my bathroom. I don&#x27;t  know what I would do without this product!</li>
            <li> This works amazing on my feet!  It is the best thing for my feet, in fact, because it is better absorbed than other creams, and, if used overnight, will keep the skin smooth and protected from cracking or simply drying out. Great product! Good SKIN CUISINE :)</li>
            <li> Very rich and moisturizing cream.  Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this very emollient cream, mostly on my hands, for many years.  When it comes to really dry skin, I have found nothing that helps like this Skin Food does (it&#x27;s not your mother&#x27;s Jergens Lotion).  Whether it&#x27;s dry heat in the winter or forgetting to use my gardening gloves in the summer, this is THE product that actually does relieve and heal my skin.  I&#x27;ve even given it as gifts on occasion and those lucky folks love it and now are true converts!  Really, if you can afford the price, try this.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  the fragrance is very mild and dissipates soon after use.</li>
            <li> Pretty greasy but does moisturize.  I got this primarily for my hands, elbows and feet.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this facial moisturizer and I was so blown away at the quality of my skin, I had to buy. The color of my skin changed it became more vibrant and glowing, the tone seems to be golden. It is very strong so a little goes a very long way, plus there natural oils so it can tend to be oily, so what I did is mix a little water with the amount I&#x27;d like to apply to help with absorption and water the powerful formula down to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best skin product for my face. It rehydrates my skin in the winter and gives it a nice soft glow again.</li>
            <li> Really good moisturizer.  It is very thick.  I actually add some almond oil to it to loosen it and then use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil is supposed to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> My fave moisturizer for normal to dry skin! I am a makeup artist and use it Personally and for clients.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream. It goes on very thick but once your skin absorbs it, does not feel greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 6 years now and have NEVER broken out. It is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it for me. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use on my face.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t big on the consistency but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Great smelling and very creamy. This is the best for dry skin in the winter! I put it on my hands and face. Leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I read about this cream somewhere and decided to try it. I have bought a million creams (expensive and not so expensive) in my lifetime and there are very few that I think truly work. Anyway, here is the funny thing about this cream - I love the smell and it is super thick and I always use it for my elbows and one night I put too much on my elbows and I was rubbing my hands together and decided to just wipe some on my face and when I woke up -- my face looked brighter. I thought that&#x27;s odd, I wonder what caused that, so now I do it every night and as a woman who is older and is really skeptical about face creams, I couldn&#x27;t believe this cream which is made for rough skin could do this to my face. Now, I don&#x27;t think the cream works that well on my elbows, but I will continue to buy it and use it on my face! People have started asking me what am I doing to my face, am I wearing new makeup because I look brighter and refreshed (music to my ears). I just say \\&quot;no, nothing new\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews about it working for people with eczema, and purchased it for my son. Once i began using this product his eczema disappeared and has yet to come back. It was such a huge relief. He would get the outbreaks on his arm and would be itching non stop thank god for this relief.</li>
            <li> Delivery time took way too long and when it was received the box was badly damaged.&lt;br /&gt;It seems they just made tracking number but did not ship out until few days later....&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them what is going on but did not resolve anything.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is way too oily and I can&#x27;t really use it before going out as it will make my&lt;br /&gt;face too shiny and oily.  I won&#x27;t recommend this product to people I know.</li>
            <li> The best creme for dry skin and winter time. It smoothens the skin, smells great. Just the right creme for every skin</li>
            <li> Great product at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> love this cream, it is amazing for the hands and body, moisturizes so nicely, love the smell, the feeling it leaves on the skin. I also use it on my face when it&#x27;s cold and windy and it&#x27;s a great help.&lt;br /&gt;Also great if you have bad dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this cream but it has a slightly greasy feel and is just not as moisturizing as I had hoped. It also has a medicinal smell but dissipates rather quickly. I&#x27;ll finish it but I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy, but it has cured my skin problem that was bothering me for years. I have normal to dry skin, I had been tried body lotion of different brands, but there were a few spots on my legs were very stubborn, the skin was still rough, itchy from time to time and discolored until I use this cream.</li>
            <li> This is a superb cream for extremely dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A nice hand cream for the dry hands, my hairdresser loves  this, I gave her some for a present.  This is great for the dry cold winters, and anytime.  Helps the hands so much!!</li>
            <li> Okay, I wish they would make this bigger and specifically for the body all over. This is suppose to be used in certain rough or dry chapped areas. But I love it so much I literally spread it all over. The smell is light.</li>
            <li> Very excellent, soothing hand cream. A very little goes a long way. Smells good too. Put it on your feet and wear white cotton socks over night. Quick healing.</li>
            <li> My hand and nails LOVE this cream. I use it primarily as a hand and cuticle cream because it is so thick and lux. Its also a great healer for sun burns or other damage to the skin. I&#x27;ve used it on all my tattoos as well. Keeps my nails very healthy and lets them get to a nice length. I always cary a tube in my purse.</li>
            <li> The skin around my nails is constantly dry and cracked. A few days use of this and my hands and nails are smooth and beautiful. I thought it would be greasy at first, but it dries pretty quickly and makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells fine, creme is thick and rich. Great for feet but leaves hands feeling dry afterwards. Can&#x27;t imagine using it as a general body creme.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet ! May be I need to use some more to see if it&#x27;s good for my skin or not .Until now , nothing extraordinary !</li>
            <li> The scent is a mixture of lemongrass/Citrus that is packs a punch in a bad way. I purchased it for the purpose of healing my dry hands but it&#x27;s SO greasy, it&#x27;s SO smelly, and it doesn&#x27;t even work. Your hands stay greasy for a very long time, if not for all time. Like a previous reviewer mentioned the scent is so strong, like pine sol or some other cleaning agent. I brought it work and was so embarrassed by the smell I had to wash it off, I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting to smell like this product. At the end of the day, it was ineffective and then some. I now use it in EXCESS on my feet with socks on and even then it&#x27;s terrible but I just don&#x27;t want to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is rich and helps dry skin. And now you require more words to evaluate something I bought from you.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this because I had read an article that Victoria Beckham uses it. And well, she looks pretty good so I figured I would give it a try. While I do like it, a lotâ€¦ it has a few drawbacks. 1. It is is a metal tube which I do not like. I think it is a harder to get all of the product out when the tube is metal because it has no bounce back.  2. It can be greasy if you put too much of it on. Other wise, I am really enjoying this. My skin is sensitive and it hasnâ€™t caused any problems. I donâ€™t put it on my face because I am worried it will clog my pores but I really enjoy using it everywhere else. My feet love it and so do my nail beds. Itâ€™s also great after shaving. I will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Weleda Skin Food works wonders on my extra dry hands! I have used this product for a few years now and it is the only thing that works well for me.  I am in medical profession so wash my hands constantly and as a result they are very dry.  And winter weather just adds to the problem. I only need to use it a few times a week (before bed) and it keeps my hands from cracking and being like sand paper.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this tube of green lotion labeled &amp;#34;skin food&amp;#34; in search of a cure for my extremely dry, cracked winter skin. After one use my hands felt smooth and replenished, and when i tested it on my face at night I experienced no breakouts or oiliness the next morning, only plush smooth skin. A miracle product for winter, it also works well in the warmer months for a kind of deep-hand-conditioner. It smells very nice, fresh and almost lemony but not like a household cleaning product. I would recommend it to anyone with in need of a slightly heavier hand or face or even body moisturizer, as well as anyone with psoriasis or eczema (I have mild eczema and my father who also uses this product daily has psoriasis).</li>
            <li> This lotion is super thick and requires you apply very little. I was surprised at how small the tube of lotion is, but since it requires you to use such a small amount it has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin is 50+ and I&#x27;ve noticed some significant changes in my face and neckline over the past 2 years, namely sagging jowl-line, chin lines, more eye wrinkles and sagging eyelids. I&#x27;ve been using a combination of organic and biodynamic-based skin care products (Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food and Acure), as well as a potent anti-aging serum from Visual Changes (Resurrection) and a bi-weekly routine with Nu-Face Trinity. Skin Food is an excellent skin nourisher that smells wonderful and soaks nicely into my skin for a day-long, dewy complexion. Any residual gets rubbed into my hands and simultaneously gets absorbed by my nails, which has had a strengthening effect on them as well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this. A bit expensive but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish this came in a larger size and less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is thicker than cream but thinner texture than gel. However, it seems to evaporate as soon as I put it on. So it didn&#x27;t seem a good protectant for my skin. I suppose it could have been quickly absorbed into the skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t feel like it to me. Usually when I use a moisturizer on my hands, I can tell there&#x27;s a film on my hand to protect the outer layer. This disappeared and didn&#x27;t seem to help with my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every night before bed. It is thick enough to last the night without feeling like you have too much product on your skin. It&#x27;s perfect. I have ordered it three times already and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Smooth, slightly greasy texture but necessary to nourish the skin. Gets absorbed relatively quickly. In the morning, skin feels not greasy but well-fed. Will purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich. A little greasy at first but it eventually soaks in. I use it at night, even on my face. Really helped with the dry areas that nothing else would touch.</li>
            <li> good cream for hands and body for the winter time.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on a fresh scar, it&#x27;s helped the area fade nicely.  A little to thick to use during the morning, but perfect for a night cream</li>
            <li> Very thick and had an odor. Definitely not nourishment for the skin...I threw it away after trying it twice. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> For starters I have sensitive and extremely dry skin.  I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this cream for people with oily skin. I have been using Skin Food for thirty-five years every day without fail. I first began using it when I lived in France as it was quite popular there at the time. For a long time I was only able to find it in health food stores.&lt;br /&gt;I see one recent reviewer hates the smell but I have never found it cloying or medicinal. The cream is thick, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily moisturizer and one tube lasts me for months. It does have a shine when you apply it at first but within an hour or so, it does absorb into the skin. As my skin is now 50ish, it makes it look dewy but I apply mineral powder to tone the shine if I go out. I am totally convinced that this cream is the reason I get numerous compliments on my skin and lack of wrinkles. When I was young I used LancÃ´me&#x27;s Hydrix, which was a lot like Skin Food, but sadly it was discontinued and then I began applying Skin Food in the morning as at that time I was using it as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny as I have never used it for anything but a facial moisturizer and I see that people have had a lot of success with using it for eczema. I like the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it and it leaves a rich feel to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have friends that pay a lot of money for Chanel and Clinique and other moisturizers but I don&#x27;t want a lot of chemicals on my face and they are amazed that this relatively inexpensive cream does such a great job on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product forever. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. This smells great and feels very pampering, I use it on both my face and my feet!</li>
            <li> We buy and use this all the time. Wonderful. I have my mother and sister in-law using it. Great for feet, elbows and hands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I have very dry hands, and in the winter they become quite raw. Since using Weleda Skin Food, I have not had this problem; it is the only cream that keeps my hands soft and moist. It is great on my feet too!</li>
            <li> Great, love it! Moisturizing but not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my poor dry skin needs in the winter.  It is my go-to for moisture in the cold dry winter months.  I love this stuff and it smells divine - like oranges in warm sunshine!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time...love the smell (clean) and the results...For dry skin I highly recommend...I use it mostly on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because apparently Julia Roberts just \\&quot;loves it.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve used better products.  While Weleda Skin Food may be all natural, it has a strange smell and leaves a greasy film on my skin.  I definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Thick cream. Excellent for extra-dry skin. Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I keep this at my desk and use it as a hand cream. Love it and may order more.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m barefoot most of the time living in Hawaii, this is the only lotion I use to keep my legs, especially my heels, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Was trying to find something to help for dry, cracked hands.  Skin Food did not help--it has a very nice scent but it&#x27;s very oily and hard to rub in.  Rather than softening my hands, I think it made them drier.</li>
            <li> absolutely my first choice for healing parched dry skin--excellent pure ingredients</li>
            <li> If you have dry, sensitive or older skin and are considering a lactic or glycolic peel in the fall or winter WELEDA SKIN FOOD is the perfect moisturizer. It is a thicker creamy treatment that provides excellent hydration and is a very good protective barrier from the elements. Also helped reduce redness and irritation on my skin and kept my skin healthy while recovering from my peel. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream is really amazing. I read about it in the daily mail and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;My hands have been full of moisture ,that actually is retained, ever since.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Another fantastic Weleda product, quality is guaranteed.  Just a dab on cuticles, dry face.....good for winter chapping.and summer protection.  I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Fab for face!!! Feel younger and look gorgeous everyday...fills in and creates youthful glow...can&#x27;t say enough...buy it now, today, omg</li>
            <li> Expensive, but very good for skin.  A bit oily at first, but it absorbs quickly.  I really like it and think it is a great quality.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine because some actress whose name escapes me was using it and highly recommended it.  I figured this would cost an arm and a leg but was surprised that it was rather affordable.  After receiving it, I have been using it as a hand cream and I love it.  It absorbs well, smells good and its kind of addicting.  I will be using this cream from now on on my hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product. I like the product anytime, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> I really like the way he works on my sons skin. It not greasy at all. It has a lemon smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> Sad but true: I ordered this product because I read in an article that Victoria Beckham uses it.  Now, I don&#x27;t really care what Victoria uses per se, but the gist of the article was that this was a low-priced lotion that even a wealthy and discerning customer would prefer over the more expensive brands.  Anyway, the product is moisturizing enough for what I wanted to use it for (a hand lotion that I could keep in my purse), but I hate the smell and it irritates my skin.  The scent is sort of herbal and medicinal, and I feel like it overpowered my perfume.  As for the irritation: my skin is very sensitive, and when I buy a new lotion or body wash, I usually expect that it will cause some sort of rash/reaction, so the irritation is more my personal problem than a shortcoming of the product itself.  And while this is of no importance whatsoever, I despise the font on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product very well.  I was kind of oily, greasy.  I also did not like the smell of it.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> The BEST lotion for severely dry skin. I put on at night before bed and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve used all sorts of dry skin lotions and this is far and away the best. My mom loved it so much on her last visit that she took it home! And she rarely tries/likes unfamiliar products. Really awesome. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Its very thick...just extremely thick and heavy so if you have other than extremely dry skin you will break out, for dry skin its very good and I do have dry skin so for that this product works well but just a little at a time</li>
            <li> Very thick oily paste squeezed from a tube. Smells plant based and slightly medicinal. Too rich to wear on my face even if I am on the drier side. Moisturizes only sub par even when considering the oily nature of this product. Will continue to use it on my body but probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great for rubbing into hands and feet at night before bed but do not recommend as a &amp;#34;pocket book&amp;#34; moisturizer because it is very thick and greasy. I would not want to put this on and then be touching my eyeglasses or cell phone screen or pretty much anything that I do not want smudges on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick. It really helps hydrate my hands after working in the dirt. The scent of calendula is mellow and soothing.  A must-have product for me.</li>
            <li> Worked as described. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is awesome on rough skin, like elbows and feet. And when I use it on my hands, it gets absorbed quickly without too much of that sticky feel left by other creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using Weleda Skin Food since 2011 and my skin loves it. Also makeup applies much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  It offers the level of moisturization that you would expect and it is lasting.  As other reviewers have noted, it is a bit greasy at first but I find that it absorbs quickly.  It has also been noted that the product has a noticeable scent and - it does.  I think it is a pleasant scent but I do always warn people before I reccommend or loan them skin food.  So far the reaction from my friends has universally been &amp;#34;yeah, it has a scent but it&#x27;s not a bad one...&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well but it stays a little greasy for my liking. Great for overnight use but not as good during the day when you are still working with your hands.</li>
            <li> very pleasant herbal smell. its pretty oily so i use it only when i go to bed at night. The cream leaves your skin moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> Great product. It can leave your face with a little bit of a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; but feels great on skin if you live in dry or cold climate. It might be a bit much for men in warmer months and depending how much your skin takes in.</li>
            <li> I received this today. I have normal to dry skin and used it as my moisturiser (on my face and under my eyes), I can safely say it&#x27;s been 10 hours and my face is still moisturised and dewy, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the first winter where the skin on my thumbs and index fingers have not split or bled.&lt;br /&gt;I handle paper and cardboard almost everyday and I have to say I am amazed!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will keep this on hand during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Best hand &amp; body cream i&#x27;ve found. Really highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, almost greasy.  My real complaint is the scent.  Weleda makes excellent creams and lotions, but their scents stink.</li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin shine like a young girl&#x27;s. I particularly love it on my feet and legs.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the tube is small and doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> Although this seems greasy at first, your skin just drinks it up and that feeling goes away. My whole family loves this for those dry, cracked winter hands.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent. My hands are smooth and no longer dry like they were before using this product. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My metro male loved this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse &amp; a gardener &amp; my hands are like sandpaper and most winters they crack - but every night I put this on &amp; read &amp; go to sleep &amp; my hands are rejuvenated! This is amazing stuff &amp; smells wonderful and the quality is terrific; I love Weleda products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to mention, many Weleda products use peanut oil ... so if you are like me &amp; have a peanut allergy look before you leap ... their face balm is amazing but they changed it over to peanut oil a couple years ago ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have a good day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every skin moisturizer ever made, almost -- natural and chemical, mixtures of the two, etc. -- and there is hands down absolutely NOTHING better than this product, which I accidentally won in a contest at Chuck&#x27;s in Florida several years ago.  I keep one in my car.  I gave one to my husband for Valentine&#x27;s day.  My cat likes it just as well as coconut oil when she gets ready to kiss me goodnight.  OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> I wish the tube was bigger. I have dry skin in the winter and ran out within two weeks. The product is good but there&#x27;s no value in it whatsoever. I have switched over to the African Botanics balm and love it even more. It lasts longer and it actually healed my dry skin so ended up using less in the end.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It is lovely smelling and does the job.</li>
            <li> I was at the local health food store and they had this product on sale for $12.00, with testers ~ I bought it, with the hope it would help my extremely rough hands. I had used coconut oil x2, Jojoba Oil x 2, wearing nitrile gloves at night--and this product cleared it up 75% first time I used it and the balance was gone by the 3rd time using it. It is not greasy, so I am not sure what another reviewer was referring to, other than it could have been the Weleda Sea Buckthorn, which was a lighter, greaser cream with the most amazing scent (I almost purchased that instead!) ~ The Skin Food was thick, very little scent and very healing for dry skin. It is pricey, but it gets the job done and at the end of the day--that is what counts.</li>
            <li> this is my very favorite moisturizer. i am 45, and have been using the very best products since i was 14. this is just the best. i use it on my face every day. granted, my skin is very dry and it drinks up the lotion quickly. this may be too thick for many to use on their faces, but i tell you it makes your face glow.&lt;br /&gt;having said all of this, it is amazing for hands. it is also so great for the entire body! try it, you will not be disappointed! i have at least 2 tubes at all times so i can carry one with me and leave one at home!&lt;br /&gt;i heart weleda skin food!</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, but it&#x27;s very strong.  I found the cream to be very greasy, even after wearing over night.</li>
            <li> I live in CO which has a very dry climate. I mean I can slather coconut oil on my skin and my skin is dry an hour or two later. My youngest has had an eczema breakout after a round of antibiotics (don&#x27;t even get me started on that) and aside from helping him heal through his diet and applying CPTG essential oils to keep infections at bay, I&#x27;ve had to contend with the effects of dry air on his extremely dry and itchy skin.  Enter Weleda Skin Food. It is a very thick cream. I find it helpful to put a little on my hands and emulsify it a little before applying. Because it has staying power his skin has had a chance to recover. A little goes a long way. I also use it on my hands and feet in the winter. Super effective. It is a little greasy, but when you&#x27;re really looking for moisturizing that lasts, well, I&#x27;ve learned to live with it and don&#x27;t mind it too much.</li>
            <li> This s a very rich creme. I like the smell a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This creme is great to protect my skin from the cold.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I read so many comments and done research on this product, still is not &#x27;the one&#x27; product that I am looking for. Is good for super dry feet, I used a few times on my face, I can barely stand the smell, is pretty bad as a &#x27;nature scents&#x27;. I have oily/combo skins, its just too much for my face to absorb.</li>
            <li> Smells good, absorbs well into the skin without leaving it feeling greasy but it didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized at all. It didn&#x27;t make it worse, but definitely not any better. I love that its all natural though.</li>
            <li> i love this. smells great works great. I use it all over, even my face when it is very dry. its a little greasy on your hands, but very effective and protective.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe cracked feet. Always have. Comes from not wearing shoes! I exchanged this for my nightly other regimen in an effort to save some dough. I like the product. I can see if you were a gardner and needed to soften your hands throughout the day, it would likely work. It however did nothing for my feet. I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous foot cream.  My other complaint is/was, it&#x27;s greasier than most creams. It&#x27;s actually more of an ointment than a cream.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate so I need a heavy lotion.  I put it on at night and things are much better by morning.  It&#x27;s on auto-refill.</li>
            <li> Love this, have used it for years to create a fresh glow on my face after make up application - warm it in your hands and tap it on your cheek bones, above eye brows, jawline and cleavage - you will look refreshed and healthy!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It&#x27;s a bit oily and thick, but nice and moisturizing. It smells good, but a little strong. I like the smell, but my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t really. It smells like herbs and spices.</li>
            <li> edit: did not know till now that this cream has lanolin in it :( unkind/unfair to sheep ~ and unnecessary! to be used as an ingredient in *anything* .. therefore, have lowered the rating (from 5 stars to 3) and removed where had said i would buy it again. .. here&#x27;s the prior review (minus that i would buy it again):  its not as easy as most creams to put on because its so dense (there&#x27;s almost a &#x27;resist&#x27; feel when applying it to body) YET! results-wise, it is probably the best body cream i&#x27;ve ever used for dry skin! it makes skin wonderfully hydrated, and this lasts a long time. great fresh-healthy-natural scent too.</li>
            <li> Almost the best. It does not have enough almond oil to deep condition. You fphave to use it more than once a day and it is heavy</li>
            <li> I am an Aesthetic Registered Nurse who works in a Medical Spa. We don&#x27;t sell Weleda Skin Food at the&lt;br /&gt;spa that I work at so I ordered it from Amazon. I love this amazing product. I am 56 years old with very&lt;br /&gt;dry skin. This is truly the best nighttime skin cream I have every used. It is wonderful for the neck and&lt;br /&gt;decollete area. It will help with the \\&quot;texture\\&quot; of your neck if you are started to show aging there. I can&#x27;t say enough&lt;br /&gt;good things about this wonderful hydrating cream. Highly recommend that you buy!</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle for those with dry skin!</li>
            <li> my favorite intensive hand cream</li>
            <li> Expensive but works like no other!  I buy several tubes and keep one in the bath, one by my bed and one in my office.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for really dry skin.  Great on hands, nails and feet.  The smell is really strong at first and not my favorite but I tolerate it for soft hands and feet.  I use it at bedtime so I don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li> This thick skin food slathers on and makes my skin so soft! The smell is amazing as well! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is nothing like this stuff. I use it on my hands and face and dry winter skin is healed.</li>
            <li> Have Type 1 diabetes so test a lot.  This works well when applied to fingertips.  Keeps them softer.  Would purchase again.  Also received a sample of their Buckthorn hand lotion and really liked the fragrance.  May try that next.</li>
            <li> best hand cream ever...takes out L&#x27;Occitane</li>
            <li> During the cold and dry North East winters my hands are so dry they crack open, especially when I&#x27;m in soapy water too much. This cream fixes the problem. This is the best stuff I have ever used. It seems expensive, but one tube goes a long way. I only use it when I need it and my tube lasted a couple years. If I used it more regular that would not be the case.</li>
            <li> This is the thickest lotion. I keep it around and use it at the first sign of skin irritant or serious dryness. It is a staple in my first aid like antibiotic cream is a must to others. I use it on my grandkids as well. It is great for preventing or healing diaper rash. Have flaking skin? Try this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall, but it&#x27;s a bit greasy and somewhat overpriced.  Not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy cream, which is great for really dry skin! Works wonders in elbows and dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you squeeze the cream out it has a light yellow hue to it and you can clearly see that it has a lot of oil in it. The smell is very mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs well, but does leave a sticky/oily film behind, which is not an issue for me because I mainly use it before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream on my face before, and not only does it do it&#x27;s job well, but it also does not clog my pores or cause acne! This is an awesome finding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using this one because it&#x27;s price to quality ration is amazing</li>
            <li> I recently started using Retin-A, and my face was incredibly dry, peeling, and irritated. Skin Food saved my skin!! This is the product to buy, if your skin is in need of serious help.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover a relatively large area.&lt;br /&gt;I shall buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is thicker than most moisturizers.  I needed a moisturizer for the face that was heavy in order to help with my dry skin. I did not want to use a body lotion for the face.  Although there were already good reviews, I was unsure of the texture.  I have to say it is an excellent product for your face if you want something creamier and heavier for dry skin. It absorbs quickly--guess your face is telling you it needs the moisture.  I love the natural smell and products.  I have already seen a change with my skin as it seems to be creating more natural oils. I plan on buying more and just an FYI that the larger size (2.5) seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Best cream for dry skin we have ever tried.  Soothing and healing.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product!  It&#x27;s rich and nourishing and I am in love with it.  Everything I have ever tried from Weleda has been a high quality product and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I have tried a metric crapload of hand creams, and the majority just make my hands feel dryer within hours of use. Skin Food does not do that; the moisturizing and softening effects it has are pretty darn persistent. I sometimes work in a extremely dry room wearing nitrile gloves all day, so if I didn&#x27;t have access to an excellent moisturizer like this one, I&#x27;d have the hands of a 99-year-old man. I gave this to the boyfriend, who washes his hands a great deal and uses a degreaser product called Goo Gone that completely desiccates the skin, and this stuff prevents the extreme cracking and dryness that he used to get. He likes the citrus smell, too (and he definitely avoids products that smell flowery or fruity).</li>
            <li> better to buy another similar brand&#x27;s. very cheap package first impression and thick cream makes me feel oily. not working for me</li>
            <li> Hands down the absolute BEST hand &amp; foot cream I have ever used. And might I just say that I am a product junkie. This is so Healing.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have been buying it for years at my local Mrs.Greens and Whole Foods.  Your hands could be chafed and burning, put this cream on and the relief is incredible.  It&#x27;s gotten quite expensive though so my future daughter in law looked on line.  Thought I had a great deal except for one of the tubes, the cream seem to seperate, .The cream is  very white and one tube was yellowy brown.  The dates were all the same they were good til 2015 but I got beat for one so I guess it didn&#x27;t turn out to be a bargain after all.</li>
            <li> This product greatly exceeded my expectations, you have to try it to truly know its worth. Heals dry or razor burned skin quickly and without an oily build-up. Nice, neutral smell.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff, it just eats it up! Love the smell and the feel of it. In fact, I am going to order more now. Thanks Weleda!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that I try this product. I would frequently have rashes on my chin from double-edge wet shaving. Shaving is tough on the skin, but delivers a close shave in ridding one of daily stubble. I had tried other products for moisturizing skin and preventing shaving rash, none worked as efficiently as Weleda Skin Food. I use it at night, it&#x27;s a bit too heavy (it also adds some sheen to one&#x27;s skin) to use during the day. I no longer wake with a shaving rash from the previous day; and my shaves are closer and far more comfortable because my skin is properly moisturized/lubricated/replenished/softened, as is my growing stubble. During the day I use Nivea Post Shave lotion for sensitive skin (the old alcohol- and dye-free formulation; the new one says Active Sport System and it&#x27;s nothing like the previous formulation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my hands--it&#x27;s the best in cold and dry weather for replenishing skin and keeping one&#x27;s hands soft. The consistency is more like toothpaste than a traditional hand cream. The product works for me and has yet to fail on repairing and replenishing skin. If only it came in a one-pound jar. Simply put, Weleda Skin Food works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t help my husband&#x27;s dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got pretty strong smell to it...&lt;br /&gt;My nose is too sensitive to it so I can not wear them outside.. it kills my nose and I never got used ot is.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it but too bad ... :(</li>
            <li> Really good for my skin</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It has been a life saver for my dry skin this winter. It has also really helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema. It is a little greasy so I probably will not use it during the summer but for winter and very dry skin; it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love, love this lotion, smells so fresh and clean.  Every time I put it on my husband comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> This cream works the best for my dry hands -- not greasy and absorbs well. Keep coming back to this one after trying others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, but pricey. Believe it or not the online price is a bargain compared to in store prices. Have only seen it at Vitamin Cottage and Whole Foods. If you ever see it on sale---buy it.</li>
            <li> Why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European made - much higher standards for ingredients (and safer ingredients)&lt;br /&gt;Full of holistic, naturally healing ingredients&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great - somewhere between a body butter and a lotion&lt;br /&gt;Works well everywhere, even the face&lt;br /&gt;packaged in a nice sturdy tube to preserve freshness (no light or air gets in)&lt;br /&gt;the name is fun (right? the marketing got to me obviously)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I don&#x27;t like it:&lt;br /&gt;The smell! Argh. It is a combination of an old leather jacket mixed with lemons and some car tires. Some people find it &#x27;nice&#x27;, &#x27;herby&#x27; or &#x27;natural&#x27; here in the reviews. I just find it odd. Really odd. I&#x27;m not keen on smelling like lemon tires. It could be the fault of the Geraniol scent in it? Maybe I&#x27;m particularly sensitive to it. I never &#x27;judge&#x27; natural lotion for it&#x27;s scent unless there is added perfume in it that doesn&#x27;t need to be there, which is in this case how I feel about this lotion. In solely my opinion, it would be an improvement without any of the perfume, or at the very least it probably couldn&#x27;t get any worse without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it though to continue using it because I absolutely love Weleda products for the purity, holistic approach and the fact that they work well (their calendula baby products have been wonderful for our little one&#x27;s skin).</li>
            <li> A homeopathic doctor told me that if I held something and it made me either strong or weak, then the product is good or bad for my body respectively.  When I held and used this cream, my body was just so relaxed, giving out a big sigh of relief as if it needed the nutrients and benefits that this cream can give.  The cream is super rich, not water down or runny, giving you a very amazing feeling that every drop of oil carrying all of its wonderful properties is nourishing your cells.  I love this cream, my body demands that I use it.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it. I think it&#x27;s way overpriced and smells kind of weird and grassy.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on this product, and given how dry my skin gets during the winter i gave it a try. It really does moisturize and works on the elbows. For less dry parts I use other moisturizer and use this product for the extremely dry parts, so it does last a long time despite its quantity. Great quality product.</li>
