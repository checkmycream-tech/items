            <li>Perfect; just took a month to get to Canada, but otherwise, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how anything that burns your eyes could be good for them!</li>
            <li>Great for computer eye strain also.</li>
            <li>Bottle is easy to squeeze, and a good size for handling.  </li>
            <li>Helps your eyes ðŸ‘€ feel better.  </li>
            <li>I feel I see with more clarity.  </li>
            <li>but it sure makes my eyes feel better.</li>
            <li>Work ok for dryness...</li>
            <li>I get better results with Visine.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>Bottle was extremely easy to pierce using the top provided,  I have no clue why anyone would have problems with this.  </li>
            <li>You have to puncture the top just right to get the drops out.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship - product as described</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s alot better then eye drops for red eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any proof yet of the long-term usage, but my eyes definitely feel better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I should be happy or sad that the Ph balance in his eyes is good enough that the drops don&#x27;t bother him.  </li>
            <li>This is refreshing, my vision is clear and I think the cataract is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I do not expect to see any results for quite a long time, but it appears to be the same product as Can C that is quite a bit more costly.&lt;br /&gt;Ralph</li>
            <li>12 year old Min Pin doesn&#x27;t have any problems with the drops.  </li>
            <li>Slight burning when you put in the drops goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Since starting these drops 2X per day I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my night vision - less halos &amp; better contrast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is a long acting product that I am taking for preventative reasons.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to compare with Can-See.</li>
            <li> It did tip over and leak a small amount, so I put it inside an older pill bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is helping for my cataracts because I have not used it long enough</li>
            <li> but I would feel sharp bits in my eye.</li>
            <li> It says on box that I received that active ingredients are Glycerin 1%, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose0.15%.</li>
            <li> It is not right</li>
            <li> I have been using another product for a cataract that seemed to be helping break the cataract down</li>
            <li> I think it is slowing down the growth.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> applicator bottle is thin plastic, hard to apply without waste</li>
            <li> or maybe Ph doesn&#x27;t mean</li>

            <li> This is a long acting product that I am taking for preventative reasons.  I do not expect to see any results for quite a long time, but it appears to be the same product as Can C that is quite a bit more costly.&lt;br /&gt;Ralph</li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE A STRONGER VERSION</li>
            <li> Helps your eyes ðŸ‘€ feel better.  It&#x27;s alot better then eye drops for red eyes.  There is an ingredient in them that was discovered to help</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand. It says on box that I received that active ingredients are Glycerin 1%, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose0.15%. Where is Carnosin 1%? Please take it back. It is not right</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any proof yet of the long-term usage, but my eyes definitely feel better.  Slight burning when you put in the drops goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> price keeps increasing.</li>
            <li> I noticed clearer vision right away. I have been using another product for a cataract that seemed to be helping break the cataract down but I would feel sharp bits in my eye. This is refreshing, my vision is clear and I think the cataract is nearly gone. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> We received the drops.  Bottle was extremely easy to pierce using the top provided,  I have no clue why anyone would have problems with this.  Bottle is easy to squeeze, and a good size for handling.  It did tip over and leak a small amount, so I put it inside an older pill bottle.  Can&#x27;t tip over now, and if it does find a way to leak, the extra bottle with contain it for recycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 12 year old Min Pin doesn&#x27;t have any problems with the drops.  Doesn&#x27;t fight it and doesn&#x27;t avoid it.  I don&#x27;t know if I should be happy or sad that the Ph balance in his eyes is good enough that the drops don&#x27;t bother him.  Is this a sign that the Carnosine will work or not work ...  or maybe Ph doesn&#x27;t mean anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the directions say that it could take 6 weeks before we notice anything.  And it will be around 8 weeks before we reorder - so I will update on any changes to the cataract in his eye at that time.</li>
            <li> Great for dry eyes.  I feel I see with more clarity.  You have to puncture the top just right to get the drops out.  Great for computer eye strain also.</li>
            <li> Quick ship - product as described - Thank  you- Hope  it does the job</li>
            <li> Very good product. Not sure if it is helping for my cataracts because I have not used it long enough but it sure makes my eyes feel better.</li>
            <li> Work ok for dryness...cant tell any lens clearing progress ...applicator bottle is thin plastic, hard to apply without waste</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using Can See.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to compare with Can-See.</li>
            <li> Since starting these drops 2X per day I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my night vision - less halos &amp; better contrast.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using these drops.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dog who is getting cataracts.  I think it is slowing down the growth.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of this product as I have macular edema and cataracts</li>
            <li> I used these for my cocker spaniel. I did the research on this product and for us, it is working!  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This product is a joke. I get better results with Visine. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect; just took a month to get to Canada, but otherwise, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> price had went up ,I didnt like that.</li>
            <li> No visible change at all.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes. I don&#x27;t know how anything that burns your eyes could be good for them! I can&#x27;t tolerate it and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
