            <li>The bottle is very cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never worn the eau de toilette, so I can&#x27;t speak about it, but the eau de parfum is a wonderful scent that ranks in quality to many fine (time-tested and pricier) fragrances.</li>

            <li>I love this perfume!</li>

            <li>Nice smell and for the price</li>
            <li>My own fault for buying perfume</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet, kind of vanilla-y and spice-y, and it is definitely a light scent (which is perfect because it sort of rises as the day wears on).</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful light, clean smelling fragrance which I love.  </li>
            <li>Get lots of nice comments on the scent whenever I wear it and much more affordable on Amazon than at the boutique.  </li>
            <li>Very light scent</li>
            <li>Even though the hanging charm is cute, a cap would&#x27;ve been more convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite</li>
            <li>I love this one</li>
            <li>It has an elegant touch to it.</li>
            <li>It is not too floral even though it may sound like it would be!</li>
            <li>I love it on her,</li>
            <li>well I love anything on her.  </li>
            <li>When you buy this just be sure to check your credit card and make sure they are on point.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is lovely and it has an innovative \\&quot;tag\\</li>
            <li>&quot; you remove from the pump top.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad it was inexpensive.</li>

            <li>I sold it and bought more.</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Have given as gifts to two friends who both wear it often and love the scent.</li>
            <li>This smells more of alcohol.</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love the smell.</li>
            <li>I had bought a sample from a department store and was pleased with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Number 6 is a sultry blend of fruits, flowers and spices, both elegant and intoxicating, appealing to men as well as women.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It smells even better once it settles on your body.  </li>
            <li>Such a wonderful, pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always remember with any fragrance you might not be able to smell it on yourself, but others will.</li>
            <li>This has been my signature scent for years, I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s her favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this parfum a ton...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and get many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I got it for the scent, not the bottle:]</li>
            <li>this is my wife&#x27;s favorite she gets compliments all the time</li>
            <li>and i also love the scent</li>
            <li>This is her favorite perfume</li>
            <li>and she was very excited.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li>I got a sample of Lucky 6 in a beauty box subscription, I thought i really liked it.</li>
            <li>Customer service is excellent and I&#x27;ve ordered other things from here that were outstanding and</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Nah I&#x27;m just being funny, but I honestly feel that way about this perfume.</li>
            <li>I got lucky when I bought this one~!  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear Lucky 6.  </li>
            <li>It has a light flowery scent that others can smell when they&#x27;re close to you, but not so strong that you&#x27;re walking around in a cloud of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an attractive bottle too.  </li>
            <li>This is a light, spring-summery scent.</li>
            <li>I emailed Amazon, and when I got my credit card bill they did charge me the correct advertised price, $15.23 &amp; free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Now the important part, the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells light and wears well.</li>
            <li>I used to wear the old Realities by Liz, until they stopped making it, and I loved it also.</li>
            <li>I would have wanted to know the strength of the fragrance, if mild, very mild, strong, etc.  </li>
            <li>When you first spray it, the scent is kind of strong, but then it turns into this soft warm scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order again very soon!!!</li>
            <li>is unique</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I thought that I was lucky to have stumbled upon such a cheap but pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Pretty glass bottle with the red beaded spray guard comes in a nice box quite suitable for gift giving.</li>
            <li>Smell is a light floral, clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>The scent was not like lucky # 6 at all.  </li>
            <li>p. Lucky</li>
            <li>B000P20QM0 Lucky 6 By Liz Claiborne For Women.</li>
            <li>Lucky Number 6 is an Oriental/Spicy fragrance with notes of Peony, Tigerlily, Jasmine Tea, Casheran, Lotus Leaf, Musk, Liquid Amber and Lychee.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And perhaps I should be grateful because of the less-than-ideal smell, but the scent also fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived quickly and is just as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it stays on quite long and it is not too overwhelming of a sent, spicy musk and amber, so I can wear it to work, but also for dinner parties.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that certain perfumes smell better on certain people, because the scent changes as it soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh.</li>
            <li>and you have your own personal aroma of wonder.</li>
            <li>and it smells exactly like it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li>nice  smell ,  mild  not like other perfumes</li>
            <li>After I shook it up and sprayed it a few more times the smell got tremendously better.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>; SO glad he just found it on here, 6 years later I finally have my smell back lol</li>
            <li>This is hard to find in the stores, so I was happy to find this.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY sasitisfied with my product!</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments from many people, people out in public that I don&#x27;t know, asking me what I am wearing because it smells so &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or so &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Lovely oriental/floral scent, spray on hair for longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li>and I still love fragrances like Clinque&#x27;s Aromatic Elixir and Arden&#x27;s Red Door and even CoCo.  </li>
            <li>okay when I first put them on, but by the end of the day felt like I was tasting it in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes next to Lolita Lempicka, UN Jardin, Alfred Sung SHI and my newest discovery</li>
            <li>Definitely more than enough to last a year, or maybe even more.</li>
            <li>Wasnt my favorite, its a very dark and strong manly musk.</li>
            <li>I really do not like many of the contemporary \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrances: too sweet and flowery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be a dedicated customer as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>Lucky #6 isn&#x27;t a perfume that packs a lot of punch as far as originality goes</li>
            <li>To me Lucky Number 6 is a lighter alternative to my heavier favorites and I still feel like an adult.</li>
            <li>My main rationale for buying it was the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My mom really likes this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this bottle so much though.</li>
            <li>I am really picky about perfume.</li>
            <li>The scent strength is light to moderate.</li>
            <li>It does last but in a light seductive way not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I bought one and they gave me an imitation, i tried the original ones, the smell stays longer, but this fades so quick</li>
            <li>I stumbled on this perfume at a small boutique and just love it!  </li>
            <li>sure I will order other Items again, just not parfume.</li>
            <li>Lucky #6 is not  too sweet, floral or heavy, which I do not like.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>the bottle is nice and the covering is ok but the scent is horrible, it is good enough to use in the bathroom</li>
            <li>For most of my life I made due with soft smelling shampoos and deodorants.</li>
            <li>I no longer like the new scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it for everyday wear!</li>
            <li>The bottle I received from amazon was not the exact same fragrant as the department store parfume.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light but surprisingly complex</li>
            <li>Again, this is purely my experience with my skin but be wary of how it might react with your own body.</li>
            <li>I will never purchase from them again and recoommend everyone else stay clear.</li>
            <li>Maybe people around me will notice it, but so far, I have not.  </li>
            <li>It smells like old lady.</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all smell-wise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine and alluring but the sandalwood keeps it classy somehow.  </li>
            <li>but you might want to be careful when ordering online because I think the one I got is old or something because it smelled strongly of rubbing alcohol for the first few squirts.</li>
            <li>after several times I would say, &amp;#34;oh you have on Lucky 6, don&#x27;t you&amp;#34; and here I am SEVERAL bottles later...</li>
            <li>It is exactly like other times I bought this perfume.</li>
            <li>It seems more watery or weak.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased it at a department store and then was not able to find it until I checked on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected, delivered on time, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li>The main reason for the \\&quot;over spray\\&quot; is because the wearer wanted to smell him or herself all day long.</li>
            <li>, that does wear off a bit, but I&#x27;m afraid that I am not smelling it how it really smells and that really I smell like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the fragrance was barely noticeable after a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li>Since everyone&#x27;s chemical makeup in their body is different, so is everyone&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li>When I first spray it on it has an odd chemical smell</li>
            <li>When I picked up the bottle I originally thought that this wasn&#x27;t horrible, it was actually a quite pleasant, woody, oriental.</li>
            <li>Find the scent very watered down from what I had been purchasing in the stores, don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>

            <li> I get many compliments when I wear this scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this parfum a ton...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and get many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I got it for the scent, not the bottle:]</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite she gets compliments all the time</li>
            <li> and i also love the scent</li>
            <li> This is her favorite perfume</li>
            <li> and she was very excited.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Lucky 6 in a beauty box subscription, I thought i really liked it.</li>
            <li> Customer service is excellent and I&#x27;ve ordered other things from here that were outstanding and</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Nah I&#x27;m just being funny, but I honestly feel that way about this perfume.</li>
            <li> I got lucky when I bought this one~!  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear Lucky 6.  </li>
            <li> It has a light flowery scent that others can smell when they&#x27;re close to you, but not so strong that you&#x27;re walking around in a cloud of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an attractive bottle too.  </li>
            <li> This is a light, spring-summery scent.</li>
            <li> I emailed Amazon, and when I got my credit card bill they did charge me the correct advertised price, $15.23 &amp; free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Now the important part, the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells light and wears well.</li>
            <li> I used to wear the old Realities by Liz, until they stopped making it, and I loved it also.</li>
            <li> I would have wanted to know the strength of the fragrance, if mild, very mild, strong, etc.  </li>
            <li> When you first spray it, the scent is kind of strong, but then it turns into this soft warm scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order again very soon!!!</li>
            <li> is unique</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was lucky to have stumbled upon such a cheap but pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Pretty glass bottle with the red beaded spray guard comes in a nice box quite suitable for gift giving.</li>
            <li> Smell is a light floral, clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> The scent was not like lucky # 6 at all.  </li>
            <li> p. Lucky</li>
            <li> B000P20QM0 Lucky 6 By Liz Claiborne For Women.</li>
            <li> Lucky Number 6 is an Oriental/Spicy fragrance with notes of Peony, Tigerlily, Jasmine Tea, Casheran, Lotus Leaf, Musk, Liquid Amber and Lychee.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And perhaps I should be grateful because of the less-than-ideal smell, but the scent also fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived quickly and is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it stays on quite long and it is not too overwhelming of a sent, spicy musk and amber, so I can wear it to work, but also for dinner parties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that certain perfumes smell better on certain people, because the scent changes as it soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh.</li>
            <li> and you have your own personal aroma of wonder.</li>
            <li> and it smells exactly like it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li> nice  smell ,  mild  not like other perfumes</li>
            <li> After I shook it up and sprayed it a few more times the smell got tremendously better.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> ; SO glad he just found it on here, 6 years later I finally have my smell back lol</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the stores, so I was happy to find this.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY sasitisfied with my product!</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments from many people, people out in public that I don&#x27;t know, asking me what I am wearing because it smells so &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or so &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Lovely oriental/floral scent, spray on hair for longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li> and I still love fragrances like Clinque&#x27;s Aromatic Elixir and Arden&#x27;s Red Door and even CoCo.  </li>
            <li> okay when I first put them on, but by the end of the day felt like I was tasting it in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes next to Lolita Lempicka, UN Jardin, Alfred Sung SHI and my newest discovery</li>
            <li> Definitely more than enough to last a year, or maybe even more.</li>
            <li> Wasnt my favorite, its a very dark and strong manly musk.</li>
            <li> I really do not like many of the contemporary \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrances: too sweet and flowery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be a dedicated customer as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> Lucky #6 isn&#x27;t a perfume that packs a lot of punch as far as originality goes</li>
            <li> To me Lucky Number 6 is a lighter alternative to my heavier favorites and I still feel like an adult.</li>
            <li> My main rationale for buying it was the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this bottle so much though.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about perfume.</li>
            <li> The scent strength is light to moderate.</li>
            <li> It does last but in a light seductive way not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought one and they gave me an imitation, i tried the original ones, the smell stays longer, but this fades so quick</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this perfume at a small boutique and just love it!  </li>
            <li> sure I will order other Items again, just not parfume.</li>
            <li> Lucky #6 is not  too sweet, floral or heavy, which I do not like.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> the bottle is nice and the covering is ok but the scent is horrible, it is good enough to use in the bathroom</li>
            <li> For most of my life I made due with soft smelling shampoos and deodorants.</li>
            <li> I no longer like the new scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it for everyday wear!</li>
            <li> The bottle I received from amazon was not the exact same fragrant as the department store parfume.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light but surprisingly complex</li>
            <li> Again, this is purely my experience with my skin but be wary of how it might react with your own body.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase from them again and recoommend everyone else stay clear.</li>
            <li> Maybe people around me will notice it, but so far, I have not.  </li>
            <li> It smells like old lady.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all smell-wise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine and alluring but the sandalwood keeps it classy somehow.  </li>
            <li> but you might want to be careful when ordering online because I think the one I got is old or something because it smelled strongly of rubbing alcohol for the first few squirts.</li>
            <li> after several times I would say, &amp;#34;oh you have on Lucky 6, don&#x27;t you&amp;#34; and here I am SEVERAL bottles later...</li>
            <li> It is exactly like other times I bought this perfume.</li>
            <li> It seems more watery or weak.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased it at a department store and then was not able to find it until I checked on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected, delivered on time, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> The main reason for the \\&quot;over spray\\&quot; is because the wearer wanted to smell him or herself all day long.</li>
            <li> , that does wear off a bit, but I&#x27;m afraid that I am not smelling it how it really smells and that really I smell like cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the fragrance was barely noticeable after a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> Since everyone&#x27;s chemical makeup in their body is different, so is everyone&#x27;s natural scent.</li>
            <li> When I first spray it on it has an odd chemical smell</li>
            <li> When I picked up the bottle I originally thought that this wasn&#x27;t horrible, it was actually a quite pleasant, woody, oriental.</li>
            <li> Find the scent very watered down from what I had been purchasing in the stores, don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was an oil because that&#x27;s the only perfumes I have used that last as long and wear so well.</li>
            <li> It is quite dark in the bottle as compared to the clear liquid sample, maybe it&#x27;s turned rancid or something?</li>
            <li> Just as she asked for, thanks for carrying this as we were not able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> an estimation of how long the fragrance last on body or clothing, and return policy from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Very soft and delicate yet scents of a woman not a little girl.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap - like fake flowers made from chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also curious about the name Lucky 6 -- have no idea about the \\&quot;story\\&quot; behind that.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what the fragnance would be when I ordered this -- only what I read in other reviews at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never smelled before simply because I like other scents in the brand.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that it does have a fruity scent, but doesn&#x27;t hang around very long after use.</li>
            <li> The bottle is opaque (the liquid is dark yellow)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy that its so cheap.</li>
            <li> My perfume Luck 6 by Liz Claiborn for Women is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because when I was a child I was smothered by grandmas and aunties with big boobs and heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> The department store parfume felt more of an oil base and it last longer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i get so sick that i just throw the perfume away because i know that i will never be able to wear it again wtihout gagging :</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how it changed scents to go from one extreme to another</li>
            <li> I have other scents</li>
            <li> It was an imitation</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that as far as scents go, one could do a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Now, I didn&#x27;t down vote this for that reason but you know how some people claim some fragrances just don&#x27;t work with their body chemistry?</li>
            <li> The set was a gift of which when I received it the perfume was half gone &amp; the shower gel had leaked all over the inside of the gift box.</li>
            <li> It is lite and subtle but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I like heavy or overpowering fragrances, but I need to have something that I know is there.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Usually when i buy a perfume or receive it as a gift i like it for about a month or 2</li>
            <li> cute bottle. smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all overpowering and very feminine without being sickly.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for at least 3 weeks now and show no sign of ever giving up this fenomenal perfume.</li>
            <li> I also discovered that by buying it through Amazon it was a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when the perfume arrived only to be extremely disappointed that it smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a replacement because it was not in stock and the replacement was not good.  </li>
            <li> still ordering it...always get at least one inquiry as to what scent I am wearing every time I have it on!</li>
            <li> The dry down on my skin was horrible.</li>
            <li> but if my choice is smelling like a sewer or like Liz Claiborne&#x27;s unfortunately named fragrance, than I wouldn&#x27;t mind spritzing this on my flesh.</li>
            <li> So sad it&#x27;s not going to be made anymore.</li>
            <li> Im sad, but since I&#x27;m not wearing this at least I do not smell awful.</li>
            <li> and then i get so sick of it.</li>
            <li> i was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to trying this perfume, and was truly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product arrived safely&lt;br /&gt;excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> I am VERY sasitisfied with my product! I used to wear this years ago when I worked at Macys and it smells exactly like it did when I first bought it!</li>
            <li> This package was paid for and never delivered and never refunded for!   I have no access to the ups claim because they already filed and did not follow through!  I will never purchase from them again and recoommend everyone else stay clear.</li>
            <li> The scent was not like lucky # 6 at all.  i was really disappointed.  The scent did not linger and stay with you.  I gave it to my niece.  I no longer like the new scent.  I think that they change the formula.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and stays on all day.  The bottle and packaging it comes in is unique so itÂ´s also good for a gift.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to trying this perfume, and was truly disappointed.  While it is known for being a \\&quot;light\\&quot; scent, the scent is practically non-existent.  There&#x27;s nothing there at all.  It&#x27;s such an attractive bottle too.  It&#x27;s not that I like heavy or overpowering fragrances, but I need to have something that I know is there.  Maybe people around me will notice it, but so far, I have not.  This may be the perfect scent for the office, enclosed quarters, because there is no way this scent will knock anyone out with a punch.</li>
            <li> The scent is sweet, kind of vanilla-y and spice-y, and it is definitely a light scent (which is perfect because it sort of rises as the day wears on). The bottle is opaque (the liquid is dark yellow) and it&#x27;s about the size of the palm of my hand. I&#x27;ve been a fan of this scent for a while now but you might want to be careful when ordering online because I think the one I got is old or something because it smelled strongly of rubbing alcohol for the first few squirts. After I shook it up and sprayed it a few more times the smell got tremendously better. Also, the bottle doesn&#x27;t have a cap. It instead has a charm that wraps around the neck of the bottle to prevent it from spraying. Even though the hanging charm is cute, a cap would&#x27;ve been more convenient.</li>
            <li> The set was a gift of which when I received it the perfume was half gone &amp; the shower gel had leaked all over the inside of the gift box. It&#x27;s a favorite so I didn&#x27;t bother returning / exchanging it.</li>
            <li> I got lucky when I bought this one~!  Nice smell and for the price; you can&#x27;t beat it!  Very good deal.</li>
            <li> Wears very nicely from a powdery flowery scent into a musk. I initially thought it was an oil because that&#x27;s the only perfumes I have used that last as long and wear so well. I love this one</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it stays on quite long and it is not too overwhelming of a sent, spicy musk and amber, so I can wear it to work, but also for dinner parties. It has an elegant touch to it. I have been complemented on it almost every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommenced it.</li>
            <li> This is a light, spring-summery scent. I love it for everyday wear! It is not too floral even though it may sound like it would be!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlie, and she loves it.  I love it on her, well I love anything on her.  The seller invoice that came in the mail with the smell good tried to charge me $60.00!  I emailed Amazon, and when I got my credit card bill they did charge me the correct advertised price, $15.23 &amp; free shipping.  When you buy this just be sure to check your credit card and make sure they are on point.  Hopefully they took my email and corrected the seller trying to steal from their customer.</li>
            <li> My mom really likes this perfume.  It turned out to be the perfect gift for Mother&#x27;s Day.  Thanks for the good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what the fragnance would be when I ordered this -- only what I read in other reviews at Amazon. I have to agree that it does have a fruity scent, but doesn&#x27;t hang around very long after use. My main rationale for buying it was the very reasonable price. The bottle is lovely and it has an innovative \\&quot;tag\\&quot; you remove from the pump top. I&#x27;m neutral about whether I would purchase it again. Might rate it number 3 in a choice of 3 brands/scents. I am also curious about the name Lucky 6 -- have no idea about the \\&quot;story\\&quot; behind that. Does anyone know?</li>
            <li> It smells like old lady. My own fault for buying perfume I&#x27;d never smelled before simply because I like other scents in the brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance!  This is hard to find in the stores, so I was happy to find this.  It came quickly and is just what I expected.  I&#x27;m going to order again very soon!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells fresh. The perfume stays and it&#x27;s pleasant. Not too strong. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for about two years and I love it. It&#x27;s very light but surprisingly complex and I always get lots of compliments, often from total strangers. I&#x27;ve never worn the eau de toilette, so I can&#x27;t speak about it, but the eau de parfum is a wonderful scent that ranks in quality to many fine (time-tested and pricier) fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum!!!! I used to wear the old Realities by Liz, until they stopped making it, and I loved it also. Lucky #6 is not  too sweet, floral or heavy, which I do not like. It is lite and subtle but lasts a long time. I have gotten compliments from many people, people out in public that I don&#x27;t know, asking me what I am wearing because it smells so &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or so &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;. Please continue to carry this brand!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Lucky 6 in a beauty box subscription, I thought i really liked it. I really don&#x27;t like this bottle so much though. My sample is gone, so I can&#x27;t do a side by side sniff test. I feel like it&#x27;s got to be different, or I would have never even wanted to buy it! When I first spray it on it has an odd chemical smell, that does wear off a bit, but I&#x27;m afraid that I am not smelling it how it really smells and that really I smell like cheap perfume. It is quite dark in the bottle as compared to the clear liquid sample, maybe it&#x27;s turned rancid or something? I am glad it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Usually when i buy a perfume or receive it as a gift i like it for about a month or 2 and then i get so sick of it. Sometimes i get so sick that i just throw the perfume away because i know that i will never be able to wear it again wtihout gagging :p. Lucky no. 5 is VERY simple and not too overpowering. I have been wearing it for at least 3 weeks now and show no sign of ever giving up this fenomenal perfume. And for a price of $15? cant beat it</li>
            <li> I use this perfume all the time. i&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good it smells. I would definitely recommend this aroma.  not too strong.  I don&#x27;t care for the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; odors and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that as far as scents go, one could do a lot worse. Lucky #6 isn&#x27;t a perfume that packs a lot of punch as far as originality goes but if my choice is smelling like a sewer or like Liz Claiborne&#x27;s unfortunately named fragrance, than I wouldn&#x27;t mind spritzing this on my flesh. When I picked up the bottle I originally thought that this wasn&#x27;t horrible, it was actually a quite pleasant, woody, oriental. I thought that I was lucky to have stumbled upon such a cheap but pleasant fragrance. It does have some staying power for a cheaper brand so if you&#x27;re looking for some bang for your buck, Claiborne is your girl.    The problem? The dry down on my skin was horrible. I kept smelling butter the entire day and it wasn&#x27;t until I sniffed my pulse points that I realized that it was this fragrance. Now, I didn&#x27;t down vote this for that reason but you know how some people claim some fragrances just don&#x27;t work with their body chemistry? I didn&#x27;t believe it until I got this. This fragrance went from &#x27;ok&#x27; to &#x27;did I just rub country crock on my body?\\&quot; Again, this is purely my experience with my skin but be wary of how it might react with your own body. I can&#x27;t even explain how it changed scents to go from one extreme to another but it did not wear well on me.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about perfume. every time i go into a store to buy I always walk out without buying. So I thought I&#x27;d just pick a perfume that sounds good and just buy. I am so glad i did. I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s not at all overpowering and very feminine without being sickly.</li>
            <li> Lovely oriental/floral scent, spray on hair for longer lasting scent. I really love the bottle and box AND the price! Have had lots of people wanting to know what I was wearing...one girl even offered me $45.00 for it. I sold it and bought more.The lowest price is at AMAZON.com(most things are)[[ASIN:B000P20QM0 Lucky 6 By Liz Claiborne For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz.]]Use the link to get the goods!</li>
            <li> ComprÃ© este perfume por algunos buenos comentarios, sin embargo cuando usÃ© esta fragancia quedÃ© decepcionada, no reuniÃ³ mis expectativas. Tiene un intenso olor a pachulÃ­. no estuve conforme con esta compra.</li>
            <li> I ordered the perfume because cologne never lasts on me. I was not disappointed. Several people smelled the fragrance that I was wearing and asked what it was &amp; where could they get it. This would make a lovely gift because it looks and smells expensive but it&#x27;s not! Pretty glass bottle with the red beaded spray guard comes in a nice box quite suitable for gift giving. I am 100% pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this perfume at a small boutique and just love it!  Smell is a light floral, clean and crisp.  Get lots of nice comments on the scent whenever I wear it and much more affordable on Amazon than at the boutique.  Have given as gifts to two friends who both wear it often and love the scent.</li>
            <li> It is exactly like other times I bought this perfume. It was gift  for my granddaughter and she was very excited.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase this product from the department store. They do not sell it anymore. The bottle I received from amazon was not the exact same fragrant as the department store parfume. This smells more of alcohol. It seems more watery or weak. The department store parfume felt more of an oil base and it last longer. I will keep it but will not buy parfume from here again. Customer service is excellent and I&#x27;ve ordered other things from here that were outstanding and Iam sure I will order other Items again, just not parfume.</li>
            <li> Good. On time. Pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Very very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love the smell.I get LOTS of compliments all the time by all sorts of people.&lt;br /&gt;The price was a great deal!!</li>
            <li> My perfume Luck 6 by Liz Claiborn for Women is just what I expected.  I had bought a sample from a department store and was pleased with the fragrance.  It isn&#x27;t an overbearing scent,  my husband compliments me whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift - she loved it.  Just as she asked for, thanks for carrying this as we were not able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Lucky Number 6 is an Oriental/Spicy fragrance with notes of Peony, Tigerlily, Jasmine Tea, Casheran, Lotus Leaf, Musk, Liquid Amber and Lychee. Number 6 is a sultry blend of fruits, flowers and spices, both elegant and intoxicating, appealing to men as well as women. The scent strength is light to moderate. Lasts 6-10 hours.</li>
            <li> A co worker has worn this scent for several years and each time she had it on I would ask what it was...after several times I would say, &amp;#34;oh you have on Lucky 6, don&#x27;t you&amp;#34; and here I am SEVERAL bottles later...still ordering it...always get at least one inquiry as to what scent I am wearing every time I have it on!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear Lucky 6.  Very light scent and it is perfect for healthcare workers.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume I always use it and always get complicated on it.  Like any perfume it needs to match your skin, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Wasnt my favorite, its a very dark and strong manly musk. if the musk smell is you then this would be good for you.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It smells even better once it settles on your body.  My clothes even smell wonderful!  Excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap - like fake flowers made from chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And perhaps I should be grateful because of the less-than-ideal smell, but the scent also fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I would have wanted to know the strength of the fragrance, if mild, very mild, strong, etc.  an estimation of how long the fragrance last on body or clothing, and return policy from the vendor. In my opinion the fragrance was barely noticeable after a couple of sprays.</li>
            <li> I bought one and they gave me an imitation, i tried the original ones, the smell stays longer, but this fades so quick</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Such a wonderful, pleasing scent.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and i have loved it ever since. My friends call it \\&quot;my scent\\&quot; and people I&#x27;ve never met will comment \\&quot;you smell so good, what is that cologne!\\&quot; I have other scents but i always come back to \\&quot;my scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this Fragrance! It does last but in a light seductive way not overpowering. I am 54 years old and I still love fragrances like Clinque&#x27;s Aromatic Elixir and Arden&#x27;s Red Door and even CoCo.  To me Lucky Number 6 is a lighter alternative to my heavier favorites and I still feel like an adult. I really do not like many of the contemporary \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; fragrances: too sweet and flowery.&lt;br /&gt;Always remember with any fragrance you might not be able to smell it on yourself, but others will. The wearer&#x27;s nose adjusts to the fragrance so you don&#x27;t smell it. Think about the men and women whose cologne or perfume almost knocks you over. The main reason for the \\&quot;over spray\\&quot; is because the wearer wanted to smell him or herself all day long.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because when I was a child I was smothered by grandmas and aunties with big boobs and heavy perfume. For most of my life I made due with soft smelling shampoos and deodorants. I tried colognes and perfumes that smelled okay when I first put them on, but by the end of the day felt like I was tasting it in the back of my throat. I found this years ago. It has a light flowery scent that others can smell when they&#x27;re close to you, but not so strong that you&#x27;re walking around in a cloud of it. The Eau De Parfum lasts all day and you can smell it on yesterday&#x27;s clothes. It&#x27;s always been relatively inexpensive in the stores, but now online costs about the same as a lot of body sprays in the bath specialty shops. So sad it&#x27;s not going to be made anymore. I don&#x27;t remember seeing Liz Claiborne on the box though.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic to find this perfume!  I had originally purchased it at a department store and then was not able to find it until I checked on Amazon.  This is a wonderful light, clean smelling fragrance which I love.  Lucky for me to be able to find it again!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me when I was 16 and we were dating, one bottle lasted me about 2 years! Crazy! Anyway, I had gotten another perfume after that considering we couldn&#x27;t find this one anywhere, but nothing ever smelled like this, he always said this was &amp;#34;my smell&amp;#34; SO glad he just found it on here, 6 years later I finally have my smell back lol</li>
            <li> This has been my signature scent for years, I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments. Wonderful spicy scent! Shipment arrived quickly and is just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that certain perfumes smell better on certain people, because the scent changes as it soaks into your skin. Since everyone&#x27;s chemical makeup in their body is different, so is everyone&#x27;s natural scent. Mix perfume with that and you have your own personal aroma of wonder. Nah I&#x27;m just being funny, but I honestly feel that way about this perfume. It&#x27;s the best. I&#x27;ve never smelled anything else like it. I pray they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Very soft and delicate yet scents of a woman not a little girl. Poised!</li>
            <li> They sent me a replacement because it was not in stock and the replacement was not good.  It was an imitation</li>
            <li> nice  smell ,  mild  not like other perfumes</li>
            <li> the bottle is nice and the covering is ok but the scent is horrible, it is good enough to use in the bathroom</li>
            <li> I did not purchase from this seller but i use this perfume &amp; wanted to give my 2cents on it. OMG! It smells great! Its sultry and somewhat musky. The bottle is very cute. Not heavy at all smell-wise. Will be repurchasing when I ran out.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes next to Lolita Lempicka, UN Jardin, Alfred Sung SHI and my newest discovery Thallium~ All 4 of them including the men&#x27;s are fantastic!.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful fragrance that gets attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have!........&lt;br /&gt;10 Stars.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!! I always wear it in the fall. When you first spray it, the scent is kind of strong, but then it turns into this soft warm scent and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected, delivered on time, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a gift. It&#x27;s her favorite scent. She was grateful and enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume in my Beauty Box 5 subscription and I absolutely LOVED it. I received multiple compliments on the sample and decided I needed to splurge and get the big bottle as a treat for myself.  I was so excited when the perfume arrived only to be extremely disappointed that it smelled awful.  I&#x27;ve attempted to shake the bottle to mix it up and also leave it still for an extended period of time to see if it helped. It did not.  Im sad, but since I&#x27;m not wearing this at least I do not smell awful.</li>
            <li> cute bottle. smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments when I wear this scent.  It&#x27;s feminine and alluring but the sandalwood keeps it classy somehow.  I will be a dedicated customer as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for a few years now. I had to start buying it online because they no longer sold this fragrance in the stores. I also discovered that by buying it through Amazon it was a lot less expensive. Now the important part, the fragrance. It smells light and wears well. I have received hundreds of compliments over the years everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> Find the scent very watered down from what I had been purchasing in the stores, don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum a ton...it is not being produced anymore from what I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;All stores and outlets no longer carry it.  But will be stocking up as it is one of&lt;br /&gt;my daughters and my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and get many compliments.  thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She tells me that every time she wears it people tell her how wonderful she smells :)</li>
            <li> Smells great! Definitely more than enough to last a year, or maybe even more. The tassel came off of the bottle, but who cares? I got it for the scent, not the bottle:]</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! It&#x27;s crazy that its so cheap. That&#x27;s my 3rd time buying it cause my friends kept stealing them lol</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite she gets compliments all the time and i also love the scent</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter - This is her favorite perfume and she was very happy to get it for her birthday and&lt;br /&gt;up coming Wedding.</li>
