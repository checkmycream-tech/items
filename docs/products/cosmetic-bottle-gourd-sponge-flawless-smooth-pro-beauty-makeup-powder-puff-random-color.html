            <li> ... then I realized it was &amp;#34;Made in China.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll use the  ones &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34; applicators.</li>
            <li> I hated it, when I tried applying makeup to my face that sponge rubbed off onto me. It was very cheap and gross</li>
            <li> I like how the shape makes it fit better in my hand while in use. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Super soft, I love to grab it. It blends nicely as expected. Great price compared to local beauty stores. I recommend this product for use as a blender.</li>
            <li> Really Enjoy Using This Product , It applies my foundation Flawlessly And really absorbs the oil , defintely recommend it to others who are looking for a beauty blender dupe ! . -Davine</li>
            <li> Just received this a couple days ago. Very smooth and soft, blends makeup very well. shape makes it very easy to grasp and use either end. happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> definitely not a dupe for the Beauty Blender but works in a pinch. a little rough and solid but its affordable.</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about this style beauty blender.  This sponge works fine but it is nothing I have to have.  I&#x27;m not sure if the name brand blender would work better but it cost $20.00 and I am not paying that for a sponge.  This one works fine.</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge!! Talk about magically blending. I&#x27;m stock piling these little babies for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be like the beauty sponge I had currently, but it is much more stiff (not as soft/ squishy) and doesn&#x27;t really blend well at all.</li>
            <li> Received it soon than expected. First time using this kind of makeup sponge and am very pleased with the results. Will be buying my teen daughter one in the near future.</li>
            <li> it is not eve close the real thing and smelled really bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I dont really use it, rather use brush.</li>
            <li> Very rough. Not good on my face</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in my beauty habits! Better then buying on in a store for like $10.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product but it wasn&#x27;t as pictured</li>
            <li> I got this product.. But it&#x27;s take longer before I got this..</li>
            <li> This item is a bust and is nothing like the cosmetic sponge it claims it is. A sponge is suppose to expand when wet. This product did not do that and was rough when trying to apply. The price was nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Works great, blends quick n smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered one before and it was larger than the one I got now it&#x27;s really small I but I love the first one that I got</li>
            <li> I just received this. The envelope said phone case? It&#x27;s not even a phone case.</li>
            <li> Makes foundation super flawless</li>
            <li> horrible. it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Kind of stiff. Not very soft. Will purchase another product that is softer. Not what i expected. Overall, as described.</li>
