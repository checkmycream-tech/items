            <li>What a beautiful fragrance  Full of flowers like jasmine and lilac  </li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve used a nice soap.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it can be VERY strong if you put more than 2 sprays (gave me a headahce), but if used lightly, it gives this great floral scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I bought it because My Father used to love this scent...and it brings nice memories to me...</li>
            <li>This sweet, flowery perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li>so delicious and so identifiable.</li>
            <li>This is pure Tuberose Smell, a lengendary flower very powerful used for the creation of  the most prestige Perfumes in France, \\&quot;The Nest of the Best Perfumes indeed\\&quot;\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok by me, I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else.</li>
            <li>Glad you had it for me.</li>
            <li>It smell great, and she always wants more.  </li>
            <li>I always go to AMAZON for most anything I&#x27;m looking for and can more often than not, find it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance gets comments as it&#x27;s not one that is worn by many.</li>
            <li>Very unique and different smell compare to others so it is perfect if you do not like to smell \\&quot;like everybody in Town\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Very clean and floral.</li>
            <li>You will always be remembered in a very special way, once you wear Fracas.</li>
            <li>You will always be remembered in a very special alluring way.</li>
            <li>I am sure on someone else it is fabulous, but it doesn&#x27;t work on my chemistry.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of fresh gardenias, this is the perfume for you!  </li>
            <li>Strong, strong gardenia.  </li>
            <li>Fracas is a beautiful white floral, dominated by tuberose.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Fracas.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>As soon as I wore it for the first time, someone noticed it!!</li>
            <li>I love many of the &#x27;older&#x27; fragrances...</li>
            <li>It did not smell like the original scent that I have used for 30 years.  </li>
            <li>have to say that the bottle is kind of really cute, and for now the parfume is just sitting on my shelf only because of the bottle...</li>
            <li>At any rate, the wife prefers it so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was still the same as I remembered and brings back wonderful memories.</li>
            <li>last week it was a waitress who said she liked coming over to the corner I was sitting in because it smelled</li>
            <li>Further, because I&#x27;m more familiar with millilitres, the bottle size exceeded my expectations, which I consider a gift in itself.</li>
            <li>The best gardenia and other white flower hues ever made!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy unique fragrances but classy.</li>
            <li>Fairly priced for the real parfum as opposed to toilet water</li>
            <li>Fracas is hot, not cold.  </li>
            <li>As such, I can&#x27;t help comparing it to my favorite perfume of all time,</li>
            <li>Just goes to show how one flower can be interpreted in many different ways!      </li>
            <li>I am obsessed with tuberouse at the moment and this scent makes me happy every time I spritz it!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>A perfume for a pretty spring dress.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is no longer sold at Sephora</li>
            <li>Thanks to Neiman Marcus for introducing me to this perfume!</li>
            <li>If you like floral perfumes, especially tuberoses, then Fracas is a classic that should be experienced, not simply worn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li>I do not consider it cheap, but it last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sensual scent</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells fabulous and I received it in record time, especially in the run up to Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It fades too fast.</li>
            <li>It lasts without being overbearing; highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fracas is a big, bold, in-your-face tuberose perfume with notes of gardenia and jasmine.  </li>
            <li>My older sister wore it for 10 years before that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic scent that&#x27;s quite feminine.</li>
            <li>I find this fragrance to be a classic.</li>
            <li>Most people are not familiar with Fracas..</li>
            <li>People usually compliment it, but all you really need is the toilet water to get the full benefit of this lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance ....not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>Does not last all day, but it is very concentrate and you only need to apply only a couple drops at the time (using more is not recommended).</li>
            <li>well that is the exact same smell this parfume has....</li>
            <li>and I had co workers requesting to be near me all day</li>
            <li>maybe for a granny or an old aunt.....</li>
            <li>This is an old fashioned floral fragrance that reminds me of Hawaii with the aroma of tuberose.</li>
            <li>So I read a bunch of good reviews on this parfume, honestly for me is the worst smell a parfume can have...</li>
            <li>I frankly could care less what she wears so long as it smells OK.  </li>
            <li>How can I obtain the same item, only much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not for a young individual...</li>
            <li>Makes you think of French Bistro&#x27;s and old vamps out of movies.  </li>
            <li>Do you know those old soap bars (big yellow ones)</li>
            <li>If you do not just adore the scent of Gardenia (which I do not unless blended with many other white flowers and only in a small amount) then you will NOT like this fragrance.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Tubereuse Criminelle by Serge Lutens, which is almost Fracas&#x27; opposite--TC is earthy, cold, and dark while Fracas is warm, buttery, and practically seems to wave pom-poms the moment you spray it on.  </li>
            <li> Its such a beautiful fragrance, but smells terrible on me.</li>
            <li> Creates an Intoxicating aroma that lasts quite a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years-unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> A value for the money as just a little goes a long way and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Extremely feminine.</li>
            <li> She loves this fragrance and I shopped this at Neiman&#x27;s and other online stores.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;my little secret\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is not really available in stores these days...</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the moment to take a shower and just take that small off of me....</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> ( I didn&#x27;t say this, it&#x27;s a secret)</li>
            <li> they have to make room for all the celebrity perfumes (unfortunately).    </li>
            <li> It is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and will not purchase it again on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;at</li>

            <li> My wife loves this stuff don&#x27;t why, but that&#x27;s works for me, happy wife Happy life</li>
            <li> Fracas is a big, bold, in-your-face tuberose perfume with notes of gardenia and jasmine.  One spray is plenty.  It can definitely be overpowering.  It&#x27;s a very sensual scent and I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to the office (but everybody&#x27;s got their own opinions on that).  Fracas is hot, not cold.  As such, I can&#x27;t help comparing it to my favorite perfume of all time, Tubereuse Criminelle by Serge Lutens, which is almost Fracas&#x27; opposite--TC is earthy, cold, and dark while Fracas is warm, buttery, and practically seems to wave pom-poms the moment you spray it on.  Just goes to show how one flower can be interpreted in many different ways!      If you like floral perfumes, especially tuberoses, then Fracas is a classic that should be experienced, not simply worn.  Just don&#x27;t apply it with an itchy trigger finger; those in your immediate environs will thank you.</li>
            <li> I ONLY wear Fracas...plain and simple. It is the most wonderful scent available in the perfume industry in my opinion. I have been wearing this for 35 years now. My older sister wore it for 10 years before that. It is not really available in stores these days...they have to make room for all the celebrity perfumes (unfortunately).    Never a week goes by without someone telling me how wonderful I smell (last week it was a waitress who said she liked coming over to the corner I was sitting in because it smelled so good!)....I keep this perfume \\&quot;my little secret\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> What a beautiful fragrance  Full of flowers like jasmine and lilac  As soon as I wore it for the first time, someone noticed it!!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with tuberouse at the moment and this scent makes me happy every time I spritz it! Highly recommend it!</li>

            <li> Shipping was fast! I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of Fracas. It&#x27;s a classic!</li>
            <li> Arrived on Time, everything went well.</li>
            <li> absolutely superb (per my wife!)</li>
            <li> Tuberose, Jasmine, Orange Flower, Lily of the valley, White iris... I smell freesia, too.  But it is somehow beyond floral.  There&#x27;s something elusive there,  that may to be the actual essence that all the white flowers in the world are trying to describe.</li>
            <li> This is so scrummy!.......I wore it to work and I had co workers requesting to be near me all day just so they can take in the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Truly beautiful notes. Extremely feminine.</li>
            <li> So I read a bunch of good reviews on this parfume, honestly for me is the worst smell a parfume can have... Do you know those old soap bars (big yellow ones) well that is the exact same smell this parfume has....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my hand and I couldn&#x27;t wait for the moment to take a shower and just take that small off of me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone might like it... but me... It&#x27;s just not for a young individual... maybe for a granny or an old aunt.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the bottle is kind of really cute, and for now the parfume is just sitting on my shelf only because of the bottle...</li>
            <li> How can I review something as personal as a scent?  This is something I have worn for over 20 years.  Released in the 1940&#x27;s it&#x27;s a wonderful scent and scent is too personal for anyone to recommend one scent to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume over forty years and still find it the most desirable scent I have ever worn.I love it and will continue to use until I no longer have need for it.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the original scent that I have used for 30 years.  I was very disappointed and will not purchase it again on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;at the lower price.</li>
            <li> Creates an Intoxicating aroma that lasts quite a long time! Fairly priced for the real parfum as opposed to toilet water</li>
            <li> The best gardenia and other white flower hues ever made!  Of course, it is from France!</li>
            <li> Take me away.  There is nothing like Fracas.  It makes me happy and will nip a depression in the bud</li>
            <li> Fracas is a beautiful white floral, dominated by tuberose. It&#x27;s a classic scent that&#x27;s quite feminine. A perfume for a pretty spring dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the impression of this scent but not the price, try Sand &amp; Sable by Coty which can be found at estate sales &amp; resale shops. Another similar fragrance is Kim Kardashian. With dominant tuberose notes, I find each of these remarkably similar to Fracas at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I used this fragrence for years in my youth and always loved it.  Forgot about it over the years but something brought it to mind recently. I guess I wanted to recapture that youth and was so pleased when I received it . The fragrance was still the same as I remembered and brings back wonderful memories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fracas as my daily scent for 20 years and I still love it. If you don&#x27;t like florals this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago for my Mom when it was sold at Sephora.  It became my Mom&#x27;s signature scent!  Unfortunately it is no longer sold at Sephora so thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> What can I say, been my go to sexy ,seductive perfume for years now. ( I didn&#x27;t say this, it&#x27;s a secret)</li>
            <li> What can I say? I have been wearing Fracas for 35 years and I still adore it. Not for everyone but so distinctive.</li>
            <li> Great! Have had it before... Love it.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister in law for her birthday, she has been wearing this perfume for years.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance ....not heavy at all.  Smells like I just got of the tub. Like I&#x27;ve used a nice soap.People ask me all the time, what am I wearing.  Most people are not familiar with Fracas..that&#x27;s ok by me, I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else.</li>
            <li> It is my signature perfume.</li>
            <li> I find this fragrance to be a classic. Hard to find in the stores. Glad you had it for me.</li>
            <li> My mother requested this as a gift.  It smell great, and she always wants more.  I do not consider it cheap, but it last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this Eau de Parfum, so it was no suprise that I still loved it.  It arrived well-packaged on time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It is too expensive. How can I obtain the same item, only much cheaper.</li>
            <li> A beautiful fragrance I could no longer find in retail stores. I always go to AMAZON for most anything I&#x27;m looking for and can more often than not, find it.</li>
            <li> This is pure Tuberose Smell, a lengendary flower very powerful used for the creation of  the most prestige Perfumes in France, \\&quot;The Nest of the Best Perfumes indeed\\&quot;\\&quot;. I bought it because My Father used to love this scent...and it brings nice memories to me...(tear in my face). Does not last all day, but it is very concentrate and you only need to apply only a couple drops at the time (using more is not recommended). Very unique and different smell compare to others so it is perfect if you do not like to smell \\&quot;like everybody in Town\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have worn Fracas for over 35 years.  Everyone comments on the great smell.  People have stopped me and asked if I am wearing Fracas.  The price was very good and the delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> This is an old fashioned floral fragrance that reminds me of Hawaii with the aroma of tuberose. This fragrance gets comments as it&#x27;s not one that is worn by many. It&#x27;s pleasant and calming. Start by using sparingly - the fragrance does mellow after it blends with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Intoxicating aroma. It is fabulous. Very clean and floral.</li>
            <li> It is not about me, my wife likes it so I do.  I frankly could care less what she wears so long as it smells OK.  I gather that Ms. Martha Stewart wears this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, it has the old fashioned, 40&#x27;s scent, sort of heavy, musky.  Makes you think of French Bistro&#x27;s and old vamps out of movies.  At any rate, the wife prefers it so that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Mother- in-law loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of someone else.  I had not tried the scent.  I am sure on someone else it is fabulous, but it doesn&#x27;t work on my chemistry.</li>
            <li> So yummy....and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Bought this as  a gift, great price and nice extras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years-unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder to find. Happy to have a place to buy it. People usually compliment it, but all you really need is the toilet water to get the full benefit of this lovely scent.</li>
            <li> This smells only of Gardenia.  Strong, strong gardenia.  Overpowering Gardenia scent.  I love many of the &#x27;older&#x27; fragrances...Chanel #5, Arpege, etc.  So I thought I would try this.  Big mistake.  If you do not just adore the scent of Gardenia (which I do not unless blended with many other white flowers and only in a small amount) then you will NOT like this fragrance.  It&#x27;s like the THOR of gardenia fragrance.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned. I just wish the scent lasted longer on me. It fades too fast. My mom does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would smell the same on me as it did another lady. Well it don&#x27;t. Its such a beautiful fragrance, but smells terrible on me. So before you buy maybe go check out samples at your local perfume shop. Because its not always the same on everyone.</li>
            <li> This sweet, flowery perfume is amazing! It lasts without being overbearing; highly recommended! Thanks to Neiman Marcus for introducing me to this perfume!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of fresh gardenias, this is the perfume for you!  It also smells like the Hawaiian plumeria flower.  I spray it in my hair and the scent is still there the next day. A value for the money as just a little goes a long way and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Started wearing fracas 30 years ago and never stopped lovin it. so delicious and so identifiable. It&#x27;s a fragrance that can never be duplicated. You will always be remembered in a very special way, once you wear Fracas.I enjoy unique fragrances but classy. Fracas is your answer. You will always be remembered in a very special alluring way. What a way to begin your romantic year.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my fiance.  She loves this fragrance and I shopped this at Neiman&#x27;s and other online stores.  This was the best price I found.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Had a pleasant experience with seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother because she is in love with this scent, but sadly cant find it in stores anymore.  In my opinion, it can be VERY strong if you put more than 2 sprays (gave me a headahce), but if used lightly, it gives this great floral scent that lasts all day.</li>
