            <li>It was very easy to use and  just as described.</li>
            <li>the rubber end comes out and it seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li>i received image plate m55 instead which is cute</li>

            <li>I plan on buying more plates soon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The Konad plates are also a lot better than BM, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love the plate on this...</li>
            <li>a lot better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>it does take some practice, but fairly easy to do. :)</li>
            <li>This produce is not as easy to use at it seems.  </li>
            <li>Its fun and really easy to use!</li>
            <li>This product came quick!</li>
            <li>If I do it right I can get the most of the nail covered although the image doesn&#x27;t cover  to both sides.</li>
            <li>The Konad is very fun to play with...</li>
            <li>i really enjoy it, this is like for someone who isnt an artist and want some cool designs on their nails.</li>
            <li>However, certain types of nail polish show better than others, but I had fun using it!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use the special polishes</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic with a little practice my nails have a beautiful zebra design.</li>
            <li>The stamper and the plate are really cool.</li>
            <li>You have to use special polish and just the right amount of pressure to make the stamp work.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to all it was an easy transaction and also fast shipping</li>
            <li>I am having lots of fun learning about nail art and this product certainly is making it easy for me.</li>
            <li>shipment also came SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Konad but this product seemed rather easy to use.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it very much.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, guys!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the overall quality.</li>
            <li>But you have to be very dedicated to getting it right the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have several brands of image plates, too, and some of Konad&#x27;s designs are so intricate and delicate, they are just beautiful!  </li>
            <li>It really works for me, which I REALLY doubted when I bought it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I already had the salon express stamper, and it was not picking up the images very well</li>
            <li>I got the double sided stamper which is definitely better for the smaller decals</li>
            <li>I wont be buying more \\&quot;full image\\&quot; plates from Konad due to that problem, but I will buy single image plates.</li>
            <li>This stamper picks up the stamp with no problem, and also stamps it perfectly on your nail - unlike my other one which misses half the edges when picking it up, and then flaking half of the stamped image off of my nail.</li>
            <li>The quality of these Konad plates are good, but the only problem I have is that they are to small to cover my entire thumb nail.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much though because they sent me a double sided stamper instead of the one sided one that is shown.</li>
            <li>, I have heard that MASH was about the same, I absolutely would recommend anyone that is stamping use</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious about Konad stamping and just want to try it out like I did, this little kit is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Still shocked that I got all 3 things for the price of $12.56 and the items came in great condition and faster than I expected.</li>

            <li> My order came in 3 days.... which was shocking for free shipping.</li>
            <li> After buying a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; stamper and being utterly disappointed with the results, I decided to give Konad a try before I wrote off nail stamping completely.</li>
            <li> however the item i received was NOT the one shown in this picture, very disappointed!</li>

            <li> This product came quick! It was exactly as described. i really enjoy it, this is like for someone who isnt an artist and want some cool designs on their nails. it does take some practice, but fairly easy to do. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just how I imagined it. However, certain types of nail polish show better than others, but I had fun using it!</li>
            <li> My order came in 3 days.... which was shocking for free shipping. The Konad is very fun to play with... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing from this seller again. Just to think I was about to spend twice the amount at the actual Konad site.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect set to start with.  You do not need anything (other than polish &amp; remover) to use them. Perfect!</li>
            <li> i received image plate m55 instead which is cute (it&#x27;s a bunch of fruits) but i was expecting m57! I can&#x27;t complain too much though because they sent me a double sided stamper instead of the one sided one that is shown.</li>
            <li> Love the item. It was very easy to use and  just as described. Would recommend to all it was an easy transaction and also fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic with a little practice my nails have a beautiful zebra design. You don&#x27;t have to use the special polishes konad makes which is a plus. A list of polishes that work can be found here [...] and there are also tutorials on how to use this on you tube. I plan on buying more plates soon.</li>
            <li> It really works for me, which I REALLY doubted when I bought it but it does. I got the double sided stamper which is definitely better for the smaller decals</li>
            <li> O My Gosh! I love this stamper! EVEN THOUGH it was not the stamper that is in the picture (I received the double sided one) I still love it! The stamper and the plate are really cool. I just tried them out and I am already getting compliments on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;This shipment also came SUPER fast! I love it. I would recommend this product to EVERYONE! Its fun and really easy to use!</li>
            <li> The item i ordered is the one showed in this picture... however the item i received was NOT the one shown in this picture, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> After buying a &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; stamper and being utterly disappointed with the results, I decided to give Konad a try before I wrote off nail stamping completely.

The Konad plates are also a lot better than BM, in my opinion. Very happy with my purchase, and that I don&#x27;t have to give up on stamping! :D</li>
            <li> These were great for the price! But you have to be very dedicated to getting it right the first time.  Sometimes the patterns don&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says it is.  I think Konad is the best brand for stamping supplies and I use them a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the plate on this...I tested it out and it works perfectly (even without the Konad special polish). I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the stamper though...the rubber end comes out and it seems very cheaply made. I might get another stamper when I can afford it, but I&#x27;ll use this one for now.</li>
            <li> Still shocked that I got all 3 things for the price of $12.56 and the items came in great condition and faster than I expected. A lot of places sell these things separately and my total would have came out to be $20.00+. I&#x27;ll be sure to order from A-VIVA BEAUTY again! Thanks, guys!</li>
