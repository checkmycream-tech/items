    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>which is a very good starter brush.</li>
            <li>Great product!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, easy to use product that cleans without damage.</li>
            <li>but my girl swears by it, so it must be good.</li>
            <li>I read many great things about the Clarisonic systems before I decided to purchase the newest, Aria.</li>
            <li>reviewers may have experienced &amp;#34;the purge.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t say that I have had more breakouts caused by this device.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>I am glad I opened to check the product before I could gift her.</li>
            <li>and I have really enjoyed this purchase.</li>
            <li>Someone who is acne prone would probably get more out of this tool than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite part of the product?</li>
            <li>I love that the brush head isn&#x27;t touching any surface.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, polished, my makeup goes on better</li>
            <li>The acne cleansing brush is also great and provides a richer lather than the sensitive brush while being just as soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like the settings, you can change the rotation speed to 3 speeds and the timer from 1-2 minutes, its extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and would choose it over any similar brand like it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the problem some users experienced is cleanser related and not from the Clarisonic device.</li>
            <li>love this product and if you can afford it then its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I had the Clarisonic original cleaner for 5 years and the battery was not working.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I like the idea of getting my skin thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>The Aria has 3 adjustable speeds to customize your clean based on your skin&#x27;s sensitivity and desired level of cleaning power.</li>
            <li>I really thought this would help my skin more.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow cleansing with a moisturizer, because this thing really gets your skin</li>
            <li>As long as you use it gently (as instructed in the guidelines) and don&#x27;t PUSH it onto your face, the whirring bristles feel like a wonderful massage and really give you a deeper cleaning.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that acne does seem to subside quickly.</li>
            <li>This brush worked great for a few months.  </li>
            <li>It totally sucked to see this kind of cheap product being sold by such so called reputed seller.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I would recommend to anyone, and especially to people who (like me) have sensitive skin and want to clean it deeply but also gently.</li>
            <li>Skin feels velvety soft and clean without dryness.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago and initially, the item worked fine.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful for the three-setting feature.</li>
            <li>I even like the *beep* sound of the magnetic charger when I put the Clarisonic back in place!</li>
            <li>I only used the timer mode on my original</li>
            <li>If warranties are important to you, buy only direct from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>, IT LOOKED LIKE AN OLDER MODELW/ NO CHARGER OR CORD, THE BOX , AND THE PLASTIC CONTAINER</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Aria.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and i received the same copy and pasted response as the first.</li>
            <li>skin has improved in the first 2 weeks, It has helped my acne and overall skin</li>
            <li>Does this cleanser tool do a better job than what I usually do for my skin with my fingertips?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure because I usually don&#x27;t get acne but</li>
            <li>I can say about this device is the price, which is steep, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>Also the smooth black finish doesn&#x27;t show stains.</li>
            <li>I love my clarisonic, ive had it for about a month and a half and have definitely seen a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The product looked old, used and didn&#x27;t have any glossy finish (as mentioned in the product description).</li>
            <li>The effects from this brush is the same as a peeling gel that cost much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I should of been using the system as a young adult.</li>
            <li>I believe the Neutrogena in combination with the Clarisonic is just too much for my face, personally.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THIS LARGER UNIT WAS PACKED IN THIS CONTAINER AND BOX, VERY DISAPOINTED</li>
            <li>and my skin doesn&#x27;t really feel much different.</li>
            <li>My skin was very clogged, especially my nose, it looked like a strawberry with the build up and nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li>After using this my pores are smaller and although the blackheads on my nose are still there they are significantly smaller and my face doesnt seem very oily as it used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always washed my face very well at night, but apparently not well enough.</li>
            <li>No more dirty wash cloth to travel with this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>currently have the sensitive brush head (came with device)</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a deep down clean without being too harsh.</li>

            <li> I find that it&#x27;s sort of harsh on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> am waiting to see how long the brush head lasts.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and brought this going through every similar albeit cheaper version of skin care systems which never did anything.</li>

            <li> found that the Aria helps reduce dry patches on my face, but I think it also depends on the type of cleanser used in conjunction with it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was worried about it irritating my skin, but it&#x27;s actually the opposite.</li>
            <li> Gets deep down and cleans all the dirt off your face.</li>
            <li> ARE FOR A BLACK ARIA, A SMALLER UNIT.</li>
            <li> I have recently - in the past few days - been using some samples of philosophy&#x27;s cleanser and that seems to be helping MAJORLY with the flakiness issue.</li>
            <li> Great concept but terrible design in terms of cleaning and mildew.</li>
            <li> I alternate between a salicylic based cleanser (Clarisonic Acne cleanser) to help get rid of dead skin and a gentler cleanser</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but the product does what it claims.</li>
            <li> My face since purchasing the clarisonic has been transformed from crocodile skin tough to baby&#x27;s bottom soft!  </li>
            <li> I have cheaper facial scrubbers and they turn and at least massage my skin.</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THE BLACK ARIA, WHAT I GOT</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Aria for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> This little machine gets rid of dirt that I didn&#x27;t know was there.</li>
            <li> Its too harsh for my skin i guess.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean behind the brush head</li>
            <li> one small pimple I had seemed to go away within the week after I started this product.</li>
            <li> , i hooked up the charger to the drying stand it takes up hardly any space.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the design is very poor in that it will mildew in the shower after a few months</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for a vibrator and doesn&#x27;t work as well as my wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about trying this out.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I hear all the hype for this and thought it would solve my dry skin problem. All it does is vibrate and does nothing for my dry skin. I have cheaper facial scrubbers and they turn and at least massage my skin. Way too expensive for a vibrator and doesn&#x27;t work as well as my wash cloth. Wish I had known this is all it does. How the others swear by it I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for a friend. I am glad I opened to check the product before I could gift her. The product looked old, used and didn&#x27;t have any glossy finish (as mentioned in the product description). There was also this powder like thing that was caught inbetween the grooves and big time scratches everywhere. It totally sucked to see this kind of cheap product being sold by such so called reputed seller. I so don&#x27;t recommend anyone buying products from this seller. Trust me on this. I have applied for a return and fingers crossed until I get my refund. Sigh!</li>
            <li> I was having issues with my facial complexion, pimples and ingrown hair from shaving.  Since using this product, I have not had any issues at all.</li>
            <li> My face since purchasing the clarisonic has been transformed from crocodile skin tough to baby&#x27;s bottom soft!  No more dirty wash cloth to travel with this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> I had the Clarisonic original cleaner for 5 years and the battery was not working. Got the Aria as a replacement and I really like it. I only used the timer mode on my original so Aria has that also. Like the battery indicator on Aria and the drying stand. Also the smooth black finish doesn&#x27;t show stains. The plink charger works well and gives me a lot of choices on how to charge. Highly recommend the Aria.</li>
            <li> i received this as a gift and emailed the customer service for replacement of brushhead as the bristles came bent out of the box. Email was promptly replied and she asked for my order number. After replying that it was a gift, i received no reply. A week later i sent them another email and i received the same copy and pasted response as the first. Nonsense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using my friend&#x27;s and it made my pore smaller temporarily and did not get rid of a single blackhead. The effects from this brush is the same as a peeling gel that cost much cheaper. This brush also made my skin flake even at the lowest settings. Its too harsh for my skin i guess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and would choose it over any similar brand like it. You just can&#x27;t compare to Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has improved in the first 2 weeks, It has helped my acne and overall skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all my friends.  I should of been using the system as a young adult.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago and initially, the item worked fine. In the last few months it has stopped holding a charge and because I didn&#x27;t buy direct from Clarisonic, they will not honor the warranty. If warranties are important to you, buy only direct from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Aria for a little over a month now. I used the same cleanser I had been using before - Neutrogena. I did not notice any severe breakouts like some users have had but my skin has definitely been dryer/flakier. I believe the Neutrogena in combination with the Clarisonic is just too much for my face, personally. I have recently - in the past few days - been using some samples of philosophy&#x27;s cleanser and that seems to be helping MAJORLY with the flakiness issue. My skin is smooth, polished, my makeup goes on better and I have really enjoyed this purchase. Worth the money, in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THE BLACK ARIA, WHAT I GOT WAS A WHITE CLARISONIC PLUS WITH RED FLOWERS AND BLACK STEMS ON IT, IT LOOKED LIKE AN OLDER MODELW/ NO CHARGER OR CORD, THE BOX , AND THE PLASTIC CONTAINER IT CAME IN ARE FOR A BLACK ARIA, A SMALLER UNIT. I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW THIS LARGER UNIT WAS PACKED IN THIS CONTAINER AND BOX, VERY DISAPOINTED</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about trying this out. I&#x27;ve always washed my face very well at night, but apparently not well enough. This little machine gets rid of dirt that I didn&#x27;t know was there. I have very sensitive skin, so I was worried about it irritating my skin, but it&#x27;s actually the opposite. As long as you use it gently (as instructed in the guidelines) and don&#x27;t PUSH it onto your face, the whirring bristles feel like a wonderful massage and really give you a deeper cleaning. This is a great product that I would recommend to anyone, and especially to people who (like me) have sensitive skin and want to clean it deeply but also gently. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my girl swears by it, so it must be good. Gets deep down and cleans all the dirt off your face.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s sort of harsh on my sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t use it everyday. I am eager to try the brush head when I am through the two that came in the box. I like the idea of getting my skin thoroughly clean. Does this cleanser tool do a better job than what I usually do for my skin with my fingertips? Honestly, I don&#x27;t know for sure and my skin doesn&#x27;t really feel much different. My skin does feel somewhat irritated after use of the Clarisonic but it doesn&#x27;t persist. I am very thankful for the three-setting feature. I can&#x27;t imagine having gotten the model with only one power setting. However, I noticed that acne does seem to subside quickly. I can&#x27;t say for sure because I usually don&#x27;t get acne but one small pimple I had seemed to go away within the week after I started this product. Someone who is acne prone would probably get more out of this tool than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the product? It&#x27;s actually the drying stand. I love that the brush head isn&#x27;t touching any surface. I even like the *beep* sound of the magnetic charger when I put the Clarisonic back in place! It&#x27;s a bit silly of me but definitely boosts the pleasure factor for me. :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful, easy to use product that cleans without damage. Skin feels velvety soft and clean without dryness. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had it a week, and I am beginning to see my skin clearing up. It removes make-up - it passes the white towel test.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to see how long the brush head lasts.</li>
            <li> I really thought this would help my skin more.  I still break out the same as before.  My skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> This brush worked great for a few months.  But the design is very poor in that it will mildew in the shower after a few months and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean behind the brush head and it the product itself.  I always tip it forward so it can drain, and it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Great concept but terrible design in terms of cleaning and mildew.</li>
            <li> This is the second item for me , i use twice a day, my face feel clear skin ,no more dead cell or acne.i really like t.</li>
            <li> I read many great things about the Clarisonic systems before I decided to purchase the newest, Aria. I was skeptical at first, but the product does what it claims. It gives your skin a deep down clean without being too harsh. The Aria has 3 adjustable speeds to customize your clean based on your skin&#x27;s sensitivity and desired level of cleaning power. The included USB charging cable and drying stand are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the Aria helps reduce dry patches on my face, but I think it also depends on the type of cleanser used in conjunction with it. I alternate between a salicylic based cleanser (Clarisonic Acne cleanser) to help get rid of dead skin and a gentler cleanser (Billy Jealousy White Knight) to keep my face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have the sensitive brush head (came with device) which is a very good starter brush. I also have the Deep pore cleansing brush which I alternate every couple days and I believe it does a great job. The acne cleansing brush is also great and provides a richer lather than the sensitive brush while being just as soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers may have experienced &amp;#34;the purge.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t say that I have had more breakouts caused by this device. Perhaps the problem some users experienced is cleanser related and not from the Clarisonic device. Maybe they are not cleaning their brush heads as recommended with antibacterial soap once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Clarisonic Aria I have had fewer breakouts on my face and my skin looks and feels smoother. Be sure to follow cleansing with a moisturizer, because this thing really gets your skin clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can say about this device is the price, which is steep, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and brought this going through every similar albeit cheaper version of skin care systems which never did anything. I love my clarisonic, ive had it for about a month and a half and have definitely seen a difference in my skin. My skin was very clogged, especially my nose, it looked like a strawberry with the build up and nothing seemed to help. After using this my pores are smaller and although the blackheads on my nose are still there they are significantly smaller and my face doesnt seem very oily as it used to. I am hoping with continued use my skin can only get better.&lt;br /&gt;I like the settings, you can change the rotation speed to 3 speeds and the timer from 1-2 minutes, its extremely easy to use. The charge last for almost a week for me and i use it twice a day, i hooked up the charger to the drying stand it takes up hardly any space.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and if you can afford it then its worth every penny.</li>
