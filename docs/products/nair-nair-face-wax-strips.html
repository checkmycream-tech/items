    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>its a shame , because this was an excellent product.</li>
            <li>These wax strips are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for the face and takes the hair off no problem.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>and I love these!!</li>
            <li>I will never buy nair anything again because i&#x27;ve never had good experience with any of their hair removal products.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The idea is to warm and soften the strips between your hands, peel the strips apart and apply them as needed.  </li>
            <li>and I do my own waxing at home,</li>
            <li>Compared to Veet or Sally Hansen that leave wax on your lip, these come off clean, and truly do a remarkable job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to hear about it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite strip</li>
            <li>This one works best for underarms and upper lip.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>When I was no longer able to find them in my rural area I was pleased to be able to order them.  </li>
            <li>Both times I got a full refund, so I&#x27;m not complaining about that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have tried to find a good product on short hair.</li>
            <li>it takes a little practice in the beginning just be sure to rub the strips in between your palms for the recommended time, to warm them up.</li>
            <li>The wax on the strips was dry and wouldn&#x27;t warm up to be usable.</li>
            <li>the product in 5 days and am very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>I figured out that if you wash and dry your face first they work so much better</li>
            <li>and i waxed my whole face to smoothness.  </li>
            <li>Nair face wax strips are awsome, they work better than any other brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>When the product is new, it works very well.</li>
            <li>anyone knows of another product that works as well as this one (when new)</li>
            <li>J warm the strips by slightly heating them over a candle flame (my hands are too cold to do the job), the wax gets nice and soft and voila!</li>
            <li>no hair, no mess!  </li>
            <li>I find the strips to be easier, quicker (no waiting for the wax pot to heat-up) and no mess!</li>
            <li>I received this product within the designated time however you could tell the product was old from the faded and crumpled boxes.  </li>
            <li>The product inside was so old that it just crumbled on the strips.</li>
            <li>This wax type hold on taught, and with 2-3 tries per area, gets it really clean (unless I&#x27;m just extra hairy)</li>
            <li>TO LONG YOU REALLY HAVE TO WASH ALOT TO GET IT ALL TO COME OFF.</li>
            <li>last time I bought it, one of the packages was so old it was discolored (</li>
            <li>Other products tend to not grab much hair unless it&#x27;s longer, or they smear the wax around.</li>

            <li> Old &amp; dried out product.</li>
            <li> It is old and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These strips must be OLD because they are dried out and unusable.  </li>
            <li> other similar wax strips, nothing comes close to it&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> I realized that they were old and dried out!</li>
            <li> It also only removed about half of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely tolerant</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to any woman who doesn&#x27;t like paying for salon waxing every other week.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t get the lip waxing down for some reason.</li>
            <li> there was no wax on the strips and just a peace of dry and yellow non sticky thing was on the strips that was completely useless.</li>
            <li> The wax was all dried up and the strips were unusable.</li>
            <li> I woudn&#x27;t waste money on any nair wax strip.  </li>
            <li> Save your skin and your wallet the trouble.</li>
            <li> These were all dried up.</li>
            <li> All three boxes were dried out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Strips were dried out</li>
            <li> Frustrating waste of money.</li>
            <li> (I work in skin care and am exposed to plain chemicals and products on a daily basis), but even with my hardy epidermis, I got a painful bumpy rash as soon as I pulled off the strip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a home waxing product before, but they can&#x27;t get any worse than this.</li>
            <li> Both gave me a painful and ugly reaction, though I&#x27;ve never experienced adverse effects with any other product.</li>
            <li> I tried to remove some hair with the small portion of visible tackiness, nothing, no hair was removed!!!  </li>
            <li> I would be wary of buying these anymore because it appears to me that the product is discontinued and if you see it for sale, they&#x27;re probably old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that was not the case with my order.</li>
            <li> The face wax strips were fake.</li>
            <li> I ignored all the bad feedback until i ordered this and tried it.</li>
            <li> hate this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I tried to use these wax strips.  </li>
            <li> absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I was so ticked and disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Totally worthless!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Old &amp; dried out product.</li>
            <li> absolutely horrible. I used to buy this all the time from the stores until it got discontinued. I ignored all the bad feedback until i ordered this and tried it. It is old and a waste of money. the was sticks to your face even after heating it up with a hair dryer which i never had to do before. they are just trying to get rid of whatever stock they have. its a shame , because this was an excellent product. I now go to the salon to have any removal done.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice now from Amazon (different sellers) because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else. Both times the product was \\&quot;expired\\&quot;. The wax was all dried up and the strips were unusable. Both times I got a full refund, so I&#x27;m not complaining about that.&lt;br /&gt;But I would be wary of buying these anymore because it appears to me that the product is discontinued and if you see it for sale, they&#x27;re probably old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last time I bought it, one of the packages was so old it was discolored (yellowed with age)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows of another product that works as well as this one (when new) I&#x27;d love to hear about it. I&#x27;ve tried tons of others and  none work as well.</li>
            <li> Bought four boxes of these a couple of weeks ago and used one strip last night and couldn&#x27;t figure out why they looked yellow instead of the regular blue wax. Well, once I warmed them up and pulled them apart I realized that they were old and dried out! And not just that one strip.....ALL FOUR BOXES OF STRIPS!!!!  I was so ticked and disappointed!! This is my favorite strip and I thought I was getting a bargain but will NEVER buy then from this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for the face and takes the hair off no problem. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I tried to use these wax strips.  I have used Nair Face Wax Strips for years to remove unwanted chin hair.  When I was no longer able to find them in my rural area I was pleased to be able to order them.  BUT!!  These strips must be OLD because they are dried out and unusable.  The idea is to warm and soften the strips between your hands, peel the strips apart and apply them as needed.  These strips never soften up!  When you try and pull them apart the wax just falls off in chunks!  Totally worthless!</li>
            <li> I woudn&#x27;t waste money on any nair wax strip.  I had been using sally hansen ones, and decided to try something else.  first after rubbing them together the wax split weird and wasn&#x27;t tacky on the whole strip, or on both sides like it said... so i tried another strip and another.... same result.  I tried to remove some hair with the small portion of visible tackiness, nothing, no hair was removed!!!  after my frusturation i went back to my sally hansen strips.  I figured out that if you wash and dry your face first they work so much better and i waxed my whole face to smoothness.  I will never buy nair anything again because i&#x27;ve never had good experience with any of their hair removal products.  I would rather shave than use nair!</li>
            <li> THE WAX STICKS TO YOU TO LONG YOU REALLY HAVE TO WASH ALOT TO GET IT ALL TO COME OFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a home waxing product before, but they can&#x27;t get any worse than this. My skin is extremely tolerant (I work in skin care and am exposed to plain chemicals and products on a daily basis), but even with my hardy epidermis, I got a painful bumpy rash as soon as I pulled off the strip. It also only removed about half of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and Nair cream on the same day. Both gave me a painful and ugly reaction, though I&#x27;ve never experienced adverse effects with any other product. Save your skin and your wallet the trouble.</li>
            <li> Nair face wax strips are awsome, they work better than any other brands that I have tried. I will definetly buy these again.</li>
            <li> These were all dried up. Frustrating waste of money.</li>
            <li> These wax strips are the best on the market.  Compared to Veet or Sally Hansen that leave wax on your lip, these come off clean, and truly do a remarkable job.  J warm the strips by slightly heating them over a candle flame (my hands are too cold to do the job), the wax gets nice and soft and voila! no hair, no mess!  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This was a knockoff product. I have the actually boxes (I&#x27;m running low and can&#x27;t find them in stores) and through comparison I can tell that this product wasn&#x27;t made in the same factory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years&lt;br /&gt;After using it there is no hair growing for 2 weeks at least&lt;br /&gt;Tried other similar wax strips, nothing comes close to it&lt;br /&gt;Got the product in 5 days and am very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great price and I love these!! Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> hate this product. doesn&#x27;t pull all hairs, not even 50%</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now. I do have a wax pot and I do my own waxing at home, but I just can&#x27;t get the lip waxing down for some reason. I find the strips to be easier, quicker (no waiting for the wax pot to heat-up) and no mess! I would recommend these to any woman who doesn&#x27;t like paying for salon waxing every other week. I&#x27;ve only used them on the lip, so I can&#x27;t speak to how they work for eyebrows. Note: it takes a little practice in the beginning just be sure to rub the strips in between your palms for the recommended time, to warm them up.</li>
            <li> I received this product within the designated time however you could tell the product was old from the faded and crumpled boxes.  The product inside was so old that it just crumbled on the strips.</li>
            <li> The wax on the strips was dry and wouldn&#x27;t warm up to be usable.</li>
            <li> Sorry but these don&#x27;t work. Difficult to use. What in the world am I going to do with 3 boxes???? HELP!</li>
            <li> All three boxes were dried out. I couldn&#x27;t use any of the strips. When the product is new, it works very well. Unfortunately, that was not the case with my order.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a good product on short hair. This one works best for underarms and upper lip. Other products tend to not grab much hair unless it&#x27;s longer, or they smear the wax around. This wax type hold on taught, and with 2-3 tries per area, gets it really clean (unless I&#x27;m just extra hairy) I love this product! I</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Strips were dried out</li>
            <li> The face wax strips were fake. there was no wax on the strips and just a peace of dry and yellow non sticky thing was on the strips that was completely useless. I will never ever buy anything from amazon again.</li>
