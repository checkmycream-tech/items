            <li>but I would like to have seen better care taken since I lost a good 1/8 of the tube in the lid.</li>
            <li>She does look really nice with this lipstick on.</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily and though the color is nice .</li>

            <li>but i love  the way it looks....</li>
            <li>Lipstick is good but broke right away</li>
            <li>The color id very rich</li>
            <li>and I think it would look great on anyone with dark hair, as maybe someone with light-hair/complextion it might not be as flattering, since the color is warm.</li>
            <li>She said it goes on smoothly, wears well and was the absolute perfect red for her.  </li>
            <li>Color did not hold Nd was too light</li>
            <li>Feels like a cheap quality..</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this lipstick, so when I did get it, I immediately put it on.</li>
            <li>This is a good shade of red for me.</li>
            <li>Then I thought maybe it&#x27;s because you need a couple coats to get the true color, and I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>The red works perfect for her skintone and shows up as a true blood red.</li>
            <li>they have tons of different shades of red &amp; there lipstick is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>It would work for a drag queen being a bold bright color, but its not my style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, but I personally would like it even deeper.</li>
            <li>Not as red as I&#x27;d liked.</li>
            <li>Rare colour to get.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first because I&#x27;ve always had to go to mac or sephora to get a professional opinion for the best color for my skin.</li>
            <li>you said you NEVER find the right</li>
            <li>I love this color, it is a true blood red to me</li>
            <li>usually don&#x27;t look that great on me.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice, it stays on without dry your lips.</li>
            <li>Because of the \\&quot;Gothic Vintage\\&quot; wording I thought it was going to be pretty vampy</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve stuck with my first instict.  </li>
            <li>It turned kind of pink when it wore off.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and he says it looks hot.</li>
            <li>Some are too pinky magenta and this one is more of a red bordeaux.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that I haven&#x27;t had trouble with it bleeding.  </li>
            <li>but it looks much brighter once its on.</li>
            <li>All I could think was i look like a clown from the 80s when teens put wayyyyyyy too much on.</li>
            <li>just as many of the other reviews state, the color shown, is not how it looks on..</li>
            <li>I read several reviews that said this lipstick came off bright pink instead of red, so at first I passed on it.  </li>
            <li>Whats nice is the cold tone in it, which means you don&#x27;t get engine red or orange red (which I again think is good).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color, Bite Me, is definitely a shade of light red just like the Manic Panic&#x27;s lipstick, Marilyn!!</li>
            <li>My daughter has an extremely light caramel skintone if that helps at all (slightly lighter than Halle Berry).  </li>
            <li>For her 18th birthday I wanted to get her a classic set of breakfast at tiffanys style pearls and a classic red lipstick.  </li>
            <li>This is not so much a BLOOD red.  </li>
            <li>To me when a young lady turns 18</li>
            <li>IT IS DEEP AND INTENSE.</li>
            <li>Not anywhere near the color i thought it would be.</li>
            <li>these are two requirements of style that are absolutely necessary as they are classic, classy and will take you anywhere and everywhere....</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it looked a different color on different skintones.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a good dark red lipstick and this is def dark red for me!</li>
            <li>It really does have a deep magenta color with hot pink at the lip edges; think of how your nails and nailbeds look when you&#x27;re taking off red nail polish--</li>
            <li>The lipstick itself is of fine quality, but it&#x27;s pretty disappointing that the actual product (just looking at it) is a fairly brighter red, and upon application (on me at least, and I have a pretty average skin tone)</li>
            <li>This is my first Manic Panic product, but certainly not the last.</li>
            <li>It looks fine in stick form, but when worn, it is most definitely pink.  :(</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting a deep, dark, BLOOD RED lipstick.</li>
            <li>i saw the other review that it looked hot pink on her.</li>

            <li> I was really looking forward to getting a deep, dark, BLOOD RED lipstick.</li>
            <li> i saw the other review that it looked hot pink on her.</li>
            <li> A proper goth chick&#x27;s makeup bag is not complete without a proper blood red lipstick.</li>
            <li> it looks just like any of the other red lipsticks I have, it&#x27;s not dark at all.</li>
            <li> The only way I&#x27;ve found to avoid the pink factor is to use the bronze/brown-reds, and in the darker shades those lose their redness and just look chocolate brown or deep copper.  </li>
            <li> The color is actually a pinkish color not even red much less blood red...</li>
            <li> but since I wanted a  very dark, deep red / maroon, it is perfect…  for that, but definitely does not look like the color shown (which is how it looks in person)….</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on too long</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s shown me the product won&#x27;t dry out over extended periods.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was a DARK red</li>
            <li> no matter how dark red the polish was--that&#x27;s what color this is.</li>
            <li> Product is a darker red like maroon but works w jeans or dark color cloths.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s liquid enough to run out on the skin a little bit, so you definetly ned lip liner with this.</li>
            <li> Was a little upset that when it arrived the tip had been mashed into the cap which left it without a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; point.</li>
            <li> It did NOT turn pink on me.  </li>
            <li> I really like Manic Panic, but the color description is completely false.  </li>
            <li> This color looks very dark on the picture, but on its just a dark red.</li>
            <li> I am medium to dark Latina woman.  </li>
            <li> not as dark as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Too bad this one looks more like a hot pink when its on :(</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t look dark red.</li>
            <li> I was also looking for this deep, dramatic blod.</li>
            <li> (duh)</li>
            <li> and i thought it was going to look bad on me because i am brown skin and dark colors like this</li>
            <li> Sad sad sad sad day ...</li>
            <li> No complaints with the seller, just disappointed that the picture was a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not a red lipstick at all. It is a burgundy. Not the color I was expecting. Otherwise a nice lipstick.</li>
            <li> Comes off very easily and though the color is nice .</li>
            <li> I was also looking for this deep, dramatic blod. This color looks very dark on the picture, but on its just a dark red. Whats nice is the cold tone in it, which means you don&#x27;t get engine red or orange red (which I again think is good). It&#x27;s a nice color, but I personally would like it even deeper. The consistency is nice, it stays on without dry your lips. But it&#x27;s liquid enough to run out on the skin a little bit, so you definetly ned lip liner with this. This is my first Manic Panic product, but certainly not the last.</li>
            <li> This is not so much a BLOOD red.  I was thinking it was a DARK red but it is not.  It did NOT turn pink on me.  Some of the reds end up turning purple on me but this one did not.  I am medium to dark Latina woman.  Around the skin tone of Eva Mendez.  This is a good shade of red for me. The lipstick itself is of good quality.  It last me through the morning and into the afternoon.  Did have to reapply around 3 or so.  But not a deal breaker for me.  Because of the \\&quot;Gothic Vintage\\&quot; wording I thought it was going to be pretty vampy but I am happy to say that it is good for daywear.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, great colour.  This is a good product that I haven&#x27;t had trouble with it bleeding.  I don&#x27;t get to wear it as often as I like, but it&#x27;s shown me the product won&#x27;t dry out over extended periods.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a good dark red lipstick and this is def dark red for me! i saw the other review that it looked hot pink on her. it could be the skin tone some times that happens.</li>
            <li> The color is actually a pinkish color not even red much less blood red... I still have not even used it after trying it.. But it did come on time* so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to getting a deep, dark, BLOOD RED lipstick. Too bad this one looks more like a hot pink when its on :( Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! I wasn&#x27;t aware it looked a different color on different skintones. On me it&#x27;s sort of a pinkish red. It stays on fairly well, though it does from from food and drink. But seriously I love this brand. I already have two of their colors.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is WAY to fushia colored to ever be considered BLOOD red. Sad sad sad sad day ... when it arrived and it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted or needed.</li>
            <li> Was a little upset that when it arrived the tip had been mashed into the cap which left it without a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; point. The color id very rich and I was happy with that but I would like to have seen better care taken since I lost a good 1/8 of the tube in the lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian with olive, tannish skin. I was a little hesitant at first because I&#x27;ve always had to go to mac or sephora to get a professional opinion for the best color for my skin. This lipstick compliments my skin without even trying. Sexy and sophisticated. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> you said you NEVER find the right red?&lt;br /&gt;well you should try Avon. they have tons of different shades of red &amp; there lipstick is fantastic!!!! it smooth&amp;creamy&amp; depending on what type you get it either matte or glossy!</li>
            <li> Wife swears by it. I have purchased this several times from Amazon for her. She does look really nice with this lipstick on.</li>
            <li> just as many of the other reviews state, the color shown, is not how it looks on.. but since I wanted a  very dark, deep red / maroon, it is perfect…  for that, but definitely does not look like the color shown (which is how it looks in person)…. when on the lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very beautiful color! :)&lt;br /&gt;The color, Bite Me, is definitely a shade of light red just like the Manic Panic&#x27;s lipstick, Marilyn!!</li>
            <li> Lipstick is good but broke right away</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this lipstick, so when I did get it, I immediately put it on. At first, I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t look dark red. So, I put on another layer and it got darker.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the container!! :)</li>
            <li> The lipstick itself is of fine quality, but it&#x27;s pretty disappointing that the actual product (just looking at it) is a fairly brighter red, and upon application (on me at least, and I have a pretty average skin tone) it looks just like any of the other red lipsticks I have, it&#x27;s not dark at all.

            <li> I love the lipstick. I like the deep red color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  For her 18th birthday I wanted to get her a classic set of breakfast at tiffanys style pearls and a classic red lipstick.  To me when a young lady turns 18 these are two requirements of style that are absolutely necessary as they are classic, classy and will take you anywhere and everywhere....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter agreed with me - she loved the pearls and this was the perfect red lipstick for her.  She said it goes on smoothly, wears well and was the absolute perfect red for her.  My daughter has an extremely light caramel skintone if that helps at all (slightly lighter than Halle Berry).  The red works perfect for her skintone and shows up as a true blood red.</li>
            <li> Color did not hold Nd was too light</li>
            <li> Very nice i recommen it</li>
            <li> I read several reviews that said this lipstick came off bright pink instead of red, so at first I passed on it.  Then I thought maybe it&#x27;s because you need a couple coats to get the true color, and I gave it a try.  I should&#x27;ve stuck with my first instict.  It really does have a deep magenta color with hot pink at the lip edges; think of how your nails and nailbeds look when you&#x27;re taking off red nail polish--that magenta stain you get when the polish starts dissolving, no matter how dark red the polish was--that&#x27;s what color this is. Nail polish stain color, and extra coats don&#x27;t help.  This is the same problem I&#x27;ve had with every \\&quot;deep red\\&quot; lipstick I&#x27;ve tried.  The only way I&#x27;ve found to avoid the pink factor is to use the bronze/brown-reds, and in the darker shades those lose their redness and just look chocolate brown or deep copper.  I was hoping this was the answer, but I&#x27;m going to have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Not as red as I&#x27;d liked. It turned kind of pink when it wore off.</li>
            <li> Product is a darker red like maroon but works w jeans or dark color cloths. Doesn&#x27;t stay on too long but I do order this brand alot. I&#x27;m happy w product for price...  The best one is their purple lipstick</li>
            <li> I really like Manic Panic, but the color description is completely false.  It looks fine in stick form, but when worn, it is most definitely pink.  :(</li>
            <li> not as dark as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Feels like a cheap quality..</li>
            <li> I love this color, it is a true blood red to me and I think it would look great on anyone with dark hair, as maybe someone with light-hair/complextion it might not be as flattering, since the color is warm. I&#x27;m in the beauty industry I should know, lol!! ;)</li>
            <li> Rare colour to get. IT IS DEEP AND INTENSE.</li>
            <li> Not anywhere near the color i thought it would be. I was hoping it would be a deeper red, like blood (duh) but it looks much brighter once its on. All I could think was i look like a clown from the 80s when teens put wayyyyyyy too much on. It would work for a drag queen being a bold bright color, but its not my style.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how it feels on my lips....I feel much more sexy.....my lips thank you Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I have always loved manic panic. This is surprisingly creamy and has a good bit of stain. My hubby got this for me and he says it looks hot. A proper goth chick&#x27;s makeup bag is not complete without a proper blood red lipstick. This is a good one. Some are too pinky magenta and this one is more of a red bordeaux. Very happy with this product. Good job,hubby!!</li>
            <li> i Love this lipstick. the looks just like the picture and it  just looks amazing. I&#x27;m a women of color and i thought it was going to look bad on me because i am brown skin and dark colors like this usually don&#x27;t look that great on me. but i love  the way it looks.... i  def recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
