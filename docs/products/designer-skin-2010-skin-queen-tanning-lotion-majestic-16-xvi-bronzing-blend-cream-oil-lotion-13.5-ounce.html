            <li>I will gladly pay $23 though for this instead of the stuff they sell!</li>
            <li>so I bought a lotion that would have smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like silk after tanning and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, after I tanned I was running errands and two people told me I smelled amazing</li>
            <li>This smells amazing</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product works amazing on me.</li>
            <li>It smells great during and after tanning like a light body spray scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works wonders.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money on it again.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion</li>
            <li>Also smell the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference and no orange, which is great!.  </li>
            <li>Also leaves a kind of shimmery look to your skin.. not a greasy look though.  </li>
            <li>I have my own tanning bed in my home, and was tanning without a lotion and not getting any color.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>So this was a nice perfume, feminine type of scent.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice bronze, tan color not orange at all.</li>
            <li>This is real deal and I am completely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li>I smelled great, felt smooth, and the nicest part of all was that, even after a shower, I still felt lightly moisturized!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good one!</li>
            <li>Very smooth on your skin and feels nice</li>
            <li>It does have a stronger smell, but I think it smells nice not like burnt skin like most lotions</li>
            <li>The best  thing about this lotion is how SOFT my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, great, fast tan.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a reasonably priced tanning lotion that works and is good for your skin!  </li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is nice not too strong.</li>
            <li>Great tanning results with super color and smooth luxurious skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this product worked to get me pretty tan!</li>
            <li>The bottle is also cute</li>
            <li>, this was okay putting on, but after baking for some time it smelled like boiled cabbage, e[...]</li>
            <li>I ordered Belleza, hopefully i will have a better experience.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutley LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>love the consistency.</li>
            <li>So, off to Amazon I went to find a better deal, and find one I did.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin soooo smooth!</li>
            <li>It was way more beneficial to my wallet to wait 2-3 days to get the product versus spending $70+ for it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>You are afterall being microwaved. :)</li>
            <li>but it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an okay lotion otherwise, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li>Make sure to have variety of lotions before purchasing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth, smells nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it and the color I&#x27;ve gotten with it.</li>
            <li>i used the entire bottle and must buy more :D</li>
            <li>Love the lotion work greatðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I will get it again, but I like to rotate between lotions I love and lotions I&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have ever put on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love designer skin tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Anyways this bronzer left me smelling good and looking great.</li>
            <li>I go tanning all the time and always spend top $ for all my lotions.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy and will order again.</li>
            <li>It has an oil in it that makes it spread farther and absorb better.</li>
            <li>this one is more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>It is also the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have used.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of using the products I was able to sun tan my sun spots...</li>
            <li>ok let me explain...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am also tanner than my boyfriend who uses Obsidian :-)</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning lotion, I have ordered it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff... way cheaper to buy on here instead of going to your tanning salon.</li>
            <li>It was okay tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I did also get a free sample packet with my purchase which was nice.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes my skin soft with no orange cool like most tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li>This is a great high quality lotion &amp; the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few lotions and haven&#x27;t been impressed by very many until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>This is great for my skin because it&#x27;s so light in the first place.</li>
            <li>Smells good even after tanning, makes your skin super soft, gave me great color.  </li>
            <li>I got good color from just the first use.</li>
            <li>I already have a pretty good tan before I used this</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell as its really strong.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion smells sooo good, and it leaves a good shade after tanning, but i&#x27;ve tried cheaper lotions that have left me even darker.</li>
            <li>Smells great, gives a natural looking glow to your skin and doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
            <li>Beyond just smelling great, it made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>New favorite!!</li>
            <li>wow I was so happy</li>
            <li>It has a beautifully light, lovely scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or scream &amp;#34;indoor</li>
            <li>It smells so elegant and sweet; I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and will make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Smells like old ladies but works great.</li>
            <li>My tan came out nice and golden, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells terribly strong and perfumey ) and feels quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like your wearing a bottle of really strong perfume - help yourself to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I do not think it is too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and the consistency is a bit mor emily than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>it was nice at first</li>
            <li>It is not the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used to get dark, but I will be buying it again just for its moisturizing purposes.</li>
            <li>My skin was glowing after just one use, not to mention I already had a nice bronze color to my skin after the first use alone.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty popular one with my friends who do not like tingles.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s average at best.....</li>
            <li>Someone told me about this lotion being very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The after tan smell is to die for.. Not too strong not too light ..</li>
            <li>lightning quick shipping too :)</li>
            <li>It came so quickly, and so far has been great.</li>
            <li>Great color and results and keeps skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I liked the 16 bronzer, but Im very particular about my smelly lotion</li>
            <li>When I found this for such a great price on Amazon</li>
            <li>The bronzers give great instant color.</li>
            <li>believe the write up said a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I finally stopped paying $85 for it at the tanning salon and started buying it online.  </li>
            <li>goes on silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>but these spots will stay light.</li>
            <li>Quality is just the same and gives you a great bronze and non orange boost to your tan</li>
            <li>, my skin was so soft and I smelled good not like I just went tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and while I&#x27;m utilizing a tanning booth for reasons other than to achieve a sunkissed glow I have to say it makes my legs look amazing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and feminine, the feel is amazing, and the results are just what I was looking for - a genuinely natural looking tan for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend smelled me after I just came back from tanning and playfully commented on how yummy I smelled :) he said he really liked it.</li>
            <li>and so far i love it!</li>
            <li>Use to buy in tanning salon but this is exact product for $30 less - Wonderful!</li>
            <li>Boy, were they Right!  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and makes my skin soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li>all in all a great product that was advertised and shipped as expected.....</li>
            <li>Good delivery time, arrived before the last delivery day.</li>
            <li>It does not darken quickly.....</li>
            <li>I feel a little better about putting that on my skin than silicone, ingredients from nature are more appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Some may not like the smell, but I thought it was a very pretty perfume smell.</li>
            <li>The bronzer in it isn&#x27;t too strong, but after I put it on, I use a towel and try to wipe as much of it off as I can.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, a little strong</li>
            <li>Also I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li>I wont be switching anytime soon, which is a first for me!</li>
            <li>As a former salon owner I used this lotion and fell in love with the way it made my skin feel!</li>
            <li>I previously owned Speed of Light, and that was the best smelly lotion ever, only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it is the quadruple bronzer.</li>
            <li>Used for tanning bed - worked fine and much cheaper than those sold there.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel super soft afterwards with rich color!  </li>
            <li>This gives me a great color just after a few tans.</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>This lotion was recommended by the Tanning Personnel as one of the better bronzers for softness and natural color.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells good, is extra creamy and soft on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic lotion.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried my share of lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>far as better tanning..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and its the only kind I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>With other lotions, I used to smell like burnt pig when I got out of the tanning bed, but with this one I smelled good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel whatsoever, and it has just the right amount of bronzer to notice the color.</li>
            <li>It is bronzing, but it is not a brown colored lotion where you would have to worry about seeing brown streaks on your skin if you didn&#x27;t rub it in right away.</li>
            <li>it is just lotion anyway,, right?</li>
            <li>It got me dark, quick and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>also have very sensitive skin and break out with bumps easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am golden tan and when I&#x27;m darker than my boyfriend who has Native American in his blood, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m more red right now than tan</li>
            <li>This lotion came super fast and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion to try out as a sample, overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty expierenced tanner &amp; have used a variety of lotions before.</li>
            <li>I got here for much cheaper!</li>
            <li>and I smelled like pee after I got out tanning, but I didn&#x27;t my first time.</li>
            <li>I was reading some mixed reviews, but I am glad that I went with this one.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and purchased it at the tanning salon for three times as much as I got it at Amazon!</li>
            <li>The royal bee jelly really does the trick!</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>The lotion got me exteremely tan after the first time even trying it.</li>
            <li>I have used several tanning lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but i didnt get as tan as i wanted good for pale girls i guess,,,</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying tanning lotion online, so I checked with my tanning salon who had the exact same product but for $80, and they also let me compare the smell, color, and consistency to make sure it was the real product because some clients have had that happen.</li>
            <li>But I heard it was good to alternate between different kinds of lotions (bronzers tingles intensifiers)</li>
            <li>I have been using Queen for several years and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>If it was a perfume or regular lotion I would buy it because I enjoy it that much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say the smell is strong and gross.  </li>
            <li>so be smart and dont burn.  </li>
            <li>The silicone based lotions, of which there are many, feel great going on but, later, feel greasy and some are even sticky, and others still will literally roll into tiny dead skin/silicone globs at the insides of my elbows and knees!</li>
            <li>If you apply just enough, you&#x27;ll be fine.    </li>
            <li>This lotion is very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I decided to try it to alternate with my Pheonician by designer skin which by the way is amazing if u arnt looking for a bronzer but want deep tan color.</li>
            <li>There really isnt much bronzer in this lotion</li>
            <li>also didn&#x27;t get much color from it either.</li>
            <li>DS really missed the boat on this lotion..</li>
            <li>This lotion is sold at my tanning salon, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something I may or may not like.</li>
            <li>This product is just like what you&#x27;d buy at a tanning salon - but MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t tan very well.</li>
            <li>I got tan really fast</li>
            <li>I feel it really does the job for bronzing.  </li>
            <li>AND how much color I get from using it.</li>
            <li>haha...  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>The royal bee jelly left my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>no tingle which i really like.</li>
            <li>Its the real stuff... 50$ in my salon</li>
            <li>What I really like about this though is that I don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh after being in the bed.</li>
            <li>I was also in the tanning bed for 15minutes my first time and 20minutes my second, so this product will probably be good for those days where you go in a 15 minute bed or less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything under the bulbs when it comes to indoor tanning lotions, many different bases, different levels of accelerators and bronzers, a few tingles (I&#x27;m not a fan) and I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t come across a lotion yet</li>
            <li>Will continue to use this product as  long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>the smell is decent afterwards....</li>
            <li>It gives you an even and glowing tan with the x 16 Bronzer and leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>Honey and royal jelly are high up on the list of ingredients too.</li>
            <li>but after 2 or 3 bottles I had to stop because the salon prices were too high for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest both these products together.</li>
            <li>highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and this is normally an $80 bottle.</li>
            <li>My friend let me use this lotion, and the first time I was ready to order this product until I tried it a second time</li>
            <li>I used Queen twice or more on my arms and shoulders... for a few sessions.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t kno if this sounds normal</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin very soft, and I get decent color.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Black and really liked it, but when I used the last of it</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li>Item was just as described in new condition.</li>
            <li>The oil based lotions are usually outlawed in tanning salons because they&#x27;re said to crack the acrylic layer you lay on over top of the lights.</li>
            <li>My skin never felt so soft with a tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>the money paid, especially saving so much by not paying the tanning salon prices!</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft!</li>
            <li>I have used Luminary in the past and it was okay,</li>
            <li>makes a big difference in how fast i can tan!</li>
            <li>It gets me very dark very quickly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a positive about this lotion, I&#x27;m not left stinky after tanning like often happens.</li>
            <li>Soft skin and a decent tan (with some redness) is worth finishing this bottle, but definitely not worth buying it again.</li>
            <li>My skin is so amazingly soft too.</li>
            <li>That is the biggest perk, my skin has never been this soft before.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop rubbing my skin and telling me how soft I feel.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves my skin soft and moisturized, not greasy even though it is cream based and contains oils.</li>
            <li>The smell is more perfumy than I prefer but is tolerable and at least you don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too only took a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old sorority girl</li>
            <li>The only problem with it was that it really didn&#x27;t get me any noticeable color.</li>
            <li>I have extremely white skin and can never get really tan from the sun.</li>
            <li>well, they have completely went away</li>
            <li>Natural looking color.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and was just as described...but as far as the product goes....</li>
            <li>and my skin is not dried out.....</li>
            <li>Like some other previous reviews, I am an avid tanning junkie, been tanning 30+ yrs and have tried tons of lotions ranging from the cheap to the costly ones</li>
            <li>It is SOOOO perfumey...and not a good perfume smell...more like an old lady White Diamonds kind of smell (R.I.P Liz).  </li>
            <li>After contemplating for several months on buying a new bottle of lotion (frankly because I was wondering if using lotion made much of a difference), I finally took the plunge and got this one.  </li>
            <li>You also need a real little bit and spreads easy.</li>
            <li>For about 30-45mins post tanning my skin feels like an oil slick, but with that being said after the lotion re-absorbs into the skin it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for me, this product worked.</li>
            <li>I only tan about 1x a week normally.</li>
            <li>Normally when I tan I become a slave to regular lotion, but with this I never dry out.</li>
            <li>, has a fairly light scent, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it but green apple, pear and honey comes to mind</li>
            <li>Helps to achieve a realistic for your skin tone tan while keeping skin moisturized with minimal offensive odor.</li>
            <li>the oil base really leaves your skin moisturized and tan, It also smells REALLY GOOD before and AFTER tanning.</li>

            <li> It smells amazing and works wonders.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money on it again.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion</li>
            <li> Also smell the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I really noticed the difference and no orange, which is great!.  </li>
            <li> Also leaves a kind of shimmery look to your skin.. not a greasy look though.  </li>
            <li> I have my own tanning bed in my home, and was tanning without a lotion and not getting any color.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> So this was a nice perfume, feminine type of scent.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a nice bronze, tan color not orange at all.</li>
            <li> This is real deal and I am completely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I smelled great, felt smooth, and the nicest part of all was that, even after a shower, I still felt lightly moisturized!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good one!</li>
            <li> Very smooth on your skin and feels nice</li>
            <li> It does have a stronger smell, but I think it smells nice not like burnt skin like most lotions</li>
            <li> The best  thing about this lotion is how SOFT my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, great, fast tan.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a reasonably priced tanning lotion that works and is good for your skin!  </li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is nice not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great tanning results with super color and smooth luxurious skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this product worked to get me pretty tan!</li>
            <li> The bottle is also cute</li>
            <li> , this was okay putting on, but after baking for some time it smelled like boiled cabbage, e[...]</li>
            <li> I ordered Belleza, hopefully i will have a better experience.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutley LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> love the consistency.</li>
            <li> So, off to Amazon I went to find a better deal, and find one I did.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> It was way more beneficial to my wallet to wait 2-3 days to get the product versus spending $70+ for it at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> You are afterall being microwaved. :)</li>
            <li> but it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s an okay lotion otherwise, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> Make sure to have variety of lotions before purchasing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth, smells nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it and the color I&#x27;ve gotten with it.</li>
            <li> i used the entire bottle and must buy more :D</li>
            <li> Love the lotion work greatðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I will get it again, but I like to rotate between lotions I love and lotions I&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have ever put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love designer skin tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Anyways this bronzer left me smelling good and looking great.</li>
            <li> I go tanning all the time and always spend top $ for all my lotions.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy and will order again.</li>
            <li> It has an oil in it that makes it spread farther and absorb better.</li>
            <li> this one is more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> It is also the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of using the products I was able to sun tan my sun spots...</li>
            <li> ok let me explain...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am also tanner than my boyfriend who uses Obsidian :-)</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion, I have ordered it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... way cheaper to buy on here instead of going to your tanning salon.</li>
            <li> It was okay tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> I did also get a free sample packet with my purchase which was nice.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and makes my skin soft with no orange cool like most tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li> This is a great high quality lotion &amp; the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few lotions and haven&#x27;t been impressed by very many until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> This is great for my skin because it&#x27;s so light in the first place.</li>
            <li> Smells good even after tanning, makes your skin super soft, gave me great color.  </li>
            <li> I got good color from just the first use.</li>
            <li> I already have a pretty good tan before I used this</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell as its really strong.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells sooo good, and it leaves a good shade after tanning, but i&#x27;ve tried cheaper lotions that have left me even darker.</li>
            <li> Smells great, gives a natural looking glow to your skin and doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
            <li> Beyond just smelling great, it made my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> New favorite!!</li>
            <li> wow I was so happy</li>
            <li> It has a beautifully light, lovely scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or scream &amp;#34;indoor</li>
            <li> It smells so elegant and sweet; I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and will make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Smells like old ladies but works great.</li>
            <li> My tan came out nice and golden, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells terribly strong and perfumey ) and feels quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like your wearing a bottle of really strong perfume - help yourself to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I do not think it is too strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and the consistency is a bit mor emily than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> it was nice at first</li>
            <li> It is not the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used to get dark, but I will be buying it again just for its moisturizing purposes.</li>
            <li> My skin was glowing after just one use, not to mention I already had a nice bronze color to my skin after the first use alone.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty popular one with my friends who do not like tingles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s average at best.....</li>
            <li> Someone told me about this lotion being very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The after tan smell is to die for.. Not too strong not too light ..</li>
            <li> lightning quick shipping too :)</li>
            <li> It came so quickly, and so far has been great.</li>
            <li> Great color and results and keeps skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I liked the 16 bronzer, but Im very particular about my smelly lotion</li>
            <li> When I found this for such a great price on Amazon</li>
            <li> The bronzers give great instant color.</li>
            <li> believe the write up said a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I finally stopped paying $85 for it at the tanning salon and started buying it online.  </li>
            <li> goes on silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> but these spots will stay light.</li>
            <li> Quality is just the same and gives you a great bronze and non orange boost to your tan</li>
            <li> , my skin was so soft and I smelled good not like I just went tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and while I&#x27;m utilizing a tanning booth for reasons other than to achieve a sunkissed glow I have to say it makes my legs look amazing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and feminine, the feel is amazing, and the results are just what I was looking for - a genuinely natural looking tan for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend smelled me after I just came back from tanning and playfully commented on how yummy I smelled :) he said he really liked it.</li>
            <li> and so far i love it!</li>
            <li> Use to buy in tanning salon but this is exact product for $30 less - Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Boy, were they Right!  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and makes my skin soooooooo soft.</li>
            <li> all in all a great product that was advertised and shipped as expected.....</li>
            <li> Good delivery time, arrived before the last delivery day.</li>
            <li> It does not darken quickly.....</li>
            <li> I feel a little better about putting that on my skin than silicone, ingredients from nature are more appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Some may not like the smell, but I thought it was a very pretty perfume smell.</li>
            <li> The bronzer in it isn&#x27;t too strong, but after I put it on, I use a towel and try to wipe as much of it off as I can.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, a little strong</li>
            <li> Also I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li> I wont be switching anytime soon, which is a first for me!</li>
            <li> As a former salon owner I used this lotion and fell in love with the way it made my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I previously owned Speed of Light, and that was the best smelly lotion ever, only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it is the quadruple bronzer.</li>
            <li> Used for tanning bed - worked fine and much cheaper than those sold there.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel super soft afterwards with rich color!  </li>
            <li> This gives me a great color just after a few tans.</li>
            <li> Well worth</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by the Tanning Personnel as one of the better bronzers for softness and natural color.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smells good, is extra creamy and soft on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic lotion.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried my share of lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> far as better tanning..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and its the only kind I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> With other lotions, I used to smell like burnt pig when I got out of the tanning bed, but with this one I smelled good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel whatsoever, and it has just the right amount of bronzer to notice the color.</li>
            <li> It is bronzing, but it is not a brown colored lotion where you would have to worry about seeing brown streaks on your skin if you didn&#x27;t rub it in right away.</li>
            <li> it is just lotion anyway,, right?</li>
            <li> It got me dark, quick and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> also have very sensitive skin and break out with bumps easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am golden tan and when I&#x27;m darker than my boyfriend who has Native American in his blood, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m more red right now than tan</li>
            <li> This lotion came super fast and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to try out as a sample, overall it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty expierenced tanner &amp; have used a variety of lotions before.</li>
            <li> I got here for much cheaper!</li>
            <li> and I smelled like pee after I got out tanning, but I didn&#x27;t my first time.</li>
            <li> I was reading some mixed reviews, but I am glad that I went with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and purchased it at the tanning salon for three times as much as I got it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> The royal bee jelly really does the trick!</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> The lotion got me exteremely tan after the first time even trying it.</li>
            <li> I have used several tanning lotions and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> but i didnt get as tan as i wanted good for pale girls i guess,,,</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying tanning lotion online, so I checked with my tanning salon who had the exact same product but for $80, and they also let me compare the smell, color, and consistency to make sure it was the real product because some clients have had that happen.</li>
            <li> But I heard it was good to alternate between different kinds of lotions (bronzers tingles intensifiers)</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen for several years and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> If it was a perfume or regular lotion I would buy it because I enjoy it that much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say the smell is strong and gross.  </li>
            <li> so be smart and dont burn.  </li>
            <li> The silicone based lotions, of which there are many, feel great going on but, later, feel greasy and some are even sticky, and others still will literally roll into tiny dead skin/silicone globs at the insides of my elbows and knees!</li>
            <li> If you apply just enough, you&#x27;ll be fine.    </li>
            <li> This lotion is very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I decided to try it to alternate with my Pheonician by designer skin which by the way is amazing if u arnt looking for a bronzer but want deep tan color.</li>
            <li> There really isnt much bronzer in this lotion</li>
            <li> also didn&#x27;t get much color from it either.</li>
            <li> DS really missed the boat on this lotion..</li>
            <li> This lotion is sold at my tanning salon, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something I may or may not like.</li>
            <li> This product is just like what you&#x27;d buy at a tanning salon - but MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> that I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t tan very well.</li>
            <li> I got tan really fast</li>
            <li> I feel it really does the job for bronzing.  </li>
            <li> AND how much color I get from using it.</li>
            <li> haha...  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> The royal bee jelly left my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> no tingle which i really like.</li>
            <li> Its the real stuff... 50$ in my salon</li>
            <li> What I really like about this though is that I don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh after being in the bed.</li>
            <li> I was also in the tanning bed for 15minutes my first time and 20minutes my second, so this product will probably be good for those days where you go in a 15 minute bed or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the bulbs when it comes to indoor tanning lotions, many different bases, different levels of accelerators and bronzers, a few tingles (I&#x27;m not a fan) and I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t come across a lotion yet</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product as  long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> the smell is decent afterwards....</li>
            <li> It gives you an even and glowing tan with the x 16 Bronzer and leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Honey and royal jelly are high up on the list of ingredients too.</li>
            <li> but after 2 or 3 bottles I had to stop because the salon prices were too high for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest both these products together.</li>
            <li> highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and this is normally an $80 bottle.</li>
            <li> My friend let me use this lotion, and the first time I was ready to order this product until I tried it a second time</li>
            <li> I used Queen twice or more on my arms and shoulders... for a few sessions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kno if this sounds normal</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin very soft, and I get decent color.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Black and really liked it, but when I used the last of it</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning</li>
            <li> Item was just as described in new condition.</li>
            <li> The oil based lotions are usually outlawed in tanning salons because they&#x27;re said to crack the acrylic layer you lay on over top of the lights.</li>
            <li> My skin never felt so soft with a tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> the money paid, especially saving so much by not paying the tanning salon prices!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used Luminary in the past and it was okay,</li>
            <li> makes a big difference in how fast i can tan!</li>
            <li> It gets me very dark very quickly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a positive about this lotion, I&#x27;m not left stinky after tanning like often happens.</li>
            <li> Soft skin and a decent tan (with some redness) is worth finishing this bottle, but definitely not worth buying it again.</li>
            <li> My skin is so amazingly soft too.</li>
            <li> That is the biggest perk, my skin has never been this soft before.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop rubbing my skin and telling me how soft I feel.</li>
            <li> The lotion leaves my skin soft and moisturized, not greasy even though it is cream based and contains oils.</li>
            <li> The smell is more perfumy than I prefer but is tolerable and at least you don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too only took a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old sorority girl</li>
            <li> The only problem with it was that it really didn&#x27;t get me any noticeable color.</li>
            <li> I have extremely white skin and can never get really tan from the sun.</li>
            <li> well, they have completely went away</li>
            <li> Natural looking color.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and was just as described...but as far as the product goes....</li>
            <li> and my skin is not dried out.....</li>
            <li> Like some other previous reviews, I am an avid tanning junkie, been tanning 30+ yrs and have tried tons of lotions ranging from the cheap to the costly ones</li>
            <li> It is SOOOO perfumey...and not a good perfume smell...more like an old lady White Diamonds kind of smell (R.I.P Liz).  </li>
            <li> After contemplating for several months on buying a new bottle of lotion (frankly because I was wondering if using lotion made much of a difference), I finally took the plunge and got this one.  </li>
            <li> You also need a real little bit and spreads easy.</li>
            <li> For about 30-45mins post tanning my skin feels like an oil slick, but with that being said after the lotion re-absorbs into the skin it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for me, this product worked.</li>
            <li> I only tan about 1x a week normally.</li>
            <li> Normally when I tan I become a slave to regular lotion, but with this I never dry out.</li>
            <li> , has a fairly light scent, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it but green apple, pear and honey comes to mind</li>
            <li> Helps to achieve a realistic for your skin tone tan while keeping skin moisturized with minimal offensive odor.</li>
            <li> the oil base really leaves your skin moisturized and tan, It also smells REALLY GOOD before and AFTER tanning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce a dark color as quickly as some lotions, but it does get you dark!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands major orange like some other tanning lotions would.</li>
            <li> The over all texture of my skin feels better after having used this product, and it isn&#x27;t an artificial effect like the one I get with a silicone based lotion.</li>
            <li> just not wild about the scent</li>
            <li> and it is not going to be around for long</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the lotion left me a little stinky after 10+ minutes in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It smells like bad cheap cologne; I walked out of the salon smelling like a 13 year old boy,</li>
            <li> (Of course I didn&#x27;t tan every single day, but you get my point.)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get anything to get me darker, i switched beds, laid outside, used oil and salt water, and I didnt like black</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a tanner &amp; I just wanted to try tanning for a month</li>
            <li> Also, absolutely no after tan smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no tanning after smell what so ever, smells like you are wearing perfume, heavenly.</li>
            <li> had absolutely no problems with this turning my hands orange either.</li>
            <li> Pair this with PINK lotion after you shower, and your skin will feel like silk.</li>
            <li> Not really that I do not like it,</li>
            <li> I dont like vanilla scents, or to smell like an apple pie or other foods.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived before the due date.</li>
            <li> but I have very minimal color....</li>
            <li> I am very pale white and this lotion has allowed me to achieve the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives me the dark color I was looking for without any orange color or streaking.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this has made my color dark</li>
            <li> If you hate the way most tanning lotions smell, there is a chance you might like this.  </li>
            <li> , I love the look, hate that the color washes off when showering.</li>
            <li> Not watered down like a salon</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t break out my skin like some of the other silicon lotions!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using this lotion as well as a few other lotions in a rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been using it a lot because I&#x27;m still iffy about the risks, but I do notice a slight color.</li>
            <li> I used this twice and already notice a slight difference</li>
            <li> and I feel slightly sticky for a little while after tanning, but that fades after about half an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Its a little oily</li>
            <li> Compared to the bottle sold on the shelf at my tanning salon, this stuff seems a little runny.</li>
            <li> but i did get alot of color after a few uses</li>
            <li> After tanning a few times with it</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion after debating over a few.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday tanner, maybe just a few times per week</li>
            <li> so now I don&#x27;t look pale &amp; dead.</li>
            <li> im naturally pale as that guy from the movie powder.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit thick feeling</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been tanning in beds for the past two years in preparation for summer in Colorado.</li>
            <li> I have used it the past two days</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> i usually tan in the morning and run my errands</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this lotion isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m VERY pale.)</li>
            <li> Now the reason I cannot give this a 5 star is because I have one complaint.</li>
            <li> If you layer it on evenly and not too thick, the smell won&#x27;t be overbearing.</li>
            <li> and its not too thick...</li>
            <li> sometimes people get confused on what sun spots are, well the ones im talking about at least....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy it again to get my summer base tan started.</li>
            <li> I was really not happy with Show Stopper (a hollywood tans product)</li>
            <li> It does work (I have been complimented on my tan after only going once or twice a week for the past month, but the smell is AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> I can barely wait two hours to shower this stuff off, and my boyfriend hated the smell.  </li>
            <li> This lotion was really thick and left my skin greasy and the smell was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak or have that orangy fake look either.</li>
            <li> I myself found it to have a &amp;#34;skin-so-soft&amp;#34; smell, almost like a weird cologne.  </li>
            <li> and that makes me sad.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion and found out that it is fake!</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Queen!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell like the nasty \\&quot;just went</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it was nice at first but i didnt get as tan as i wanted good for pale girls i guess,,,</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is wonderful! If I burn using another product I can put this on an it rehydrates my skin. Also I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most fragrances. This lotion is an exception. Though this is purfumed, and smells great, it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. Instead it seems to repair any damage to it. It is not the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used to get dark, but I will be buying it again just for its moisturizing purposes. Normally when I tan I become a slave to regular lotion, but with this I never dry out.</li>
            <li> Good delivery time, arrived before the last delivery day. I&#x27;m not much of a tanner &amp; I just wanted to try tanning for a month so I bought a lotion that would have smelled amazing. It does &amp; there is no burnt smell after i&#x27;m done tanning. I&#x27;m prone to burning befor I get tan so I&#x27;m more red right now than tan but i did get alot of color after a few uses so now I don&#x27;t look pale &amp; dead. There really isnt much bronzer in this lotion so it doesn&#x27;t turn your hands major orange like some other tanning lotions would. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again to get my summer base tan started. The bottle is also cute so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have a home tanning bed and tried several different lotions.  This lotion gives me the dark color I was looking for without any orange color or streaking.  I love this lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I swear by Designer Skin products, they are the ONLY tanning lotions I will ever use. I used to use Black and really liked it, but when I used the last of it I wanted to try something new. Someone told me about this lotion being very good for dry skin. There was no way I was going to pay $70 at the tanning salon, so I bought it here for a fraction of the price. It came so quickly, and so far has been great. I got good color from just the first use. It does have a stronger smell, but I think it smells nice not like burnt skin like most lotions leave your skin smelling like. My skin is so amazingly soft too. I would recommend this product to my friends, and would purchase again once this is gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to try out as a sample, overall it&#x27;s okay. I liked the 16 bronzer, but Im very particular about my smelly lotion, this was okay putting on, but after baking for some time it smelled like boiled cabbage, e[...] I previously owned Speed of Light, and that was the best smelly lotion ever, only thing i didn&#x27;t like about it is the quadruple bronzer. Get something else if you are picky about lotion smelling weird/nasty. I ordered Belleza, hopefully i will have a better experience.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  The smell is mild and pleasant.  I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say the smell is strong and gross.  I love the smell.  The best  thing about this lotion is how SOFT my skin feels after using it.  Also, absolutely no after tan smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered designer skin bronzing sun tan lotion and I love it!!! I love ordering things from amazon. com!! All their stuff is the best!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty expierenced tanner &amp; have used a variety of lotions before. This lotion was really thick and left my skin greasy and the smell was AWFUL! It smells like bad cheap cologne; I walked out of the salon smelling like a 13 year old boy, it was gross... also didn&#x27;t get much color from it either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lotion to anyone. DS really missed the boat on this lotion..</li>
            <li> I am not an experienced tanner so when the lady at the salon suggested this product I trusted in her and paid big bucks for it. After tanning a few times with it I noticed I was darker but thats also what a tanning bed will do to you. It smells pretty good and makes my skin soooooooo soft. That is the biggest perk, my skin has never been this soft before. My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop rubbing my skin and telling me how soft I feel. I liked it but I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money on it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning so I haven&#x27;t been using it a lot because I&#x27;m still iffy about the risks, but I do notice a slight color. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutley LOVE this lotion. My skin feels like silk after tanning and the smell is amazing. The oil in it is not oily at all and if it didnt have the word in the title you would not even know its there, so no worry about being greasy or leaving residue on your clothes or the tanning bed. It gets me very dark very quickly. I wont be switching anytime soon, which is a first for me! You will love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and this is normally an $80 bottle. I got here for much cheaper! The lotion works awesome and smells great!</li>
            <li> love the consistency. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell as its really strong. However, after I tanned I was running errands and two people told me I smelled amazing lol that&#x27;s never happened before. This ones a keeper. Nice lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is sold at my tanning salon, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on something I may or may not like. So, off to Amazon I went to find a better deal, and find one I did. I love this product! I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it smelling differently and it leaves my skin soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> Love the product, great price</li>
            <li> This product is just like what you&#x27;d buy at a tanning salon - but MUCH cheaper. It was way more beneficial to my wallet to wait 2-3 days to get the product versus spending $70+ for it at the tanning salon. I tanned for 5 weeks and still have quite a bit left in the bottle. (Of course I didn&#x27;t tan every single day, but you get my point.) My only gripe is that the lotion left me a little stinky after 10+ minutes in the tanning bed. I guess this happens with any lotion though. You are afterall being microwaved. :)</li>
            <li> Has great color . . just not wild about the scent</li>
            <li> I actually bought this in the salon (DEFINITELY should have bought on Amazon!) but it smells fantastic! I don&#x27;t smell like the nasty \\&quot;just went tanning\\&quot; scent. It gives some color (not a ton.. but it&#x27;s only 16x and I&#x27;m VERY pale.) The lotion leaves my skin soft and moisturized, not greasy even though it is cream based and contains oils. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty good one! Recommended.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells sooo good, and it leaves a good shade after tanning, but i&#x27;ve tried cheaper lotions that have left me even darker. My friend let me use this lotion, and the first time I was ready to order this product until I tried it a second time and I smelled like pee after I got out tanning, but I didn&#x27;t my first time. I was also in the tanning bed for 15minutes my first time and 20minutes my second, so this product will probably be good for those days where you go in a 15 minute bed or less. If you are picky about smells, I don&#x27;t recommend. But it&#x27;s an okay lotion otherwise, but there are better out there. Make sure to have variety of lotions before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years, but I am not loyal to any particular brand of tanning lotion.  Queen was recommended by one of the girls at my salon.  It does work (I have been complimented on my tan after only going once or twice a week for the past month, but the smell is AWFUL.  It is SOOOO perfumey...and not a good perfume smell...more like an old lady White Diamonds kind of smell (R.I.P Liz).  I can barely wait two hours to shower this stuff off, and my boyfriend hated the smell.  Soft skin and a decent tan (with some redness) is worth finishing this bottle, but definitely not worth buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the bulbs when it comes to indoor tanning lotions, many different bases, different levels of accelerators and bronzers, a few tingles (I&#x27;m not a fan) and I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t come across a lotion yet that I like as much as this one. The silicone based lotions, of which there are many, feel great going on but, later, feel greasy and some are even sticky, and others still will literally roll into tiny dead skin/silicone globs at the insides of my elbows and knees! The oil based lotions are usually outlawed in tanning salons because they&#x27;re said to crack the acrylic layer you lay on over top of the lights. For whatever reason, this one isn&#x27;t. And, I&#x27;ve got to say, it&#x27;s fantastic! Hours after I tanned, I still didn&#x27;t have that rubber sweat funk I&#x27;ve gotten from 99.9% of the silicone based lotions I&#x27;ve used. My skin felt moisturized, not coated in a layer of grease or plastic. I smelled great, felt smooth, and the nicest part of all was that, even after a shower, I still felt lightly moisturized! The over all texture of my skin feels better after having used this product, and it isn&#x27;t an artificial effect like the one I get with a silicone based lotion. The fragrance is light and feminine, the feel is amazing, and the results are just what I was looking for - a genuinely natural looking tan for my skin tone. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion after debating over a few. I was reading some mixed reviews, but I am glad that I went with this one. I&#x27;ve heard and seen good things about royal jelly. Honey and royal jelly are high up on the list of ingredients too. I feel a little better about putting that on my skin than silicone, ingredients from nature are more appealing to me. This lotion goes on smooth, smells nice, has a fairly light scent, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to describe it but green apple, pear and honey comes to mind ( I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells terribly strong and perfumey ) and feels quite moisturizing. My boyfriend smelled me after I just came back from tanning and playfully commented on how yummy I smelled :) he said he really liked it. That&#x27;s a positive about this lotion, I&#x27;m not left stinky after tanning like often happens. It is a little bit thick feeling and I feel slightly sticky for a little while after tanning, but that fades after about half an hour or so. I&#x27;m satisfied with it and the color I&#x27;ve gotten with it.</li>
            <li> Great color and results and keeps skin super soft. New favorite!! Also smell the smell is nice. Not watered down like a salon will tell you they are when you buy online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and purchased it at the tanning salon for three times as much as I got it at Amazon! It gives you an even and glowing tan with the x 16 Bronzer and leaves your skin very soft! Best tanning lotion I have EVER used!</li>
            <li> I got this off my wishlist, I like this lotion it has no silicone in it and the oil base really leaves your skin moisturized and tan, It also smells REALLY GOOD before and AFTER tanning. You also need a real little bit and spreads easy.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and i use it all the time! i definitely noticed a change in my color when i started using this. i used the entire bottle and must buy more :D</li>
            <li> This has to be the VERY BEST tanning lotion I have ever used! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy after 30 days of tanning! It&#x27;s the only product I will use from now on!</li>
            <li> This lotion came super fast and was exactly what I was looking for. I am looking forward to doing business with again!!!</li>
            <li> I have used a ton of different tanning lotions. Bronzing, silicone, tingling, etc. I guess you could call me an experienced tanner. I used Queen because I had always wanted to try it and heard that it was really good. My skin never felt so soft with a tanning lotion! The royal bee jelly really does the trick! It gives you beautiful color, too. Some may not like the smell, but I thought it was a very pretty perfume smell. If you layer it on evenly and not too thick, the smell won&#x27;t be overbearing. If you apply just enough, you&#x27;ll be fine.    My skin didn&#x27;t look or feel greasy either!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion,it&#x27;s great smelling, even after tanning. I&#x27;m fair skinned and legs don&#x27;t tan very well. I really noticed the difference and no orange, which is great!.  Well worth the money paid, especially saving so much by not paying the tanning salon prices!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion work greatðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Queen 5 stars. It got me dark, quick and smells pretty good. I will get it again, but I like to rotate between lotions I love and lotions I&#x27;ve never tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I started using Queen about 1 year ago but after 2 or 3 bottles I had to stop because the salon prices were too high for me. When I found this for such a great price on Amazon I was ecstatic. I&#x27;m not an everyday tanner, maybe just a few times per week and this will give me a glow that will last in between tans and even if I miss a session or two. The smell is also a plus. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Queen!!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin/burn easily and I&#x27;ve been tanning in beds for the past two years in preparation for summer in Colorado. I&#x27;ve tried a few lotions and haven&#x27;t been impressed by very many until I tried this one. It&#x27;s the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have ever put on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel whatsoever, and it has just the right amount of bronzer to notice the color. This is great for my skin because it&#x27;s so light in the first place. The smell is SPECTACULAR and even smells good after tanning. Buy this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by the Tanning Personnel as one of the better bronzers for softness and natural color.  Boy, were they Right!  It makes your skin feel super soft afterwards with rich color!  It also didn&#x27;t break out my skin like some of the other silicon lotions!  The smell is more perfumy than I prefer but is tolerable and at least you don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh afterwards.  Doesn&#x27;t streak or have that orangy fake look either. Glad I found a reasonably priced tanning lotion that works and is good for your skin!  I love it and will reorder this again!</li>
            <li> After contemplating for several months on buying a new bottle of lotion (frankly because I was wondering if using lotion made much of a difference), I finally took the plunge and got this one.  I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun when it comes to tanning lotion.  I LOVE this lotion!!  I used to prefer not to use lotion because I couldnt stand the after smell, this stuff smells great!  Leaves your skin so soft afterwards as well.  Also leaves a kind of shimmery look to your skin.. not a greasy look though.  I highly recommend this product. Its a great price too!  In the store where I tan, it&#x27;s $60 for this bottle of lotion.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. If it was a perfume or regular lotion I would buy it because I enjoy it that much! It is bronzing, but it is not a brown colored lotion where you would have to worry about seeing brown streaks on your skin if you didn&#x27;t rub it in right away. The lotion is a pinkish color. I have my own tanning bed in my home, and was tanning without a lotion and not getting any color. I used this twice and already notice a slight difference and I \\&quot;feel\\&quot; like I&#x27;m getting tan.</li>
            <li> If you hate the way most tanning lotions smell, there is a chance you might like this.  I myself found it to have a &amp;#34;skin-so-soft&amp;#34; smell, almost like a weird cologne.  I am going back to using &amp;#34;Tao&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Worship Me.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product and great price I got tan really fast would deff recommend people to use it it smells great to</li>
            <li> I love designer skin tanning lotions. This gives me a great color just after a few tans. Not orange and the smell is nice. k</li>
            <li> I worked in a tanning salon and would recommend this to all of my clients. Great for outdoor tanning as well. Smells great, gives a natural looking glow to your skin and doesn&#x27;t stain!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on amazon last week and it came in yesterday. I have used it the past two days and so far i love it! Really! Im not a fan of bronzers, I love the look, hate that the color washes off when showering. But I heard it was good to alternate between different kinds of lotions (bronzers tingles intensifiers) and I decided to try it to alternate with my Pheonician by designer skin which by the way is amazing if u arnt looking for a bronzer but want deep tan color. Anyways this bronzer left me smelling good and looking great. I already have a pretty good tan before I used this but Queen has made my skin way darker in just two days! No streaks and no orange. Will continue to use 2x a week and Pheonician 2x a week. I highly suggest both these products together.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in a high-end tanning salon, and this lotion retailed for $60-80.  The bronzer is great, but the botanical extracts that provide moisture for your skin are the best part.  This lotion smells good, is extra creamy and soft on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, fantastic lotion.  Best that I&#x27;ve ever used! And trust me- I&#x27;ve used TONS of indoor tanning lotions!</li>
            <li> I go tanning all the time and always spend top $ for all my lotions. I was really not happy with Show Stopper (a hollywood tans product) so I tried a packet of Queen.....wow I was so happy, my skin was so soft and I smelled good not like I just went tanning. I was going to buy the bottle from the salon but I could not see spending another $90. I found it on this website for a great price. Shipping was fast too only took a week. Overall very happy and will order again.</li>
            <li> You get a nice hydration a l ong with a great looking color</li>
            <li> Love the smell!!! It smells wonderful and makes my skin soft with no orange cool like most tanning lotions do.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning indoors for many years, and this is the best tanning lotion I have ever used.  It has an oil in it that makes it spread farther and absorb better. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but the product works great!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> i like the color i got in one 12 minute bed session with tanning from this lotion but i can&#x27;t get past the smell. it smells like an intoxicating perfume. i usually tan in the morning and run my errands so when ever i caught whiff of myself i wanted to go home and shower. probably won&#x27;t use again</li>
            <li> This product works amazing on me. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect! The same quality as the bottles I&#x27;ve bought at the salon.  To me, Queen has always smelled like &amp;#34;tanning.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for any girl who loves tanning but hates the smell or feel of tanning lotions. It has a beautifully light, lovely scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or scream &amp;#34;indoor tanning lotion&amp;#34;. Beyond just smelling great, it made my skin so soft! My skin was glowing after just one use, not to mention I already had a nice bronze color to my skin after the first use alone. I&#x27;m a 20 year old sorority girl so I&#x27;ve tried my share of lotions and this is by far my favorite.Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My tanning salon sells this product for around $70. This is a great high quality lotion &amp; the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for the price.  I feel it really does the job for bronzing.  Leaves the bed a bit oily after, but it is an oil based lotion.  Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using Queen for several years and it&#x27;s my absolute favorite. I love how soft it makes my skin feel AND how much color I get from using it. Will continue to use this product as  long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I bought this after Shine was discontinued.  Some indoor tanning lotions smell too fruity or like coconut...this one is more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;As far as better tanning..I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It has given me a great bronze color very quickly! It smells great during and after tanning like a light body spray scent. I am very pale white and this lotion has allowed me to achieve the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Looked at all the reviews and thought hey, why not. It smells really good, a little strong but it goes away. Very smooth on your skin and feels nice; no streaks. The only problem with it was that it really didn&#x27;t get me any noticeable color. :/</li>
            <li> When I was at my darkest.. (ppl said angel stop tanning!!!)  I needed to get my arms to catch up to the rest of me. im naturally pale as that guy from the movie powder.  so it works. lol  I couldn&#x27;t get anything to get me darker, i switched beds, laid outside, used oil and salt water, and I didnt like black (my tan washed off with black)and yes i got skin cancer if you&#x27;re wondering...so be smart and dont burn.  always use lotion!  i quit tanning after that for a year .. now just here and there for sun as i work third and suffer from seasonal.  Sooo.  I used Queen twice or more on my arms and shoulders... for a few sessions.  I seen a huge difference in my arms and the rest of my body that i used beautifully brown on.  My arms got darker, and felt softer, almost silky i guess...  And the smell was awesome.  I dont like vanilla scents, or to smell like an apple pie or other foods.  So this was a nice perfume, feminine type of scent.  I like it a lot.  Just dont want to dish out the money for it haha...  it is just lotion anyway,, right?</li>
            <li> Use to buy in tanning salon but this is exact product for $30 less - Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I rotate between many lotion and this one has great skin care which is very important for a great tan. The bronzers give great instant color. This is a pretty popular one with my friends who do not like tingles. I do like tingles however, but this stays in my rotation for the skin care and the bronzers.</li>
            <li> Great product song fragrance which I love</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin very soft, and I get decent color.  It just makes me smell like a hospital!</li>
            <li> As a former salon owner I used this lotion and fell in love with the way it made my skin feel! I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Like some other previous reviews, I am an avid tanning junkie, been tanning 30+ yrs and have tried tons of lotions ranging from the cheap to the costly ones and I must say this stuff is incredible. Absolutely no tanning after smell what so ever, smells like you are wearing perfume, heavenly. Great tanning results with super color and smooth luxurious skin. Item arrived before the due date. I will purchase again because I know this is a 2010 product and it is not going to be around for long and that makes me sad.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like your wearing a bottle of really strong perfume - help yourself to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the write up said a light citrus scent. Nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;Took 2 washes with soap, water and scrubbing to rid my skin of the horrid smell.</li>
            <li> My Favorite!!!!  I was so happy when I finally stopped paying $85 for it at the tanning salon and started buying it online.  Nice smell, great, fast tan.</li>
            <li> I have extremely white skin and can never get really tan from the sun. I started tanning on February 13 and have been going 3-4 times a week and let me just say that I am tanner than I have ever been! I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for me, this product worked. I would recommend using this lotion as well as a few other lotions in a rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this lotion isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t horrible. Its also not overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had absolutely no problems with this turning my hands orange either. The bronzer in it isn&#x27;t too strong, but after I put it on, I use a towel and try to wipe as much of it off as I can.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion and found out that it is fake! The bottom of the bottle was opened and resealed with something else. It is not tanning lotion because there are no results!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion a few months ago and it came in fast and the bottle was sealed. It smells soo good! If it were a perfume id buy it lol. Its a little oily but it worked well and my tan did last a while.</li>
            <li> The lotion got me exteremely tan after the first time even trying it. I love the smell and I do not think it is too strong. With other lotions, I used to smell like burnt pig when I got out of the tanning bed, but with this one I smelled good. It gave me a nice bronze, tan color not orange at all. It did not break my skin out either.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best smelling lotion I have used - even after I get out of the tanning bed. It is also the most moisturizing tanning lotion I have used. My skin has never been so soft! Pair this with PINK lotion after you shower, and your skin will feel like silk. It doesn&#x27;t produce a dark color as quickly as some lotions, but it does get you dark! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this lotion. It seems to be very good and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> goes on silky and smooth. I have fair skin and this product worked to get me pretty tan! Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. Im really big on smells and I dont like to smell like a fruit or chocolate or any food. This smells really good! like perfume! and its not too thick... it also did help me with burning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!! After about 2 weeks of using the products I was able to sun tan my sun spots... ok let me explain... sometimes people get confused on what sun spots are, well the ones im talking about at least.... There not the ones that are like blotches on ppls faces there the ones that no matter what you do everything thing else will tan on your body but these spots will stay light. Well I thought I would always have them... on my upper stomach and my lower back... I even started wearing different bathing suits to hide them on my stomach... well, they have completely went away I have even skin tone! I don&#x27;t kno if this sounds normal but I used to be jealous of woman with even skin tone. But kno I put this on and go and tanning and I have an even skin tone!! FYI I used to tan indoors before and still would have white spots...</li>
            <li> The royal bee jelly left my skin smooth and hydrated. My tan came out nice and golden, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described in new condition. Shipment arrived within good time. I love this product. It smells amazing and works wonders. Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> This lotion is AMAZING!!! The after tan smell is to die for.. Not too strong not too light .. Just PERFECT. Now the reason I cannot give this a 5 star is because I have one complaint. For about 30-45mins post tanning my skin feels like an oil slick, but with that being said after the lotion re-absorbs into the skin it feels silky smooth. I love it!!</li>
            <li> i have used this product before buying it at a tanning salon but the salon went out of business.  good thing i checked on line.  love it.</li>
            <li> Used for tanning bed - worked fine and much cheaper than those sold there.</li>
            <li> Helps to achieve a realistic for your skin tone tan while keeping skin moisturized with minimal offensive odor. I&#x27;m fair skinned and while I&#x27;m utilizing a tanning booth for reasons other than to achieve a sunkissed glow I have to say it makes my legs look amazing. Natural looking color.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> I have used several tanning lotions and this is my favorite. It smells so elegant and sweet; I get many compliments. I am also tanner than my boyfriend who uses Obsidian :-) We tan for the same amount of time. I have used Luminary in the past and it was okay, but this is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am golden tan and when I&#x27;m darker than my boyfriend who has Native American in his blood, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Not really that I do not like it, just not what I was looking for. The fragrance is very nice though.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and was just as described...but as far as the product goes....it&#x27;s average at best.....the smell is decent afterwards....and my skin is not dried out.....but I have very minimal color....It does not darken quickly.....I was wanting a quicker darker tan.....It did not leave the orange streaks and that it is a big plus.....I would use again as a maintaining lotion...but not for my developing lotion....all in all a great product that was advertised and shipped as expected.....</li>
            <li> great lotion, much better price on the internet then at the salon (OMG). Lotion smells good and dont feel like you need to run home and take a shower.</li>
            <li> It has a really great bronzer, but it leaves me feeling oily. I probably won&#x27;t order this product again.  I have seen good results from the product.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it goes on soooo smooth :)</li>
            <li> makes a big difference in how fast i can tan! nice smell and works great...no tingle which i really like. highly recommended...lightning quick shipping too :) A+++ purchase</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells good even after tanning, makes your skin super soft, gave me great color.  This was my first time buying tanning lotion online, so I checked with my tanning salon who had the exact same product but for $80, and they also let me compare the smell, color, and consistency to make sure it was the real product because some clients have had that happen. This is real deal and I am completely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion, I have ordered it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... way cheaper to buy on here instead of going to your tanning salon. Quality is just the same and gives you a great bronze and non orange boost to your tan</li>
            <li> I use to b sooo white. This stuff works great and will make your skin so soft. Its the real stuff... 50$ in my salon so u cant beat the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years and its the only kind I&#x27;ll use. I don&#x27;t start tanning until a month before spring and using this lotion,  going twice a week I will have a perfect tan in a month.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and break out with bumps easily. I never break out with this lotion!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, great consistency, and works well!</li>
            <li> It was okay tanning lotion.  The smell is strong and the consistency is a bit mor emily than I prefer.  Good for winter skin I guess.</li>
            <li> Compared to the bottle sold on the shelf at my tanning salon, this stuff seems a little runny. Not too bad. It definitely does the job, and it also smells identical to the $80 bottle they sell, just seems thinner. I will gladly pay $23 though for this instead of the stuff they sell!</li>
            <li> I only tan about 1x a week normally. I can&#x27;t say this has made my color dark however it has definitely maintained it. What I really like about this though is that I don&#x27;t smell like burning flesh after being in the bed. The smell of the lotion is nice not too strong. I did also get a free sample packet with my purchase which was nice. I have yet to use it though.</li>
            <li> Smells like old ladies but works great. Super fast shipping too.</li>
