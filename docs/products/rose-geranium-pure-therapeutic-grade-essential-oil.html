            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great oil.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells great</li>
            <li>Was great to use in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li>Another great oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps ticks away.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re sold out lol.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>It smells great and is safer than the chemicals and toxins.  </li>
            <li>so I am really satisfied!!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>We all smelled pleasant though!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Share anything good here.  </li>
            <li>smells really good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>I also tried putting a drop on the horse&#x27;s forehead, mane and rump to keep away the flies, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the chemically horse fly spray.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good condition, it just didn&#x27;t do what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li>, it is save to use no side affects, smells good too.</li>
            <li>it is a good oil.</li>
            <li>And the house smells lovely!</li>
            <li>It sure works for us!</li>
            <li>So glad we found it!</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>I make my own body wash and shampoo and ordered this oil to use to scent it.</li>
            <li>well, it made her smell nice</li>
            <li>so decided to try out rose geranium.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since biblical times rose geranium has been used to protect premises from malicious mischief.  </li>
            <li>Item came fast and I love the smell!!!</li>
            <li>but once I had it in hand &amp; able to use it I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It’s very easy and inexpensive for a company to have its employees, friends, and the hired hands of writers buy hundreds or thousands of its products and write glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell</li>
            <li>very strong smell</li>
            <li>Bought it to use as an aid against ticks, so far its working great!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK by me...</li>
            <li>I also dab a bit of this oil on me...behind the ears, on my wrists and on my ankles...and the bugs leave me alone for the most part.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews it seems to work for most people.</li>
            <li>Love putting this with jasmine in my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I bought some as a tick preventative for my dog after seeing so many glowing reviews..</li>
            <li>she&#x27;d get just as many as before.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best out there if you need it for repelling ticks.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love it, let&#x27;s hope it keeps the ticks away on my Staffy</li>
            <li>I feel much better about this than using chemicals.</li>
            <li>Still not 100% sure it repels ticks, but I rubbed it on my arms in the park one evening when I saw mosquitoes lurking about and not one landed on me.  </li>
            <li>and they had been having many tick problems.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>geranium is a deliciously scented essential oil.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Before applying the rose geranium oil, I bathed my dogs with a flea and tick shampoo and checked them over thoroughly to ensure a clean start.</li>
            <li>As always,  company has quick service and oil is top notch!</li>
            <li>Well it works pretty good</li>
            <li>gentle, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Worked at keeping the ticks restless and moving on top of the coat for easy removal.</li>
            <li>but for me it was too strong smelling.</li>
            <li>Just love the aroma of this fine oil, just after shower I apply my cream or a oil carrier and apply few drop of this oil on my body and feel wonderful and relax.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden has always given me amazing oils and honestly i have never been let down in the least but the rose geranium is the best i&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li>It has a strong floral scent, not a bad smell but should be diluted because it is strong.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of everything Edens Garden makes, but they really this one right, and for a good price given the quality.  </li>
            <li>Five star reviews, real or invented, pay off handsomely in the end.  </li>
            <li>I was turned on to it by the website Primallyinspired and could not have been more excited about a natural solution to the tick problems we experience.</li>
            <li>this smells amazing and last forever.  </li>
            <li>I am especially liking a kind of &amp;#34;Garden Roses&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;which is almost similar to rose.</li>
            <li>just a dab on dog/cat&#x27;s back of neck and  dab on your own wrists and according to this lady she has not seen one tick on her dog</li>
            <li>right were</li>
            <li>After ordering 2 bottles of 100% Pure Essential Oil Rose Geranium</li>
            <li>I use equal, small amounts of this rose geranium, neroli (Miracle Botanicals), and rose damascena (the 55$/5ml one from abroad, I&#x27;ll correct to name as soon as I can; when I&#x27;ve gone too cheaply on this one</li>
            <li>Tried it on myself first..</li>
            <li>I use this in my homemade body lotion, and the first time I applied it, I could not stop smelling my arms and hands; I was a walking bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, there are plenty of  manufacturers of natural products you can rely on, and perhaps rose geranium oil is effective in other applications, but in my experience, elimination of ticks is definitely not one of them.</li>
            <li>No ticks so far (only been a week), but they also smell nice.</li>
            <li>The smell of the oil was literally like stepping into a garden full of lush blooming flowers and just inhaling the scent.</li>
            <li>The painful reality, though, is that you can be duped by what you believe to be an honest, benign natural products manufacturer’s scheme just as easily as if it were a fly-by-night company—even more easily because these manufacturers cannot legally claim their products effectiveness in any use.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have consistently applied the Eden’s Garden Rose Geranium drops DAILY as instructed on the aforementioned website for a week, and I can tell you, it has had no effect whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>reasonably priced and it works.</li>
            <li>This is not irritating to my skin,so no problem in using it to discourage Lyme Disease carriers.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t afford to buy actual rose essential oil, since they cost too much.</li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>Much better than the other geranium</li>
            <li>One drop on the withers and one drop on the back just above the tail in the morning and our three dogs who charge through our woods, meadow and marsh many times each day are protected.</li>
            <li>Or perhaps this is a particularly tick-population-explosive season.</li>
            <li>unlike most of the harsh chemical products...only repels ticks and doesn&#x27;t kill them.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you&#x27;re in an area with only a few it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>(if you think 10ml of any essential oil is worth nearly $30.00 shipped at the time of this writing), but don’t buy it for tick prevention.</li>
            <li>Works really well for us in conjunction with Tickz herbal tick repellent by Petzlife...as good or better than the Frontline</li>
            <li>Finally decided to get smart and buy the 10 ml bottles instead of the 5 ml bottles.</li>
            <li>just a few drops in a diffuser and the room is filled with the smell of roses.  </li>
            <li>Again, I am an outspoken advocate for all natural solutions to all ailments (I don&#x27;t even take aspirin or Tylenol), and I am in no way endorsing Frontline for the reasons I mentioned already.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product a couple of months ago and finally had a friend bring it to me here in the Caribbean where I live with my wife and four dogs.</li>
            <li>We live in deep woods just up the way from Lyme CT.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to repel ticks on my dog, so far in 3 weeks I have removed only 2 ticks!!!  </li>
            <li>not a single tick!</li>

            <li> not a single tick!</li>
            <li> Ok, I think it stinks</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer, I found a tick locked into me behind my knee exactly where I had placed a drop of this oil earlier in that day before going out.</li>
            <li> So I pretty much don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s smelly because I HATE TICKS.</li>
            <li> when Im feeling a little down</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s sure to be artificial and USELESS for controlling ticks.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my neck and the fragrance</li>
            <li> Plus we were reluctantly using the past few years on our heavily tick infested property in the Midwest.</li>
            <li> Count me as another advocate of natural solutions who refuses to use products such as Frontline, not only for lack of desire to inject harsh chemicals with side effects into my pups, but the price of monthly injections is outrageous.  </li>
            <li> I end up with something that smells like my grandma&#x27;s hankies--not bad exactly, but not what I&#x27;m going for.).</li>
            <li> As an experiment in reaction to my disappointment, I placed the ticks near a drop of the oil I applied to a napkin, and the ticks made no motion to retreat.  </li>
            <li> No more poison ie frontline for me.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> only it&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
            <li> They usually feast on me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve adapted to the essential oils way of life because I&#x27;m tired of pouring unnecessary prescription drugs in my body.</li>
            <li> It did take longer to get because the shipping was slow</li>
            <li> No more ticks!!!  </li>
            <li> This unfortunately didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> off a star because it is so damn expensive.</li>
            <li> It an also be worn as a perfume to turn back vicious gossip toward the one who started the rumor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and I also apply it behind the neck and at the base of the tail on my dog.</li>
            <li> Ticks hate it.  </li>
            <li> I put a drop on their collar and one at the base of their tail.  </li>
            <li> APPLIED DROP TO BASE OF NECK AND TAIL REGION</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for ticks, found a tick right were I put the oil on my dog.</li>
            <li> I make my own body wash and shampoo and ordered this oil to use to scent it. I ordered the oil on standard shipping and it arrived in 3 days!! The smell of the oil was literally like stepping into a garden full of lush blooming flowers and just inhaling the scent. I immediately made the body wash and took a shower, I must admit it was heaven and it stayed on me all day! Eden&#x27;s Garden has always given me amazing oils and honestly i have never been let down in the least but the rose geranium is the best i&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Bought it to use as an aid against ticks, so far its working great! Thankyou!</li>
            <li> I just keep on buying this stuff this summer! Finally decided to get smart and buy the 10 ml bottles instead of the 5 ml bottles. Works really well for us in conjunction with Tickz herbal tick repellent by Petzlife...as good or better than the Frontline Plus we were reluctantly using the past few years on our heavily tick infested property in the Midwest. One drop on the withers and one drop on the back just above the tail in the morning and our three dogs who charge through our woods, meadow and marsh many times each day are protected. And the house smells lovely! The only downside is that this product...unlike most of the harsh chemical products...only repels ticks and doesn&#x27;t kill them. So sometimes the ticks ride in on our dogs, later jump off when they decide they don&#x27;t like the ride and then we find them crawling on the carpet. That&#x27;s OK by me...I&#x27;d rather put up with that than poison our dogs. I also dab a bit of this oil on me...behind the ears, on my wrists and on my ankles...and the bugs leave me alone for the most part. If you are looking for a non-toxic way to address the tick problem for your dogs definitely try this. Based on the reviews it seems to work for most people. It sure works for us!</li>
            <li> After ordering 2 bottles of 100% Pure Essential Oil Rose Geranium (yes, 2 bottles because I fell for the advertising hype), what I received was 2 bottles of a nauseating fragrance which seemed to attract ticks rather than repel them. I might concede that regional terrains differ so testimony about the oil&#x27;s effectiveness may differ. Or perhaps I didn&#x27;t use enough of the oil. Or perhaps this is a particularly tick-population-explosive season. All that aside, I regret ordering 2 bottles only to find out it was ineffective for ourselves and our Schnoodle.</li>
            <li> gentle, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Much better than the other geranium I had. Love putting this with jasmine in my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Purchased this to help prevent ticks</li>
            <li> My second bottle, now in their larger size.  I am not a fan of everything Edens Garden makes, but they really this one right, and for a good price given the quality.  I am especially liking a kind of &amp;#34;Garden Roses&amp;#34; blend I make on the spot:  I use equal, small amounts of this rose geranium, neroli (Miracle Botanicals), and rose damascena (the 55$/5ml one from abroad, I&#x27;ll correct to name as soon as I can; when I&#x27;ve gone too cheaply on this one I end up with something that smells like my grandma&#x27;s hankies--not bad exactly, but not what I&#x27;m going for.). Anyway.  Experiment.  Enjoy.  Share anything good here.  I&#x27;ve gotten almost all my best oil info from you guys here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it wa ok but for me it was too strong smelling.</li>
            <li> I bought some as a tick preventative for my dog after seeing so many glowing reviews..well, it made her smell nice but it didn&#x27;t do diddly do as a preventative- she&#x27;d get just as many as before. This year is supposed to be at epidemic levels for ticks in rural southern Illinois. Maybe if you&#x27;re in an area with only a few it&#x27;s effective. Anyway, for those of you with lots of ticks I&#x27;d head to the vets. This unfortunately didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to repel ticks on my dog, so far in 3 weeks I have removed only 2 ticks!!!  Before using this he was coming in every day with several ticks so I am really satisfied!!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great oil. Ticks hate it.  My dogs were getting one to two ticks on them every day. I put a drop on their collar and one at the base of their tail.  No more ticks!!!  Plus it smells great</li>
            <li> Helps with the mosquitoes!</li>
            <li> Just like another reviewer, I found a tick locked into me behind my knee exactly where I had placed a drop of this oil earlier in that day before going out.</li>
            <li> Was great to use in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Just love the aroma of this fine oil, just after shower I apply my cream or a oil carrier and apply few drop of this oil on my body and feel wonderful and relax.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best out there if you need it for repelling ticks. I&#x27;ve tried a couple different brands but this one keeps the bugs away!</li>
            <li> this smells amazing and last forever.  I have bought from other company in past due to cheaper price for more oil but they did not come close to the aroma that Eden,s Garden oil has.  just a few drops in a diffuser and the room is filled with the smell of roses.  when Im feeling a little down I put a few drops on my neck and the fragrance lift my mood.  love it</li>
            <li> Ok, I think it stinks (and my family does, too), but since we&#x27;ve started using this on our wrists and ankles, we haven&#x27;t seen any ticks. So I pretty much don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s smelly because I HATE TICKS. So glad we found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a repellent for ticks on my dog and it works well along with her flea &amp; tick collar. It did take longer to get because the shipping was slow but once I had it in hand &amp; able to use it I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> One drop on the neck and wrist or ankles prevents ticks.  Even works on animals (one drop on neck and on at tip of tail).</li>
            <li> Helps my canine friends repel ticks.</li>
            <li> Item came fast and I love the smell!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I bought it because our dogs were bringing in 9 - 10 ticks a day. Now we have none. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Another great oil from Eden&#x27;s Garden. reasonably priced and it works. I&#x27;ve adapted to the essential oils way of life because I&#x27;m tired of pouring unnecessary prescription drugs in my body. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Amazing..it does what I read about it. Tried it on myself first..then applied it to all my cats and dogs.</li>
            <li> Works fantastically for keeping ticks and Mosquitos away!</li>
            <li> Love it, let&#x27;s hope it keeps the ticks away on my Staffy and she smells beautiful..</li>
            <li> This is not irritating to my skin,so no problem in using it to discourage Lyme Disease carriers.  I feel much better about this than using chemicals.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of months ago and finally had a friend bring it to me here in the Caribbean where I live with my wife and four dogs. I was turned on to it by the website Primallyinspired and could not have been more excited about a natural solution to the tick problems we experience. Count me as another advocate of natural solutions who refuses to use products such as Frontline, not only for lack of desire to inject harsh chemicals with side effects into my pups, but the price of monthly injections is outrageous.  Before applying the rose geranium oil, I bathed my dogs with a flea and tick shampoo and checked them over thoroughly to ensure a clean start. Since then I have consistently applied the Eden’s Garden Rose Geranium drops DAILY as instructed on the aforementioned website for a week, and I can tell you, it has had no effect whatsoever.  In fact, I just pulled out 7 blood-engorged ticks within a three inch radius of where the product was applied on one of my dogs, and 4 ticks in the same area of another.  As an experiment in reaction to my disappointment, I placed the ticks near a drop of the oil I applied to a napkin, and the ticks made no motion to retreat.  Again, I am an outspoken advocate for all natural solutions to all ailments (I don&#x27;t even take aspirin or Tylenol), and I am in no way endorsing Frontline for the reasons I mentioned already.  The painful reality, though, is that you can be duped by what you believe to be an honest, benign natural products manufacturer’s scheme just as easily as if it were a fly-by-night company—even more easily because these manufacturers cannot legally claim their products effectiveness in any use.  It’s very easy and inexpensive for a company to have its employees, friends, and the hired hands of writers buy hundreds or thousands of its products and write glowing reviews. (Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed, and I know how much time you’ve wasted away trying to distinguish what’s realand what’s invented.) Five star reviews, real or invented, pay off handsomely in the end.  Thankfully, there are plenty of  manufacturers of natural products you can rely on, and perhaps rose geranium oil is effective in other applications, but in my experience, elimination of ticks is definitely not one of them. I hope you can see I’ve introduced no bias, nor have I endorsed alternative products in this review. I can say that I actually like the product’s smell.  So buy it for that reason (if you think 10ml of any essential oil is worth nearly $30.00 shipped at the time of this writing), but don’t buy it for tick prevention.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t afford to buy actual rose essential oil, since they cost too much. so decided to try out rose geranium.&lt;br /&gt;which is almost similar to rose. smells really good. just don&#x27;t over use this. thankyou!</li>
            <li> The real thing. We live in deep woods just up the way from Lyme CT.  APPLIED DROP TO BASE OF NECK AND TAIL REGION DAILY ON DOGS. Worked at keeping the ticks restless and moving on top of the coat for easy removal. No more poison ie frontline for me.&lt;br /&gt;Took off a star because it is so damn expensive. But trust me, if your buying this stuff by the ounce and you&#x27;re not paying over $100 then it&#x27;s sure to be artificial and USELESS for controlling ticks.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps ticks away.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell only it&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
            <li> Smells good.  I bought it as a tick repellent for my dogs.  It does not work.  My dogs still have ticks.</li>
            <li> I used a drop on my neck and between my wrists to keep gnats and flies away while riding my horses.  I also tried putting a drop on the horse&#x27;s forehead, mane and rump to keep away the flies, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the chemically horse fly spray.  We all smelled pleasant though!&lt;br /&gt;I also put a drop on the dogs&#x27; nylon dog collars to help ward off ticks.  No ticks so far (only been a week), but they also smell nice.</li>
            <li> Still not 100% sure it repels ticks, but I rubbed it on my arms in the park one evening when I saw mosquitoes lurking about and not one landed on me.  They usually feast on me so I was relieved.</li>
            <li> I use the oil to anoint myself and family.  I add it to scrub water to protect my home from adverse conditions and to reverse misfortune.  Since biblical times rose geranium has been used to protect premises from malicious mischief.  It an also be worn as a perfume to turn back vicious gossip toward the one who started the rumor.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read that it could help with keeping dear ticks off of you, which is a big problem in my yard/area. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work.  I still found ticks on me. It arrived on time and in good condition, it just didn&#x27;t do what I hoped it would do.</li>
            <li> ...on pinterest. This oil is a GREAT flea and tick repellant! just a dab on dog/cat&#x27;s back of neck and  dab on your own wrists and according to this lady she has not seen one tick on her dog and they had been having many tick problems. thought I&#x27;d share since I came here to get some..and they&#x27;re sold out lol. byeeee</li>
            <li> Love this item. Smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this instead of &amp;#34;spot treatments&amp;#34; to keep fleas and ticks off of my dog. It smells great and is safer than the chemicals and toxins.  Just a dab between his shoulder blades.  So far, so good!  My dog doesn&#x27;t spend a lot of time outdoors and I prefer this for protection. I used it on myself and my grandchildren, just dabbing on the backs of our necks, wrists and ankles.  I didn&#x27;t notice any biting insects bothering us during a day at the park.</li>
            <li> As always,  company has quick service and oil is top notch!</li>
            <li> I was told this would keep ticks off your pet and also off of humans.  Well it works pretty good and you do not need a carrier oil, it is save to use no side affects, smells good too.</li>
            <li> it is a good oil. very strong smell</li>
            <li> Wowza. I use this in my homemade body lotion, and the first time I applied it, I could not stop smelling my arms and hands; I was a walking bouquet of flowers. I went to work that day feeling like a goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose geranium is a deliciously scented essential oil. It smells luxurious in lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a tick repellent after purchasing 8-acres of what is basically forest. I put this in a roller vial with a carrier oil (fractionated coconut oil) and apply it to my boots and I also apply it behind the neck and at the base of the tail on my dog. He use to have ticks on him but they never bit but now they don&#x27;t even get on him! not a single tick! So very happy with this! It has a strong floral scent, not a bad smell but should be diluted because it is strong.</li>
