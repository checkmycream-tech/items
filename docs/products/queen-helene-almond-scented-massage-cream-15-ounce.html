            <li>This is by far one of the best creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great product, and worth keeping around the home.</li>
            <li>By far not the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I use this product mostly for my face.  </li>
            <li>better options for massage creams /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of almonds and this cream feels like silk on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I am overall very pleased with this product; It smells great</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend before a nice warm bath.</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy massage product makes body rubdowns very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>A very mild almond scent in the jar which is nice, but fades away quickly.  </li>
            <li>oils are probably available.</li>
            <li>I bought some and it arrived just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday weekend, and it worked out fabulously.</li>
            <li>The Queen Helene Almond Scented Massage Cream is a wonderful product that absolutely soothed my dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I think it is really conditioning my skin because I&#x27;ve noticed  more smooth and toned areas.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It is perfect because it is not messy like massage oils, has a great texture that doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The spa I go to for facial uses this and it smells amazing</li>
            <li>Beside the smell, she says that it&#x27;s left her skin feeling really soft and even has her asking for more massages, and more almond massage cream as well.</li>
            <li>love its result, my skin is very dry and it makes my skin smooth, radiant and healthier after 2 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this ointment to anyone, regardless of whether they are having skin issues or not, this is truly a product that works and does wonders!</li>
            <li>It seems to be greasy but absorbs into the skin if you are in cool air or live in a cooler climate.</li>
            <li>Not only was it great for cuts and scabs and helped in the healing process, but it virtually eliminated all of my dry skin!</li>
            <li>My daughter is a massage therapist and really likes this item for massages</li>
            <li>and I also use it with a special wooden massage tool on my stomach and legs.</li>
            <li>The scent was really subtle- not overpowering like you&#x27;d find at many mall chain stores, and it definitely had better staying power for a massage than a normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it to my feet and have my wife apply it to my shoulders and my skin feels very smooth and hydrated for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>The smell is gorgeous;it leaves the skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Light almond fragrance is soothing and not too harsh.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and really takes care of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this item, unless you have severe dry skin, but I love to massage this into my skin after a shower.</li>
            <li>It had a tendency to cake up a little bit and still too much friction.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use this product mostly for my face.  It goes on smooth and smells awesome.  Leaves you feeling clean. I also use when I want to pamper my wife.  She loves the way it makes her feet and back feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this massage cream for some time now and I am overall very pleased with this product; It smells great (almondy, as you would expect) and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. The texture of the cream is very pleasant and just feels milky and smooth. I usually apply it to my feet and have my wife apply it to my shoulders and my skin feels very smooth and hydrated for the rest of the day. I would absolutely recommend before a nice warm bath.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a massage therapist and really likes this item for massages</li>

            <li> The spa I go to for facial uses this and it smells amazing, I use it to massage my face and then wipe it off with wet cotton pads. Leaves my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> This cream can be used anywhere on the body. The smell is gorgeous;it leaves the skin incredibly soft. Four stars because it is slightly oily for a \\&quot;cream.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best creams I&#x27;ve tried. It smells amazing and leaves skin feeling soft. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily and really takes care of dry skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this every time i get massged and even brought some to my massafpge therapist to use.  She likes it too!  Smells great, works well</li>
            <li> Very good, I use it instead of lotion. Makes skin very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The Queen Helene Almond Scented Massage Cream is a wonderful product that absolutely soothed my dry, cracked skin.

            <li> Transaction was good.  The massage cream itself was not a great cream for massage from my perspective.  It had a tendency to cake up a little bit and still too much friction.  It smelled good, was pleasant, and still usable, but better options for massage creams / oils are probably available.</li>
            <li> Great stuff at Great Prices and delivery !!</li>
            <li> After massaging the skin with this product, skin becomes oily. Does not give good effect on the skin. So this product does not give the results as advertised on amazon website.</li>
            <li> I bought some and it arrived just in time for my wife&#x27;s birthday weekend, and it worked out fabulously. The scent was really subtle- not overpowering like you&#x27;d find at many mall chain stores, and it definitely had better staying power for a massage than a normal lotion.

Great product, and worth keeping around the home.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just lotion, but I do love the smell!</li>
            <li> By far not the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  A very mild almond scent in the jar which is nice, but fades away quickly.  It&#x27;s slightly greasy and I don&#x27;t get the directions \\&quot;Massage a generous amount into skin.  Remove with a wash cloth.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ll stick with BioTone.</li>
            <li> love its result, my skin is very dry and it makes my skin smooth, radiant and healthier after 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  The girl I go to who does my pedicures uses this on me and I just HAD to find it and get it home for myself.  Cheaper than getting luxe brands.  This does what I like - pampers me while moisturizing after a shower.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this item, unless you have severe dry skin, but I love to massage this into my skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> Good massage body cream. It is not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best massage cream I have found. I love the scent of almonds and this cream feels like silk on my skin. It is perfect because it is not messy like massage oils, has a great texture that doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast and last a long time. I use it alone for elbows, neck and hands and I also use it with a special wooden massage tool on my stomach and legs. I think it is really conditioning my skin because I&#x27;ve noticed  more smooth and toned areas. Summer is coming so that is a big bonus ! It&#x27;s a 15 oz jar and the price can not be beat. I have also been using it to remove mascara and on the tip of a cotton swab to erase make up mistakes. It never makes my eyes water ! And the fragrance of Almonds is delicate. perfect.  Thank You QH.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy massage product makes body rubdowns very comfortable.  Light almond fragrance is soothing and not too harsh.  Also leaves a great film of moisture on the skin.</li>
