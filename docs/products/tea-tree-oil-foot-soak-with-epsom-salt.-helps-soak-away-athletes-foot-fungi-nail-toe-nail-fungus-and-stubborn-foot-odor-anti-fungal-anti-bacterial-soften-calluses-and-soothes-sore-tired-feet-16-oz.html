            <li>I tried this foot soak right away because I am so excited to use it already.</li>

            <li>My feet havent felt this good in a long time</li>

            <li>Would Highly Recommend!!</li>

            <li>a whole lot fresher.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I was anticipating a &amp;#34;tingling feeling&amp;#34; due to tea tree being  one of the main ingredients, but I used my bathtub instead of a basin and  more than the recommended one capful, so I may have diluted the salts too much (?).  </li>
            <li>This foot soak has a very pleasant scent and soothed my tired and dry summer feet.</li>

            <li>My only criticism is I wish it scent was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>Wow, heaven in a jar!</li>
            <li>When I soaked my feet after a long days work, my feet feels so relaxed and fresh.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised on how relaxing and invigorating  </li>
            <li>I like that the natural tea tree oil in the crystals is an antibacterial.</li>
            <li>It softened the skin on my heels and made my toenails and cuticles soft and easier to cut.</li>
            <li>This spa like soak can used as a scrub as well!Smells like peppermint, leave skin soft and fragrant.</li>
            <li>I love the product because its not too harsh on your skin, but it definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this, the callouses on my feet were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Feels so nice on my tired, achy tootsies!</li>
            <li>So I was concerned that the Rocky Mountain Essentials Tea Tree Oil Therapeutic Foot Soak would be more irritating than relaxing.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it works for those reasons, however, my tired feel really do feel more relaxed and relaxed after a 15 minute hot foot soak with half a cup of epsom salt.</li>

            <li> The smell is of tea tree oil which I feel is really refreshing especially on tired, hot feet.</li>
            <li> very pleased that the pealing on my feel and the bad smell has all gone away.</li>
            <li> The jar will last for ages because it is so big and so little is needed.</li>
            <li> and I both have dry itchy feet.</li>
            <li> Too the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dominant scent is that of fresh peppermint mixed with faint hints of rosemary and lavender, and is simultaneously soothing and energizing.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day my feet and ankles are so sore because I have fibro and other health issues.</li>
            <li> It has made the swelling in my feet go down during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil in the past and was not blown away by the results.  </li>
            <li> It provided a small amount of tingling, and that is what won me over.  </li>
            <li> i mean who wants to look at scaly dirty looking feet!!</li>
            <li> I use this for my husband for his tired smelly feet.</li>
            <li> Also the tea tree oil helps the broken skin in the feet.</li>
            <li> It also contains Epsom salt which helps with pain and tired muscles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product.  </li>
            <li> It really failed all three.  </li>
            <li> I have very bad eczema on the bottom of my feet and for the 3 night</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this. My fianc&amp;eacute; and I both have dry itchy feet. This helps relieve the itch like nothing else we&#x27;ve tried. We soak our feet in warm to hot water with a capful of this for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be picked to sample this stuff for free!! Well, I paid $1 but close enough. It works awesome! Leaves my feet soft and super relaxed!! I have very bad eczema on the bottom of my feet and for the 3 night I&#x27;ve been using it, my feet are not itchy!!! Thanks for making an awesome quality product, you have a new customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit.  I was skeptical about using this product.  I have used tea tree oil in the past and was not blown away by the results.  I have used it as a disinfectant, acne treater, and fungus remover.  It really failed all three.  But when I stuck my feet in this bath, I thought for sure I was in heaven!  It provided a small amount of tingling, and that is what won me over.  I have used it 6 times since, and my feet feel refreshed and fresh for hours after.  Even in shoes!</li>
            <li> I just ran out of Lavender Epsom Salt so when I was offered a sample of this product at a reduced price, I was very excited. The scent is very strong and smells very authentic and relaxing. I don&#x27;t have any issues with fungus or inflammation so I am not sure if it works for those reasons, however, my tired feel really do feel more relaxed and relaxed after a 15 minute hot foot soak with half a cup of epsom salt. Overall, a good spa like pick me up at home.</li>
            <li> I am such a fan of this Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak. Not only does it come in a great large size it works great. The smell is amazing! and it makes my feet feel wonderful when i take them out from the soak. It is very relaxing!</li>
            <li> Feels so nice on my tired, achy tootsies! It is a nice relaxing treat after a long day on my feet. I got a great price on it and it works wonders for soreness. It also smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Great quality and size for the price.  All very good ingredients and very soothing.  Also good for sinuses if you take a bath in it!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is really good I love how it smells. This is the perfect foot soak. I use this for my husband for his tired smelly feet. I just add this to a bowl with water and let his feet rest. Very good product for the price. Worth it for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of peppermint and eucalyptus is a great combination. Also the tea tree oil helps the broken skin in the feet. It&#x27;s therapeutic and relaxing. It also contains Epsom salt which helps with pain and tired muscles. This also helps as a scrub. I scrub my husband feet and they become smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and relax. Very good aoramtheraphy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample, review and give you my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this last week and my husband and I have used it twice.&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that we I opened the jar the fragrance was beautiful! I have asthma and smells sometimes bother me but not this.  It actually opened my sinuses. We soaked our feet for 15 minutes. It gives a tingling sensation that was relaxing.  It left our feet feeling clean and soft. Will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow, heaven in a jar! That&#x27;s how I would summarize my experience with this awesome Tea Tree Oil Foot Soak! First, I was amazed on how much you get, it&#x27;s a huge 16oz jar indeed! It&#x27;s packaged and sealed nicely, preserving it&#x27;s potency. I thought that it would smell like the strong tea tree oil smell but I was surprised on how relaxing and invigorating  the scent is, and that&#x27;s because of the essential oils that are in this heaven in a jar! The blend scents of peppermint, eucalyptus, tea tree and lavender is a treat to your senses. I feet tend to sweat, even when I&#x27;m wearing open sandals and shoes, and it could get embarrassing. When I soaked my feet after a long days work, my feet feels so relaxed and fresh. My hubby uses this too and very positive that this will benefit him greatly with his nail fungus with continued use. I love this product! Thanks for letting me purchase it a great promotional price to test, try out and review. Would Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> Received this product today early than I expected. Shipping is fast and it has neat and good packaging. I tried this foot soak right away because I am so excited to use it already. My feet feels so smooth and relaxed. Plus! The aroma of the soothing therapeutic soak smells so good and super refreshing. It deodorize your skin and leave your feet feeling fresh and clean. Tea Tree OIl Therapeutic foot soak is a must have! 5 stars from me, happy customer.</li>
            <li> I like to pamper myself with bath and body products so when I got a chance to try this foot soak at a reduced price for review purposes, I jumped on it. This jar is really big and the white crystals are chunky. The smell is of tea tree oil which I feel is really refreshing especially on tired, hot feet. I use just a bit in a bowl of warm water and soak my feet for about 10 minutes. When I am done, they are refreshed, deodorized and even feel softer. I then apply my foot cream and am good to go. The jar will last for ages because it is so big and so little is needed. I like that the natural tea tree oil in the crystals is an antibacterial. It&#x27;s just a really good foot soak and the price is actually very fair for the quality. I absolutely will be purchasing more at full price when I need more. I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Price! Great Seller! Very Fast! I love the product because its not too harsh on your skin, but it definitely gets the job done! It has made the swelling in my feet go down during my pregnancy! I will continue to buy it and use it even after my child is born!</li>
            <li> Got this on discount item with my Honest review opinion food therapy works great upon my foot spa or foot soak i put this and you feel relaxing and smell the scent and best it can wash away you&#x27;re fungus and bacteria. It&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this product to see how you work on my joints</li>
            <li> Okay, so while I like the scent of Tea Tree Oil, it can be a bit overpowering. So I was concerned that the Rocky Mountain Essentials Tea Tree Oil Therapeutic Foot Soak would be more irritating than relaxing. Too the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dominant scent is that of fresh peppermint mixed with faint hints of rosemary and lavender, and is simultaneously soothing and energizing. This is an ideal soak for both chilling in the evening and perking up a draggy day. I don&#x27;t know about its antifungal properties, as I don&#x27;t have any fungus to speak of, but my feel did feel - and smell - a whole lot fresher. That&#x27;s good enough for me. This will be a very nice escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and happier feet are my own.</li>
            <li> I did receive a discount for writing this review.  I love the product it smells good and helps my sore feet.  It makes my feet feel better</li>
            <li> This stuff was really great. The smell is pretty decent and left my feet feeling wonderful. Definitely a good choice after working on my feet all day. After a few weeks of using this, the callouses on my feet were pretty much gone. I&#x27;m almost out, so I&#x27;ll need to order a refill soon. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Please don&#x27;t raise the price!</li>
            <li> Rejuvenating and fresh!</li>
            <li> I love soaking my feet in this smells wonderful feels great</li>
            <li> I got this for discount for review. At the end of the day my feet and ankles are so sore because I have fibro and other health issues. I was excited to give this a try to hopefully help with my stinky feet and help with the cramping. I soaked my feet already a couple of time. The nights that I soak my feet I have no cramping and very pleased that the pealing on my feel and the bad smell has all gone away. This is a great gift for the mother you love so much. This will be something that she will be so happy with.</li>
            <li> works amazing! makes my feet smooth - would recommend!</li>
            <li> recieved this as a review  and loved it My feet havent felt this good in a long time great soaking and feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> Omg I could smell it through the box!  I have plantar fasciitis and by the end of the day my feet are killing me. it was very nice to soak them in a hot tub filled with this great smelling foot soak!</li>
            <li> This foot soak has a very pleasant scent and soothed my tired and dry summer feet. I was anticipating a &amp;#34;tingling feeling&amp;#34; due to tea tree being  one of the main ingredients, but I used my bathtub instead of a basin and  more than the recommended one capful, so I may have diluted the salts too much (?).  It softened the skin on my heels and made my toenails and cuticles soft and easier to cut. My only criticism is I wish it scent was a little more powerful. Good product !</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I LOVE this!! I guess I should say my FEET love this! Such a wonderful scented soak that softens and helps get rid of that awful looking skin on your feet that comes from wearing sandals all summer. I have a thing about my feet..I always want them soft and looking good..i mean who wants to look at scaly dirty looking feet!! Yuck! This Tea Treeoil Foot Soak is the answer to prayer..try it I KNOW you will love it as much as I do. I recieved at a reduced price for my review</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This spa like soak can used as a scrub as well!Smells like peppermint, leave skin soft and fragrant. I soaked for about 20 min and was incredibly relaxed. Would make a great gift.</li>
