            <li>These are the best out there.</li>
            <li>Best beauty product ever.</li>
            <li>works wonderful.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>So the wife says this works great.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice curler - does what you want...</li>
            <li>I received this package in a timely matter and the price was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find something made in America...until I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product because it really does make your eyelashes look more beautiful.</li>
            <li>An old favorite which is still the best.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Delivered in a timely manner :)</li>
            <li>it was much better.</li>
            <li>if it makes a teenage girl happy then it is good.</li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>love it, cheap and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have always used a Maybelline eyelash curler - the older ones were great.</li>
            <li>Flimsy and pretty much good for nothing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when you have a product that really works (and has for years), updates are more detrimental than helpful.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the cheap eyelash curlers in the stores and I am fine using them, but I thought this product was priced great</li>
            <li>For years I have used this particular one and love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would work better than my old one.</li>
            <li>The refills have also changed from the soft rubber to a more updated silicone or gel-type product, which seems to make it necessary to hold the curler longer and with more pressure to get the desired curl.  </li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t come with refills and there are no pads on the finger holes</li>
            <li>Other than that they sent me an air head and coupon in the package which was nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Maybelline eyelash curler for years that works very well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much nicer than the cheaper one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>my daughter had only ever bought the cheap ones at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>The curled eyelashes will last a long time which makes this product even more worth buying.</li>
            <li>The new design?</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised - a simple eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>The box for this product clearly states &amp;#34;MADE IN U.S.A.&amp;#34; but the curler itself says &amp;#34;CHINA.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Either they rub too much against my upper lid and rub my eye shadow off or don&#x27;t curl as well.  </li>
            <li>I have a Max Factor curler in which I was using the old Maybelline white, flat-topped curler pads.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline won&#x27;t listen to their customers and bring back the old pads.</li>
            <li>Although it looks the same, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to produce quite the same results as the old version.  </li>

            <li> I have a Max Factor curler in which I was using the old Maybelline white, flat-topped curler pads.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline won&#x27;t listen to their customers and bring back the old pads.</li>
            <li> Although it looks the same, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to produce quite the same results as the old version.  </li>
            <li> The pad pops out, isn&#x27;t stable, pulls out eyelashes and gives a funky fake looking curl, like a crimp rather than a natural upswept curl - if your lucky enough to even get it to curl.</li>
            <li> The last white pad split, and when I couldn&#x27;t find refill pads at any retailer, I bought this whole new set one thinking it was the same thing - WRONG.  </li>
            <li> It might be similar to other eyelash curlers, but I&#x27;ve only used this one.</li>
            <li> so it hurts your fingers because for some reason you have to really squeeze hard for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read similar complaints on other sites - why don&#x27;t manufacturers listen to their customers?</li>
            <li> This is the kind of curler that always seems to painfully pull a few lashes on the outside of your eye.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is the box came smashed and the black squishy thing on the metal started coming out.</li>
            <li> The former soft white squared edge pads have been replaced with a black hard plastic rounded edge pad that DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> Was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying it because I couldn&#x27;t find the little rubber replacements for my other one (different brand).</li>
            <li> The black squishy lining (not sure what it&#x27;s called, but like, the bumper?) keeps falling out, and no matter what angle I come from it barely makes a dent in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I actually got sent a REVLON EYELASH CURLER IN A MAYBELLINE BOX WITH ONE RUBBER COVERING MISSING!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the Revlon curler nor any other one I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> The black, rounded rubber pads do NOTHING and will not curl my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I like the black rubber -</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Imagine a lady&#x27;s limp handshake; that&#x27;s what this is like.</li>
            <li> This one does not fit the contour of my eye and just will not curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is one of those extremely cheaply-made eyelash curlers on the market that you have to squeeze so hard to curl your lashes.</li>
            <li> The black pad is so hard, it just doesn&#x27;t work to curl lashes.  </li>
            <li> I had one with a spring in the past-</li>
            <li> It is really hard to get it to curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous, why bother making an eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t curl?  </li>
            <li> Dishonest, false advertising by Maybelline.  </li>
            <li> Totally useless, and I&#x27;ve bought a million of these suckers before</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine why a regular eyelash curler would have terrible reviews, and now I know.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it at any price.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this online because anymore, I am unable to find these Maybelline curlers in a drug store.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible buy!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> love it, cheap and very easy to use. Better than the expensive ones from Shu, etc.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> I received this package in a timely matter and the price was a good deal. The packages was in a protective bag.</li>
            <li> So the wife says this works great.  It is what it is, if you need one get it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes only squeezed them.  I&#x27;ve had a Maybelline eyelash curler for years that works very well.  Trying to get an extra but was hoping for one that was engineered to work.  This one was not even engineered to work.  Dissappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the price and the fact that the product is from a trusted brand name. You definitely get what you pay for. It does not curl my eyelashes at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are the best out there.</li>
            <li> It works, eyelashes are curled.</li>
            <li> this curler doesn&#x27;t work. like at all.</li>
            <li> An old favorite which is still the best.</li>
            <li> Ever since Maybelline \\&quot;improved\\&quot; the curler pad design, it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have a Max Factor curler in which I was using the old Maybelline white, flat-topped curler pads.  The last white pad split, and when I couldn&#x27;t find refill pads at any retailer, I bought this whole new set one thinking it was the same thing - WRONG.  The black, rounded rubber pads do NOTHING and will not curl my lashes.  I&#x27;ve read similar complaints on other sites - why don&#x27;t manufacturers listen to their customers?</li>
            <li> The box for this product clearly states &amp;#34;MADE IN U.S.A.&amp;#34; but the curler itself says &amp;#34;CHINA.&amp;#34;  I was thrilled to find something made in America...until I opened the box.  Dishonest, false advertising by Maybelline.  I will be returning this curler.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine why a regular eyelash curler would have terrible reviews, and now I know. Flimsy and pretty much good for nothing. The black squishy lining (not sure what it&#x27;s called, but like, the bumper?) keeps falling out, and no matter what angle I come from it barely makes a dent in my lashes. Imagine a lady&#x27;s limp handshake; that&#x27;s what this is like. Totally useless, and I&#x27;ve bought a million of these suckers before so I know how they should work. I&#x27;ve never paid attention to brands for something as simple as an eyelash curler, but MAYBELLINE YOU BLEW IT.</li>
            <li> Love. Never pulls the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is one of those extremely cheaply-made eyelash curlers on the market that you have to squeeze so hard to curl your lashes. It doesn&#x27;t even work...doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes!  It doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy.  It doesn&#x27;t come with any replacements.  This is the kind of curler that always seems to painfully pull a few lashes on the outside of your eye.  Sorry I purchased it at any price.</li>
            <li> I never got my eyelash curler.!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile &amp; it works well. The only problem is the box came smashed and the black squishy thing on the metal started coming out. Other than that they sent me an air head and coupon in the package which was nice. 😂</li>
            <li> Very nice curler - does what you want... I like the black rubber - it&#x27;s much nicer than the cheaper one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised - a simple eyelash curler.  Delivered in a timely manner :)</li>
            <li> Been using this product for decades!</li>
            <li> Best beauty product ever.</li>
            <li> Was what I expected. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I actually got sent a REVLON EYELASH CURLER IN A MAYBELLINE BOX WITH ONE RUBBER COVERING MISSING! Terrible buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning the one I got, doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!  My lashes just didn&#x27;t curl.  The black pad is so hard, it just doesn&#x27;t work to curl lashes.  Ridiculous, why bother making an eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t curl?  Come on Maybeline.</li>
            <li> works wonderful. curls to perfection. wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this product</li>
            <li> Always buy the Maybelline eyelash curler.  For me it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well. I had one with a spring in the past- it was much better.</li>
            <li> This product seems to have been re-tooled somehow.  Although it looks the same, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to produce quite the same results as the old version.  The refills have also changed from the soft rubber to a more updated silicone or gel-type product, which seems to make it necessary to hold the curler longer and with more pressure to get the desired curl.  Sometimes when you have a product that really works (and has for years), updates are more detrimental than helpful.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Doesn&#x27;t pull on lashes</li>
            <li> I have always used a Maybelline eyelash curler - the older ones were great. The new design? Not a chance. The former soft white squared edge pads have been replaced with a black hard plastic rounded edge pad that DOES NOT WORK! The pad pops out, isn&#x27;t stable, pulls out eyelashes and gives a funky fake looking curl, like a crimp rather than a natural upswept curl - if your lucky enough to even get it to curl. I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline won&#x27;t listen to their customers and bring back the old pads.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would work better than my old one. I was wrong. It is really hard to get it to curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because it really does make your eyelashes look more beautiful. It might be similar to other eyelash curlers, but I&#x27;ve only used this one. I&#x27;ve never used this product but I&#x27;ve seen it being used. The curled eyelashes will last a long time which makes this product even more worth buying.</li>
            <li> my daughter had only ever bought the cheap ones at the dollar store. after a mishap that cut off her eyelashes i bought her this one. she was amazed at the quality. she said it was &#x27;fancy&#x27;. if it makes a teenage girl happy then it is good.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cheap eyelash curlers in the stores and I am fine using them, but I thought this product was priced great and it was Maybelline also so I bought it. First of all it doesn&#x27;t come with refills and there are no pads on the finger holes so it hurts your fingers because for some reason you have to really squeeze hard for it to work. I am throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Wish it had rubber on the handles.</li>
            <li> I bought this online because anymore, I am unable to find these Maybelline curlers in a drug store.  I love this one.  I don&#x27;t care for the Revlon curler nor any other one I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Either they rub too much against my upper lid and rub my eye shadow off or don&#x27;t curl as well.  For years I have used this particular one and love it.  I hope they never discontinue it!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler will not curl my lashes. I ended up buying it because I couldn&#x27;t find the little rubber replacements for my other one (different brand). This one does not fit the contour of my eye and just will not curl my eyelashes. Very disappointed...</li>
