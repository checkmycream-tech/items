            <li> I highly recommend it although the friend who recommended it to me can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too heavy for her hair and makes her hair oily.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that will define my curl w/o making my hair hard and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still need to use my Doo Gro because nothing makes my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown a little about an inch or two in a month</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because my hair was past due for a relaxer and after getting it straightness I haven&#x27;t started again</li>
            <li> I got just the shampoo in the green bottle</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for about the past six months.</li>
            <li> When I used them I saw a small amount of hair growth then bumbs formed on my scalp which turned to scabs and the strands of hair fell out when the scabs fell</li>
            <li> My friend turned me on to the Doo Gro Mega Thick lotion</li>

            <li> It does help my hair grow and makes it thick..</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick and course, this makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin, frizzy, curly hair and my hair</li>
            <li> The Medicated Hair Vitalizer Formula is too heavy on my hair making heat styling very difficult.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for people with excessively frizzy and thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> but that was a bad decision</li>

    <ol>
            <li> my hair has grown a little about an inch or two in a month</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Works great and service was awesome!</li>
            <li> it today which is Received way before estimated delivery date which is December 1st and got today. November 28th. Heard nothing but good things about this product. I have purchased the anti-itch oil for my itchy scalp it works to a degree (no need to use a lot it may cause your scalp to itch severely ) Can&#x27;t wait to see the results from using this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scents and the leave in treatment is completely watery. I thought it would be like a normal conditioner that softens and untangles the hair after shampooing. I had to get something else to do that part. These products really seem to be made for hair growth alone and not keeping your hair easily manageable, soft, and looking nice. The Medicated Hair Vitalizer Formula is too heavy on my hair making heat styling very difficult. If your hair is thick and course, this makes it worse. Using a childrens detangling solution after showering really helped solve that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cakes on to my curling iron and has made my face break out a bit when it gets on my skin sleeping or sweating at the gym. I stopped using it because my hair was past due for a relaxer and after getting it straightness I haven&#x27;t started again so I&#x27;m not sure how well it really works. Giving it another shot soon.</li>
            <li> My friend turned me on to the Doo Gro Mega Thick lotion and I have been using it for about the past six months. I really liked how it tamed my hair more than any other salon sold product. I also use It&#x27;s a Ten but I still need to use my Doo Gro because nothing makes my hair less frizzy. When other people have seen my hair recently they are amazed at how much it grew and how my hair has gotten fuller. I have naturally thin, frizzy, curly hair and my hair now is full long and healthy looking like the women who do hair commercials. We are all blown away at this product. I highly recommend it although the friend who recommended it to me can&#x27;t use it because it&#x27;s too heavy for her hair and makes her hair oily. I recommend it for people with excessively frizzy and thin hair!!!</li>
            <li> Hi Ive only used Doo Gro oils &amp; Lotions but they really work. The oil really makes my hair grow and the Lotion keeps my hair slicked back but doesnt leave it looking or feeling greasy I love these products so much that I&#x27;ve decided to use the whole line. To me it smells good but to each its own I guess[[ASIN:B000EVKYQK Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil 4.5 fl oz (135 ml)]]</li>
            <li> I have been using Doo Grow products for years. I buy them at my local Sally Beauty store. I usually just use the leave in conditioner (it feels watery, but it&#x27;s wonderful) and the oil and yes, it works very well. My own hair stylist asked me what I was using. One day I was riding the escalator in a department store and a woman on the escalator going in the opposite direction said, \\&quot;Oh my goodness, your hair is so beautiful.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had cancer in 2011 and all my hair fell out. I was shiny head bald for 7 months. My hair started growing back in August (fell out in Feb) and it&#x27;s curly now. It&#x27;s been curly for 6 months so I guess I won&#x27;t get my old nappy/coarse texture back. I&#x27;ve tried everything to define my curls w/o making my hair crunchy. I&#x27;ve had to learn to work with my hair all over again because I used to have the coarse hair. I went back to using the Doo Grow oil. I put it in my hair just after I wash it and it made my hair look gorgeous. It&#x27;s the only thing that will define my curl w/o making my hair hard and crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does make your hair grow...or in anycase it keeps it from breaking so that it does grow longer and faster. As a matter of fact I stopped using it when I cut my hair short one year. I loved the haircut and didn&#x27;t want to grow out of it too quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it works on coarse hair and naturally curly hair as well. I will not use anything else. I don&#x27;t use the shampoo/conditioner though. I didn&#x27;t like those as much (I use Suave for 99 cents).</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my hair.  I love all the Doo Gro hair products.  My hair is healthy, shiny and manageable..</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and still love it and it keeps my hair smelling so fresh</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo! I saw results in my hair&#x27;s growth &amp; thickness after one bottle. I just bought my second bottle. I don&#x27;t like the leave in treatment . Too oily &amp; very hard to wash out if you get too much. Also the bottle of leave in treatment should be in a squirt bottle. It&#x27;s like pouring out water.</li>
            <li> DOOGRO is really amazing for any hair type. It really works to Nourish, strengthen, Grow &amp; Condition your hair. I LOVE IT. It Really works, It&#x27;s easy to manage &amp; great for blow drying your hair or flat ironing it. It washes out easy and it&#x27;s very light.&lt;br /&gt;#HealthyHair</li>
            <li> Love those product ,really works</li>
            <li> DID NOT GROW AN INCH OF HAIR.IT IS NOT ALAPRECIA IT IS JUST LOST OF HAIR NO CHEMINALS&lt;br /&gt;JUST LOST HAIR</li>
            <li> I got just the shampoo in the green bottle and i had my hair like a pixie cut so results would have been very noticeable. I noticed a quarter of an inch extra that grew every month. Maybe using all products will help though. Who knows try it.</li>
            <li> These products and others (Dr. Miracles, Organic Root Stimulator) cause hair loss. They have harsh cancer causing chemicals such as parabens, sulfates. When I used them I saw a small amount of hair growth then bumbs formed on my scalp which turned to scabs and the strands of hair fell out when the scabs fell off.&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil, natural/ organic/ vegetarian products are better!</li>
            <li> My product was leaking out so i didnt get to use much of this product so i wouldnt know if it&#x27;s good or not</li>
            <li> have had it long enough to see a diff yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past with great results and stopped using it but that was a bad decision and now I see where I needed to go back to using again.. It does help my hair grow and makes it thick.. I take lots of different medication for my pressure and my hair thin out in the top of my head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to having Doo Gro helping my hair full in again...</li>
            <li> Awesome does what it says</li>
