            <li>Price is amazing, I recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a brighter purple and doesn&#x27;t look as good in person.  </li>
            <li>, wife looks good in the wig.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, and is a nice purple.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line:for the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>

            <li>Very nice wig, looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>This wig is exactly what I wanted it to be The color is beautiful and it has a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I love the look and would love to get more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I would buy this wig again, but I&#x27;ll use the one I received until I can&#x27;t anymore  :)</li>
            <li>Of course for $15 :)</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 Will be buying more from this seller &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>i love wearing it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the purple wig, and while it was more of a bright purple than the dark-ish purple in the picture, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and looks great.  </li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful, soft, and looks real for most part.</li>
            <li>Shipping took forever, but well worth the wait :)</li>
            <li>She wrapped her hair up in the hair net that comes with this and the wig fits great.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s comfortable too.</li>
            <li>It is definitly curly but after wearing it they tangle pretty easy so take care of em!</li>
            <li>I may trim the bangs though since they&#x27;re really long lol</li>
            <li>Its great quality for the price and the color is 98% accurate a little bit more violet-ish but good enough.</li>
            <li>The curls are more of knots, really.</li>
            <li>This wig came nicely packaged and in it&#x27;s hair net which kept it tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Soft texture, very full.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture and arrived WAY sooner than it said.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this if you are looking for a cute purple wig.</li>
            <li>got it fast too!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this to pass off for real hair, since it does have a synthetic look to it, but higher quality than halloween costume wigs.</li>
            <li>Which was nice because it was estimated to take like a month and a half.</li>
            <li>The top is easy to see but the wig is thick enough to cover it easily.</li>
            <li>and it got here so fast.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this to fit properly without a ton of bobby pins holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to pin the bangs back to wear it comfortably.</li>
            <li>Good quality and lots of thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>Ive seen other complaints about being able to see thru the wig, but i have not noticed that at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY long, just like pictured, so it does tangle easily.</li>
            <li>It is soft and the exact color and length</li>
            <li>It also does a good job hiding thick hair, whether it is loose or in a wig cap and can be made to look pretty realistic (as far as purple hair goes).</li>
            <li>The quality was was much better than I expected for the low price I paid.</li>
            <li>My friend received hers two weeks early from earliest date.</li>
            <li>I got purple and it&#x27;s true to color, if a little brighter than in the picture.</li>
            <li>The wig is soft, thick and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>fibers are thin and don&#x27;t feel as good as some other wigs I have, but they are not like Halloween costume wig fibers.</li>

            <li> fibers are thin and don&#x27;t feel as good as some other wigs I have, but they are not like Halloween costume wig fibers.</li>
            <li> and i picked black (still waiting for mine but its still early)</li>
            <li> I was worried it would look super costumey and the hair would be thin or something.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a medium/small head and long hair.</li>
            <li> The bangs are long, but you can always cut or pin them.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying in other colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use a de-tangler when wearing it to conventions or parties and brush with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I do have hair that is quite long (a few inches shorter than the wig), so maybe I wasn&#x27;t securing my hair well enough under the wig, but it feels a little small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> inside of the cap contains adjustable straps that allow you to tighten or loosen your wig, however, even with hair pinned flat (i don&#x27;t have thick hair either)</li>
            <li> , I got it about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it did give me a headache, but hopefully I can find a way to make it hurt my head a little less.</li>
            <li> If pinned just right...it can cover up a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little tangled, but that&#x27;s from handling</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a little small for my head</li>
            <li> I felt like the netting was a little small also.</li>
            <li> so it hard to part because of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little thin</li>
            <li> She has really thick hair and its curly.</li>
            <li> The cap is slightly thin and can have moments of the cap showing through the hair.</li>

            <li> This wig is exactly what I wanted it to be The color is beautiful and it has a nice curl. Unfortunately, it is a little small for my head and it started to hurt after an hour or so. The top is easy to see but the wig is thick enough to cover it easily. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it did give me a headache, but hopefully I can find a way to make it hurt my head a little less. Also, don&#x27;t believe the month&#x27;s time, I got it about a week and a half and it got here so fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a brighter purple and doesn&#x27;t look as good in person.  I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! Definitely buying in other colors! Great length, adorable style. Shipping took forever, but well worth the wait :)</li>
            <li> The quality was was much better than I expected for the low price I paid. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is soft and the exact color and length im very happy ! Came with a wig cap too and all wrapped up in a net !</li>
            <li> This wig came nicely packaged and in it&#x27;s hair net which kept it tangle free.  The hair is very soft and looks great.  I&#x27;ll be ordering another one in a different color.</li>
            <li> Awesome girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> The cap is small.&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the cap contains adjustable straps that allow you to tighten or loosen your wig, however, even with hair pinned flat (i don&#x27;t have thick hair either) I couldn&#x27;t get this to fit properly without a ton of bobby pins holding it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the wig came just as pictured. The wig was beautiful curled and is a gorgeous purple color. I wouldn&#x27;t use this to pass off for real hair, since it does have a synthetic look to it, but higher quality than halloween costume wigs. It&#x27;s VERY long, just like pictured, so it does tangle easily. I&#x27;ll use a de-tangler when wearing it to conventions or parties and brush with a wide tooth comb. That works wonders. The cap is slightly thin and can have moments of the cap showing through the hair. If pinned just right...it can cover up a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would buy this wig again, but I&#x27;ll use the one I received until I can&#x27;t anymore  :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Looks wonderful,  and the color (purple) was perfect.  My order said it would take a month to get to me, but it came in 15 days from across the world!</li>
            <li> I ordered the purple wig, and while it was more of a bright purple than the dark-ish purple in the picture, I really can&#x27;t complain. The wig is soft, thick and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. It also does a good job hiding thick hair, whether it is loose or in a wig cap and can be made to look pretty realistic (as far as purple hair goes). I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig! Looks exactly like the picture and arrived WAY sooner than it said. Which was nice because it was estimated to take like a month and a half. Only took like two weeks. Soft texture, very full. I may trim the bangs though since they&#x27;re really long lol</li>
            <li> I like it, wife looks good in the wig.  Ive seen other complaints about being able to see thru the wig, but i have not noticed that at all.  Great for the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this wig yesterday. The curls are more of knots, really. Kind of frizzy, but still gorgeous. It feels great, and is a nice purple.  It&#x27;s a great wig for the price. I definitely recommend this if you are looking for a cute purple wig.</li>
            <li> What a great wig! My daughter has a medium/small head and long hair. She wrapped her hair up in the hair net that comes with this and the wig fits great. She says it&#x27;s comfortable too. She wore it all day and it looks awesome. Because it&#x27;s inexpensive I was worried it would look super costumey and the hair would be thin or something. Not so! It&#x27;s fine! She loves it.</li>
            <li> I got purple and it&#x27;s true to color, if a little brighter than in the picture. It is a little tangled, but that&#x27;s from handling (curls get tangled).The fibers are thin and don&#x27;t feel as good as some other wigs I have, but they are not like Halloween costume wig fibers.The bangs are long, but you can always cut or pin them. I chose to pin them back, but this made me see one issue.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little thin so it hard to part because of this. Because of the contrast between the netting and the fibers, you can see the netting if it&#x27;s parted. I felt like the netting was a little small also. I do have hair that is quite long (a few inches shorter than the wig), so maybe I wasn&#x27;t securing my hair well enough under the wig, but it feels a little small.&lt;br /&gt;Standard shipping took FOREVER (well....around 3 weeks; it was projected to be four or five weeks though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:for the price, it&#x27;s good. I like it, I&#x27;ll wear it, but it&#x27;s not the highest quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Halloween!</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful, soft, and looks real for most part. My friend received hers two weeks early from earliest date. She has really thick hair and its curly. She wanted the purple one to go with costume and i picked black (still waiting for mine but its still early), she put wig cap on head and wig over, you couldnt even tell she has a lot of hair. I definitely recomend.</li>
            <li> $15 for an amazing wig?! Heck yes! Get this if you need it!! It&#x27;s perfection! Of course for $15 :)</li>
            <li> This wig fits perfectly, was the perfect color and was amazing quality!! &amp;#60;3 Will be buying more from this seller &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Good quality and lots of thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> very nice! got it fast too! great color... i love wearing it. great price too. i would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Very nice wig, looks fantastic! I have to pin the bangs back to wear it comfortably. It is definitly curly but after wearing it they tangle pretty easy so take care of em!</li>
            <li> Great wig. Perfectly as described! shipping speed was O.K. I love the look and would love to get more! Price is amazing, I recommend!</li>
            <li> Its great quality for the price and the color is 98% accurate a little bit more violet-ish but good enough. Its beautiful.</li>
