            <li>I just love this body creme</li>
            <li>You will not believe how much better your skin looks if you apply before bed each night.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed that when applying it, it does not go on smooth like most lotions, which feels good, but I figured if it works, that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Has excellent repair capability for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>But it also seems fine for skin that does not have eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>As others have said, this is a fabulous moisturizing and skin repair creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick</li>
            <li>this review was useful, please let me know by voting for it.</li>
            <li>Great for lathering up right before bed, but leaves your legs a little greasy, so I don&#x27;t want to use it when I am going out.</li>
            <li>Great for those of us with super dry skin especially heels.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s getting to be too hot.</li>
            <li>I know of know better remedy for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Certainly very moisturizing like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever encountered and doesn&#x27;t really have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading the great reviews about how it helps extremely dry skin but for the price it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>The stiff kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>but I loved it for my extreme dry hands and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>So far I find it at least as good as the old creme when it comes to moisturizing and skin</li>
            <li>This does all I want along those lines, especially a particularly pesky elbow that gets so dry</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with this product, especially since there are so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It comes in an 8 ounce tube so the price per ounce is lower than even the old price of the intensive repair creme.</li>
            <li>This Eucerin did nothing except get everything on and near me greasy.</li>
            <li>So one star for this product and I am really surprised.</li>
            <li>It not only helps with dry skin, it is very helpful to relieve itching from the winter dryness.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed that the safety seal over the lotion was opened and it looked liked most of the lotion had been previously used!  </li>

            <li> My small container arrived and was only half full of creme.</li>
            <li> This is the only product on the market that moisturizers my dry skin.  </li>

            <li> Expensive but worth every cent!  </li>
            <li> and my hands are hopelessly dry</li>
            <li> Eucerin body creme can&#x27;t be beat for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> It has helped heal a number of dry patches on my body.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to help rid your skin of that ugly \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; appearance.  </li>
            <li> This lotion seemed really thick/dense &amp; difficult to apply, it also left me feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> It takes a few applications but is well worth the efforts since bumpy skin is not attractive.</li>
            <li> Only know that I always try to avoid wearing black or dark clothes, I leave a powdery residue on everything!  </li>
            <li> I deliberately ordered the intensive type due to the extent of the dryness that I am experiencing.</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very dry, and it keeps it a little moist now (perhaps).  </li>
            <li> A small amount can rub in over a wide area.</li>
            <li> Not entirely sure the lid was sealed on either.</li>
            <li> I usually spread the cream on my face (been doing for 5 years now) and the lotion after a shower.  </li>
            <li> purchase-- especially for how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find these days</li>
            <li> of late it has gone up in price a lot.</li>
            <li> Hightly recommend for anyone with bad dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a problem before but not happy at all with this</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with me, or if I somehow got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that they quit making it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to continue using</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears they have stopped producing it.</li>
            <li> downside however is that it&#x27;s very difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Too bad product has been discontinued by manufacturer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this creme.  It is hard to find these days so I was happy to see it on Amazon.  A little over priced, but great product!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product on the market that moisturizers my dry skin.  I have tried several products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to help rid your skin of that ugly \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; appearance.  It takes a few applications but is well worth the efforts since bumpy skin is not attractive.</li>
            <li> Where the product arrived the seal is open and only half is contain and its already used this is mafia product don‘t ever try to buy it.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist said this is the only product that will protect against cracking heels in dry, winter weather.  He was correct.  I have not had this problem since beginning its use three years ago.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading the great reviews about how it helps extremely dry skin but for the price it&#x27;s not worth it. My small container arrived and was only half full of creme. Not entirely sure the lid was sealed on either. Seemed like it had been opened and used even though I bought it \\&quot;new\\&quot;.  Should have sent it back but didn&#x27;t. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is a fabulous moisturizing and skin repair creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of late it has gone up in price a lot. It is not listed on Eucerin&#x27;s website as a current product. Perhaps this is why the price is going up but that is just speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this Eucerin product - [[ASIN:B00DEXA0LY Eucerin Body Creme, Eczema Relief, 8 Ounce]] - a great alternative. It comes in an 8 ounce tube so the price per ounce is lower than even the old price of the intensive repair creme. A small amount can rub in over a wide area. So far I find it at least as good as the old creme when it comes to moisturizing and skin repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the eczema designation. Some ingredients are supposed to help with that. But it also seems fine for skin that does not have eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was useful, please let me know by voting for it.</li>
            <li> I read online this would help to cure those pesky bumps some of use get on the backs of our arms. Mine flare up in the summer time and it&#x27;s something I try to hide with long sleeves, but it&#x27;s getting to be too hot. This Eucerin did nothing except get everything on and near me greasy. This did not absorb in my skin and was so slimy feeling. I used it once and threw it away. It was unbearable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have seen this product used in hospitals, etc., and assumed that it would be the best. I recently moved to an area with very dry air and my hands are hopelessly dry and my elbows are like sandpaper. I deliberately ordered the intensive type due to the extent of the dryness that I am experiencing. The first thing I noticed that when applying it, it does not go on smooth like most lotions, which feels good, but I figured if it works, that&#x27;s OK. After using it for a number of weeks I can say that it has not helped one bit with the dryness. I reapply it several times a day and it has not helped. So one star for this product and I am really surprised.</li>
            <li> Certainly very moisturizing like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever encountered and doesn&#x27;t really have a noticeable smell. It also feels nice on the body.&lt;br /&gt;The downside however is that it&#x27;s very difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, when you put it on it&#x27;s creamy but then it goes away, it stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I know of know better remedy for extremely dry skin.  This does all I want along those lines, especially a particularly pesky elbow that gets so dry it&#x27;s practically scaly.</li>
            <li> Eucerin body creme can&#x27;t be beat for dry winter skin.  It not only helps with dry skin, it is very helpful to relieve itching from the winter dryness.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s sad that they quit making it. It&#x27;s too expensive to continue using but I loved it for my extreme dry hands and cracked cuticles.</li>
            <li> I usually spread the cream on my face (been doing for 5 years now) and the lotion after a shower.  My skin is very, very dry, and it keeps it a little moist now (perhaps).  Maybe it diminished some of the flakes, don&#x27;t know.  Only know that I always try to avoid wearing black or dark clothes, I leave a powdery residue on everything!  Like I said this cream and the lotion helped me diminish the embarrasment but still have NOT gotten rid off the problem.... Still like the feeling of it. I know my body likes it, when I wash my hands,or take a shower, I always apply it afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it, but for some reason it doubled in price.  Why?  This is highway robbery.  What&#x27;s up?</li>
            <li> I just love this body creme and I&#x27;ve been regularly using this product every night and my skin feels softer than before.</li>
            <li> Why did they ever stop making this?  I really loved this stuff, even used it on my face.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every cent!  You will not believe how much better your skin looks if you apply before bed each night.</li>
            <li> Love the cream!  Delivery was quick</li>
            <li> Great for those of us with super dry skin especially heels. Heals, repairs and exfoliates! Too bad product has been discontinued by manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Great for lathering up right before bed, but leaves your legs a little greasy, so I don&#x27;t want to use it when I am going out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It has helped heal a number of dry patches on my body.  It is very effective.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product, especially since there are so many good reviews. This lotion seemed really thick/dense &amp; difficult to apply, it also left me feeling sticky. The stiff kind of sticky. Not sure if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with me, or if I somehow got a bad batch...</li>
            <li> Repaired my skin after years of pain.  Has excellent repair capability for very dry skin.  Hightly recommend for anyone with bad dry skin.  Unfortunately, it appears they have stopped producing it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the safety seal over the lotion was opened and it looked liked most of the lotion had been previously used!  There was none spilled in the packaging so it did not happen during shipping. I have never had a problem before but not happy at all with this purchase-- especially for how expensive it was.</li>
