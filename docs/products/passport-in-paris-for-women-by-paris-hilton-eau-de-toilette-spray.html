            <li>The Price Is Perfect</li>
            <li>This smells great.</li>
            <li>If you like Happy by Clinique, you will like passport.  </li>
            <li>So if you have this no need to buy Happy and vice versa.</li>
            <li>I must say smells good</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>smells very nice and the lasted more then 3 days to me</li>
            <li>My favorite one!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This scent is soooo lovely!</li>
            <li>Glad we found something she likes that doesn&#x27;t break my pocketbook!</li>
            <li>(and I DESPISE patchouli) but honestly, I can&#x27;t even detect it.</li>
            <li>and I must say I liked it as well.</li>
            <li>i LOVE IT!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very well done scent that in my opinion has some great staying power.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance for young teen-agers</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still just as strong.</li>
            <li>and It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume first time ordering paris hilton fragrances.</li>
            <li>Light , fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>sWEET</li>
            <li>Scent is sweet, light enough to be appropriate for a child.</li>
            <li>Perfume has a sweet smell and my wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this a super fruity type scent really.</li>
            <li>I think I will be getting myself one very soon!</li>
            <li>Absolutely lived it!</li>
            <li>The scent was absolutely lovely, only problem is I can&#x27;t find anymore of these perfumes for the bargain</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I get a strong hit of the white musk.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am no Paris Hilton fan, however, this scent is really complex and lovely.</li>
            <li>My little lady adores Paris so this was an easy selection for my nine year old this Christmas.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s like a soft &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet but not at all cavity-inducing sugary.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t really gotten any compliments on it, so I am not sure how strong it is to others or how long the scent actually lasts.</li>
            <li>It smells like some very yummy fruity drinks, like a pina colada mixed with some other fruits.</li>
            <li>so the lasting power is not very long, but for the price (5-15$) I don&#x27;t mind.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume first time ordering paris hilton fragrances. I must say smells good then i expected it to.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderfull!</li>
            <li> The smell is light and fresh. However, I haven&#x27;t really gotten any compliments on it, so I am not sure how strong it is to others or how long the scent actually lasts.</li>
            <li> smells very nice and the lasted more then 3 days to me it smelled like cotton candy and I will buy another but bigger bottle</li>
            <li> My favorite one! I love it!</li>
            <li> tHIS SCENT IS SOOOOOOO AMAZING!!! sWEET AND EVERYTHING  i LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt; MAY HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER IN THE FUTURE SOON</li>
            <li> This scent is soooo lovely! It smells like some very yummy fruity drinks, like a pina colada mixed with some other fruits. I personally have never been to Paris or France, but I have been to the Caribbean and this brings me back to that. Tropical and fruity! It a toilette spray so the lasting power is not very long, but for the price (5-15$) I don&#x27;t mind. The lasting power is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I actually got this as a gift for a fror a friend and I end up using it any time I am at her place. I think I will be getting myself one very soon!</li>
            <li> Absolutely lived it! It shipped out to my home in no time! The scent was absolutely lovely, only problem is I can&#x27;t find anymore of these perfumes for the bargain I got them for. But definitely have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> This smells great. Light , fresh and clean. If you like Happy by Clinique, you will like passport.  They smell similar,  and I would even venture to say even identical. This will uplift your mood. So if you have this no need to buy Happy and vice versa. Take a chance. The Price Is Perfect and It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a definite surprise to say the least! First of all, I am no Paris Hilton fan, however, this scent is really complex and lovely. Right off the bat, I get a strong hit of the white musk. After it settles a bit, the other notes come through. The honeysuckle is also present but not overpowering. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a super fruity type scent really. To me, it&#x27;s like a soft &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; type of girlie scent with a somewhat &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; note to it. It&#x27;s a little sweet but not at all cavity-inducing sugary.I know it says there is patchouli in this (and I DESPISE patchouli) but honestly, I can&#x27;t even detect it. If anything, it just gives it a bit of depth without taking over and drowning out all the other notes. This is a very well done scent that in my opinion has some great staying power. I sprayed just a tiny bit on my arm a few hours ago to test it and it&#x27;s still just as strong. I would definitely repurchase this and recommend it to others!</li>

            <li> Great fragrance for young teen-agers</li>
            <li> Perfume has a sweet smell and my wife absolutely loves it. She used it up in no time and I must say I liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful, sweet scent. I&#x27;ve bought this same perfume multiple times. Very refreshing. I do wish it lasted a little longer. But having said that, for the price- you can&#x27;t beat this perfume.</li>
