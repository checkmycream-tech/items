            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how incredibly transforming it was!</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s good on my hair</li>
            <li>Which I guess is also a good thing since it didn&#x27;t give me any breakouts as well?</li>
            <li>It&#x27; a good product..feel refreshing and good!</li>
            <li>Hey girls!This stuff is very nice and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Hydrating and refreshing!</li>
            <li>in all, this is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and more refreshed after using this mist.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than two weeks now and most of my friends noticed that my skin look radiant and smoother than before.</li>
            <li>so its more like a serum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes your skin feels good and fresh :)</li>
            <li>Not so sure about this becuase i havent seen any visible result from using it almost 1 month.  </li>
            <li>that I believe work better than a skin mist.</li>
            <li>I have bought this mist around 5 times, its my favorite moisturizer-</li>
            <li>There are so many raves for this product from different beauty bloggers, but I wasn&#x27;t so impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>So collagen stays on top of the skin and is washed off.</li>
            <li>Great rose smell and big bottle</li>
            <li>So refreshing and works great, I have been using for two years my face is smooth and young</li>
            <li>Great product for dry skin, smells good, quick absorb and non greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Japanese women have great skin and many of their face products contain collagen</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great if you ever need to feel refreshed or extra boost of moisture throughout the day :)</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and love the product!</li>
            <li>Using just the collagen toner after cleansing and this mist twice a day, I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference.</li>
            <li>so I fit it into my routine as if it were a serum.</li>
            <li>After using this for the first time, I could feel that my skin was much better.</li>
            <li>I do find it very refreshing to spray this on my face in the mid afternoon</li>
            <li>The results of this are not dramatic as I was expecting, however using this once or twice a day really does keep my skin healthy and flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I know that majority of collagen products cannot be absorbed into the skin but this product specifically contains hydrolyzed collagen (I think I spelled that right)</li>
            <li>I found this and instantly had to know more.</li>
            <li>first, I did not think it was working.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles that start to pop up around my smile when my skin is dry are gone, and my skin&#x27;s texture is better- softer, dewier, and my pores</li>
            <li>My skin soaked it up very quickly and my skin did not feel softer so much as it just felt more firm.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshed face before putting their makeup on.</li>
            <li>I use three sprays 2 for my face and 1 for my neck then gently rub it in.</li>
            <li>It also appears that with continued use, my hair has gotten stronger and I am not shedding as much.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my hands and soaps really don&#x27;t help matters.</li>
            <li>I spray this on after I wash my hands and my eczema is almost completely gone, which is rare in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for price</li>
            <li>does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Really sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for price</li>
            <li>I could feel a mask like effect no matter how much I put on, and it made my skin feel like it couldn&#x27;t breathe.  </li>
            <li>I really do enjoy the one in the blue bottle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really did anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I think this works better on dry to normal skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s molecular mass is small enough to be easily absorbed into the skin for good moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very strong and fades easily, but some people with more sensitive noses might have a bigger problem with it than I did.</li>
            <li>As Smart Skin Care.com notes, collagen molecules are too big to be absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use when you wake up especially because your body loses alot of water during sleep</li>
            <li>My hair gets very dry and frizzy due to the winter weather, and this stuff is awesome at taming my hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I could be imagining it, but it sure seems like it, I am cleaning my brush out less frequently than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t harm my skin and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t see younger looking skin since mine is pretty young</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 this year, and my skin is starting to show more signs of aging and dryness this winter than it did in previous years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m to young for wrinkles</li>
            <li>Nearly all girls have one bottle in their hands.</li>
            <li>Your body can&#x27;t absorb collagen, it can only produce it, so putting collagen on your skin or eating food with collagen does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only slight downside to this product is that it has kind of a strange smell to it.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have to say is it is not a MIST - the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; comes out very strong.  </li>
            <li>Really did wonder for my dry skin</li>
            <li>Some companies claim they have developed transdermal techniques to deliver collagen deep into the skin, but the claims are not yet proven.</li>
            <li>not too heavy, just right.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I have been wondering about collagen products for awhile so I decided to look for something online. I found this and instantly had to know more. Japanese women have great skin and many of their face products contain collagen so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m only 22 so I won&#x27;t see younger looking skin since mine is pretty young but it makes my face feel awesome! My face is smoother and more refreshed after using this mist. I recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshed face before putting their makeup on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 this year, and my skin is starting to show more signs of aging and dryness this winter than it did in previous years. Apparently according to some articles I read, this is around the time collagen production starts to slow down in the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but I thought I&#x27;d give a collagen product a try. I can&#x27;t believe how incredibly transforming it was! Using just the collagen toner after cleansing and this mist twice a day, I&#x27;m seeing a huge difference. The wrinkles that start to pop up around my smile when my skin is dry are gone, and my skin&#x27;s texture is better- softer, dewier, and my pores are even shrinking a little! I&#x27;ll be buying this as long as they keep making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight downside to this product is that it has kind of a strange smell to it. It&#x27;s not very strong and fades easily, but some people with more sensitive noses might have a bigger problem with it than I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two weeks now and most of my friends noticed that my skin look radiant and smoother than before. In addition, I used less make up and my pores seems smaller than it used to be.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of my favorites! I&#x27;m to young for wrinkles but this is a great product to help strengthen and protect the skin with collagen! Now I know that majority of collagen products cannot be absorbed into the skin but this product specifically contains hydrolyzed collagen (I think I spelled that right) and it&#x27;s molecular mass is small enough to be easily absorbed into the skin for good moisture. It&#x27;s great to use when you wake up especially because your body loses alot of water during sleep so it helps dehydrate before you do your morning routine. This is a little thicker than a mist so its more like a serum so I fit it into my routine as if it were a serum. It&#x27;s also great if you ever need to feel refreshed or extra boost of moisture throughout the day :)</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and love the product!</li>
            <li> This is the best seller in Japan. Nearly all girls have one bottle in their hands. I make me feel really good. I will continue buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing any miracles but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. This doesn&#x27;t harm my skin and I have very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s makes your skin feels good and fresh :)</li>
            <li> Erases fine lines, gives beautiful skin tone and is a consummate product for burns of any kind.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Cant get enough! So refreshing and works great, I have been using for two years my face is smooth and young looking</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. After using this for the first time, I could feel that my skin was much better.</li>
            <li> Not so sure about this becuase i havent seen any visible result from using it almost 1 month.  I do find it very refreshing to spray this on my face in the mid afternoon a little pick me up i guess.  However, I think this works better on dry to normal skin I guess.  The only negative I have to say is it is not a MIST - the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; comes out very strong.  They need to redesign the bottle dispenser.</li>
            <li> Hey girls!This stuff is very nice and refreshing. I like using it in the summer instead of cream at night after I wash my face and use a toner before going to dinner and dancing etc. I use three sprays 2 for my face and 1 for my neck then gently rub it in. It makes my skin moist and feel protected from the NYC dirt. I still use a little eye cream. Great rose smell and big bottle it should last awhile. Great in the NYC summer heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was intrigued by it. It just seems so bizzare, I&#x27;ve never heard of something like this in the states. Besides, my skin is very dry and using this seemed like something I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I did not think it was working. My skin soaked it up very quickly and my skin did not feel softer so much as it just felt more firm. I was a bit upset, so I stopped using for a few days, thinking why bother, it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. However, after I stopped using it, my skin got extremely dry! I started using it again and lo and behold, my skin improved. The results of this are not dramatic as I was expecting, however using this once or twice a day really does keep my skin healthy and flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have found two uses for it that I believe work better than a skin mist. This is the best product I have found for my hair! My hair gets very dry and frizzy due to the winter weather, and this stuff is awesome at taming my hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. It also appears that with continued use, my hair has gotten stronger and I am not shedding as much. I could be imagining it, but it sure seems like it, I am cleaning my brush out less frequently than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another use I found is as a hand mist. I have eczema on my hands and soaps really don&#x27;t help matters. I spray this on after I wash my hands and my eczema is almost completely gone, which is rare in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a really nice product. It has great benefits and I am seeing results after over a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 11/29/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dropped 3 stars from this review for two reasons. One, I finally found the ingredients for this product and it contains parabens and other chemicals that I do not want on my skin. Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, I found out that any product claiming to have collagen in it is fake. Your body can&#x27;t absorb collagen, it can only produce it, so putting collagen on your skin or eating food with collagen does absolutely nothing. I thought micro collagen was different, but that too is just a marketing gimmick :( Really sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for price and it&#x27;s good on my hair and it did help my face, but I won&#x27;t be using this anymore and I definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again.n your skin or eating food with collagen does absolutely nothing.

            <li> I have bought this mist around 5 times, its my favorite moisturizer- not too heavy, just right. Perfect for summer as well :D</li>
            <li> There are so many raves for this product from different beauty bloggers, but I wasn&#x27;t so impressed with it.  It felt tacky and almost greasy on my skin.  I could feel a mask like effect no matter how much I put on, and it made my skin feel like it couldn&#x27;t breathe.  It also didn&#x27;t produce any visible results while using it.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a difference yet but I will continue to use it...I really do enjoy the one in the blue bottle</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin, smells good, quick absorb and non greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Hydrating and refreshing! I use throughout the day if I feel my skin needs some moisture. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Collagen cremes have been around for decades. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that they work. As Smart Skin Care.com notes, collagen molecules are too big to be absorbed by the skin. So collagen stays on top of the skin and is washed off. Collagen cremes may work as a moisturizer, but they won&#x27;t strengthen your skin. Some companies claim they have developed transdermal techniques to deliver collagen deep into the skin, but the claims are not yet proven.</li>
            <li> Really did wonder for my dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27; a good product..feel refreshing and good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really did anything for my skin. Which I guess is also a good thing since it didn&#x27;t give me any breakouts as well?</li>
