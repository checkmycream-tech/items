            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Nothing but smooth, sleek and shiny hair from this spray!</li>
            <li>To eliviate this problem, I just spray some on my bathroom counter top and dip my fingers into that liquid and rub it on my hair and then use a curling iron to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they both make my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li>Perfect for long hair!</li>
            <li>just a  light spray is enough for it to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I read in the free Oprah magazine that I get, that this was top rated for heat protection.  </li>
            <li>you never fail me!! :)</li>
            <li>I liked it so much i went out and bought 4 more.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>So, I basically use it as a setting solution and it works just fine for that in my opinon and protects my hair too.</li>
            <li>made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important to have heat protection.</li>
            <li>Spells great on my hair and now helps me use my flat iron without getting split ends from damage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hot a huge fan of putting them on my hands and going thru sections of hair and wasting more than I should.</li>
            <li>this product is true to it&#x27;s word</li>
            <li>I normally use treseme heat spray, but I think this is my new love!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves hair smelling amazing!</li>
            <li>While other Pantene products don’t really work on my hair this one does great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, the product came right on time!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a light hairspray more than I would have expected...</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>First time user to heat protection.</li>
            <li>Will more then likely purchase again when I am finished with this bottle I have.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it really does well protecting from heat of the blow dryer, flat iron curling iron ect.</li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>I try not to use my hair straightener too much</li>
            <li>The hair dryer really wrecks its&#x27; sleekness buy</li>
            <li>I feel like this does not offer as much protection as the John Frieda</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I am a natural, so I rarely use heat in order to maintain my curls.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much pantene</li>
            <li>I spray my hair lightly before using the blow dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(OK, maybe a little hyperbole.)</li>
            <li>Leaves her hair looking smooth with a little sheen.  </li>
            <li>I only use this when I am styling my hair (hardly ever) but its nice to use something to protect my hair in those moments.</li>
            <li>Being natural</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and prevents dryness.</li>
            <li>I have tried it several times and it really weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine</li>

            <li> My hair is thin and fine</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for straightening her hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am always using a blow dryer or flat iron</li>
            <li> I always use it before i flat irom or blow dry.</li>
            <li> I wish the spray nozzel would have a &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; setting because its hard for the spray to directly make onto a section of hair without missing or putting to much in one area.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a detangling spray also when my hair is dry, my hair is thick and tends to knot very easiy.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair when it is damp and just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> if I use this stuff before I dry it, it looks like I just came out of the salon.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my damp hair before I blow dry and curl.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, damaged hair and this product</li>
            <li> Less then two weeks of use and my once long even hair has pieces only an inch long.</li>
            <li> I needed a heat protection spray since I use heat on my hair every single day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten this from a previous purchase and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Without this her hair would be very dry looking.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to overspray -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it seems to do as it says.</li>
            <li> I use many Pantene products and am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> one because my hair still feels a little dry and fried after using my heating iron.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the wax type feel of it, nor the way It weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it is leaving any residue or weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair there was absolutely NO heat damage!!</li>
            <li> Since using this item,my hair has become less damaged and frizzy</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from feeling frizzy and all dried out.</li>
            <li> I used heat everyday for two weeks.</li>
            <li> My product was broken.</li>
            <li> The block part that sprays stuff out was broken.</li>
            <li> I have thin blond hair</li>
            <li> Or, worse, shooting it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand.</li>
            <li> This is so bad it should be recalled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> I never heard of this before til someone told me about it. I liked it so much i went out and bought 4 more. I always use it before i flat irom or blow dry. It works</li>
            <li> My product was broken. The block part that sprays stuff out was broken.</li>
            <li> I love this product My fave styler</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great! Perfect for long hair!</li>
            <li> I read in the free Oprah magazine that I get, that this was top rated for heat protection.  I have tried it several times and it really weighs my hair down. I have thin blond hair and I don&#x27;t need anything that will make it look or feel any flatter than it already is. I also didn&#x27;t notice \\&quot;the shine\\&quot;... Just the feeling I needed to wash it again. I will go back to Tresemme...</li>
            <li> Always a great product by Pantene. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand.</li>
            <li> Love love love the great smell. First time using it and I loved it.</li>
            <li> this product is true to it&#x27;s word</li>
            <li> This is an awesome heatt protectant spray. I also use it as a leave in conditioner. I spray it on my hair when it is damp and just let it air dry. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling and it doesn&#x27;t.make your hair look greasy. I use it as a detangling spray also when my hair is dry, my hair is thick and tends to knot very easiy. This is great to use on days I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair to help with the knots and again, it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy looking or make your hair feel sticky or &amp;#34;crumchy&amp;#34; like a gel or mousse might.</li>
            <li> I love this Pantene Pro-V Heat protection spray! I try not to use my hair straightener too much but when I do use it I can count on this to prevent damaging. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling amazing! This is now a must when using my hair straightener.</li>
            <li> This is great spray for those of us who worry about drying our hair while straightening.  It helps protects my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten this from a previous purchase and use it regularly. Love that it protects my hair while blow drying. Being natural that&#x27;s important to have heat protection. Pantene is a great company and this product works great. I got this product at a discounted price for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Not only cannot I not believe this works but I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. My hair is thin and fine but I have a lot of it. The hair dryer really wrecks its&#x27; sleekness buy if I use this stuff before I dry it, it looks like I just came out of the salon.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this for straightening her hair with a flat iron.  Leaves her hair looking smooth with a little sheen.  Without this her hair would be very dry looking.  Good product!</li>
            <li> This spray is fantastic! Does the job and smells great. Love it! Definite must have!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, good product, according to my pre-tween girls, who like to use it on their hair before flat-ironing. Love the scent!!</li>
            <li> First time user to heat protection. I only use this when I am styling my hair (hardly ever) but its nice to use something to protect my hair in those moments.</li>
            <li> I spray my hair lightly before using the blow dryer and flat iron.  It leaves my hair silky and shiny and has a really nice fragrance.  Be careful not to overspray - just a  light spray is enough for it to work perfectly.  This is a wonderful product and a terrific price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair gloss without the greasy feel smells real good. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I always forget to use heat protectant before I curl or straighten my hair. I&#x27;m hot a huge fan of putting them on my hands and going thru sections of hair and wasting more than I should. With this I can just spray all over in 1/2 the time. Love the sleek design and works wonders on my hair. Since using this item,my hair has become less damaged and frizzy</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair so I need heat protection without the weight. While other Pantene products don’t really work on my hair this one does great. I’ve been using it for a while now and like it. They’ve made some packaging improvements. The spray now has a lock and unlock feature so I can take it on the go without having to worry about it leaking or spring in my bag. I’ll continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I feel like this does not offer as much protection as the John Frieda one because my hair still feels a little dry and fried after using my heating iron.</li>

            <li> Not only did this not protect my hair from heat styling it BROKE IT ALL OVER MY HEAD!  I use many Pantene products and am so disappointed. I did not care for the wax type feel of it, nor the way It weighed my hair down but I have it a go anyways.  Less then two weeks of use and my once long even hair has pieces only an inch long. This is so bad it should be recalled.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my damp hair before I blow dry and curl. It keeps my hair from feeling frizzy and all dried out. Nothing but smooth, sleek and shiny hair from this spray! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and leaves hair smelling amazing!</li>
            <li> I wish the spray nozzel would have a &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; setting because its hard for the spray to directly make onto a section of hair without missing or putting to much in one area.  To eliviate this problem, I just spray some on my bathroom counter top and dip my fingers into that liquid and rub it on my hair and then use a curling iron to curl my hair.  So, I basically use it as a setting solution and it works just fine for that in my opinon and protects my hair too.</li>
            <li> Not that great... My hair doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;protected&#x27; it&#x27;s like a light hairspray more than I would have expected... Not at all like a heat protection spray I&#x27;ve used before. Ended up giving it away after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> works well at 1/3 of the price of a salon brand.</li>
            <li> Just got this and just tried this. Amazing. I have really dry, damaged hair and this product made a huge difference. You can spray it on your hair and blowdry your hair. It shines and softens,beautifully. I was able to try this product at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for an honest review. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Seems to be protecting my hair well. I don&#x27;t believe it is leaving any residue or weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I needed a heat protection spray since I use heat on my hair every single day. I was worried about frying my hair so I made the purchase. This protects my hair and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for my hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and prevents dryness.</li>
            <li> This has been amazing for my hair! I am a natural, so I rarely use heat in order to maintain my curls. Three weeks ago I used this in addition to a leave in conditioner to straighten my hair. I used heat everyday for two weeks. When I washed my hair there was absolutely NO heat damage!! This stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I use this Heat Protection as a follow up to my pantene  hair care routine. I love this stuff it really does well protecting from heat of the blow dryer, flat iron curling iron ect. I will buy both the heat protection and the  Pantene Pro-V 2-Minute Moisture Masque Deep Conditioner again together. I love the way they both make my hair feel so healthy.</li>
            <li> Works great when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Got worried after some of the spray ended up on a plastic cap and wouldn&#x27;t wipe off, because it ate into the plastic. What would it do to my hair or scalp?! Not using it.</li>
            <li> I am always using a blow dryer or flat iron so this product was a life savor. Thanks so much pantene you never fail me!! :)</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but it seems to do as it says. Will more then likely purchase again when I am finished with this bottle I have.</li>
            <li> I use this when I curl and/or when I straighten and it works great. It has become my favorite heat protection spray and the amount you receive is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the weirdest application of a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle that I have ever seen. There is no way to hold and pump this product onto your hair without getting a muscle cramp. (OK, maybe a little hyperbole.) Or, worse, shooting it in your eyes. This is not even a spray, it is a stream of liquid, which totally defeats the purpose of  &#x27;spraying&#x27; it onto your hair. I even tried spraying it onto my hands and applying it to my hair, and that was ridiculpus.</li>
            <li> Great spray to help protect hair</li>
            <li> Sema to protect hair from heat when applied</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Spells great on my hair and now helps me use my flat iron without getting split ends from damage!</li>
            <li> Protects my hair from the hair dryer and straightener. Smells good is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shine and smells great all while protecting your hair from heat. Amazing i ended up ordering 3 more bottles. Great price also</li>
