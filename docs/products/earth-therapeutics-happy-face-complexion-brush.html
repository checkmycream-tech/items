            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Not the quality of the original brush which I purchased and loved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it do a good job, but my complexion looks good too!</li>
            <li>With the appropriate skin cleanser, I can already see improvements in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>now that i know where to get them :-)</li>
            <li>Perfect facial brush for washing my face.  </li>
            <li>so i thought i&#x27;d give this a try; works well; bristles are soft and do a good job; easy to handle and keep clean;  happy with this product.</li>
            <li>product looks new and works great..</li>
            <li>It has very nice bristles and is very comfortable in your hand but a bit too soft for me.</li>
            <li>I love using this in the shower with my face wash and my skin feels smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>It came very quick.</li>
            <li>This brush sure does clean my face.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It is durable &amp; easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This completion brush is Way too soft to do any good....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t a good brush, but for me, it&#x27;s way too soft even for my skin.</li>
            <li>The Shiseido brush was extremely gently with a very fine comb.</li>
            <li>but it would leave my pores perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>It is soft, but effective.  </li>
            <li>but they still provide a nice massaging action.  </li>
            <li>This is a good facial brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer than my old brush and my face feels good afterward.  </li>
            <li>The original reviewers stated this and they were right on with this observation.</li>
            <li>The smaller head size allows it to more easily penetrate the creases around the nose</li>
            <li>Had a great deal of trouble finding a complexion brush.  </li>
            <li>For the cost, it wasn&#x27;t worth arguing over.</li>
            <li>The bristles can also fray and bend very easily if you don&#x27;t take care to cap and store properly after use.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and light weight.</li>
            <li>I finally decided I should get a new one after the first one had had a good run.</li>
            <li>I have used this type of brush for years it was fine soft brissels</li>
            <li>Bristles may stain very easily if using it to remove an herbal facial mask or very colored products.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner than washing with just my hands or a wash cloth!</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I needed with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect because it&#x27;s not so expensive.  </li>
            <li>This brush, while made quite fine, is quite soft, i&#x27;m sure its too soft to do anything, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If one likes a good stiff unyielding brush for exfoliation, this is it.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Be sure to let it air dry to prevent this.</li>
            <li>It removes all the dirt and oil, leaving my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this because of the price and the reviews, but the thistles (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called) are very plastic-y to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The bristles are way to soft!!!</li>
            <li>Feels nice, but not very effective for cleansing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I could get any sort of a deep exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft, too soft in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Cap can come off very easily so be sure to cap it and set the brush down, and not propped against anything.</li>
            <li>The item in this picture is not what was shipped; I used to own the green brush and ordered a replacement; the new brush has a clear/white handle and is too soft!</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft but you can see how it really helps take the makeup/ dirt off your face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Its small soft and cute!</li>
            <li>I  was thinking the bristels would be a little bit more resistant.</li>
            <li>Overall it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>One star may seem like a harsh review for this product, but it really is rather cheap.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little to soft but other than that, it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li>The bristels are extremely soft almost like a feather.</li>
            <li>This brush makes your face really really soft, like a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting firmer bristles, but it has extremely soft ones.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get one with soft plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nicely soft so don&#x27;t irritate my face</li>
            <li>It feels soft and not abrasive on my skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted a soft brush as my skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>The light green handled brush pictured when I purchased is not what arrived.  </li>
            <li>I chose this because it was made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the older ones.</li>
            <li>The new one looks different and is way too soft.</li>
            <li>First, my brush was different from the one pictured, it had a long handle on it.  </li>
            <li>I just got the brush today and as soon as I used it I saw a major difference in my complexion</li>
            <li>Pleased with results but part with bristles broke in half after less than 2 weeks use.</li>
            <li>At the same time it&#x27;s not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s not doing anything.  </li>
            <li>This one is the longest lasting so far.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be the same brush, but the bristles are too soft to do anything.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to not irritate acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good brush, but maybe a little too weak for some people/</li>
            <li>It was a newer version with a clear handle, very long, too soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>Its soft as well hard enough to clean the face and it reaches everywhere.</li>
            <li>The brush was a little smaller than expected but adding a complexion brush to your daily regimen makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>It is just soft enough yet hard enough to clean your face.</li>
            <li>This brush feels too soft, or maybe the bristles are too long, it just feels like I&#x27;m running the bristles along my skin rather scrubbing my skin and creating lather.</li>
            <li>The older brush was green and this one was clear.</li>
            <li>With my old face brush, after I used it, my moisturizer would sting my face, which told me that the old brush was putting little tiny cuts all over my face.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that using this brush would just cause more tiny, microscopic cuts on my face that would open up my skin and make it vulnerable to even more bacteria.</li>
            <li> I have some other brushes at home, and they&#x27;re very soft, almost velvety, but were getting a little too old for my liking.</li>
            <li> This brush feel a little rough, the bristles are less dense and doesn&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old face brush (by Origins) whose bristles were too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin that feels dry despite it.</li>
            <li> I saw someone said it is too rough, and I can&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li> Durable, not pretty, but does its job.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it never feels to rough.</li>
            <li> but with in 30 days the brissels were all matted down and is very close to useless at this point.</li>
            <li> It went in the trash before I even put the packaging down.</li>
            <li> It helps to exfoliate without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I bought the one pictured a few years ago</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it in the eye area cuz its too hard for that area, as will any other brush be.</li>
            <li> that my wider headed face brushes could not easily get to.</li>
            <li> It was impossibly to feel the brush go into the pores, I just felt the foam gently washing my face</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes based on the picture and using them in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Shiseido facial brushes along with their products but find them too expensive nowadays.</li>
            <li> It was also within my budget, there was no need to spend a lot of money for a fancy and expensive facial brush.  </li>
            <li> It cleans makeup well but do not use around eye area as it will scratch delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Comes with a plastic cover which would be bad to loose.</li>
            <li> Really tough bristles, the wood got mildewy in the shower, and the bristles fell out continuously.</li>
            <li> I was sick of using wash cloths that can be a bit rough and tug the skin.</li>
            <li> I lost mine sadly</li>
            <li> Not recommended :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wrong!!!!</li>

            <li> I saw someone said it is too rough, and I can&#x27;t believe it!  I have super sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t use any face washing sponges or wash clothes ( unless it&#x27;s for a baby ) without my skin getting red and irritated.  This brush feels too soft, or maybe the bristles are too long, it just feels like I&#x27;m running the bristles along my skin rather scrubbing my skin and creating lather.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be exfoliating at all. Feels nice, but not very effective for cleansing. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old face brush (by Origins) whose bristles were too stiff.  With my old face brush, after I used it, my moisturizer would sting my face, which told me that the old brush was putting little tiny cuts all over my face.  This brush by Happy Face is just perfect.  It&#x27;s much softer than my old brush and my face feels good afterward.  At the same time it&#x27;s not so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s not doing anything.  My face feels so much cleaner than washing with just my hands or a wash cloth!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes based on the picture and using them in the past. What I got was something different. The bristles are way to soft!!! The older brush was green and this one was clear. Please bring back the older ones.</li>
            <li> Had a great deal of trouble finding a complexion brush.  The Happy Face complexion Brush fills the bill.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping to include it when i use my cleanser for my skin. I  was thinking the bristels would be a little bit more resistant. The bristels are extremely soft almost like a feather. I think it is a good brush, but maybe a little too weak for some people/</li>
            <li> One star may seem like a harsh review for this product, but it really is rather cheap. I have some other brushes at home, and they&#x27;re very soft, almost velvety, but were getting a little too old for my liking. I decided to order this because of the price and the reviews, but the thistles (if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called) are very plastic-y to me. I&#x27;m afraid that using this brush would just cause more tiny, microscopic cuts on my face that would open up my skin and make it vulnerable to even more bacteria. The brush is made in China and looks like something I could have bought at an Asian market for $2. I won&#x27;t be returning it, since they don&#x27;t cover shipping for non-defected items. Not recommended :(</li>
            <li> I use this product to enhance the effectiveness of my facial soap.  It helps to exfoliate without being too harsh.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I kept mine in the shower, and it grew mold. Be sure to let it air dry to prevent this. Maybe it could be made to resist mold as well.</li>
            <li> This brush makes your face really really soft, like a baby&#x27;s face.  I was expecting firmer bristles, but it has extremely soft ones.  It kinda feels like a baby&#x27;s hair brush.  Surprisingly, it works amazing! It removes all the dirt and oil, leaving my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> If one likes a good stiff unyielding brush for exfoliation, this is it. The original reviewers stated this and they were right on with this observation. Durable, not pretty, but does its job.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th face brush I have tried.  This one is the longest lasting so far.  It is soft, but effective.  It is durable &amp; easy to clean.  The smaller head size allows it to more easily penetrate the creases around the nose that my wider headed face brushes could not easily get to. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I just got the brush today and as soon as I used it I saw a major difference in my complexion my face was glowing and my skin tone looked even! Amazing. Definitely a great purchase. Also it came on time (:</li>
            <li> I bought another brush from this maker and thought that was what I was buying again. Wrong!!!! This brush is super soft, too soft in my opinion. I will be trying something else in the future.</li>
            <li> Really tough bristles, the wood got mildewy in the shower, and the bristles fell out continuously. Do yourself a favor and get one with soft plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> This completion brush is Way too soft to do any good....I am very disappointed in this purchase. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this brush.  The bristles are nicely soft so don&#x27;t irritate my face but they still provide a nice massaging action.  It has held up for years and I am ordering a second.</li>
            <li> I love using this in the shower with my face wash and my skin feels smooth after use.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was not the one pictured in the ad. It was not Earth Therapeutics, but April brand, which have seen at Dollar Tree.  For one dollar.  Displeased.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to save money. I have oily skin that feels dry despite it. I used to buy Shiseido facial brushes along with their products but find them too expensive nowadays. I was hoping this would work similarly but it doesn&#x27;t. The Shiseido brush was extremely gently with a very fine comb. It was impossibly to feel the brush go into the pores, I just felt the foam gently washing my face but it would leave my pores perfectly clean. This brush feel a little rough, the bristles are less dense and doesn&#x27;t clean as well so the search continues.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It feels soft and not abrasive on my skin. It was a great value and srrived on time. I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> First, my brush was different from the one pictured, it had a long handle on it.  I wanted a soft brush as my skin is so sensitive and I got exactly what I needed with this product.  With the appropriate skin cleanser, I can already see improvements in my complexion.  It was also within my budget, there was no need to spend a lot of money for a fancy and expensive facial brush.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush, while made quite fine, is quite soft, i&#x27;m sure its too soft to do anything, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because it&#x27;s not so expensive.  It cleans my face, stimulates it and my face feels so good afterwards - a definite yes.</li>
            <li> Its small soft and cute! I use it to remove my face masks and for face washing. Its just what I needed I was sick of using wash cloths that can be a bit rough and tug the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a face brush from the same company earlier this year. I thought this would be the same brush, but the bristles are too soft to do anything. I had to buy another brush instead.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase. This brush is super soft and light weight. It does not irritate my skin. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Item pictured is NOT what I ordered. For the cost, it wasn&#x27;t worth arguing over. It went in the trash before I even put the packaging down.</li>
            <li> The brush was a little smaller than expected but adding a complexion brush to your daily regimen makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft. If you want it to exfoliate it will not. It has very nice bristles and is very comfortable in your hand but a bit too soft for me. I like to scrub my face.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! I use it everyday and it never feels to rough. The best think about it is it doesn&#x27;t cost $60 or $200 dollars like those others which essentially do the same thing. It cleans makeup well but do not use around eye area as it will scratch delicate skin. Use eye make-up remover pads for that area.</li>
            <li> Used it an couple times. Flimsy. Not so good.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial brush. The bristles are soft enough to not irritate acne prone skin. It helps bring your cleanser to a lather. Comes with a plastic cover which would be bad to loose. I lost mine sadly so I have to place my brush in a jar. Cap can come off very easily so be sure to cap it and set the brush down, and not propped against anything. Bristles may stain very easily if using it to remove an herbal facial mask or very colored products. The bristles can also fray and bend very easily if you don&#x27;t take care to cap and store properly after use. Overall it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail today and tried it out. The bristles are a little to soft but other than that, it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li> The light green handled brush pictured when I purchased is not what arrived.  It was a newer version with a clear handle, very long, too soft bristles.  Not the quality of the original brush which I purchased and loved.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of brush for years it was fine soft brissels but with in 30 days the brissels were all matted down and is very close to useless at this point.</li>
            <li> Pleased with results but part with bristles broke in half after less than 2 weeks use. I will not take a chance and buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it was made for sensitive skin. I did my research and this brush was highly recommended. I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t a good brush, but for me, it&#x27;s way too soft even for my skin. I don&#x27;t feel like I could get any sort of a deep exfoliating clean.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the face brush it works great and i love it , great product and now that i know where to get them :-)</li>
            <li> i was very happy with this product. It came very quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again and recommend it to my friends and family. product looks new and works great..</li>
            <li> The item in this picture is not what was shipped; I used to own the green brush and ordered a replacement; the new brush has a clear/white handle and is too soft!</li>
            <li> This brush sure does clean my face. Its soft as well hard enough to clean the face and it reaches everywhere. Don&#x27;t use it in the eye area cuz its too hard for that area, as will any other brush be.</li>
            <li> Perfect facial brush for washing my face.  I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it do a good job, but my complexion looks good too!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten it yet but with the reviews It sounds like a gr8 products.&lt;br /&gt;Im going to use it for these products I bought from Mary Kay I can&#x27;t wait!!!!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft but you can see how it really helps take the makeup/ dirt off your face.</li>
            <li> I bought the one pictured a few years ago and it had worked great for me. I finally decided I should get a new one after the first one had had a good run. I tried to reorder, but what I got once not the same as the one in the picture. The new one looks different and is way too soft. It&#x27;s like night and day compared to one pictured.</li>
            <li> Bought this after my clarisonic died; didnt want to put another 200.00 into buying one so i thought i&#x27;d give this a try; works well; bristles are soft and do a good job; easy to handle and keep clean;  happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and I received it quickly. It is just soft enough yet hard enough to clean your face.</li>
