            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the best Bay Rum try Dominica.</li>
            <li>The smell of this Bay Rum is very good,  though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a man who smells like he bathed in a bottle of cologne and this scent is just incredible but.....</li>
            <li>A great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but it is the aftershave that my wife says smells the best on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>scent, though pleasant, is negligible.</li>
            <li>Read good reviews about it on some shaving websites including BadgerAndBlade.</li>
            <li>And it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good body splash on product after a shower.</li>
            <li>but I SURE DIDN&#x27;T!</li>
            <li>Insofar as a pure after-shave product, it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Nice feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is nice, it grows on you.  </li>
            <li>price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Brand is okay, it is, what it is.</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with this product.     </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, comes from the source, smells the most like bay leaves.</li>
            <li>I love love love this scent on a man</li>
            <li>I DO LOVE THE SCENT -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s heaven and no chemical &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it like most colognes and aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>I use it more as an \\&quot;after-bath\\&quot; fragrance more so than an aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be the most practical aftershave I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the point: you can then apply your favorite scent, if that&#x27;s your thing, without fear of clashing.</li>
            <li>(Of course, the product must be good first and foremost...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good &amp;#34;business as usual&amp;#34; aftershave, one you wear when you&#x27;re not trying to choke out the entire room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to use it when I don&#x27;t shave just for the cool and refreshing scent.     </li>
            <li>Great Product, reminded me of old times.</li>
            <li>It has a very straightforward clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>However she&#x27;s had more fun with the bottle than I&#x27;d ever imagined...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes after a shave you just want something to tighten up your pores and maybe let you know you&#x27;re clean.</li>
            <li>good price is an extra.)  </li>
            <li>Most Master&#x27;s products, and I&#x27;ve tried them all, aren&#x27;t much to write home about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find something so cheap that is also so understated.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pass up a new aftershave, though, that I haven&#x27;t seen before and that smells nice and has the right price.</li>
            <li>A bit of burn at first, but this product actually does really good job at moisturizing and keeping your face supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>next to one another, and most of them won&#x27;t resemble each other to any great extent.</li>
            <li>Hard to find locally has a pleasant smell not too strong in that it gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again simply because I like the shaving gels better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other after shave.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be very cafeful</li>
            <li>how much you spill out.</li>
            <li>must admit though that they really nailed the Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>It does what an aftershave is supposed to do better than any other in my experience--namely, remove razor sting and seal your hide.</li>
            <li>absolutely the finest of the old days brings back memories a scent is very powerful</li>
            <li>I bought this product for it&#x27;s price and classic barbershop fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the sorriest excuse for bay rum I ever splashed on my clean shaven face.</li>
            <li>far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just straight Bay Rum with water and alchohol.</li>
            <li>I think a man actually could bathe in this and would smell just right.</li>
            <li>I never expected her to just go straight for the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of more expensive Bay Rums, but this one works for me better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as the last review claims.</li>
            <li>I suppose that what I&#x27;m saying is that the nature of &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; aftershave is a very subjective moving target, so you sort of need to use several to figure out which--</li>
            <li>With the rather low cost - even with shipping - I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The scent is more subtle and lighter than Clubman&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>Barclay Crocker (Google it) carries it for the cheapest price and has tons of other Bay Rums aftershaves as well, just a heads up to all you other aftershave nuts! :)</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not bad as an average fragrance, but I tend to prefer Clubman&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and you need to use it liberally if you expect the scent to last throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this several months ago in the hope of getting that old time barber shop aroma.</li>
            <li>And if you do have sensetive skin I suggest that you dilute it with a little water to make the alcohol less potent.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild smell that doesn&#x27;t last forever (I have other aftershaves that do), it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and it&#x27;s really hard to put too much on.</li>
            <li>My husband bought this the other day and really likes it.</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li>I like the slight sting, the slight scent, and the slight but effective emollient.</li>
            <li>Not a long lasting smell but seems to do the job as an after shave.  </li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Rum is strange stuff - you can put 20 different &amp;#34;Bay Rums&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And the only time I feel a burn is when my razor is dull and not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The only other bay rum I&#x27;ve tried is made by Clubman, so I&#x27;ll compare Master to that.  </li>
            <li> You get a lot of aftershave for the money, 15 oz, at least enough to last a year if you only put it on after you shave like I do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s burn level is significant when used as an aftershave (reminds me of Lustray), but I tend to thin it out with a few drops of water before applying.  </li>
            <li> use this product in a rotation of three, the other ones being Clubman Pinaud and the Family Dollar Brut knockoff.  </li>
            <li> People at BadgeAndBlade claim a lot less burn than Clubman because of the glycerin  </li>
            <li> Has an odd odor, unlike any bay rum aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday with a staight razor and Porazo shaving cream that I build up with a badger brush.</li>
            <li> It stings for a few seconds and then stops.</li>
            <li> The one bad thing about it is the opening is too large</li>
            <li> botlte broken in package and leaked</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn so much on bad shave days.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> They all burn terribly, this is even worse.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I debated between four or five stars, but decided to give this product the benefit of the doubt.  Insofar as a pure after-shave product, it is excellent.  A bit of burn at first, but this product actually does really good job at moisturizing and keeping your face supple and smooth.  Nice feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is outstanding.  (Of course, the product must be good first and foremost...good price is an extra.)  I picked two bottles up at Sally&#x27;s on closeout for $3.99 per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, it grows on you.  Cinnamon and cloves.  It&#x27;s not heavy, and you need to use it liberally if you expect the scent to last throughout the day.  It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but it is the aftershave that my wife says smells the best on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product in a rotation of three, the other ones being Clubman Pinaud and the Family Dollar Brut knockoff.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of more expensive Bay Rums, but this one works for me better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Give it as a gift, just what they wanted. A great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Brand is okay, it is, what it is. Bay rum is a throwback to my Grandfather and something that I have used for 20 years. Local pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry this anymore so had to rely on online orders.</li>
            <li> botlte broken in package and leaked</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago in the hope of getting that old time barber shop aroma. I&#x27;m still looking for it. This is the sorriest excuse for bay rum I ever splashed on my clean shaven face. The aroma isn&#x27;t there to last to even begin to wear off. All I can say about it is that it does sting when splashed on but so does rubbing alcohol and that smell lasts longer then this Bay Rum. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Sally Beauty. Read good reviews about it on some shaving websites including BadgerAndBlade. All the replies and reviews spoke well of it. I didn&#x27;t have the same luck. I got all kinds of pain. I have three Clubman aftershaves. They all burn terribly, this is even worse. Plus it left my skin feeling tacky and the hand that I put it on with so I had to wash it with water. People at BadgeAndBlade claim a lot less burn than Clubman because of the glycerin  but I SURE DIDN&#x27;T! After putting it on three times it didn&#x27;t make the shave burn go away and still kept burning my skin each time I put it on. The three times were over the course of about 12 hours. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. It cost $9.99 at Sally. It&#x27;s overpriced $2 from the official Sally website. $10.61 with TAX. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I can&#x27;t pass up a new aftershave, though, that I haven&#x27;t seen before and that smells nice and has the right price. The smell of this Bay Rum is very good,  though. You get a lot of aftershave for the money, 15 oz, at least enough to last a year if you only put it on after you shave like I do. 3 stars.     Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with this product.     I&#x27;d like to make it part of my rotation but with it not taking away the burn and even after repeated splashes I just can&#x27;t see that happening. Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to use it when I don&#x27;t shave just for the cool and refreshing scent.     If you&#x27;re looking for the best Bay Rum try Dominica. It doesn&#x27;t burn, comes from the source, smells the most like bay leaves. The one bad thing about it is the opening is too large so you have to be very cafeful how much you spill out. Barclay Crocker (Google it) carries it for the cheapest price and has tons of other Bay Rums aftershaves as well, just a heads up to all you other aftershave nuts! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for it&#x27;s price and classic barbershop fragrance. And after using it for a week I can&#x27;t complain. It doesn&#x27;t burn as much as the last review claims. I shave everyday with a staight razor and Porazo shaving cream that I build up with a badger brush. And the only time I feel a burn is when my razor is dull and not sharp enough. And if you do have sensetive skin I suggest that you dilute it with a little water to make the alcohol less potent.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this the other day and really likes it. It stings for a few seconds and then stops. The smell is not too strong and not too weak. It&#x27;s pleasant smelling and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love love love this scent on a man but it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I don&#x27;t like a man who smells like he bathed in a bottle of cologne and this scent is just incredible but.....doesn&#x27;t last long.  Maybe, like perfume, it&#x27;s different on every man because I bought it for one man and I could smell it on him a lot longer.  I DO LOVE THE SCENT - it&#x27;s heaven and no chemical &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it like most colognes and aftershaves.  I think a man actually could bathe in this and would smell just right.</li>
            <li> Most Master&#x27;s products, and I&#x27;ve tried them all, aren&#x27;t much to write home about. They are quite inexpensive, so no harm done, but they just don&#x27;t have any dimension to them or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit though that they really nailed the Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bay Rum is strange stuff - you can put 20 different &amp;#34;Bay Rums&amp;#34; next to one another, and most of them won&#x27;t resemble each other to any great extent. I suppose that what I&#x27;m saying is that the nature of &amp;#34;Bay Rum&amp;#34; aftershave is a very subjective moving target, so you sort of need to use several to figure out which--if any--you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why I like Master&#x27;s product:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t burn so much on bad shave days.&lt;br /&gt;3) It has a very straightforward clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t overpower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes after a shave you just want something to tighten up your pores and maybe let you know you&#x27;re clean. That&#x27;s what this stuff does. It has a very mild smell that doesn&#x27;t last forever (I have other aftershaves that do), it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and it&#x27;s really hard to put too much on. It&#x27;s a very good &amp;#34;business as usual&amp;#34; aftershave, one you wear when you&#x27;re not trying to choke out the entire room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just straight Bay Rum with water and alchohol. And it smells really good. It&#x27;s rare to find something so cheap that is also so understated.</li>
            <li> Not a long lasting smell but seems to do the job as an after shave.  With the rather low cost - even with shipping - I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The only other bay rum I&#x27;ve tried is made by Clubman, so I&#x27;ll compare Master to that.  The scent is more subtle and lighter than Clubman&#x27;s version.  It&#x27;s lasting power is also a tad shorter, but works well at not overpowering.  I use it more as an \\&quot;after-bath\\&quot; fragrance more so than an aftershave.  It&#x27;s burn level is significant when used as an aftershave (reminds me of Lustray), but I tend to thin it out with a few drops of water before applying.  Overall, it&#x27;s not bad as an average fragrance, but I tend to prefer Clubman&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for my after shaving. However she&#x27;s had more fun with the bottle than I&#x27;d ever imagined... When my dad said this stuff would get me laid being used as after shave. I never expected her to just go straight for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Has an odd odor, unlike any bay rum aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally has a pleasant smell not too strong in that it gets absorbed quickly. Good body splash on product after a shower.</li>
            <li> absolutely the finest of the old days brings back memories a scent is very powerful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any other after shave.  I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again simply because I like the shaving gels better.</li>
            <li> Great Product, reminded me of old times.</li>
            <li> I find this to be the most practical aftershave I have ever used. I like the slight sting, the slight scent, and the slight but effective emollient. It does what an aftershave is supposed to do better than any other in my experience--namely, remove razor sting and seal your hide. The clincher is the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent, though pleasant, is negligible. But that&#x27;s the point: you can then apply your favorite scent, if that&#x27;s your thing, without fear of clashing.</li>
