            <li>While I&#x27;m OK with lavender scent, I can&#x27;t say it is one of my favorites, and I prefer it on a subdued level at best.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant.</li>
            <li>These are pleasant smelling, not overpowering.  </li>

            <li>The Lavender salt bath smells really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Lavender Salt for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
            <li>Even the packaging is nice.</li>

            <li>Nice lavender scent without being too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly and easily and is a great luxury product.</li>
            <li>Plus, it filled the bathroom with a very nice, light scent that was better than any air freshener I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad, I&#x27;m glad...</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the wonderful scent you get the exfoliating action of genuine sea salt.  </li>
            <li>Some bath salts are oily and leave a layer on top - this isn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>If you want it to smell stronger, you can add more.</li>
            <li>I love to use it as a scrub on my feet.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more when I finish wi this bag.  </li>
            <li>the packaging is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>My reason for purchasing this lavender infused product was because I love the lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love to relax with a warm/hot bath when feeling stressed.</li>
            <li>It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to the use in the tub, I also enjoyed using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li>This product works magic in the tub.</li>
            <li>Lavender smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Lavender is one of my favorite herbs.  </li>
            <li>And did I mention that I love the elegant packaging?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product and will always have on hand.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>One of these days, I am going to have to buy for myself. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lavender is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow; not pungent or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a handful of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s wonderful Sleep Lavender salts to turn your bath into a luxurious, relaxing spa experience.</li>
            <li>I love all the San Francisco Salt Company salts I&#x27;ve tried, and perhaps the Sleep Lavender most of all.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>did like it much better when I followed one of the suggested product</li>
            <li>Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the lavender scent was very pleasant and very relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really liked  this product, and think it was worth the price!</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>the plus side, if you like a strong lavender scent, you&#x27;d be pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will have a good night&#x27;s sleep tonight, thanks to Sleep Lavender Bath Salt.</li>
            <li>I love to sit in a jacuzzi and enjoy the relaxing retreat.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you combine a tablespoon or so of the salts with some bath gel or liquid soap, it makes a great exfoliating shower scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Smells good, and really helps you relax</li>
            <li>The bag doesn&#x27;t seal, and bath salts can easily spill out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give this 5 stars since I can&#x27;t fault the product for my lack of a strong affinity for lavender.</li>
            <li>It does make them really smooth.</li>
            <li>REALLY Fabulous products.  </li>
            <li>It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get the benefits of the relaxing, detoxifying soak, but your skin will still feel fabulous after your shower, and you&#x27;ll have the pleasure of the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pre De Provence Bath Salts have a wonderful lavender fragrance that lingers during the entire bath soak and the gentle fragrance lingers on the skin after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make the bath smell very good and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>After a long day at work these bath salts work great to help you unwind</li>
            <li>In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.</li>
            <li>of the indirect benefits of using bath salts is that they serve as a reminder and encouragement to take the time to soak in a tub for pleasure rather than having a hurried shower just to get clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many bath salts, and these are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>And if you have a nice glass of wine, a few lit candles and some good music playing, maybe even longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaging is attractive and would make for a great gift, it has a little opening to sniff the product on the back of the bag</li>
            <li>I  love how gentle it is on the skin too.</li>
            <li>If you like the scent of lavender, as much as I do, you will love the fragrance of these bath salts.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend who needs to relax in a warm tub after a busy day.  </li>
            <li>Despite its size, the package arrived a day early which is always nice.  </li>
            <li>They used a one way valve like the kind used in soft coffee packages.</li>
            <li>The lavender essential oil is pronounced and, I would imagine, of good quality to be so strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more, for sure.</li>
            <li>the salt grains dissolve quickly for a soothing bath in no time.</li>
            <li>such a nice reward for taking that extra time to be good to yourself.</li>
            <li>One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night - it really helps feel and sleep better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find other suggestions on the package - sprinkle some on your feet in the shower, then rub your feet together (nice!) or even add some to your shower gel for a body</li>
            <li>I prefer village naturals relax or calm brands.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Precious scent, completely relaxing.</li>
            <li>This is one is just right.</li>
            <li>The package is very easy to open and reseal and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have the time to take a long bath, and the nice thing about these bath salts is that they can be used in the shower as well.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this product,  worth the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly nice on elbows and feet where there always seems to be dry skin.</li>
            <li>But once I was past that sensitive stage and started becoming larger, the idea of taking the weight off with a relaxing bath started sounding more and more appealing.</li>
            <li>Sleep Lavender makes you feel like you are in a spa, as the salts start to dissolve in the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be: lavender.</li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>So much for lavender&amp;#34;s relaxation benefits!</li>
            <li>The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak helps to ease the headache as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the prefect way to relax before going to sleep, in a hot bath with these San Francisco Bath Salts.</li>
            <li>which is having such a great impact, but the difference between sitting in a regular perfumed bath and relaxing in a tub of this product was marked</li>
            <li>long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the lavender bath salts added a nice touch to the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The salts dissolved easily with no visible residue left at the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggested usage for the bath is 2 large handfuls in a bathtub and then a 20 minute soak.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure luxury, and feels rejuvenating and uplifts the soul.</li>
            <li>Definitely Gift Worthy!</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Also the prices were quite reasonable considering the the ingredients used to make their products.</li>
            <li>Very medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>The second photo shows the bag the salts came in, the salt has a light purple color.</li>
            <li>I take a bath, crawl into bed and fall fast asleep.</li>
            <li>Thanks for that.</li>
            <li>It freshens the whole room.</li>
            <li>salts make for a very relaxing bath soak.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them, as it was a gift, but am curious to know if these are in fact superior in their absorption or health properties than your basic salts.  </li>
            <li>B0091IZQGK Rose Dead Sea Bath Salts 2lb Bag]],</li>
            <li>As the rose colored salts turn to a pale purple color as they dissolve in the water, the aroma of lavender rises up and smoothes out the wrinkles of a stressful day.</li>
            <li>I am seven months pregnant and avoided bathing during the first four months of pregnancy because of some potential risks to the baby.</li>
            <li>These superb quality sea salts include the lavender essential oil, as well as vitamin E, and aloe vera, so your skin is moisturized by the oils while it is exfoliated by the salts; the results are a velvety feel to your skin, and if you don&#x27;t want to take a long soak in the tub, you can add a little of the salts to your shower gel, or sprinkle some on your soapy wash cloth.</li>
            <li>handful added to a tub of hot water fills the air with the natural lavender scent, which is very calming.  </li>
            <li>Highly scented but very mellow and relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Lovely aroma and it truly does calm the soul as well as the body with the added essential oils and they were careful on the carrier oils&lt;</li>
            <li>I use them nearly evening night in a hot bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to spoil yourself once in a while, especially after a hectic week or a rough day.  </li>
            <li>A little strong at first</li>
            <li>I push myself in a physical amd mental capacity while playing roller derby, this is a great unwind after a long practice or bout.</li>
            <li>- all of my muscles felt more relaxed, I had less round ligament pain, and I had a better night&#x27;s sleep on the evenings I used this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the scent, when diluted with the shower water, was no where near as intense as it was in the tub.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made with premium Pacific sea salts with pure lavender essential oil, you can tell it&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a really pure product with nice ingredients, I&#x27;m confused why they had to add coloring.</li>
            <li>Obviously, it is important to me to avoid any unnatural chemicals in the bath, so the ingredients list of these bath salts was extremely appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade</li>
            <li>The roughness of the salts removes old dead skin cells and my skin looks more luminous after using them.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back.</li>
            <li>Light a candle, turn down the lights, and listen to music for an experience that soothes the soul as well as the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ths bath salt is a bit too strongly scented for me, even when using less than the recommended \\&quot;large handful\\&quot; for a regular bath (two handfuls are recommended for a \\&quot;therapy bath\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second review...  Still enjoyed the lavender, but the 2lb bag doesn&#x27;t go far enough as I have a big tub.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t enough to make the bath water noticeably red once the tub is full.</li>
            <li>Seems like something like that , all epsom salts would be more or less equal.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Salt 20 Lbs Fine Grain]]</li>
            <li>Pure bath salts with essential oils in them, San Francisco Bath Salt Company has created relaxation in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many less expensive products that did a whole lot more.</li>
            <li>Great product but the packaging is disappointing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much, which makes the bag really last.</li>
            <li>My San Francisco Bath Salts arrived early..  </li>
            <li>I have had my first bath with Lavender Bath Salt tonight, after a long run.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft after getting out of this bath</li>
            <li>The salts completely dissolved.  </li>
            <li>Pretty ridiculous to charge this much without emphasizing exactly what we are getting over the $1.50 for 4 lbs epsom salts from the store.  </li>
            <li>(you can locate it by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo).</li>
            <li>Francisco Salt Company makes a variety of high quality salts, and the health benefits are enormous.</li>
            <li>Compared to store epsoms, I paid 4x as much for half as much.  </li>
            <li>the product is fine, but much more expensive than other bath salt, it only cost 2$ in nearby store.</li>
            <li>Gave this as a gift to a lavender-loving young woman of 26 who reported back</li>
            <li>This bath salt contains natural sea salt with lavandin essential oil, glycerin, vitamin E, and aloe vera leaf juice to condition and protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not crazy about the smell of lavender, there are several other bath salts made by this company such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Helps her calm down after a long day.</li>
            <li>The lavender really calms you down on those stressful days.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water).</li>

            <li> The plastic is a nearly perfect barrier; I can&#x27;t smell any lavender with the bag sealed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>

            <li> They help release the toxins your body takes in (this is especially true of us city dwellers!)</li>
            <li> They are all great, but I loved this one the best, probably because of the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> Their products are exceptional!</li>

            <li> /&gt;It also comes very nicely packaged in a bag with a \\&quot;scent button\\&quot; that allows you to get an idea of what it smells like before using it.</li>
            <li> Sleep lavenders smell is wonderful, and does not have an overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the scent of lavender better than pain killers for headache relief and a wonderful relaxer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m OK with lavender scent, I can&#x27;t say it is one of my favorites, and I prefer it on a subdued level at best.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant.</li>
            <li> These are pleasant smelling, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These bath salts are the nicest I&#x27;ve seen, relatively fine grained so that they dissolve easily, wonderfully scented.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a lavendar bath salt that I loved.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good buy.  </li>
            <li> Good size bag for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for Xmas too.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a shower person than a bath person, but the sleep lavender bath salts are a great product for showering as well as for tub baths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with Lavender Salt and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The Lavender salt bath smells really nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Lavender Salt for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li> And just like in the bath, it makes the shower and the whole bathroom smell wonderful.  </li>

            <li> Nice lavender scent without being too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It dissolves quickly and easily and is a great luxury product.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;m glad, I&#x27;m glad...</li>
            <li> My favorite.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the wonderful scent you get the exfoliating action of genuine sea salt.  </li>
            <li> Some bath salts are oily and leave a layer on top - this isn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> If you want it to smell stronger, you can add more.</li>
            <li> I love to use it as a scrub on my feet.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more when I finish wi this bag.  </li>
            <li> the packaging is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing this lavender infused product was because I love the lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love to relax with a warm/hot bath when feeling stressed.</li>
            <li> It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to the use in the tub, I also enjoyed using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This product works magic in the tub.</li>
            <li> Lavender smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite herbs.  </li>
            <li> And did I mention that I love the elegant packaging?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product and will always have on hand.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> One of these days, I am going to have to buy for myself. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lavender is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow; not pungent or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a handful of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s wonderful Sleep Lavender salts to turn your bath into a luxurious, relaxing spa experience.</li>
            <li> I love all the San Francisco Salt Company salts I&#x27;ve tried, and perhaps the Sleep Lavender most of all.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li> did like it much better when I followed one of the suggested product</li>
            <li> Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the lavender scent was very pleasant and very relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really liked  this product, and think it was worth the price!</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> the plus side, if you like a strong lavender scent, you&#x27;d be pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will have a good night&#x27;s sleep tonight, thanks to Sleep Lavender Bath Salt.</li>
            <li> I love to sit in a jacuzzi and enjoy the relaxing retreat.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you combine a tablespoon or so of the salts with some bath gel or liquid soap, it makes a great exfoliating shower scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and really helps you relax</li>
            <li> The bag doesn&#x27;t seal, and bath salts can easily spill out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this 5 stars since I can&#x27;t fault the product for my lack of a strong affinity for lavender.</li>
            <li> It does make them really smooth.</li>
            <li> REALLY Fabulous products.  </li>
            <li> It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is fantastic.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get the benefits of the relaxing, detoxifying soak, but your skin will still feel fabulous after your shower, and you&#x27;ll have the pleasure of the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pre De Provence Bath Salts have a wonderful lavender fragrance that lingers during the entire bath soak and the gentle fragrance lingers on the skin after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to make the bath smell very good and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> After a long day at work these bath salts work great to help you unwind</li>
            <li> In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.</li>
            <li> of the indirect benefits of using bath salts is that they serve as a reminder and encouragement to take the time to soak in a tub for pleasure rather than having a hurried shower just to get clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many bath salts, and these are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> And if you have a nice glass of wine, a few lit candles and some good music playing, maybe even longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging is attractive and would make for a great gift, it has a little opening to sniff the product on the back of the bag</li>
            <li> I  love how gentle it is on the skin too.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of lavender, as much as I do, you will love the fragrance of these bath salts.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who needs to relax in a warm tub after a busy day.  </li>
            <li> Despite its size, the package arrived a day early which is always nice.  </li>
            <li> They used a one way valve like the kind used in soft coffee packages.</li>
            <li> The lavender essential oil is pronounced and, I would imagine, of good quality to be so strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more, for sure.</li>
            <li> the salt grains dissolve quickly for a soothing bath in no time.</li>
            <li> such a nice reward for taking that extra time to be good to yourself.</li>
            <li> One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night - it really helps feel and sleep better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find other suggestions on the package - sprinkle some on your feet in the shower, then rub your feet together (nice!) or even add some to your shower gel for a body</li>
            <li> I prefer village naturals relax or calm brands.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Precious scent, completely relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is one is just right.</li>
            <li> The package is very easy to open and reseal and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have the time to take a long bath, and the nice thing about these bath salts is that they can be used in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this product,  worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly nice on elbows and feet where there always seems to be dry skin.</li>
            <li> But once I was past that sensitive stage and started becoming larger, the idea of taking the weight off with a relaxing bath started sounding more and more appealing.</li>
            <li> Sleep Lavender makes you feel like you are in a spa, as the salts start to dissolve in the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be: lavender.</li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> So much for lavender&amp;#34;s relaxation benefits!</li>
            <li> The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains.</li>
            <li> I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak helps to ease the headache as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the prefect way to relax before going to sleep, in a hot bath with these San Francisco Bath Salts.</li>
            <li> which is having such a great impact, but the difference between sitting in a regular perfumed bath and relaxing in a tub of this product was marked</li>
            <li> long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the lavender bath salts added a nice touch to the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The salts dissolved easily with no visible residue left at the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suggested usage for the bath is 2 large handfuls in a bathtub and then a 20 minute soak.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure luxury, and feels rejuvenating and uplifts the soul.</li>
            <li> Definitely Gift Worthy!</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Also the prices were quite reasonable considering the the ingredients used to make their products.</li>
            <li> Very medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> The second photo shows the bag the salts came in, the salt has a light purple color.</li>
            <li> I take a bath, crawl into bed and fall fast asleep.</li>
            <li> Thanks for that.</li>
            <li> It freshens the whole room.</li>
            <li> salts make for a very relaxing bath soak.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them, as it was a gift, but am curious to know if these are in fact superior in their absorption or health properties than your basic salts.  </li>
            <li> B0091IZQGK Rose Dead Sea Bath Salts 2lb Bag]],</li>
            <li> As the rose colored salts turn to a pale purple color as they dissolve in the water, the aroma of lavender rises up and smoothes out the wrinkles of a stressful day.</li>
            <li> I am seven months pregnant and avoided bathing during the first four months of pregnancy because of some potential risks to the baby.</li>
            <li> These superb quality sea salts include the lavender essential oil, as well as vitamin E, and aloe vera, so your skin is moisturized by the oils while it is exfoliated by the salts; the results are a velvety feel to your skin, and if you don&#x27;t want to take a long soak in the tub, you can add a little of the salts to your shower gel, or sprinkle some on your soapy wash cloth.</li>
            <li> handful added to a tub of hot water fills the air with the natural lavender scent, which is very calming.  </li>
            <li> Highly scented but very mellow and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> Lovely aroma and it truly does calm the soul as well as the body with the added essential oils and they were careful on the carrier oils&lt;</li>
            <li> I use them nearly evening night in a hot bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to spoil yourself once in a while, especially after a hectic week or a rough day.  </li>
            <li> A little strong at first</li>
            <li> I push myself in a physical amd mental capacity while playing roller derby, this is a great unwind after a long practice or bout.</li>
            <li> - all of my muscles felt more relaxed, I had less round ligament pain, and I had a better night&#x27;s sleep on the evenings I used this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the scent, when diluted with the shower water, was no where near as intense as it was in the tub.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made with premium Pacific sea salts with pure lavender essential oil, you can tell it&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a really pure product with nice ingredients, I&#x27;m confused why they had to add coloring.</li>
            <li> Obviously, it is important to me to avoid any unnatural chemicals in the bath, so the ingredients list of these bath salts was extremely appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade</li>
            <li> The roughness of the salts removes old dead skin cells and my skin looks more luminous after using them.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back.</li>
            <li> Light a candle, turn down the lights, and listen to music for an experience that soothes the soul as well as the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ths bath salt is a bit too strongly scented for me, even when using less than the recommended \\&quot;large handful\\&quot; for a regular bath (two handfuls are recommended for a \\&quot;therapy bath\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second review...  Still enjoyed the lavender, but the 2lb bag doesn&#x27;t go far enough as I have a big tub.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t enough to make the bath water noticeably red once the tub is full.</li>
            <li> Seems like something like that , all epsom salts would be more or less equal.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt 20 Lbs Fine Grain]]</li>
            <li> Pure bath salts with essential oils in them, San Francisco Bath Salt Company has created relaxation in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many less expensive products that did a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> Great product but the packaging is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much, which makes the bag really last.</li>
            <li> My San Francisco Bath Salts arrived early..  </li>
            <li> I have had my first bath with Lavender Bath Salt tonight, after a long run.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft after getting out of this bath</li>
            <li> The salts completely dissolved.  </li>
            <li> Pretty ridiculous to charge this much without emphasizing exactly what we are getting over the $1.50 for 4 lbs epsom salts from the store.  </li>
            <li> (you can locate it by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo).</li>
            <li> Francisco Salt Company makes a variety of high quality salts, and the health benefits are enormous.</li>
            <li> Compared to store epsoms, I paid 4x as much for half as much.  </li>
            <li> the product is fine, but much more expensive than other bath salt, it only cost 2$ in nearby store.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to a lavender-loving young woman of 26 who reported back</li>
            <li> This bath salt contains natural sea salt with lavandin essential oil, glycerin, vitamin E, and aloe vera leaf juice to condition and protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not crazy about the smell of lavender, there are several other bath salts made by this company such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Helps her calm down after a long day.</li>
            <li> The lavender really calms you down on those stressful days.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water).</li>
            <li> that if you don&#x27;t like flowery scents, San Francisco Bath Salt Company offers other salts with different scents, for example Muscle Soak Bath Salts which smells minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure I really need those extra ingredients (</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little strong for me; because of past experience that I had with lavender I decided to mix it with a little of my fragrance that I use to sell to my customers.</li>
            <li> a long day...</li>
            <li> sleep lavender bath salts package suggested several ways to use the salts, and one of them was to sprinkle the salts over wet feet and rub the feet together for a massage and foot refresher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I bathe regularly under ordinary circumstances using highly scented bath bombs from Lush, I was shocked at how much of a difference this lavender sea salt product made in having a relaxing effect.</li>
            <li> I only add about half a cup, if that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last night after a very tough week and a working Saturday, I couldn&#x27;t sleep, so I put a cup of lavender salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> They even put little samples of their different gourmet salts in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other salts that dry my skin or leave a residue, these salts do not.</li>
            <li> usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Walgreens salts are much less expensive and in a larger bag (although not as pretty).</li>
            <li> A long soak soothes tired muscles and leaves the skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> Where San Francisco went a little strange is the use of FD&amp;C coloring.</li>

            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers about how the scent of the bath salts disappear in less than 5 minutes.  </li>

            <li> This smells divine! And the bath salts themselves, are so relaxing! I just discovered this company &amp; they are fantastic! Their products are exceptional!</li>
            <li> worst smell ever had. Not fuctioning as described.</li>
            <li> Love these salts.  I do a therapeutic soak once a week.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to a lavender-loving young woman of 26 who reported back it was the best lavender bubble bath fragrance she has ever luxuriated &amp;#34;inn&amp;#34;. And &amp;#34; I&#x27;m so glad, I&#x27;m so glad, I&#x27;m glad, I&#x27;m glad, I&#x27;m glad...&amp;#34; - Cream</li>
            <li> Great product! Made me feel nice and relaxed</li>
            <li> My favorite.  This is a reorder.  Nice lavender scent without being too overwhelming.  Well packaged.  Quick delivery.  I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This isbthe best lavenderbath salt ever. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps soothe my sore muscles and makes for a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> So many bath salts either do not smell at all or have horrible perfume smell. This is one is just right. I get into my bath, close my eyes and I fell like I am in the middle of the lavender meadow. Very relaxing. I  love how gentle it is on the skin too.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of lavender, as much as I do, you will love the fragrance of these bath salts.  Aside from the wonderful scent you get the exfoliating action of genuine sea salt.  These salts make a great addition to a relaxing pre bedtime soak in the tub.  And the packaging for these salts is also quite nifty.</li>
            <li> This will take the sting out of even the worst day! I love entering my bathtub when it smells this good...and boy do I sleep well afterwards. Precious scent, completely relaxing. As well, I add magnesium salts to the tub just to spike my magnesium intake. Additionally relaxing! Sleep well and relax!</li>
            <li> I love to sit in a jacuzzi and enjoy the relaxing retreat.  Sleep lavenders smell is wonderful, and does not have an overwhelming smell.  Sleep Lavender makes you feel like you are in a spa, as the salts start to dissolve in the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my cares, aches and pains start to dissolve as I unwind for 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked  this product, and think it was worth the price!</li>
            <li> Lovely aroma and it truly does calm the soul as well as the body with the added essential oils and they were careful on the carrier oils&lt;br /&gt;they add to the miss. you just don&#x27;t want to get out. the  company is a joy to work with and I look forward to working with them&lt;br /&gt;again. Also the prices were quite reasonable considering the the ingredients used to make their products. Soak in piece and quiet&lt;br /&gt;after a long day...ahhh&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a lavendar bath salt that I loved. This one I love! It doesn&#x27;t take much to make the bath smell very good and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I&#x27;ve had other salts that dry my skin or leave a residue, these salts do not. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This bath salt contains natural sea salt with lavandin essential oil, glycerin, vitamin E, and aloe vera leaf juice to condition and protect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A handful added to a tub of hot water fills the air with the natural lavender scent, which is very calming.  A long soak soothes tired muscles and leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the indirect benefits of using bath salts is that they serve as a reminder and encouragement to take the time to soak in a tub for pleasure rather than having a hurried shower just to get clean.  Light a candle, turn down the lights, and listen to music for an experience that soothes the soul as well as the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A review sample was provided by the San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> I am seven months pregnant and avoided bathing during the first four months of pregnancy because of some potential risks to the baby. But once I was past that sensitive stage and started becoming larger, the idea of taking the weight off with a relaxing bath started sounding more and more appealing. Obviously, it is important to me to avoid any unnatural chemicals in the bath, so the ingredients list of these bath salts was extremely appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I bathe regularly under ordinary circumstances using highly scented bath bombs from Lush, I was shocked at how much of a difference this lavender sea salt product made in having a relaxing effect. I&#x27;m not sure whether it is the lavender essential oil, or the minerals in the sea salt which is having such a great impact, but the difference between sitting in a regular perfumed bath and relaxing in a tub of this product was marked - all of my muscles felt more relaxed, I had less round ligament pain, and I had a better night&#x27;s sleep on the evenings I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is attractive and would make for a great gift, it has a little opening to sniff the product on the back of the bag so you can smell it without opening it, and it has a square bottom so it sits upright on the shelf. It dissolves quickly and easily and is a great luxury product. This would make a great gift for anyone undergoing a stressful time in their life. If you&#x27;re interested in reading about the benefits of using sea salt or essential oil in your bath, do a quick internet search for \\&quot;Mark&#x27;s Daily Apple\\&quot; and \\&quot;how to take a better bath\\&quot; for links to some scientific studies that show the benefits of bathing with this type of product.</li>
            <li> Pretty ridiculous to charge this much without emphasizing exactly what we are getting over the $1.50 for 4 lbs epsom salts from the store.  Some lavender?  Compared to store epsoms, I paid 4x as much for half as much.  Haven&#x27;t used them, as it was a gift, but am curious to know if these are in fact superior in their absorption or health properties than your basic salts.  Seems like something like that , all epsom salts would be more or less equal.</li>
            <li> After a long day at work these bath salts work great to help you unwind</li>
            <li> These bath salts make for a relaxing bath soak. The lavender can lull you into a dream-like state as your mind takes leave.</li>
            <li> 2lbs is not enough of these.....</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a filler for a baby shower momento. It smells so good! I don&#x27;t do baths but if I did I would use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many bath salts, and these are my favorite so far. Some bath salts are oily and leave a layer on top - this isn&#x27;t like that. I don&#x27;t use much, which makes the bag really last. The scent is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be: lavender. If you want it to smell stronger, you can add more. I only add about half a cup, if that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. I just ordered another one!</li>
            <li> It smell very nice. I love to use it as a scrub on my feet. It does make them really smooth.</li>
            <li> Scented bath salts smell and feel luxurious after a hard, 10-hour day on the assembly line!</li>
            <li> I have been into lavendar bath salts, shampoo, conditioner lately.  This seems to be a good buy.  Others raved about the packaging, but I am not impressed with the packaging at all.</li>
            <li> This product  iss delightful to use.  The fragrance is light and refreshing. Using it as a bath salt is relaxing. I plan to order more when I finish wi this bag.  Thank you San Francisco salt company</li>
            <li> Very medicinal smell. I prefer village naturals relax or calm brands. Ahava also makes bath salts that smell great.</li>
            <li> First of all... the packaging is absolutely adorable. The fragrance is a little strong for me; because of past experience that I had with lavender I decided to mix it with a little of my fragrance that I use to sell to my customers. Overall, this product deserves 5 stars x 2!</li>
            <li> the product is fine, but much more expensive than other bath salt, it only cost 2$ in nearby store.</li>
            <li> WOW! The smells take you away to a spa retreat the moment the salts hit the warm water of your tub...your aches and worries slowly vanish with a few deep breaths after a long day. I push myself in a physical amd mental capacity while playing roller derby, this is a great unwind after a long practice or bout. Highly Recommend this product,  worth the price!</li>
            <li> The wife loves it! Helps her calm down after a long day. Also doesnt smell all that bad. A little strong at first</li>
            <li> I decided on the 2 star ranking because I feel this in an inferior product as compared to the other brands of lavender bath salts I&#x27;ve previously used. The salt used in this product may or may not be beneficial - no way to compare. My reason for purchasing this lavender infused product was because I love the lavender fragrance. The fragrance disappears within 5 minutes when diluted in lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because I liked the value pack two pound size. I also buy my gourmet salts from SFBC. I didn&#x27;t like the fact the fragrance dissipated by the time the bath crystals dissolved. I love to relax with a warm/hot bath when feeling stressed. SFSC&#x27;s lavender fragrance is GONE within minutes. So much for lavender&amp;#34;s relaxation benefits! I especially love Pre De Provence Lavender Bath Salts. I should never have switched brands. I thought I was getting a comparative product for less money. Pre De Provence Bath Salts have a wonderful lavender fragrance that lingers during the entire bath soak and the gentle fragrance lingers on the skin after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a shower person than a bath person, but the sleep lavender bath salts are a great product for showering as well as for tub baths. For my nighttime shower, I use a body wash that has the consistency of shaving cream. To a handful of the body wash, I added about a teaspoon of the sleep lavender bath salts and worked them together for a few seconds, then scrubbed up. Until the bath salts dissolved, they had a mild exfoliating effect, and the lavender scent was very pleasant and very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleep lavender bath salts package suggested several ways to use the salts, and one of them was to sprinkle the salts over wet feet and rub the feet together for a massage and foot refresher. I tried this while showering, and my feet felt wonderful, plus the soothing effects of the lavender aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long, steamy hot shower before going to bed is one of those little luxuries that I love, and the lavender bath salts added a nice touch to the shower. Note that I&#x27;ve also used the San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s muscle soak product in the same way, and it&#x27;s a similar experience, except with a peppermint scent instead of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who needs to relax in a warm tub after a busy day.  She was delighted to receive the lavender salts, and after reading the contents, was even more pleased.</li>
            <li> My San Francisco Bath Salts arrived early..  and I couldn&#x27;t wait to use them..  They are all great, but I loved this one the best, probably because of the lavender scent.  REALLY Fabulous products.  I&#x27;ll be back for more, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back and after a couple of back surgeries I learned a number strategies that help my back feel better. One of them is a 10 minute hot bath every night - it really helps feel and sleep better. Recently I included Sleep Lavender Bath Salts from San Francisco Bath Salt Company into my routine. I love it! The Lavender salt bath smells really nice. I don&#x27;t like strong scents and this one was just right for me - not too strong yet noticeable. It made my soak more luxurious and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Note that if you don&#x27;t like flowery scents, San Francisco Bath Salt Company offers other salts with different scents, for example Muscle Soak Bath Salts which smells minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a collage of three photos (you can locate it by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo). The first photo shows salt in my hand, you can see the size and texture of the salt grains. The second photo shows the bag the salts came in, the salt has a light purple color. The third photo shows salt as it begins to melt in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the hot soak reduces pain and relieve muscle cramps in my back. I also found that if I have a migraine a hot soak helps to ease the headache as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use one or two hand fulls of salt per bath, so one 2 pound bag will last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an evaluation bag of Lavender Salt for evaluation and an honest review. I have been using salt soaks for a couple of weeks now. In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit. I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water). It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the use in the tub, I also enjoyed using a bit of salt as skin exfoliator. It works nicely providing a gentle scrub and massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with Lavender Salt and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewontinue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This product works magic in the tub. It smells awesome and relaxes you in the process. Something you should stay stocked with.</li>
            <li> I have started taking baths at night instead of showering in the morning. I started this after my cat was sick and needed special care in the morning. These bath salts are heavenly. I take a bath, crawl into bed and fall fast asleep.</li>
            <li> I bought Sleep Lavender Bath Salt by San Francisco Salt Company along with their Epsoak Epsom Salt product. Despite its size, the package arrived a day early which is always nice.  They even put little samples of their different gourmet salts in the package. Thanks for that. I have had my first bath with Lavender Bath Salt tonight, after a long run. It was soothing and relaxing. Lavender smells lovely. I am sure I will have a good night&#x27;s sleep tonight, thanks to Sleep Lavender Bath Salt.</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite herbs.  I use it dried to cook with, keep little sachets of it in my folded blankets and adore lavender bath products, so I was in heaven when a bag of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00AYNNX34 Sleep Lavender Bath Salts 2 Lbs]] arrived on my doorstep.  I&#x27;ve found the scent of lavender better than pain killers for headache relief and a wonderful relaxer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bath salts are the nicest I&#x27;ve seen, relatively fine grained so that they dissolve easily, wonderfully scented.  And did I mention that I love the elegant packaging?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been spoiling myself with a couple of handfuls dissolved in my footbath every evening.  You&#x27;ll find other suggestions on the package - sprinkle some on your feet in the shower, then rub your feet together (nice!) or even add some to your shower gel for a body scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - I love these top-of-the-line bath salts! You will too.  Definitely Gift Worthy!</li>
            <li> Good size bag for the price. Smells wonderful! Has a very strong lavender scent</li>
            <li> Wonderful bath salts. They smell amazing and dissolve quickly. Even the packaging is nice. I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from San Francisco Bath Salt Co.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about the fragrance of lavender that relaxes and reminds me of a field in Provence in the South of France. It&#x27;s the prefect way to relax before going to sleep, in a hot bath with these San Francisco Bath Salts. I find that the fragrance lingers, even the next day. It freshens the whole room. I don&#x27;t always have the time to take a long bath, and the nice thing about these bath salts is that they can be used in the shower as well. If you combine a tablespoon or so of the salts with some bath gel or liquid soap, it makes a great exfoliating shower scrub that leaves your skin feeling so soft afterwards. The roughness of the salts removes old dead skin cells and my skin looks more luminous after using them. It&#x27;s particularly nice on elbows and feet where there always seems to be dry skin. And just like in the bath, it makes the shower and the whole bathroom smell wonderful.  They&#x27;re made with premium Pacific sea salts with pure lavender essential oil, you can tell it&#x27;s the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not crazy about the smell of lavender, there are several other bath salts made by this company such as [[ASIN:B0091IZQGK Rose Dead Sea Bath Salts 2lb Bag]], [[ASIN:B008X7I234 California Breeze Bath Salts 2lb Bag]] or [[ASIN:B0091LN6K0 Bubble Yum Foaming Bath Salts 2lbs]]. Or if you prefer something with less perfune,  you could also use the [[ASIN:B004GIM68G Minera Dead Sea Salt 20 Lbs Fine Grain]] and still get the nice exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested usage for the bath is 2 large handfuls in a bathtub and then a 20 minute soak.  But who would limit themselves to only 20 minutes when these salts make the bath feel so luxurious? I say, 30 minutes at least. And if you have a nice glass of wine, a few lit candles and some good music playing, maybe even longer. It&#x27;s nice to spoil yourself once in a while, especially after a hectic week or a rough day.  My skin felt so soft after getting out of this bath and I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product by the San Francisco Bath Salt Company for a fair and honest review. It was a good way to be introduced to their fine line of bath salts.e pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product by the San Francisco Bath Salt Company for a fair and honest review. It was a good way to be introduced to their fine line of bath salts.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in my bath water along with baking soda and lavender oil to help with bloated</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order of these bath salts. I use them nearly evening night in a hot bath. The aroma turns my bathroom into a spa!  Love this product and will always have on hand.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are perfect for jetted tubs - no bubbling.  The scent is amazing, which makes your bath heavenly. The lavender really calms you down on those stressful days.  Would definitely buy these again, I think they are the highest quality salts I have found.  No skin irritation either.</li>
            <li> Smell delicious and are a great gift. Also came with a rubber duck for the tub. Good for Xmas too.</li>
            <li> Great product but the packaging is disappointing.  The bag doesn&#x27;t seal, and bath salts can easily spill out.</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers about how the scent of the bath salts disappear in less than 5 minutes.  I, too, like to relax in the tub while smelling the fragrance.  This was very disappointing given the cost of this product and the other reviews. Plus, it didn&#x27;t do anything for softening my skin.  I&#x27;ve used many less expensive products that did a whole lot more.</li>
            <li> Pure bath salts with essential oils in them, San Francisco Bath Salt Company has created relaxation in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is fantastic. The plastic is a nearly perfect barrier; I can&#x27;t smell any lavender with the bag sealed. They used a one way valve like the kind used in soft coffee packages. Squeezing the bag forces a bit of aroma out of that valve. I like the Tiffany blue color of the bag, this looks nice sitting around a bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared this blend to the Walgreens Lavender Epsom salts. The San Francisco bath salt has a stronger lavender smell. The Walgreens salts are much less expensive and in a larger bag (although not as pretty). Where San Francisco went a little strange is the use of FD&amp;C coloring. In a really pure product with nice ingredients, I&#x27;m confused why they had to add coloring. There isn&#x27;t enough to make the bath water noticeably red once the tub is full. In addition to the lavender oil, the salts have glycerin, Vitamin E, and Aloe Vera added. Walgreens went the just salts and lavender route. Not sure I really need those extra ingredients (oddly the other salts from San Francisco don&#x27;t have these added ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts make for a very relaxing bath soak. The aroma is pleasant. The salts do not leave a residue or oily film. I like this product a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly scented but very mellow and relaxing.  The package is very easy to open and reseal and the salt grains dissolve quickly for a soothing bath in no time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Smells good, and really helps you relax</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves this stuff.  One of these days, I am going to have to buy for myself. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the last time I had an Epson salt soak.  Last night after a very tough week and a working Saturday, I couldn&#x27;t sleep, so I put a cup of lavender salts in a hot tub and soaked for twenty minutes.  The salts completely dissolved.  It was better than drugs!  I completely relaxed and was able to do some minor stretching, crack my toes and knuckles and totally fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender is not perfumed, but earthy and mellow; not pungent or overwhelming.  After the bath, I just lay on my bed and felt my skin and muscles actually pulsate.  Needless to say, I had a great night&#x27;s sleep.  I think this is going to be a regular ritual.  There is also an aroma plug on the back so you can test the smell before using.  The package is very attractive and makes for a perfect gift type item.

            <li> It only takes a handful of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s wonderful Sleep Lavender salts to turn your bath into a luxurious, relaxing spa experience. As the rose colored salts turn to a pale purple color as they dissolve in the water, the aroma of lavender rises up and smoothes out the wrinkles of a stressful day. These superb quality sea salts include the lavender essential oil, as well as vitamin E, and aloe vera, so your skin is moisturized by the oils while it is exfoliated by the salts; the results are a velvety feel to your skin, and if you don&#x27;t want to take a long soak in the tub, you can add a little of the salts to your shower gel, or sprinkle some on your soapy wash cloth. You won&#x27;t get the benefits of the relaxing, detoxifying soak, but your skin will still feel fabulous after your shower, and you&#x27;ll have the pleasure of the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco Salt Company makes a variety of high quality salts, and the health benefits are enormous. They help release the toxins your body takes in (this is especially true of us city dwellers!) and combined with the warmth of the water relaxes your muscles. And skin just glows afterwards....such a nice reward for taking that extra time to be good to yourself. I love all the San Francisco Salt Company salts I&#x27;ve tried, and perhaps the Sleep Lavender most of all. It&#x27;s pure luxury, and feels rejuvenating and uplifts the soul. It&#x27;s a sensory, tactile delight.</li>
            <li> These are pleasant smelling, not overpowering.  I enjoyed them.  Second review...  Still enjoyed the lavender, but the 2lb bag doesn&#x27;t go far enough as I have a big tub.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m OK with lavender scent, I can&#x27;t say it is one of my favorites, and I prefer it on a subdued level at best. Ths bath salt is a bit too strongly scented for me, even when using less than the recommended \\&quot;large handful\\&quot; for a regular bath (two handfuls are recommended for a \\&quot;therapy bath\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, if you like a strong lavender scent, you&#x27;d be pleased with this. The lavender essential oil is pronounced and, I would imagine, of good quality to be so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts dissolved easily with no visible residue left at the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like it much better when I followed one of the suggested product uses and tried it as a shower salt. I sprinkled some on the shower floor before turning on the water, and it felt quite nice underfoot. Sort of a massage-type feeling. Plus, the scent, when diluted with the shower water, was no where near as intense as it was in the tub. Plus, it filled the bathroom with a very nice, light scent that was better than any air freshener I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes very nicely packaged in a bag with a \\&quot;scent button\\&quot; that allows you to get an idea of what it smells like before using it. Good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this 5 stars since I can&#x27;t fault the product for my lack of a strong affinity for lavender. It does what it says it will do, and it was quite nice as a shower salt.&lt;br /&gt;[manufacturer provided a sample for review]</li>
