    <ol>
            <li>I used for peach fuzz on face and worked perfect.</li>
            <li>perfectly awesome!</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>This I must say is the best hair bleach</li>
            <li>use this on my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows came out to a bright orange.</li>
            <li>Effective but doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it at this website and not have to go to the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I use this for lightening my eyebrows and it gets the job done perfectly and matches well with my dyed strawberry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>This made my eyebrows match my hair much better and made them look better when I put eyebrow heel on them to define them.</li>
            <li>Love that Amazon has so many options.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much, and I use the same amount of time as with my eyebrows, and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This stuff lightened my eyebrows and works quickly in just three minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tolerable though, and worth it.</li>
            <li>This form of cr&amp;egrave;me bleach is the only kind my wife uses.</li>
            <li>but this bleach will lighten to any shade you want, just time it right.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly like it told me too.</li>
            <li>It allows me to gradually lighten my brows at a slow enough speed that makes them come out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and hair and am very careful not to mess around with bleach, and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Gentile on my very reactive skin.</li>
            <li>My eyes were very irritated the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It still is, regardless of how much exfoliation/moisturizing I do.</li>
            <li>It is a quality brand with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>You would probably need to learn with time what the perfect application time is for you, but always opt for less (as in: go with what they say in the little pamphlet, not a lot more) because the results could be harsh — bleach is still bleach, aloe or no aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As if someone put a huge toilet on my face.</li>
            <li>Follow the instruction, but do not use it for a long time, your brow will be too light.</li>
            <li>Like pre high school, when my mom and sister told me about it.</li>
            <li>, hair felt good, soft, wasn&#x27;t fried, brittle or broken this stuff is surprisingly gentle.</li>
            <li>I have tried other facial hair bleaches, and nothing was quite as good and simple to use as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>Great stuff it works slowly which is good because to fast is bad</li>
            <li>The powder has an ammonia smell but when mixed with the cream is barely noticeable and the scent it does carry is a mild version of hair dye.</li>
            <li>i used this as my first facial bleach.</li>
            <li>Works very well, the only problem is I get a headache from the smell</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin and some eczema issues.  </li>
            <li>you have to shape your brows first and be sure its not super thin because blonde hairs are light and it&#x27;ll look like you have almost no eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I tried toners, blonde shampoo (all high quality ones) to no avail.</li>
            <li>It looks weird in the golden stage and then it pretty much turns translucent.</li>
            <li>The only thing that fixed my skin was a non-acidic peeling cream from Korea.</li>
            <li>After bleaching the second time, the skin under my eyebrows and surrounding them was red and very sensitive.</li>

            <li> I probably shouldn&#x27;t have left it on for so long, but even if you were trying to go to any type of blonde shade, they will be orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a minor thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some dark hair on my upper lip</li>
            <li> I tried one other brand of facial hair bleach and it was harder to use and grainier and took longer, so I&#x27;m sticking with this for life.</li>
            <li> The skin under and around my eyebrows was also very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> , mixing is a bit annoying, since you&#x27;re mixing the cream with powder on a small piece of plastic (and it pretty much goes everywhere), but you can mix it anywhere, and it&#x27;s not hard to get the hang of it and to get used to that.</li>
            <li> is not very useful for me</li>
            <li> Maybe this will work if you only leave it on for a few minutes and your eyebrows are very dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> (Crazy) theirs lol which seems rather painful to me.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are dark black-brown and look sparse because of how pale I am.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a little tingly afterwards but no side effects or irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have some pale skin but also being Armenian</li>
            <li> but I usually wait up to 15 min to get the results that I want.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, slowly and even.</li>
            <li> I decided to bleach my hair and hated dark brows</li>
            <li> Works but smells horrible.</li>

            <li> I use this for lightening my eyebrows and it gets the job done perfectly and matches well with my dyed strawberry blonde hair. Be warned, though, that it will make your brows a reddish color as it lightens.</li>
            <li> This is hg for me. Being Russian I have some pale skin but also being Armenian I have some dark hair on my upper lip haha. I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I can remember. Like pre high school, when my mom and sister told me about it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on exfoliated skin or skin that&#x27;s &amp;#34;too clean&amp;#34; as it will burn or tingle. It&#x27;s tolerable though, and worth it. No one even knows I have a mustache at all. My sister and mother now prefer to tweeze! (Crazy) theirs lol which seems rather painful to me. But they are both hairier than I am. My sisters one complaint is that she doesn&#x27;t like having a glorious golden mustache when the sun hits her face. My answer to that is, leave it on longer! It looks weird in the golden stage and then it pretty much turns translucent. I tried one other brand of facial hair bleach and it was harder to use and grainier and took longer, so I&#x27;m sticking with this for life.</li>
            <li> If I had known this worked so well I would have done this ages ago. Gentile on my very reactive skin. I used for peach fuzz on face and worked perfect.</li>
            <li> Works very well, the only problem is I get a headache from the smell and my skin was red and itchy for a bit</li>
            <li> is not very useful for me</li>
            <li> My eyebrows came out to a bright orange. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have left it on for so long, but even if you were trying to go to any type of blonde shade, they will be orange. I tried toners, blonde shampoo (all high quality ones) to no avail. I dyed over my eyebrows, then rebleached them all in the same day. I knew while doing this that I should wait, but I just couldn&#x27;t. After bleaching the second time, the skin under my eyebrows and surrounding them was red and very sensitive. It stung just to put lotion on it. My eyes were very irritated the rest of the day. The skin under and around my eyebrows was also very dry and flaky. It still is, regardless of how much exfoliation/moisturizing I do. The only thing that fixed my skin was a non-acidic peeling cream from Korea. Maybe this will work if you only leave it on for a few minutes and your eyebrows are very dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> Works but smells horrible. Used it on my brows. As if someone put a huge toilet on my face. Too scared to use again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial hair bleaches, and nothing was quite as good and simple to use as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, mixing is a bit annoying, since you&#x27;re mixing the cream with powder on a small piece of plastic (and it pretty much goes everywhere), but you can mix it anywhere, and it&#x27;s not hard to get the hang of it and to get used to that. It&#x27;s such a minor thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s very good. I have very sensitive skin and hair and am very careful not to mess around with bleach, and this is perfect for me. You would probably need to learn with time what the perfect application time is for you, but always opt for less (as in: go with what they say in the little pamphlet, not a lot more) because the results could be harsh — bleach is still bleach, aloe or no aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote &amp;#34;and then some&amp;#34; because I *sometimes*, in a pinch, use it for root coverup. I don&#x27;t use too much, and I use the same amount of time as with my eyebrows, and it works perfectly! Isn&#x27;t that neat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff lightened my eyebrows and works quickly in just three minutes.  My eyebrows are dark black-brown and look sparse because of how pale I am. This made my eyebrows match my hair much better and made them look better when I put eyebrow heel on them to define them.</li>
            <li> i used this as my first facial bleach. I decided to bleach my hair and hated dark brows so i got this and POOF problem solved. you have to shape your brows first and be sure its not super thin because blonde hairs are light and it&#x27;ll look like you have almost no eyebrows. lol. but this bleach will lighten to any shade you want, just time it right.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, slowly and even. It allows me to gradually lighten my brows at a slow enough speed that makes them come out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product. Effective but doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> This form of cr&amp;egrave;me bleach is the only kind my wife uses. It is a quality brand with a reasonable price. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it at this website and not have to go to the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Did want I expect. Follow the instruction, but do not use it for a long time, your brow will be too light.</li>
            <li> perfectly awesome! does what it says!</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Instructions says to leave on the product for 10 min max but I usually wait up to 15 min to get the results that I want. My skin does feel a little tingly afterwards but no side effects or irritation whatsoever. Will buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly like it told me too. I have dark eyebrows and I wanted to bleach it since my hair was a lighter color. I only got it to go a shade up.</li>
            <li> Did the job with no burning!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has sensitive skin and some eczema issues.  Works great!  Love that Amazon has so many options.</li>
            <li> Great stuff it works slowly which is good because to fast is bad I tested it on a hair swatch made from my hair after it was cut, hair felt good, soft, wasn&#x27;t fried, brittle or broken this stuff is surprisingly gentle. The cream looks like the facial cream in jars and has no overpowering odor. The powder has an ammonia smell but when mixed with the cream is barely noticeable and the scent it does carry is a mild version of hair dye. This I must say is the best hair bleach I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
