            <li>The smell is nice and light too.</li>
            <li>My wife has tried many hair care products and this seems to be \\&quot;THE</li>
            <li>--it is a good, lightweight conditioning product with a useful spray.  </li>
            <li>For me I get better moisture from this product than Lanza oil or Kerastase.</li>
            <li>it is an excellent product for human hair extensions and makes them easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that knots easily.</li>
            <li>I have very tangly hair and this product makes it much more easily to comb through.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this I used it a few times and wasn&#x27;t impressed-</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this product is not bad, but it is quite powerful in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Fabulous and works wonders on my newly relaxed hair!</li>
            <li>After that my hair is really smooth and easy to brush, I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and shiny now and very soft.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as I needed.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product 2 weeks ago and just after the first use, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>this makes combing my hair easier when my hair is wet and adds a nice shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>So, I purchased this at Sally&#x27;s because I always got such great results with their fermodyl leave in treatments and was struggling with very damaged bleached blonde hair.</li>
            <li>very lightweight, works on all hair types.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that gets very frizzy in the summer.</li>
            <li>I keep going back to this as a light weight detangler whether or not I use conditioner in the shower.  </li>
            <li>When I unbraided my hair the next morning, the waves were really defined, shiny and most importantly soft.</li>
            <li>but now the blow dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like straw) and then mist lightly before flat ironing.</li>
            <li>Have not found a better leave in conditioner, and the price is better than the other more expensive salon brands.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and made my hair less frizzy</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and fades completely when dry.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>i originally bought this from my hairdresser but now have found it on amazon for $5.00 less</li>
            <li>not heavy or oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product really does instantly strengthen your hair.</li>
            <li>So, i spray this all over my hair until it&#x27;s completely saturated, brush it out, and let that dray too.</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s dry, I spray just a little more on the gray parts just before I use my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets dry and and weighs down easily.  </li>
            <li>And I have spent hundreds of dollars on very high end products, I have tried everything on the market and this exceeds  everything I have tried by far.</li>
            <li>I have never seen such great results form a hair care product that can also be applied to dry hair without making it feel stocky or thick or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Six months later, I have gone back to a rich brunette but feel like my now dyed hair looked dry and dull.</li>

            <li> It was exactly as I needed.  Have used this product before and it works wonders on stopping breakage.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a number of years....not heavy or oily or greasy.  very lightweight, works on all hair types.  One of my favorite hair products.</li>

            <li> Awesome light weight&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that knots easily. This spray is the best detangler I have ever used. The fragrance is light and fades completely when dry. It does not leave me hair looking oily, even if I overuse it. The spray makes an immediate and positive difference in how difficult it is to get a comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> Use this for 3 people in our house, helps hair keep conditioned after wash. locks in the oils and i love it</li>
            <li> Fabulous and works wonders on my newly relaxed hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product - Actually water it down a bit so it lasts longer but use it every day before blowing my hair out. Smells great and just enough conditioner so your hair isn&#x27;t flat. LOVE it. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have very tangly hair and this product makes it much more easily to comb through.  Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and feel stronger. I also seem to be shedding less as well. One of the best products in my arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(FYI: I am black and have relaxed hair)</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets very frizzy in the summer. I thought this product would help as my hairdresser recommended it to me. It does nothing for my hair &amp; it makes it dry which I don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I love the freshness that it gives my hair.</li>

            <li> Love It, would recommend to everyone who has problem hair. Have used this product for years, best on the market&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again :)</li>

            <li> My wife has tried many hair care products and this seems to be \\&quot;THE ONE.\\&quot; This product keeps her hair very bright, brilliant and fine. I would recommend to the ladies out there...</li>
            <li> Love it, smells awesome</li>

            <li> Bought em twice. I love the smell and made my hair less frizzy</li>
            <li> This review is for the Treatment &amp; Shine 233 Spray. So, I purchased this at Sally&#x27;s because I always got such great results with their fermodyl leave in treatments and was struggling with very damaged bleached blonde hair. When I first purchased this I used it a few times and wasn&#x27;t impressed- so under the cabinet it went. Six months later, I have gone back to a rich brunette but feel like my now dyed hair looked dry and dull. So I rummaged through my storage and came across this product…again. I could KICK myself for every putting this away. My hair looks like fake hair! It is so smooth and shiny now and very soft. It seems to be repairing my over porous hair and giving it strength. After just 2 weeks my hair has had significantly less breakage and is not dry at all. In fact, hair that I was washing every 3-4 days now has to be washed every other day because it is so moisturized it gets oily. This stuff is miraculous. And I have spent hundreds of dollars on very high end products, I have tried everything on the market and this exceeds  everything I have tried by far. For me I get better moisture from this product than Lanza oil or Kerastase. I shake it thoroughly and then mist generously onto damp hair before I blow dry (I was stuck air drying until this product but now the blow dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like straw) and then mist lightly before flat ironing. On second day hair I spritz the dry ends and it refreshes my hair. PLUS it is an excellent product for human hair extensions and makes them easy to comb through. I have never seen such great results form a hair care product that can also be applied to dry hair without making it feel stocky or thick or weighed down. THANK YOU ROUX!</li>
            <li> Great price. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product really does instantly strengthen your hair. I dye my hair a lot, so it is often dry and i avoid showering.However when i dude, once it&#x27;s dry,it seems to act up and take on the consistency of straw. So, i spray this all over my hair until it&#x27;s completely saturated, brush it out, and let that dray too. After that my hair is really smooth and easy to brush, I would definitely recommend the product.</li>
