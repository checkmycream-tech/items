            <li>Awesome brush... reduces drying time...</li>
            <li>VERY IMPRESSED</li>
            <li>I use it in combo with my hairdryer, which seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great brush!</li>
            <li>Very good quality brush...and seller very good</li>
            <li>This is a great idea.</li>
            <li>received the product on time and in great shape.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw it on pinterest and thought it would be great.</li>
            <li>Also I feel it is a great detangle brush too.</li>
            <li>This brush is great.</li>
            <li>It’s a great concept</li>
            <li>Love this brush!!</li>
            <li>GREAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT - TAKES A FAIR BIT OF MOISTURE FROM THE HAIR</li>
            <li>Good idea,</li>
            <li>all is good  mmm .m</li>
            <li>,it is good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good way to wash the cloth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that this does a bit of good in drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>The results were quite surprising.</li>
            <li>and that is a beautiful thing :-)  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this brush to a couple of people and we are all happy with it, but don&#x27;t pay 22$. 12 is more like it.</li>
            <li>A much better deal than a Brazilian and without the chemicals!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brush, it is a life-saver!</li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t a hairdryer, but it&#x27;s an amazing brush that works with a dryer to drastically improve drying time, and the end result of blow drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have straight hair, and I don&#x27;t do anything to it, I might not be the best judge here.</li>
            <li>On top of that though, I found that it greatly reduces static and fly-aways and helps smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, just need read more how to use better</li>
            <li>It is a nice size and glides easily through hair.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and although for me its not about &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; my hair its just wonderful to have a brush detangle so wonderfully without pulling your hair out!</li>
            <li>I did however use the absorbent bits to my advantage though, I sprayed my favorite perfume on it and it disperses through my hair.</li>
            <li>That combo is where the magic happens.</li>
            <li>I got this brush in hopes that I could use it to soak up a bit more water than the towel gets and help with my lack of hair attention.</li>
            <li>but I love this brush.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for the drying factor :)</li>
            <li>You can do better with something else.</li>
            <li>We also have a microfiber turban wrap that does a much better job at soaking up the water.</li>
            <li>I saw this in the store and bought it cause it just looked too interesting to not try out.</li>
            <li>You can find it for $15 in many place and for just under $12 at Target.</li>
            <li>Towel works way way better</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my hair has had way more static since I began using this brush.</li>
            <li>Of course, this means I either go around with weirdo static hair</li>
            <li>The brush is okay.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting better.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to read the directions when u get it</li>
            <li>and youll love it.</li>
            <li>I do notice that the ends of my hair start dripping more after using this brush which leads me to believe that it does work some.  </li>
            <li>but i think they could have used a more absorbent material...</li>
            <li>others seemed to have better outcomes.</li>
            <li>she has 3 more in her cabinet and says she can&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li>My hair has a very fine texture and gets damaged easily when styling.</li>
            <li>Okay this quick style brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but good enough since I have lots of hair and anything that helps is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found this brush easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>pull through my hair easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this item with high hopes and its theory is good.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is worth any more than that.</li>
            <li>This brush has great vents that keep the air flowing through and allow me to put the blowdryer closer to my hair without overheating, plus shorter drying time because of the blue bits, gets me smoother and prettier hair without any additional heat tools after drying.</li>
            <li>It is not anywhere near as good as the&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li>do, however, like large paddle brushes and continue to use it as a normal hairbrush which it does a great job at.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for long very curly hair</li>
            <li>In the end I concluded that a comb through and towel dry was best if you really want to save your hair from heat damage.</li>
            <li>My hair holds lots of moisture and takes so long to style so I am always happy to find a product that helps save me time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Ever since I originally came across this brush, i&#x27;ve wanted it.</li>
            <li>Man I was excited about this brush.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, the problems arose when trying to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li>The product is true to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>It was a nice idea, Goody, but a microfiber towel after shampooing is more effective, and can be easily tossed in the washing machine to clean it and then in the dryer to completely dry it for the next use.</li>
            <li>Now it takes about 10 minutes to blow dry completely and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li>The brush speeds both air drying time and when accompanied by a hairdryer for quick styling.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I had high expectations for this brush.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how well the product works, but it&#x27;s a good brush, bit high priced though, works fine and is big</li>
            <li>Maybe it’d be better for people with more texture to their hair or really long hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own even when it&#x27;s super long so that may be why I didn&#x27;t see anything special there.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean so far and is made well.</li>
            <li>It works OK, but not really any more that just toweling it again would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth it at $12</li>
            <li>But if that happens, it will still totally be worth it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell for sure if it really helps much, but I use it whenever my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading the different reviews and how good they were I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, save your money and use a towel instead.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better on longer hair (mine is barely shoulder length).</li>
            <li>once you brush a few times it wont pick up any more water.. if you towel dry first it works great</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li>I was a bit optimistic at first</li>
            <li>Neither way looks that pretty.</li>
            <li>It does get rid of some of the excess water and shorten my drying time by some, but after it gets wet, it&#x27;s not too effective.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to really help with drying time, this probably isn&#x27;t worth it for you.  </li>
            <li>Pretty neat idea.  </li>
            <li>Go find a different brush that&#x27;s better for your hair and use a blow dryer to get it drier faster.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how much difference this brush makes in how quickly my hair dries.</li>
            <li>doesnt totally dry but is good for someone who airs dries and does not curl anyway someone who goes natural</li>
            <li>I have tried to shampoo the brush, per the instructions and used even harsher cleaning agents to clean it completely.</li>
            <li>Meh....don&#x27;t really think it does very much</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how the brush dried my hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works better with long hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure who this would really be good for.</li>
            <li>With or without a hairdryer this brush speeds up dry time for sure.</li>
            <li>Perfect for drying long thick hair..</li>
            <li>I did like how gentle it was though—it detangles quite well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have semi-thick hair and this brush really doesn&#x27;t work too well on it.  </li>
            <li>but it really does make drying my hair faster.</li>
            <li>It feels gentle on my hair too.</li>
            <li>With this brush it dries much faster</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference between using this and a towel.</li>
            <li>The brush works really well in combination with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really made a difference on styling time for me.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews and the product description, I expected this brush to do more.  </li>
            <li>Really appreciate this brush.</li>
            <li>This does take out some water from your hair, but not that much.</li>
            <li>Works well as a brush but not so much on drying the hair.</li>
            <li>You really need a brush that&#x27;s going to do it all for you?</li>
            <li>Also, you can get it much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li>After using the brush I don&#x27;t think there is too much of a change.  </li>
            <li>bunch up so isn&#x27;t of much use.  </li>
            <li>Also is pretty easy to brush out wet hair</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it dosnt pull my hair out like some other brushes do.  </li>
            <li>have fine hair, but a ton of it, so it takes my hair forever to dry.</li>
            <li>After discovering it about 6 months ago, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>pleased.&lt;br /&gt;However she was hoping for an easy style with this brush but still needs to use extra products to smooth it down and set</li>
            <li>one thing I will note, although I notice no smell or wear or problem cleaning loose hairs out of the brush at this point, I expect to replace it more frequently than a normal brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Goody makes a round brush that is gray and orange and that is the best brush out there if you have thick hair that has to be straightened.&lt;br /&gt;Done</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>but I see that it works fine and dries my hair faster (not very noticeable)</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this brush is very easy to use and does remove some excess moisture from your hair, it is not much better than just towel drying your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a means to speed up the process, not cut it out completely!!</li>
            <li>My thinking is it might not help a lot, but a little help is better than some.</li>
            <li>Through adoption and birth we&#x27;ve added three kids to our family in the last 2 1/2 years, so I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped blow-drying my hair in the mornings</li>
            <li>It might be better if it were a round brush instead of paddle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m my hair between this and a normal brush.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t remorse tangles as well as a normal brush</li>
            <li>like it and the fuzzy blue part is fun.</li>
            <li>She has very fine, thin hair and it works better for her while blow drying and cuts her blow dry from about 7 or 8 minutes to about 5.</li>
            <li>I either have to hide my hair in a bun, or straighten or curl it to get it to look socially acceptable (not even aiming for pretty).</li>
            <li>Its advertised to dry your hair quickly</li>
            <li>I tried to brush only one side of my hair with this brush and air dried both sides and while it was slightly more dry, it did not make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Though I was hopeful about this product, it does not provide any more drying than an ordinary plastic bristled, vented brush, followed by blotting with a towel.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>and I get compliments on my hair being soft, shiny, and frizz-free!</li>
            <li>and then the brush was super wet after one brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>perhaps worthwhile if it&#x27;s causing even a tiny bit less damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another handy tip - use a towel genie or other similar product to dry your hair before you use this brush.</li>
            <li>only thing, also my very biggest pet peave (dont know how to spell:) is hard bristles on a brush.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of long fine hair that takes ages to blow dry.</li>
            <li>My niece, who hates having her hair brushed since it’s usually very knotted, didn’t mind letting me brush her hair with this</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; the hair completely.</li>
            <li>mo2DG12E7CC0O5U]]I wear my hair in its natural textured state and without chemicals.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t really think the microfiber pads mixed in with the bristles</li>
            <li>While the texture of my hair is very fine, it is very dense and takes at least 30 minutes to fully dry.  </li>
            <li>It just eliminates more water and cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally have a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>When doing this, I cut my dry time by more than half.</li>
            <li>It probably does dry my hair a bit more than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but hair is definitely still wet.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my four year old with long straight hair.</li>
            <li>Due to my schedule in the morning, I&#x27;m out of the shower and doing my hair right after.</li>
            <li>I go through my hair and my daughters multiple times with this and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between it and a normal brush.  </li>
            <li>If you clean it or get it really wet, let it dry out on a towel before putting it away.</li>
            <li>It has some vents in the plastic portion and it will dry out in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Barely brushes because of the microfiber in the way!</li>
            <li>love this hairbrush and recommend to anyone with thick hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning!</li>
            <li>I especially like it for off days where I can easily dampen my hair and blow a little style/body back into it.</li>
            <li>did anything at all to help my hair dry faster although I will say my hair typically dries pretty fast on</li>
            <li>It helps a little so the hair is not dripping wet but certainly not replacement for a hairdryer (kind of what I was hoping for since she hates it)</li>
            <li>(barely made a dent in drying time).</li>
            <li>This brush will not dry you hair but it does remove excess water.  </li>
            <li>and I use this brush everyday to blow dry my hair (I wrap it in terry cloth turban for a few minutes first) and it has significantly reduced my drying time.</li>
            <li>The fluffy microfiberish towel material doesn&#x27;t really seem wet when I use it like it would be if it&#x27;s really absorbing?</li>
            <li>drying time is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Helps me get ready faster and with less stress of a morning.</li>
            <li>I wanted this brush to work, if I let my hair dry naturally I don&#x27;t need to use any products on it.  </li>
            <li>I do need to brush and detangle with a regular brush first and then run through a few times with this brush.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, long hair and used it last night and it worked well.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have shoulder length, thick hair and while the brush is fine for brushing wet hair, the amount of water it absorbs is negligible.  </li>

            <li> You can do better with something else.</li>
            <li> We also have a microfiber turban wrap that does a much better job at soaking up the water.</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and bought it cause it just looked too interesting to not try out.</li>
            <li> You can find it for $15 in many place and for just under $12 at Target.</li>
            <li> Towel works way way better</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my hair has had way more static since I began using this brush.</li>
            <li> Of course, this means I either go around with weirdo static hair</li>
            <li> The brush is okay.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting better.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to read the directions when u get it</li>
            <li> and youll love it.</li>
            <li> I do notice that the ends of my hair start dripping more after using this brush which leads me to believe that it does work some.  </li>
            <li> but i think they could have used a more absorbent material...</li>
            <li> others seemed to have better outcomes.</li>
            <li> she has 3 more in her cabinet and says she can&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li> My hair has a very fine texture and gets damaged easily when styling.</li>
            <li> Okay this quick style brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> but good enough since I have lots of hair and anything that helps is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found this brush easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> pull through my hair easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this item with high hopes and its theory is good.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is worth any more than that.</li>
            <li> This brush has great vents that keep the air flowing through and allow me to put the blowdryer closer to my hair without overheating, plus shorter drying time because of the blue bits, gets me smoother and prettier hair without any additional heat tools after drying.</li>
            <li> It is not anywhere near as good as the&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> do, however, like large paddle brushes and continue to use it as a normal hairbrush which it does a great job at.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for long very curly hair</li>
            <li> In the end I concluded that a comb through and towel dry was best if you really want to save your hair from heat damage.</li>
            <li> My hair holds lots of moisture and takes so long to style so I am always happy to find a product that helps save me time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Ever since I originally came across this brush, i&#x27;ve wanted it.</li>
            <li> Man I was excited about this brush.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, the problems arose when trying to clean it after using it.</li>
            <li> The product is true to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> It was a nice idea, Goody, but a microfiber towel after shampooing is more effective, and can be easily tossed in the washing machine to clean it and then in the dryer to completely dry it for the next use.</li>
            <li> Now it takes about 10 minutes to blow dry completely and it looks awesome.</li>
            <li> The brush speeds both air drying time and when accompanied by a hairdryer for quick styling.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had high expectations for this brush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how well the product works, but it&#x27;s a good brush, bit high priced though, works fine and is big</li>
            <li> Maybe it’d be better for people with more texture to their hair or really long hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own even when it&#x27;s super long so that may be why I didn&#x27;t see anything special there.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean so far and is made well.</li>
            <li> It works OK, but not really any more that just toweling it again would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth it at $12</li>
            <li> But if that happens, it will still totally be worth it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell for sure if it really helps much, but I use it whenever my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading the different reviews and how good they were I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, save your money and use a towel instead.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better on longer hair (mine is barely shoulder length).</li>
            <li> once you brush a few times it wont pick up any more water.. if you towel dry first it works great</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li> I was a bit optimistic at first</li>
            <li> Neither way looks that pretty.</li>
            <li> It does get rid of some of the excess water and shorten my drying time by some, but after it gets wet, it&#x27;s not too effective.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something to really help with drying time, this probably isn&#x27;t worth it for you.  </li>
            <li> Pretty neat idea.  </li>
            <li> Go find a different brush that&#x27;s better for your hair and use a blow dryer to get it drier faster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how much difference this brush makes in how quickly my hair dries.</li>
            <li> doesnt totally dry but is good for someone who airs dries and does not curl anyway someone who goes natural</li>
            <li> I have tried to shampoo the brush, per the instructions and used even harsher cleaning agents to clean it completely.</li>
            <li> Meh....don&#x27;t really think it does very much</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how the brush dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works better with long hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure who this would really be good for.</li>
            <li> With or without a hairdryer this brush speeds up dry time for sure.</li>
            <li> Perfect for drying long thick hair..</li>
            <li> I did like how gentle it was though—it detangles quite well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
            <li> I have semi-thick hair and this brush really doesn&#x27;t work too well on it.  </li>
            <li> but it really does make drying my hair faster.</li>
            <li> It feels gentle on my hair too.</li>
            <li> With this brush it dries much faster</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference between using this and a towel.</li>
            <li> The brush works really well in combination with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really made a difference on styling time for me.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and the product description, I expected this brush to do more.  </li>
            <li> Really appreciate this brush.</li>
            <li> This does take out some water from your hair, but not that much.</li>
            <li> Works well as a brush but not so much on drying the hair.</li>
            <li> You really need a brush that&#x27;s going to do it all for you?</li>
            <li> Also, you can get it much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> After using the brush I don&#x27;t think there is too much of a change.  </li>
            <li> bunch up so isn&#x27;t of much use.  </li>
            <li> Also is pretty easy to brush out wet hair</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it dosnt pull my hair out like some other brushes do.  </li>
            <li> have fine hair, but a ton of it, so it takes my hair forever to dry.</li>
            <li> After discovering it about 6 months ago, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> pleased.&lt;br /&gt;However she was hoping for an easy style with this brush but still needs to use extra products to smooth it down and set</li>
            <li> one thing I will note, although I notice no smell or wear or problem cleaning loose hairs out of the brush at this point, I expect to replace it more frequently than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Goody makes a round brush that is gray and orange and that is the best brush out there if you have thick hair that has to be straightened.&lt;br /&gt;Done</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> but I see that it works fine and dries my hair faster (not very noticeable)</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this brush is very easy to use and does remove some excess moisture from your hair, it is not much better than just towel drying your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a means to speed up the process, not cut it out completely!!</li>
            <li> My thinking is it might not help a lot, but a little help is better than some.</li>
            <li> Through adoption and birth we&#x27;ve added three kids to our family in the last 2 1/2 years, so I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped blow-drying my hair in the mornings</li>
            <li> It might be better if it were a round brush instead of paddle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m my hair between this and a normal brush.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t remorse tangles as well as a normal brush</li>
            <li> like it and the fuzzy blue part is fun.</li>
            <li> She has very fine, thin hair and it works better for her while blow drying and cuts her blow dry from about 7 or 8 minutes to about 5.</li>
            <li> I either have to hide my hair in a bun, or straighten or curl it to get it to look socially acceptable (not even aiming for pretty).</li>
            <li> Its advertised to dry your hair quickly</li>
            <li> I tried to brush only one side of my hair with this brush and air dried both sides and while it was slightly more dry, it did not make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Though I was hopeful about this product, it does not provide any more drying than an ordinary plastic bristled, vented brush, followed by blotting with a towel.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> and I get compliments on my hair being soft, shiny, and frizz-free!</li>
            <li> and then the brush was super wet after one brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> perhaps worthwhile if it&#x27;s causing even a tiny bit less damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another handy tip - use a towel genie or other similar product to dry your hair before you use this brush.</li>
            <li> only thing, also my very biggest pet peave (dont know how to spell:) is hard bristles on a brush.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long fine hair that takes ages to blow dry.</li>
            <li> My niece, who hates having her hair brushed since it’s usually very knotted, didn’t mind letting me brush her hair with this</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; the hair completely.</li>
            <li> mo2DG12E7CC0O5U]]I wear my hair in its natural textured state and without chemicals.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t really think the microfiber pads mixed in with the bristles</li>
            <li> While the texture of my hair is very fine, it is very dense and takes at least 30 minutes to fully dry.  </li>
            <li> It just eliminates more water and cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally have a very sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> When doing this, I cut my dry time by more than half.</li>
            <li> It probably does dry my hair a bit more than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but hair is definitely still wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my four year old with long straight hair.</li>
            <li> Due to my schedule in the morning, I&#x27;m out of the shower and doing my hair right after.</li>
            <li> I go through my hair and my daughters multiple times with this and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between it and a normal brush.  </li>
            <li> If you clean it or get it really wet, let it dry out on a towel before putting it away.</li>
            <li> It has some vents in the plastic portion and it will dry out in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Barely brushes because of the microfiber in the way!</li>
            <li> love this hairbrush and recommend to anyone with thick hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning!</li>
            <li> I especially like it for off days where I can easily dampen my hair and blow a little style/body back into it.</li>
            <li> did anything at all to help my hair dry faster although I will say my hair typically dries pretty fast on</li>
            <li> It helps a little so the hair is not dripping wet but certainly not replacement for a hairdryer (kind of what I was hoping for since she hates it)</li>
            <li> (barely made a dent in drying time).</li>
            <li> This brush will not dry you hair but it does remove excess water.  </li>
            <li> and I use this brush everyday to blow dry my hair (I wrap it in terry cloth turban for a few minutes first) and it has significantly reduced my drying time.</li>
            <li> The fluffy microfiberish towel material doesn&#x27;t really seem wet when I use it like it would be if it&#x27;s really absorbing?</li>
            <li> drying time is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Helps me get ready faster and with less stress of a morning.</li>
            <li> I wanted this brush to work, if I let my hair dry naturally I don&#x27;t need to use any products on it.  </li>
            <li> I do need to brush and detangle with a regular brush first and then run through a few times with this brush.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, long hair and used it last night and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have shoulder length, thick hair and while the brush is fine for brushing wet hair, the amount of water it absorbs is negligible.  </li>
            <li> I thought if it at least took out the excessive water it would be nice, I didnt expect it to completely dry my hair or anything.</li>
            <li> It has always taken far too long to dry</li>
            <li> The material get&#x27;s wet with just a few strokes making it less and less effective with each brush stroke.</li>
            <li> but the problem is that the absorbing bristles aren&#x27;t stiff.</li>
            <li> Our blow drying time has not really changed and I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Using this brush cut down on my drying time considerably to about only 7-10 min</li>
            <li> Either short or long hair</li>
            <li> Then I can use the flat iron in the morning.</li>
            <li> The microfiber bristles do get flat after using it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have longish thick hair, so I either spend 20-25 min trying to drying it (which makes me hot since its summer and makes my scalp sweat, thus defeating the purpose of washing my hair)</li>
            <li> The &#x27;soft&#x27; cloth &#x27;bristles&#x27; maybe should have &#x27;stem/bristles&#x27; in them as I think they &#x27;mush&#x27; down as I brush my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was advertised that the microfibers (the blue stuff) would help dry my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> But for crying out loud, a hairbrush should not be this difficult to clean!</li>
            <li> So this brush does not instantly dry your hair; however, it does eliminate the dripping wet that people with long hair have to manage.</li>
            <li> It is especially not helpful for thinner, finer hair like in one of my other children as it seems they don&#x27;t have enough hair to even be touched by the microfiber.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this product helps me dry my hair in half the time</li>
            <li> guess if you&#x27;re going to use a flat brush to dry your hair you might as well use this.</li>
            <li> To me, this worked like a regular brush because my hair was still soaking wet after running the brush through it</li>
            <li> I have long hair, waist length.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness, fairly long (about 4-5 inches below my shoulders) hair.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my daughter who has long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and dry it straight.</li>
            <li> Eventually the blue microfiber just gets matted down to a flat piece.</li>
            <li> Just get the other one and maybe a different hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A pleasure to use and a time saver as I&#x27;m always in a hurry trying to blow dry my long hair!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and this brush manages my tangles.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and didnt expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> This brush does not seem to dry hair any quicker like it&#x27;s advertised for.  </li>
            <li> Because of cowlicks, I blow dry my hair almost every day to keep them under control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the microfiber bristles, you might want to leave the brush out after usage to allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps at all or if my hair just takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> always blow dry it after use so the water isn&#x27;t sitting in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to completely dry your hair by itself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to reduce the time it takes to dry my hair as well as limit the exposure to the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> This does help but do not expect to have dry hair after using it.  </li>
            <li> After using, just leave the brush out to air dry.  </li>
            <li> But this brush does help remove excess water and while drying causes hair to dry faster.</li>
            <li> It makes it softer and easier to work with once my hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> so getting it dry and under control is a process.</li>
            <li> It helps dry my hair and straighten it just be brushing.</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length and it takes about 5-8 min to dry now instead of 15+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but when we used the hair dryer with it it did help dry faster.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews are like &amp;#34;you still have to blow dry your hair...</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair before I go to bed, so that it can dry over night.</li>
            <li> I wish people had enough common sense to realize the brush isn&#x27;t to dry your hair completely.</li>
            <li> This brush helps it dry quicker.  </li>
            <li> the one thing you need to straighten your hair is a brush that grabs the pulls and straightens the hair as you dry it</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I let my hair air dry in the morning and had hopes that this would make it go faster.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, when it generally takes me 15, i&#x27;ve already dried by hair quite a bit with a towel and let it air dry as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to bring down the time of hair dry but only down for 4 min, I have another goody brush and it works the same with out the fiber</li>
            <li> I briefly used the towel, did not leave my hair dripping wet, but still very wet nonetheless and immediately used the brush.</li>
            <li> Once the micro-fiber sections become pressed down it is a simple matter to revive them with a comb or even your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I received this brush compliments of Influenster.com, so I just started using this brush and it DEFINITELY cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and this brush has reduced my blow drying time by at least 1/3 for less than $10.  </li>
            <li> it definitely takes some of the water out and makes it less frizzy</li>
            <li> This brush really works to detangle and help dry my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> does not work as I thought it should, does not really help dry wet hair</li>
            <li> I just brush this through my hair in different directions a few times and it only takes me a few minutes to dry it with the hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The microfiber bristles get wet, as one would expect, if it is to absorb the water in your hair to some extent.</li>
            <li> or I go out with it wet in a bun.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell see a difference on my wet hair at all when I use this brush.</li>
            <li> Your hair will still be wet.  </li>
            <li> Hair is just was wet as when we started.</li>
            <li> i have thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush does not speed drying of hair in the least and is very large and clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a stay at home mom who would rather not have soaking wet hair when its cold out, but to me this product is just another product that you get too excited about</li>
            <li> ...unless I&#x27;ve somehow developed the ability to dry my hair faster by desperately hoping...because I can&#x27;t seem to figure out any other reason why it takes slightly less time each morning even though I really can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;d be doing anything?</li>
            <li> Except that the brush (like any other) causes your hair to stretch/break when used when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> might try using my brush again during the less dry summer months.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who has thick and/or long hair.</li>
            <li> But if you blow dry your hair using this brush I&#x27;d say I finish a little bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is supposed to dry your hair a little while you brush it</li>
            <li> Less time wet,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum, she has thick hair that takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush hoping it would cut down on the amount of time I had to expose my hair to the extreme heat of my hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : It can start to smell a little mildew-y if you store it soaking wet.</li>
            <li> This is NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> so you buy it, and then its not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> Cuts down on drying time with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that it smooths down my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It does cut down on air drying time.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; do tend to mash down and need fluffed up after each use.</li>
            <li> like I usually get when I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush cuts my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> 3 minutes less time with a dryer is nice...and</li>
            <li> Using the brush saves me about three minutes in the morning, so I think the claim of 30% less drying time is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> less frizz</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t notice any difference compared to using my regular brush.</li>
            <li> and it is kinda hard to pull through my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to brush and dry your hair?</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> But my hair is very long and thick.</li>
            <li> I think it may help me dry my thick hair faster.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick hair that takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a tight schedule or thick hair!</li>
            <li> and it seriously pains me to spend that long doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is short it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our family for a few months</li>
            <li> and that is with changing brushes mid-way through to a round barrel brush when its gone \\&quot;just damp\\&quot; to give it lift and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> waste money on this brush</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, so I usually spend about 20 minutes drying it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to hold, not necessarily elegant in feel nor in looks...</li>
            <li> I usually wrap my hair for about a half hour before brushing it with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was really hoping this would help me dry my really thick shoulder-length hair faster</li>
            <li> but this brush cut my air drying time in at LEAST half.  </li>
            <li> Every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> If you want something that will at least help a little bit then I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> AND DONT USUALLY HAVE TO USE A</li>
            <li> After a few times of using this brush, I began to notice the microfibers smelled moldy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite expensive as a basic hairbrush.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The blow dryer usually takes about 15 minutes after towel drying, and after that</li>
            <li> Usually it takes me about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Are we all just that lazy???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it dries the hair quicker</li>
            <li> and I usually straighten it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does or not.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of 12 bucks!</li>
            <li> It is really useless if you have long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it used to take an army of house elves to dry my hair, and now I can do it myself!</li>
            <li> I really hate drying my hair and usually let it air dry since my hair is so long.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush, but it totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get the brush through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> No - or at least, probably not.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that gets frizzy when I use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it retains all water.</li>
            <li> I was especially disappointed by Goody customer service&#x27;s reaction to my inquiry as to how one is to clean the brush.  </li>
            <li> It is worse than an ordinary brush because the towel fibers make it impossible to comb out hair from the brush, so it is never totally clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the microfibers are surrounded by plastic bristles and backed on a plastic brush, drying them completely is nearly impossible, especially in humid bathrooms and summer humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it until a newer, fancier,elite salon brand comes out with one  that I sadly convince myself I need because maybe, just maybe it&#x27;ll take off 3 and a HALF minutes of drying time...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even though I have thin hair, I did not think it cut down on my drying time.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are HARD!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews posted about this brush!</li>
            <li> and this one is weak.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Such a stupid product.</li>
            <li> and it is even worse during the humid Summer.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m so tired of having frizzy hair all the time</li>
            <li> The price here ($23 when I write this) is absolutely ridiculous!.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive for just a brush.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this brush.  </li>
            <li> It stinks horribly after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very long hair, and this brush manages my tangles. It doesn&#x27;t pull and break my hair. It is a wonderful buy. KPR</li>
            <li> I bought this item with high hopes and its theory is good. Except that the brush (like any other) causes your hair to stretch/break when used when your hair is wet. My hair breakage went up using this product- In the end I concluded that a comb through and towel dry was best if you really want to save your hair from heat damage.</li>
            <li> Meh....don&#x27;t really think it does very much</li>
            <li> This brush does not seem to dry hair any quicker like it&#x27;s advertised for.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> To me, this worked like a regular brush because my hair was still soaking wet after running the brush through it and then the brush was super wet after one brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, but a ton of it, so it takes my hair forever to dry. I thought this would help, but it didn&#x27;t. My mom loves the brush. She has very fine, thin hair and it works better for her while blow drying and cuts her blow dry from about 7 or 8 minutes to about 5.</li>
            <li> Everything is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has a very fine texture and gets damaged easily when styling. Because of cowlicks, I blow dry my hair almost every day to keep them under control. While the texture of my hair is very fine, it is very dense and takes at least 30 minutes to fully dry.  I bought this brush hoping it would cut down on the amount of time I had to expose my hair to the extreme heat of my hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this brush is very easy to use and does remove some excess moisture from your hair, it is not much better than just towel drying your hair. Maybe it’d be better for people with more texture to their hair or really long hair. I did like how gentle it was though—it detangles quite well. My niece, who hates having her hair brushed since it’s usually very knotted, didn’t mind letting me brush her hair with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the microfiber bristles, you might want to leave the brush out after usage to allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and this brush has reduced my blow drying time by at least 1/3 for less than $10.  A much better deal than a Brazilian and without the chemicals!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it dosnt pull my hair out like some other brushes do.  Its advertised to dry your hair quickly but I didnt notice a change in drying time.  I did however use the absorbent bits to my advantage though, I sprayed my favorite perfume on it and it disperses through my hair.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brush...and seller very good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how well the product works, but it&#x27;s a good brush, bit high priced though, works fine and is big</li>
            <li> Its just another brush.  I did not notice any difference in the dryness of my hair.  Eventually the blue microfiber just gets matted down to a flat piece.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift, loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush... reduces drying time...only thing, also my very biggest pet peave (dont know how to spell:) is hard bristles on a brush. so i would reccomend this to someone!</li>
            <li> GREAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT - TAKES A FAIR BIT OF MOISTURE FROM THE HAIR SO IT DRIES QUICKER AND DONT USUALLY HAVE TO USE A DRIER  -  DESPITE ADVERTISING IT HERE I COULD NOT BUY IT IN THE UK AT THE TIME - HOWEVER ARRIVED QUICKER THAN IF I HAD BOUGHT IT HERE - VERY IMPRESSED</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and although for me its not about &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; my hair its just wonderful to have a brush detangle so wonderfully without pulling your hair out! I have given as gifts as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews posted about this brush! After discovering it about 6 months ago, I couldn&#x27;t live without it! Is it going to dramatically transform your hair? No - or at least, probably not. But does it cut drying time? Absolutely! On top of that though, I found that it greatly reduces static and fly-aways and helps smooth my hair. I recommend it to all of my friends and keep two on hand for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another handy tip - use a towel genie or other similar product to dry your hair before you use this brush. That combo is where the magic happens. Don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews! You have to try this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It can start to smell a little mildew-y if you store it soaking wet. I use it in combo with my hairdryer, which seems to work the best. If you clean it or get it really wet, let it dry out on a towel before putting it away.</li>
            <li> I have never heard about it and bought to try. I liked the product, just need read more how to use better</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for myself after reading a magazine review. I have very long thick hair and it works well. It is easy to clean so far and is made well. It does seem to help somewhat with drying my hair as well.</li>
            <li> So this brush does not instantly dry your hair; however, it does eliminate the dripping wet that people with long hair have to manage. I have thick, fine, long hair and used it last night and it worked well. The brush didn&#x27;t catch on any tangles and I could feel the bristles reaching to my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is NOT worth the money. It stinks horribly after one or two uses. I always put it in the dishwasher to wash it and then spray it with lysol but it&#x27;s getting to the point where its time to throw it away. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in drying time either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle. I&#x27;m just a stay at home mom who would rather not have soaking wet hair when its cold out, but to me this product is just another product that you get too excited about so you buy it, and then its not worth the $.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this in our family for a few months and I cannot tell a difference.  My daughter and I both have shoulder length, thick hair and while the brush is fine for brushing wet hair, the amount of water it absorbs is negligible.  Our blow drying time has not really changed and I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the purchase. It is especially not helpful for thinner, finer hair like in one of my other children as it seems they don&#x27;t have enough hair to even be touched by the microfiber.  Good idea, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> does not work as I thought it should, does not really help dry wet hair</li>
            <li> I received this brush as a gift, and was intrigued with the microfibers. Upon reading the instructions on the packaging, I gave it a try. Like another reviewer, the problems arose when trying to clean it after using it. The microfiber bristles get wet, as one would expect, if it is to absorb the water in your hair to some extent. Because the microfibers are surrounded by plastic bristles and backed on a plastic brush, drying them completely is nearly impossible, especially in humid bathrooms and summer humidity. After a few times of using this brush, I began to notice the microfibers smelled moldy! I have tried to shampoo the brush, per the instructions and used even harsher cleaning agents to clean it completely. But for crying out loud, a hairbrush should not be this difficult to clean! It was a nice idea, Goody, but a microfiber towel after shampooing is more effective, and can be easily tossed in the washing machine to clean it and then in the dryer to completely dry it for the next use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush. Through adoption and birth we&#x27;ve added three kids to our family in the last 2 1/2 years, so I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped blow-drying my hair in the mornings (I&#x27;m just thankful to get a shower). I got this brush in hopes that I could use it to soak up a bit more water than the towel gets and help with my lack of hair attention. It works OK, but not really any more that just toweling it again would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have straight hair, and I don&#x27;t do anything to it, I might not be the best judge here. Maybe it is for people who are styling their hair in the mornings instead of letting Mother Nature take over.</li>
            <li> I have semi-thick hair and this brush really doesn&#x27;t work too well on it.  It is hard to get the brush through my thick hair. It didn&#x27;t speed up drying time as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> This brush cuts my blow drying time in half. I was hesitant at first but I love this brush. Great product!</li>
            <li> I found this brush easy to use. I was a bit optimistic at first but it really does make drying my hair faster. It feels gentle on my hair too. A pleasure to use and a time saver as I&#x27;m always in a hurry trying to blow dry my long hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mum, she has thick hair that takes a long time to dry. With this brush it dries much faster and she&#x27;s really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;However she was hoping for an easy style with this brush but still needs to use extra products to smooth it down and set it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for the drying factor :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful for long very curly hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps at all or if my hair just takes forever to dry.  I didn&#x27;t notice any faster drying with this at all.  But my hair is very long and thick.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea. It dries your hair as you brush it. Then I add product and I style with my regular brush. It takes a lot of time out of the process.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for over a week but I see that it works fine and dries my hair faster (not very noticeable) but good enough since I have lots of hair and anything that helps is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product on time and in great shape.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in hair dryness. It&#x27;s quite expensive as a basic hairbrush. You can do better with something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my four year old with long straight hair. I do need to brush and detangle with a regular brush first and then run through a few times with this brush. It helps a little so the hair is not dripping wet but certainly not replacement for a hairdryer (kind of what I was hoping for since she hates it) We also have a microfiber turban wrap that does a much better job at soaking up the water.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw it on pinterest and thought it would be great. I don&#x27;t see much difference between using this and a towel. But if you blow dry your hair using this brush I&#x27;d say I finish a little bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always blow dry it after use so the water isn&#x27;t sitting in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you&#x27;re going to use a flat brush to dry your hair you might as well use this. It&#x27;s not going to completely dry your hair by itself. Either short or long hair it&#x27;s just not going to work. The material get&#x27;s wet with just a few strokes making it less and less effective with each brush stroke.</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and bought it cause it just looked too interesting to not try out. I have longish thick hair, so I either spend 20-25 min trying to drying it (which makes me hot since its summer and makes my scalp sweat, thus defeating the purpose of washing my hair) or I go out with it wet in a bun. Neither way looks that pretty. Using this brush cut down on my drying time considerably to about only 7-10 min and that is with changing brushes mid-way through to a round barrel brush when its gone \\&quot;just damp\\&quot; to give it lift and shine.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush, but it totally disappointed. I have thick, wavy hair and I can&#x27;t tell see a difference on my wet hair at all when I use this brush. I definitely would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Though I was hopeful about this product, it does not provide any more drying than an ordinary plastic bristled, vented brush, followed by blotting with a towel.  It is worse than an ordinary brush because the towel fibers make it impossible to comb out hair from the brush, so it is never totally clean.&lt;br /&gt;A postscript: I was especially disappointed by Goody customer service&#x27;s reaction to my inquiry as to how one is to clean the brush.  They referred me to the FAQs on their webpage, which were not at all helpful.</li>
            <li> This brush will not dry you hair but it does remove excess water.  I wanted to reduce the time it takes to dry my hair as well as limit the exposure to the blow dryer.  This does help but do not expect to have dry hair after using it.  Your hair will still be wet.  It is a nice size and glides easily through hair.  My hair holds lots of moisture and takes so long to style so I am always happy to find a product that helps save me time.  Once the micro-fiber sections become pressed down it is a simple matter to revive them with a comb or even your fingers.  After using, just leave the brush out to air dry.  It has some vents in the plastic portion and it will dry out in a reasonable amount of time.  The price here ($23 when I write this) is absolutely ridiculous!.  You can find it for $15 in many place and for just under $12 at Target. It is worth it at $12 but I don&#x27;t think it is worth any more than that.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and didnt expect a miracle. But this brush does help remove excess water and while drying causes hair to dry faster. Cuts down on drying time with my hair dryer. Also is pretty easy to brush out wet hair</li>
            <li> ...unless I&#x27;ve somehow developed the ability to dry my hair faster by desperately hoping...because I can&#x27;t seem to figure out any other reason why it takes slightly less time each morning even though I really can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;d be doing anything? The fluffy microfiberish towel material doesn&#x27;t really seem wet when I use it like it would be if it&#x27;s really absorbing? I have long hair, waist length. 3 minutes less time with a dryer is nice...and perhaps worthwhile if it&#x27;s causing even a tiny bit less damage to my hair. It&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to hold, not necessarily elegant in feel nor in looks...it&#x27;s not a Mason Pearson folks. I&#x27;ll use it until a newer, fancier,elite salon brand comes out with one  that I sadly convince myself I need because maybe, just maybe it&#x27;ll take off 3 and a HALF minutes of drying time...</li>
            <li> The brush works really well in combination with a hair dryer. It helps remove excess water.  Also I feel it is a great detangle brush too. I have really long hair so this helps.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; the hair completely. What I like about it is that it smooths down my frizzy hair. It makes it softer and easier to work with once my hair is completely dry. I brush my hair after towel drying and let it finish air drying. It does cut down on air drying time. The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; do tend to mash down and need fluffed up after each use.</li>
            <li> I think it may help me dry my thick hair faster. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how it works, but even saving a couple of minutes is helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Great brush! It&#x27;s really made a difference on styling time for me. I have very thick wavy hair so getting it dry and under control is a process. Every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and the product description, I expected this brush to do more.  I go through my hair and my daughters multiple times with this and don&#x27;t notice any difference at all between it and a normal brush.  Hair is just was wet as when we started.</li>
            <li> all is good  mmm .m m, ,m , ,n  , , , , , , , , , ,m ,m ,</li>
            <li> Not sure who this would really be good for. I have a lot of long fine hair that takes ages to blow dry. Towel works way way better</li>
            <li> Really appreciate this brush. It works for my hair, I dont quite get the negative comments about this product as I have had nothing but success when using this brush.</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness, fairly long (about 4-5 inches below my shoulders) hair. Using the brush saves me about three minutes in the morning, so I think the claim of 30% less drying time is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair has had way more static since I began using this brush. I&#x27;m pretty sure running microfiber through my hair contributes to this, and I think the brush also scrapes off some of the remnants of my conditioner leaving it unprotected from the winter dryness. Of course, this means I either go around with weirdo static hair or I have to use additional styling products, thus eliminating the time saving that this product boasts. Either way, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try using my brush again during the less dry summer months.</li>
            <li> This brush really works to detangle and help dry my very thick hair. This is a purchase of a second one for me, so I can keep one in both bathrooms. I&#x27;ll be buying another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is short it is very thick.  I was very pleased with how the brush dried my hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a hair dryer at all!</li>
            <li> It is ok,I used it ,it is good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li> this brush is a wow! it makes my life easier and simplier, especially for all those people who&#x27;s on the go always. thank you goody!</li>
            <li> I got this on the advise in a beauty &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; items book. What a waste of money! The brush does not speed drying of hair in the least and is very large and clumsy to use. Would stay away!</li>
            <li> It probably does dry my hair a bit more than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but hair is definitely still wet. The &#x27;soft&#x27; cloth &#x27;bristles&#x27; maybe should have &#x27;stem/bristles&#x27; in them as I think they &#x27;mush&#x27; down as I brush my hair. Probably need to dispose of after awhile, says it is treated but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good way to wash the cloth.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t a hairdryer, but it&#x27;s an amazing brush that works with a dryer to drastically improve drying time, and the end result of blow drying. I have thick wavy hair that gets frizzy when I use a blow dryer. The blow dryer usually takes about 15 minutes after towel drying, and after that I either have to hide my hair in a bun, or straighten or curl it to get it to look socially acceptable (not even aiming for pretty). This brush has great vents that keep the air flowing through and allow me to put the blowdryer closer to my hair without overheating, plus shorter drying time because of the blue bits, gets me smoother and prettier hair without any additional heat tools after drying. This is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, so one thing I will note, although I notice no smell or wear or problem cleaning loose hairs out of the brush at this point, I expect to replace it more frequently than a normal brush. But if that happens, it will still totally be worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. It has prevented me from frying my hair by both blow drying and straightening. It helps dry my hair and straighten it just be brushing.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! I have curly, thick hair that takes forever to dry but this brush cut my air drying time in at LEAST half.  Less time wet, less frizz and that is a beautiful thing :-)  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and I use this brush everyday to blow dry my hair (I wrap it in terry cloth turban for a few minutes first) and it has significantly reduced my drying time. My hair is about shoulder length and it takes about 5-8 min to dry now instead of 15+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this hairbrush and recommend to anyone with thick hair that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning!</li>
            <li> Purchased with hope it would help my daughters have hair that was dryer before bed.  Wasn&#x27;t too impressed at first but when we used the hair dryer with it it did help dry faster.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, save your money and use a towel instead. This does take out some water from your hair, but not that much. My hair was still dripping after using this. I was disappointed because I was really hoping this would help me dry my really thick shoulder-length hair faster (barely made a dent in drying time).</li>
            <li> Such a stupid product. Does absolutely nothing!! Barely brushes because of the microfiber in the way!</li>
            <li> The brush is okay.  I was expecting better.  Works well as a brush but not so much on drying the hair.</li>
            <li> Okay this quick style brush is AMAZING. I have long thick hair, so I usually spend about 20 minutes drying it and it seriously pains me to spend that long doing my hair. I received this brush compliments of Influenster.com, so I just started using this brush and it DEFINITELY cuts down on drying time. Now it takes about 10 minutes to blow dry completely and it looks awesome. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who has thick and/or long hair. Some of these reviews are like &amp;#34;you still have to blow dry your hair...&amp;#34; well obviously. It just eliminates more water and cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
            <li> I have really thick long hair. It does get rid of some of the excess water and shorten my drying time by some, but after it gets wet, it&#x27;s not too effective.</li>
            <li> I like to wash my hair before I go to bed, so that it can dry over night. Then I can use the flat iron in the morning. This eliminates one step of heat on my hair. I don&#x27;t really know how much difference this brush makes in how quickly my hair dries. I think it does help move my hair from dripping to just damp before I actually get in bed. It is also well made.&lt;br /&gt; I have recommended this brush to a couple of people and we are all happy with it, but don&#x27;t pay 22$. 12 is more like it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I originally came across this brush, i&#x27;ve wanted it. Finally today I bought it and i&#x27;ve already put it to the test. I wish people had enough common sense to realize the brush isn&#x27;t to dry your hair completely. The purpose is to use it before blow drying and during. When doing this, I cut my dry time by more than half. Usually it takes me about 15 minutes and today it only took me 5. Keep in mind, when it generally takes me 15, i&#x27;ve already dried by hair quite a bit with a towel and let it air dry as well. I briefly used the towel, did not leave my hair dripping wet, but still very wet nonetheless and immediately used the brush. I then ran it through my hair continuously while blow drying. In fact if people read the instructions on the package...it suggests that you do just that. It also says that it depends on your hair type as to the results you will get. I&#x27;ll never understand why people expect perfection out of everything. How hard is it to brush and dry your hair? You really need a brush that&#x27;s going to do it all for you? Are we all just that lazy??? It&#x27;s a means to speed up the process, not cut it out completely!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it dries the hair quicker and it is kinda hard to pull through my long hair.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in this brush.  The description said it would remove excess water from your hair.  I have short hair and it didn&#x27;t seem to get any water out of it.  Maybe it works better with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it takes a long time to dry.  This brush helps it dry quicker.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and dry it straight. I got this brush thinking it would help with drying time. It didnt. It doesnt help with the drying time and I cant tell if it takes water out of the hair or not. It just doesnt make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;and the one thing you need to straighten your hair is a brush that grabs the pulls and straightens the hair as you dry it and this one is weak. It doesnt grab the hair and hold it and I even bought the rounded one to try and that one doesnt either.&lt;br /&gt;Goody makes a round brush that is gray and orange and that is the best brush out there if you have thick hair that has to be straightened.&lt;br /&gt;Done waste money on this brush like I did. Just get the other one and maybe a different hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;But this brush is not the answer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb water anymore than using a regular brush. I&#x27;m very disappointed. After reading the different reviews and how good they were I had high expectations. I thought if it at least took out the excessive water it would be nice, I didnt expect it to completely dry my hair or anything. I seriously don&#x27;t notice any difference compared to using my regular brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this does a bit of good in drying my hair.  Also, you can get it much cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Due to my schedule in the morning, I&#x27;m out of the shower and doing my hair right after. I have thick hair and it retains all water. It has always taken far too long to dry and it is even worse during the humid Summer. I just brush this through my hair in different directions a few times and it only takes me a few minutes to dry it with the hair dryer! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a tight schedule or thick hair!</li>
            <li> With or without a hairdryer this brush speeds up dry time for sure. But it&#x27;s like a 1/4 of the time when I use it with the dryer, and no frizz like I usually get when I blow dry my hair. Just be sure to read the directions when u get it and youll love it. Oh, if it matters, I have medium thickness wavy hair and I usually straighten it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I let my hair air dry in the morning and had hopes that this would make it go faster.  I&#x27;m not sure if it does or not.  I usually wrap my hair for about a half hour before brushing it with this brush.  After using the brush I don&#x27;t think there is too much of a change.  I do notice that the ends of my hair start dripping more after using this brush which leads me to believe that it does work some.  The microfiber bristles do get flat after using it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to really help with drying time, this probably isn&#x27;t worth it for you.  If you want something that will at least help a little bit then I would recommend this product.  My thinking is it might not help a lot, but a little help is better than some.</li>
            <li> doesnt totally dry but is good for someone who airs dries and does not curl anyway someone who goes natural</li>
            <li> I really hate drying my hair and usually let it air dry since my hair is so long. However, I&#x27;m so tired of having frizzy hair all the time so I bought this to make my life a lot easier. Wow, this product helps me dry my hair in half the time and I get compliments on my hair being soft, shiny, and frizz-free! I am in love with this brush, it is a life-saver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it used to take an army of house elves to dry my hair, and now I can do it myself! I gave them all the sock.</li>
            <li> Perfect for drying long thick hair..drying time is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Helps me get ready faster and with less stress of a morning.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat idea.  It works well. I especially like it for off days where I can easily dampen my hair and blow a little style/body back into it.</li>
            <li> It is really useless if you have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it..&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> it definitely takes some of the water out and makes it less frizzy but i think they could have used a more absorbent material... once you brush a few times it wont pick up any more water.. if you towel dry first it works great</li>
            <li> Man I was excited about this brush. It’s a great concept but the problem is that the absorbing bristles aren&#x27;t stiff. When you brush your hair they just get pushed back with the hair. I can’t tell any difference made by the water absorption. I just use it as a regular brush now.</li>
            <li> It is not anywhere near as good as the&lt;br /&gt;old Goody brushes. It pulls my hair;&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t pull through my hair easily. At&lt;br /&gt;15 bucks, I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> The bristles are short and the blue fibers bunch up so isn&#x27;t of much use.  It might be better if it were a round brush instead of paddle.  Perhaps it works better on longer hair (mine is barely shoulder length).</li>
            <li> I tried to brush only one side of my hair with this brush and air dried both sides and while it was slightly more dry, it did not make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, like large paddle brushes and continue to use it as a normal hairbrush which it does a great job at.</li>
            <li> The product is true to it&#x27;s claims. I have the thickest hair according to all who style and cut it. The brush speeds both air drying time and when accompanied by a hairdryer for quick styling.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2DG12E7CC0O5U]]I wear my hair in its natural textured state and without chemicals. I tried the Goody QUIKSTYLE Paddle Brush after a shampoo and deep condition. The results were quite surprising.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it was advertised that the microfibers (the blue stuff) would help dry my hair faster.  I don&#x27;t think it helped at all.  i have thin, straight hair.  I wanted this brush to work, if I let my hair dry naturally I don&#x27;t need to use any products on it.  It was expensive for just a brush.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference I&#x27;m my hair between this and a normal brush. It also doesn&#x27;t remorse tangles as well as a normal brush</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible! I don&#x27;t generally have a very sensitive scalp but this brush basically feels like sandpaper going over my head. The bristles are HARD! And I don&#x27;t really think the microfiber pads mixed in with the bristles did anything at all to help my hair dry faster although I will say my hair typically dries pretty fast on it&#x27;s own even when it&#x27;s super long so that may be why I didn&#x27;t see anything special there. What a waste of 12 bucks! Go find a different brush that&#x27;s better for your hair and use a blow dryer to get it drier faster. This thing is junk.</li>
            <li> I wanted to bring down the time of hair dry but only down for 4 min, I have another goody brush and it works the same with out the fiber</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had high expectations for this brush.  Unfortunately, even though I have thin hair, I did not think it cut down on my drying time.  Now the brush just sits in my drawer.  Maybe it was just my hair... others seemed to have better outcomes.</li>
            <li> This brush is supposed to dry your hair a little while you brush it so it doesn&#x27;t drip so much.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell for sure if it really helps much, but I use it whenever my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and the fuzzy blue part is fun.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my daughter who has long hair. she truly loves it and has recommended it to hr friends. she has 3 more in her cabinet and says she can&#x27;t be without one. Highly recommended</li>
