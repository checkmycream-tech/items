    <ol>
            <li>I am incredibly happy!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a beginner like myself!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful kit i bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>they need to put the liquid in a secure bottle!!!!</li>
            <li>GREAT kit, was really impressed with all the stuff that came with it.</li>
            <li>Good for a starter kit for sure!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve had it for some time and its great for touch ups</li>
            <li>It was great quality.</li>
            <li>i was so happy that i wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Hi, I looks like I got a good deal on this</li>
            <li>Everything else LOOKS good.</li>
            <li>oh also it is a really good thing to buy.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more products!</li>
            <li>but, some items were of very cheap quality</li>
            <li>The brushes are VERY cheap and don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>I was also able to peel off an acrylic nail within an hour</li>
            <li>ok well it wasnt.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of powder colors, the brush sizes.</li>
            <li>You may be better off going to Sally Beauty</li>
            <li>This nail set is perfect for first timers like myself who are interested in doing nails.</li>
            <li>Ok,after long thought and alot of testing I&#x60;d have to say this this one of the best things I have bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It took a EXTREMELY LONG time to Arrive but the kit itself is Perfect</li>
            <li>When i first got it i loved the package because everything was neatly put in the box there was a card</li>
            <li>Okay so I received this package from the Post Office smelling STRONGLY of Acrylic liquid.</li>
            <li>Besides everything being ruined, i found that most of the items are VERY cheaply made and its probably worth buying everything separately.</li>
            <li>Other than that, everything was great for practicing!!</li>
            <li>This product came fast and was nicely packed in the package.</li>
            <li>Great for practicing, but when I received this item all of my nail files were falling apart because my brush cleaner leaked open</li>
            <li>I am happy with the speed of the shipping and overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a shipping delay they blamed on USPS while promising to tell their shipper to pack the kit more appropriately with padding etc.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to buy this kit....</li>
            <li>I was originally going to buy everything separately</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks to come but it was totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I love this so much I&#x60;d</li>
            <li>but this kit saves you so much money!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dieing to do my own nails and finally came across this!</li>
            <li>All in all, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the brushes werent of good quality and the acrylic liquid and powder set so quickly and inconsistently that my acrylics looked like a lumpy mess when I was done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech, just wanted to start doing my own acrylics.</li>
            <li>I am also happy to say it will last some time if your only using it for touch ups as I am.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>, figuring the replacement kit would ship after they received my damaged return, they sent several more e-mails asking me each time over and over if I wanted a refund or replacement.  </li>
            <li>And the nail glue doesn&#x27;t really work!</li>
            <li>I knew not to expect the exact items (colors, etc.) shown</li>
            <li>Sure, this kit comes with a lot of stuff, but I am personally unimpressed.</li>
            <li>But other then that it was pretty okay.</li>
            <li>They want too much money for the items and then you have a hard time trying to get them to send you a replacement that is in good condition (meaning nothing damaged during shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but more which was kind of expensive</li>
            <li>buy again and plan to very soon.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY don&#x27;t recommend spending the money on the disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely comes with many different nail tools that are useful.</li>
            <li>To start out, I do recommend, just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>After many e-mails to them and much frustration, they offered to send me a $5 refund on the return shipping for the RMA (not even half the return shipment</li>
            <li>secondly i love the little thank you not/card.</li>
            <li>but hey not anyone&#x27;s fault.also is wanted to say that it was a box in a box so that nothing would be broken or anything like that which was another thing i loved.</li>
            <li>I know that I will have to explore the more expensive brands to get a better quality but for the price of this kit you definitely get a LOT of misc things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is why I rated them 2 stars - they gave follow up at first but no final result!</li>
            <li>It does however come with clear nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking forward to your early reply.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>This item has the complete accesories that I need to make the nails.</li>
            <li>She is completely ecstatic and beyond words.</li>
            <li>I hope the seller will send the missing item and maybe a full container of the liquids.......</li>
            <li>the 1st one was the exact same box I sent back to them and the second box the nails, files, the acrylic liquid and brush cleaner had spilled again, and other damages (the same as the first box).  </li>
            <li>am missing the blueberry cuticle treatment and more that half of the brush cleaner and acrylic liquid spilled in shipping.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine buying this from someone else for a higher price and less quality.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of things in this bundle but the way it is shipped to you results in a HOT MESS.  </li>
            <li>The way they send it to you is very flimsy and the acrylic liquid and brush cleaner spills and destroys the other items inside the box.  </li>
            <li>You could see right away by the stains that much of the liquid had leaked through the exterior of the thin box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> You could see right away by the stains that much of the liquid had leaked through the exterior of the thin box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> further inspection, the seals were all broken on the powders (which had also leaked all over the other contents) and the liquid containers were mostly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit was good but the acrylic liquid spilt in the box when I got it :(</li>
            <li> The nail care products are cheap (the cuticle trimmers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut anything), the nail glue doesn&#x27;t glue, and the acrylic is perpetually lifting while the clear coat is discoloured in a few days (though they hardly stay on that long anyway).</li>
            <li> If everything came intact, the items would probably not last very long.</li>
            <li> and I know will not last very long.</li>
            <li> It was packaged in the same measly/unprotected shipping bag and thin cardboard box like the first damaged kit.  </li>
            <li> Also the brush cleaner was useless, it was almost like I was trying to clean my brush with water....</li>
            <li> think this one was even in worse condition than the first considering the nail filers were even splitting apart :</li>
            <li> Overall, mostly just disappointed with the packaging for shipping and the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> noticed that there are a few comments like mine and they received the package in the same condition.</li>
            <li> and it was just nothing that i expected.</li>
            <li> The acrylic liquid and the brush cleaner both came empty because they had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> Crazy cart is very responsible with the time.</li>
            <li> Why would I want a refund after paying to ship their broken kit back to them from CA to NY??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything was poorly thrown into the box and nothing was properly packaged for some of the items being liquid and powder.</li>
            <li> The colour gels are very little though.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> i thought everything would just be crambed into a small litle box.</li>
            <li> There was like 5-7 things missing!</li>
            <li> this point I&#x27;m too disgusted to e-mail their &amp;#34;support department&amp;#34; and will file a complaint with Amazon since I strongly get the feeling this company is a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m super angry that i waited three weeks to get some crap like this</li>
            <li> I opened the box to find ALMOST EVERYTHING destroyed by the broken bottle of Acrylic liquid.</li>
            <li> So I am contacting Amazon to get a refund on this poorly shipped bundle that Emart does not care about.</li>
            <li> By far the worst buying experience</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are sorry for that, For this issue, we would like you keep the item</li>
            <li> was a very thin cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> e-mailed Crazy Cart&#x27;s customer service to report the damage</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it shows up in a USPS bad with no packaging/padding.  </li>
            <li> disappointed customer with a frustrated daughter</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed to find almost none of the items salvageable.</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok,after long thought and alot of testing I&#x60;d have to say this this one of the best things I have bought on Amazon. It not only has everything I needed in this lot but it was at a price we could SO do. I&#x60;ve had it for some time and its great for touch ups and I simply can not go on without this. I am also happy to say it will last some time if your only using it for touch ups as I am. It does however come with clear nails. Flimsy if that means anything to those who are reviewing this product. It came with everything in the picture. It was great quality. I love this so much I&#x60;d buy again and plan to very soon. I only wish that I had bought 2 of these instead of one. But that&#x27;s ok ill be buying it again. I hope there around forever. I couldn&#x27;t imagine buying this from someone else for a higher price and less quality. Thank You.</li>
            <li> It took a EXTREMELY LONG time to Arrive but the kit itself is Perfect</li>
            <li> Hi, I looks like I got a good deal on this kit!&lt;br /&gt;I am missing the blueberry cuticle treatment and more that half of the brush cleaner and acrylic liquid spilled in shipping. Everything else LOOKS good. I hope the seller will send the missing item and maybe a full container of the liquids.......</li>
            <li> Bought this at my daughter&#x27;s request for her 15th birthday.  By far the worst buying experience and I purchase quite a bit from various online retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it shows up in a USPS bad with no packaging/padding.  All this kit was contained in was a very thin cardboard box.  Upon opening the mailing bag I was overwhelmed by the chemical smell emanating from the bag.  You could see right away by the stains that much of the liquid had leaked through the exterior of the thin box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon further inspection, the seals were all broken on the powders (which had also leaked all over the other contents) and the liquid containers were mostly empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed Crazy Cart&#x27;s customer service to report the damage and they replied with the following response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dear buyer ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for contacting us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sorry for that, For this issue, we would like you keep the item and we issue you 20% refund as compenstion.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t bother you return it. It can save a lot of time.IS it fine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to your early reply.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;crazy cart customer service.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I want to return it in hopes an undamaged kit would be shipped to replace it (not to mention safer to use).  After many e-mails to them and much frustration, they offered to send me a $5 refund on the return shipping for the RMA (not even half the return shipment cost).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, figuring the replacement kit would ship after they received my damaged return, they sent several more e-mails asking me each time over and over if I wanted a refund or replacement.  Why would I want a refund after paying to ship their broken kit back to them from CA to NY??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a shipping delay they blamed on USPS while promising to tell their shipper to pack the kit more appropriately with padding etc., I finally received the replacement kit several weeks later.  Guess what?  It was packaged in the same measly/unprotected shipping bag and thin cardboard box like the first damaged kit.  And YES, the liquids had emptied AGAIN and the powder was EVERYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this one was even in worse condition than the first considering the nail filers were even splitting apart :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;m too disgusted to e-mail their &amp;#34;support department&amp;#34; and will file a complaint with Amazon since I strongly get the feeling this company is a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Extremely disappointed customer with a frustrated daughter</li>
            <li> Okay so I received this package from the Post Office smelling STRONGLY of Acrylic liquid. I opened the box to find ALMOST EVERYTHING destroyed by the broken bottle of Acrylic liquid. Everything was poorly thrown into the box and nothing was properly packaged for some of the items being liquid and powder. I was extremely disappointed to find almost none of the items salvageable. Besides everything being ruined, i found that most of the items are VERY cheaply made and its probably worth buying everything separately. If everything came intact, the items would probably not last very long. ALSOOOO, some of the items in the picture WERE NOT in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ALL, i&#x27;m super angry that i waited three weeks to get some crap like this AND I REALLY don&#x27;t recommend spending the money on the disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that there are a few comments like mine and they received the package in the same condition. I bought it for about 40 some dollars and I noticed the Price has gone UPP! STAY AWAY FROM BUYING THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech, just wanted to start doing my own acrylics. GREAT kit, was really impressed with all the stuff that came with it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to buy this kit....It definitely comes with many different nail tools that are useful. Such as nail clips and cutters and glue and a nail polish remover bottle, plenty of files and buffers.... However, the brushes werent of good quality and the acrylic liquid and powder set so quickly and inconsistently that my acrylics looked like a lumpy mess when I was done. I was also able to peel off an acrylic nail within an hour so it didnt bond well with my nail even though I properly prepped my nail beforehand :-/ Also the brush cleaner was useless, it was almost like I was trying to clean my brush with water....I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> The kit was good but the acrylic liquid spilt in the box when I got it :( I had to go but more which was kind of expensive they need to put the liquid in a secure bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> When i first got it i loved the package because everything was neatly put in the box there was a card and it was just nothing that i expected. i thought everything would just be crambed into a small litle box. ok well it wasnt. secondly i love the little thank you not/card. i was so happy that i wanted to write a review. also the shipping process was a bit of a wait but hey not anyone&#x27;s fault.also is wanted to say that it was a box in a box so that nothing would be broken or anything like that which was another thing i loved.So yeah thats it oh also it is a really good thing to buy.</li>
            <li> This kit included quality products! I am incredibly happy! Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful product! I will be purchasing more products!</li>
            <li> This product came fast and was nicely packed in the package. I knew I was getting what I was paying for. I love the variety of powder colors, the brush sizes. I know that I will have to explore the more expensive brands to get a better quality but for the price of this kit you definitely get a LOT of misc things. Good for a starter kit for sure!!!</li>
            <li> To anyone thinking about ordering this item - PLEASE DO NOT!!!  There are a lot of things in this bundle but the way it is shipped to you results in a HOT MESS.  The way they send it to you is very flimsy and the acrylic liquid and brush cleaner spills and destroys the other items inside the box.  They want too much money for the items and then you have a hard time trying to get them to send you a replacement that is in good condition (meaning nothing damaged during shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given Emart several chances (3) to send me a replacement but have not heard back from them since October 21,2013.  They sent me two replacements - the 1st one was the exact same box I sent back to them and the second box the nails, files, the acrylic liquid and brush cleaner had spilled again, and other damages (the same as the first box).  I even sent them an email on November 1, 2013 and have yet to receive a reply.  I sent them photos as well as suggestions on shipping but nothing.  So I am contacting Amazon to get a refund on this poorly shipped bundle that Emart does not care about. Try ordering it from someone else on Amazon.  You may be better off going to Sally Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I rated them 2 stars - they gave follow up at first but no final result!</li>
            <li> Great for practicing, but when I received this item all of my nail files were falling apart because my brush cleaner leaked open so I was left with a millimeter of cleaner left... Other than that, everything was great for practicing!! The colour gels are very little though.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!!!!!!! They don&#x27;t send you everything that&#x27;s in the picture and the acrylic powders doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t buy ....</li>
            <li> I rated this item 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t deliver what it promised. There was like 5-7 things missing! And the nail glue doesn&#x27;t really work! But other then that it was pretty okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dieing to do my own nails and finally came across this! I was originally going to buy everything separately but this kit saves you so much money!! It took about 3 weeks to come but it was totally worth the wait! Everything came that was supposed to and actually got 2 things of the rhinestones! Perfect for a beginner like myself!</li>
            <li> I knew not to expect the exact items (colors, etc.) shown but, some items were of very cheap quality and I know will not last very long. I will have to replace which, defeats the purpose of the kit. I am happy with the speed of the shipping and overall I am happy with my purchase. To start out, I do recommend, just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this based on all the positive reviews. However, I was very disappointed. The acrylic liquid and the brush cleaner both came empty because they had leaked in transit. Everything was ruined. The nail files fell apart, the nail tips all stuck together. Also, some of the products looked used. The brushes are VERY cheap and don&#x27;t work well.  Overall, mostly just disappointed with the packaging for shipping and the quality of the product.  I will not purchase from to seller again.</li>
            <li> This item has the complete accesories that I need to make the nails. Crazy cart is very responsible with the time.</li>
            <li> This nail set is perfect for first timers like myself who are interested in doing nails. It supplies everything you need at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Sure, this kit comes with a lot of stuff, but I am personally unimpressed. The nail care products are cheap (the cuticle trimmers aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut anything), the nail glue doesn&#x27;t glue, and the acrylic is perpetually lifting while the clear coat is discoloured in a few days (though they hardly stay on that long anyway). All in all, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful kit i bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loves it. She is completely ecstatic and beyond words. Thank you very much.</li>
