            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>love these EZ combs for surviving summer.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>would like to see them use better quality beads instead of the plastic beads..</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives a more sophisticated look than just wearing a ponytail.</li>
            <li>But I gave them to a friend with long hair and they worked perfectly for her</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and I love these.</li>
            <li>So glad they are still available.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>They do wear out over time, but for the price, they are easily replaced.</li>
            <li>They seemed to break easily</li>
            <li>They were also delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are a beautiful and comfortable product.</li>
            <li>and it was fine</li>
            <li>These are the real thing stretch nicely and hold hair well</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for these combs, sold in sets of four.  </li>
            <li>These are very comfortable and hold up my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly send out my box if anyone wants it</li>
            <li>These things are great when u don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do your hair when u first start using them they are alittle tight but with time they stretch and are much more comfortable and they are very sturdy</li>
            <li>An easy way to achieve a quick up-do in a variety of colors and at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not high quality, but good for the price.</li>
            <li>I paid almost this much for one in the store and they didn&#x27;t have all the colors available.</li>
            <li>These hair combs are very comfortable to wear, more comfortable than the hard plastic hair clips.</li>
            <li>they hold hair very well, stay snug and are very pretty.</li>
            <li>I have purchased EZ Combs several times before and just love them, but the first one I tried from this order broke the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>The second one is holding up ok.</li>
            <li>I have been using these since I first saw them on TV commercials.</li>
            <li>They are pretty.</li>
            <li>Cute, but not sturdy enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>They stay in my hair and they are pretty</li>
            <li>Absolute bargain!</li>
            <li>For other styles and to be dressed up though I still think it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>All 4 arrived quickly, packaged well and in new condition.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful, but I have very thick hair</li>
            <li>and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>Love these they are a little smaller than the one that I already had which is good for me since my very long hair is also this.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and hold my hair up all day long.</li>
            <li>They are OK, of average quality.</li>
            <li>I also like this particular packaging because they have all 4 combs instead of just two.</li>
            <li>have bought these a few times over the years, love these combs.  </li>
            <li>Good combs but tines are too short for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>The quality is not good, but still nice.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty, but the thin wire combs bend and don&#x27;t hold fine hair very well.  </li>
            <li>The strands just snapped like old elastic.  </li>
            <li>Product was decent quality, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to stretch far enough to make the styles listed.</li>
            <li>I really like these combs, they make for a quick up-do for my hard to control hair and are a great camouflage for a bad hair day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I have thicker hair, and more of it than the average girl, but even trying to put half of it up did not feel very secure, and sadly I will never use them again.</li>

            <li> The black one has a minor defect but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> Holds all day long and feels like nothing is in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had these before when my hair was long.</li>
            <li> and when I use this to put up all my hair in a twist, the combs keep getting loose.  </li>
            <li> The only downside its that I have thinning hair due to Meds that I take, and these combs will slide down from time to time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to redo my hair and  place the combs back on tighter a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay around $5 to $6 each for a single similar comb at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> They are too small, and dont seem sturdy enough.  </li>
            <li> I notice a slight lower quality difference compared to the ones I have purchased from Walgreens for $6 a piece.</li>
            <li> and my hair is a mess.</li>
            <li> Was Disappointed no longer available.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hold tight and often falls out.</li>
            <li> I get a headache if my hair clips are too tight and I have never had this problem with these.  </li>
            <li> The wire teeth on the combs are a little shorter than I like, but for the price I am not complaining.  </li>
            <li> I washed and dried on ones by mistake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them at the pool; I can lay back on the deck chair with no pain or awkward numb in the back of my head!</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and rather thick.</li>
            <li> I found these attached combs hard to find!</li>
            <li> One of the combs was broken when I received the package, as if someone tried to wear it and it broke.</li>
            <li> The e-book combs are made from a thin metal wire that just doesn&#x27;t hold in my hair.</li>

            <li> I like the idea, but I&#x27;m still wondering if the elastic will hold!</li>

            <li> I love these. They are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> One of the combs was broken when I received the package, as if someone tried to wear it and it broke. In fact, the package looked like a return. I returned them.</li>

            <li> I have been using these since I first saw them on TV commercials. I bought 3 sets  this time so I don&#x27;t run out. They do wear out over time, but for the price, they are easily replaced. I also like this particular packaging because they have all 4 combs instead of just two. Made me happy.</li>

            <li> I found these attached combs hard to find! Checked many stores. So I bought on line.  They are OK, of average quality. After I ordered,  I ended up finding some in an accessory store in Naples Italy for cheap! I don&#x27;t see how you can make some of the fancier hair styles with these combs.  They are too small, and dont seem sturdy enough.  I have rather short hair and use one just to keep my hair up.  The variety of the 4 pack is nice.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve had several comments about my hair when I used them.</li>
            <li> Cute, but not sturdy enough for my hair. My hair is shoulder length and rather thick. The e-book combs are made from a thin metal wire that just doesn&#x27;t hold in my hair. I do not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> They seemed to break easily</li>
            <li> Love it. Holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> These things are great when u don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do your hair when u first start using them they are alittle tight but with time they stretch and are much more comfortable and they are very sturdy I washed and dried on ones by mistake and it was fine I wore an hour or so later</li>
            <li> These are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Holds all day long and feels like nothing is in my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using them at the pool; I can lay back on the deck chair with no pain or awkward numb in the back of my head!</li>
            <li> These work well on longer hair. I have medium hair and could not get them to stay in or just all together could not get it to work. But I gave them to a friend with long hair and they worked perfectly for her and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> easy to use very beautiful</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Excellent price 4Pc set at $6.99!  Was Disappointed no longer available.  Purchased an additional Pack of 3 (Total of 6 EZ Combs) at $9.99 through a different vendor.  Still a Great find!</li>
            <li> Product was decent quality, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to stretch far enough to make the styles listed.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, but I have very thick hair and when I use this to put up all my hair in a twist, the combs keep getting loose.  For other styles and to be dressed up though I still think it&#x27;s nice.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re pretty, but the thin wire combs bend and don&#x27;t hold fine hair very well.  Plastic combs would work better!</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable and hold up my hair very well. I often get headaches from putting my hair up but these don&#x27;t do that to me. They were also delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I had these before when my hair was long. Now that I am letting it grow again I wanted to get these because once you put them on, they hold all day!!!</li>
            <li> Works well nice and EZ to use</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for these combs, sold in sets of four.  The wire teeth on the combs are a little shorter than I like, but for the price I am not complaining.  I usually pay around $5 to $6 each for a single similar comb at Walmart.  Actually, I ordered two sets since there was no shipping charge.  This was an Amazon Add-on item.</li>
            <li> I love these combs! They stay in my hair and they are pretty</li>
            <li> Some of the combs were a bit bent but nothing you couldn&#x27;t straighten out just using your fingers. I notice a slight lower quality difference compared to the ones I have purchased from Walgreens for $6 a piece. But all in all I love using these. They are comfortable and hold my hair up all day long.</li>
            <li> I love these combs. - they are the best for putting hair up without pulling.  I get a headache if my hair clips are too tight and I have never had this problem with these.  So glad they are still available.</li>
            <li> An easy way to achieve a quick up-do in a variety of colors and at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I love these EZ combs for surviving summer.</li>
            <li> Brilliant hair styling gizmos once I&#x27;d got the hang of them.  I&#x27;d admired one my friend had but had only seen them for sale in Boots - wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for on Amazon.  Anyway, found the name of it in Boots (£8.99 for one!), searched and came up with these.  Absolute bargain!</li>
            <li> Wonderful looking and keeps hair in place</li>
            <li> Love these they are a little smaller than the one that I already had which is good for me since my very long hair is also this. I love how these stay put all day and look really nice, better than a bobby pin bun.</li>
            <li> The black one has a minor defect but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I really like these combs, they make for a quick up-do for my hard to control hair and are a great camouflage for a bad hair day. All 4 arrived quickly, packaged well and in new condition. These have held up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see them use better quality beads instead of the plastic beads..</li>
