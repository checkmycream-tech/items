            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice sturdy product.</li>
            <li>I am not fond of seeing my face on the 10X side but it might come in handy for spots or blemishs.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking mirror for the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very strong and broke from one drop.</li>
            <li>The Rucci Clear Vanity Mirror, 1X/10X  is an excellent mirror.</li>
            <li>I dropped it once in the bathroom, but it is still very fine.</li>
            <li>Received very quick, love PRIME!</li>
            <li>Still a good mirror and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it for tweezing, but not for applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the best 10X mirror, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I wish the angling on the stand was a bit better too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>They are better made than I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this recent purchase.  </li>
            <li>perfect for close in facial grooming.</li>
            <li>Love the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Whether its just to check to make sure nothings out of place or to make sure I apply my make up correctly.</li>
            <li>I found a better one with lighting at costco.</li>
            <li>I think 5x would have been better for applying make-up.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you see more than you want, but sometimes you need to.</li>
            <li>Love the 10x.  </li>
            <li>The 10x mag is perfect for plucking eyebrows, you can actually shape your brow hair by hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I can see better while putting my make up on.</li>
            <li>just what I was &#x27;looking&#x27; for...the plastic exterior makes it nice &amp; light &amp; easy to move around...</li>
            <li>Not for use first thing in the morning if you want to have a good day.  </li>
            <li>My mom saw hers and loved it so much, I bought it for her too.</li>
            <li>The acrylic parts could have been a bit nicer, but I won&#x27;t complain too much since the mirrors are of good quality.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the Ricci a try since it was 10X mag, great price AND was a larger diameter than most of the travel mirrors out there.</li>
            <li>It was so easy putting on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Cannot afford to get too strong - will  scare me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you put this mirror in a perfect location and position, you end up having to hold the mirror with your hand right in front of your face to actually use it for close ups.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple of these to use around the house and they are actually pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the mirrors are good quality and magnification is good.</li>
            <li>nothing fancy, but it looks clean and nice and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Mirror is very clear and the plastic frame is of good quality.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly fine without a light.</li>
            <li>It can sit on the windowsill, available whenever I need it.  </li>
            <li>and that takes away from being hands free.  </li>
            <li>If you think that your skin is smooth and blackhead free stay away from 10x</li>
            <li>free viewing.  </li>
            <li>This is a great basic mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>This is very well made for the price and sits nicely on my window sill.</li>
            <li>It has a good, clear image.</li>
            <li>i just needed something small for my room and this does the trick marvelously.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that I found this clear plastic one on Amazon and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>getting older, one of the first things that goes is good eyesight.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a new magnifying mirror, and decided against the lighted kind, because vanity light is adequate.  </li>
            <li>It is good quality and attractive with a good base for standing.</li>
            <li>Nice size to put near my sink.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Probably will throw it away and buy a real mirror spending more on it.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for several months now, I wished I would have paid more to get a better quality one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to super glue it together.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best nor fanciest magnification mirror, but for basic makeup application and occasional use</li>
            <li>Provides adequate magnification and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>this strong locally and was so excited to find it through Amazon!</li>
            <li>The magnifying mirror is way too powerful to use for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>I would buy another if/when this one gets broken because it&#x27;s perfect for our bathroom.</li>
            <li>It was too powerful for me.  </li>
            <li>but it has been worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The extra magnification comes in handy at times.  </li>
            <li>I have to get it right up to my face to get it to focus</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>And you have to use the right distance and position to see right.</li>
            <li>and it is just right for me.</li>
            <li>Right size, magnification and the stand fits her requirements.</li>
            <li>This one was just right.  </li>
            <li>The 10X magnification is very large.  </li>
            <li>I usually up on make up in my bathroom that has great lighting.</li>
            <li>Kind of strange.  </li>
            <li>Clear view and flips easy.</li>
            <li>I have to hold it very close to be able to get a clear image.  </li>
            <li>nice size for limited bathroom counter space</li>
            <li>the 5X is clear and accurate for the purpose I require to use this 10X -</li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The mirror works ok as a regular make up mirror</li>
            <li>but the magnification side is pretty blurry depending on the angle and where in the mirror you look.  </li>
            <li>the 10x magnification is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>You can see things you are looking for and things you really don&#x27;t want to see!</li>
            <li>Looks and performs exactly like the one that broke.</li>
            <li>I was going to leave it in Europe just so not to have so much baggage coming home but decided it was to useful for that.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and functional, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as designed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like to see improved is the holder; it should not come away from the mirror quite so easily.</li>
            <li>My old one, which had a stand and a light, finally broke down, so I bought this one, hoping to get a good value.</li>
            <li>The regular side is fine for just about anything except applying makeup.</li>
            <li>But overall it is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older 7X version for traveling and decided to find a higher mag without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good 10x magnifying mirror within the price range that this product was purchased at.</li>
            <li>Wife really uses it a lot.</li>
            <li>real  </li>
            <li>however, my last mirror was lighted and when ordering this I completely forgot how useful the light could be.  </li>
            <li>as the magnification really helps with make-up application.  </li>
            <li>Hotel mirrors do not have enough light.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I was going to buy a lighted mirror after purchasing this one, and honestly could not find something simple without extra panels and bells and whistles that I did not need.  </li>
            <li>So excited to receive it - using it for medical purposes - well, it&#x27;s here</li>
            <li>Much better than mirrors I bought at other stores.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a true replacement it is also much lighter and easier to handle.  </li>
            <li>Nice size magnifying mirror that has very little distortion.  </li>
            <li>so you can mount it down, but that would defeat my intent of being able to have the mirror anywhere.</li>
            <li>No big deal, I just turn the lights on in the bathroom or use the natural light in the room when using this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li>I had a 7x but needed a little more.  </li>
            <li>I really like it in clear because it works with all decors.  </li>
            <li>for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I am a novice when it comes to the new wave make up application so this works for me.</li>
            <li>Very clear view.</li>
            <li>Very clear reflection.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the cheap frame, seemed very fragile, but due to the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much there.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s just large enough too.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit smaller than I expected, but sturdy good makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>On the other side is a regular mirror, good to use to check the back of my hair after I&#x27;ve blown it dry.</li>
            <li>The mirror is ver clear with no distortion.</li>
            <li>The Rucci Clear Vanity mirror does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror to replace an old one that had been my Mom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Very glad to finally find a 10x/1x mirror that is small enough to travel with, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be mounted to any wall!!!  </li>
            <li>I looked at some 14x in local stores and it was too much.  </li>
            <li>It has a sturdy, flexible plastic cover, but I have put it inside another soft zippered case for packing, although it probably doesn&#x27;t need both.</li>
            <li>My old one broke but didn&#x27;t care as I didn&#x27;t care for the color.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price, shipped fast and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>Its small plastic and just generally cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really see your entire face to put make up - not enough viewing for that.</li>
            <li>Wear glasses - not just any kind - trifocals - it is not easy to take care of your face - with glasses on - and I had ordered a Mag+ mirror and found it not strong enough.  </li>
            <li>So, it works if you need a quick close up look, but long term, I will have to look for another product that makes life a little easier than this.</li>
            <li>when you try to angle it certain directions, it just falls down.</li>
            <li>so it sort of ruins the whole &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, I found the mirror itself has a LOT of distortion and there was only a very tiny area in the center that was really functional.</li>

            <li> I found a better one with lighting at costco.</li>
            <li> I think 5x would have been better for applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you see more than you want, but sometimes you need to.</li>
            <li> Love the 10x.  </li>
            <li> The 10x mag is perfect for plucking eyebrows, you can actually shape your brow hair by hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I can see better while putting my make up on.</li>
            <li> just what I was &#x27;looking&#x27; for...the plastic exterior makes it nice &amp; light &amp; easy to move around...</li>
            <li> Not for use first thing in the morning if you want to have a good day.  </li>
            <li> My mom saw hers and loved it so much, I bought it for her too.</li>
            <li> The acrylic parts could have been a bit nicer, but I won&#x27;t complain too much since the mirrors are of good quality.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Ricci a try since it was 10X mag, great price AND was a larger diameter than most of the travel mirrors out there.</li>
            <li> It was so easy putting on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Cannot afford to get too strong - will  scare me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you put this mirror in a perfect location and position, you end up having to hold the mirror with your hand right in front of your face to actually use it for close ups.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these to use around the house and they are actually pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the mirrors are good quality and magnification is good.</li>
            <li> nothing fancy, but it looks clean and nice and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very clear and the plastic frame is of good quality.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly fine without a light.</li>
            <li> It can sit on the windowsill, available whenever I need it.  </li>
            <li> and that takes away from being hands free.  </li>
            <li> If you think that your skin is smooth and blackhead free stay away from 10x</li>
            <li> free viewing.  </li>
            <li> This is a great basic mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> This is very well made for the price and sits nicely on my window sill.</li>
            <li> It has a good, clear image.</li>
            <li> i just needed something small for my room and this does the trick marvelously.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that I found this clear plastic one on Amazon and at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> getting older, one of the first things that goes is good eyesight.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a new magnifying mirror, and decided against the lighted kind, because vanity light is adequate.  </li>
            <li> It is good quality and attractive with a good base for standing.</li>
            <li> Nice size to put near my sink.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Probably will throw it away and buy a real mirror spending more on it.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for several months now, I wished I would have paid more to get a better quality one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to super glue it together.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best nor fanciest magnification mirror, but for basic makeup application and occasional use</li>
            <li> Provides adequate magnification and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> this strong locally and was so excited to find it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> The magnifying mirror is way too powerful to use for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> I would buy another if/when this one gets broken because it&#x27;s perfect for our bathroom.</li>
            <li> It was too powerful for me.  </li>
            <li> but it has been worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The extra magnification comes in handy at times.  </li>
            <li> I have to get it right up to my face to get it to focus</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> And you have to use the right distance and position to see right.</li>
            <li> and it is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Right size, magnification and the stand fits her requirements.</li>
            <li> This one was just right.  </li>
            <li> The 10X magnification is very large.  </li>
            <li> I usually up on make up in my bathroom that has great lighting.</li>
            <li> Kind of strange.  </li>
            <li> Clear view and flips easy.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it very close to be able to get a clear image.  </li>
            <li> nice size for limited bathroom counter space</li>
            <li> the 5X is clear and accurate for the purpose I require to use this 10X -</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The mirror works ok as a regular make up mirror</li>
            <li> but the magnification side is pretty blurry depending on the angle and where in the mirror you look.  </li>
            <li> the 10x magnification is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> You can see things you are looking for and things you really don&#x27;t want to see!</li>
            <li> Looks and performs exactly like the one that broke.</li>
            <li> I was going to leave it in Europe just so not to have so much baggage coming home but decided it was to useful for that.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and functional, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as designed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would like to see improved is the holder; it should not come away from the mirror quite so easily.</li>
            <li> My old one, which had a stand and a light, finally broke down, so I bought this one, hoping to get a good value.</li>
            <li> The regular side is fine for just about anything except applying makeup.</li>
            <li> But overall it is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older 7X version for traveling and decided to find a higher mag without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good 10x magnifying mirror within the price range that this product was purchased at.</li>
            <li> Wife really uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> real  </li>
            <li> however, my last mirror was lighted and when ordering this I completely forgot how useful the light could be.  </li>
            <li> as the magnification really helps with make-up application.  </li>
            <li> Hotel mirrors do not have enough light.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I was going to buy a lighted mirror after purchasing this one, and honestly could not find something simple without extra panels and bells and whistles that I did not need.  </li>
            <li> So excited to receive it - using it for medical purposes - well, it&#x27;s here</li>
            <li> Much better than mirrors I bought at other stores.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it a true replacement it is also much lighter and easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> Nice size magnifying mirror that has very little distortion.  </li>
            <li> so you can mount it down, but that would defeat my intent of being able to have the mirror anywhere.</li>
            <li> No big deal, I just turn the lights on in the bathroom or use the natural light in the room when using this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li> I had a 7x but needed a little more.  </li>
            <li> I really like it in clear because it works with all decors.  </li>
            <li> for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I am a novice when it comes to the new wave make up application so this works for me.</li>
            <li> Very clear view.</li>
            <li> Very clear reflection.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the cheap frame, seemed very fragile, but due to the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much there.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just large enough too.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit smaller than I expected, but sturdy good makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> On the other side is a regular mirror, good to use to check the back of my hair after I&#x27;ve blown it dry.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ver clear with no distortion.</li>
            <li> The Rucci Clear Vanity mirror does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to replace an old one that had been my Mom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Very glad to finally find a 10x/1x mirror that is small enough to travel with, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be mounted to any wall!!!  </li>
            <li> I looked at some 14x in local stores and it was too much.  </li>
            <li> It has a sturdy, flexible plastic cover, but I have put it inside another soft zippered case for packing, although it probably doesn&#x27;t need both.</li>
            <li> My old one broke but didn&#x27;t care as I didn&#x27;t care for the color.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price, shipped fast and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Its small plastic and just generally cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really see your entire face to put make up - not enough viewing for that.</li>
            <li> Wear glasses - not just any kind - trifocals - it is not easy to take care of your face - with glasses on - and I had ordered a Mag+ mirror and found it not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> So, it works if you need a quick close up look, but long term, I will have to look for another product that makes life a little easier than this.</li>
            <li> when you try to angle it certain directions, it just falls down.</li>
            <li> so it sort of ruins the whole &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, I found the mirror itself has a LOT of distortion and there was only a very tiny area in the center that was really functional.</li>
            <li> A small adjustment in distance fro the mirror can radically change the focus, but it is very workable.</li>
            <li> Nice and clear and seems to have a sturdy base.  </li>
            <li> It is blurring , not clear at all.</li>
            <li> If the acrylic was heavier with less seams and not hollow, I would rave about it.</li>
            <li> My other magnification mirror finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> The double mirror is great--normal on one side and 10X on the other.  </li>
            <li> I can use one side for makeup and the other side to check the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It helps you see every single detail</li>
            <li> Fragile and not worth the spend</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed to replace a broken mirror in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I bought a small round mirror with a magnifying lens and attached it to the large mirror on my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day!  </li>
            <li> Wanted one a little larger, but couldn&#x27;t find one.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it being a little bigger</li>
            <li> I guess for the price it should be expected.  </li>
            <li> but I had expected that.  </li>
            <li> its not very sturdy &amp; is too bulky for what I need it for</li>
            <li> those nasty little hidden hairs can&#x27;t hide anymore with 10x magnification and that helps you to look a little more civilized.</li>
            <li> As we get older our eye sight gets worse.  </li>
            <li> This one fits in well with my other lucite accessories.  </li>
            <li> see,  makes  it  a little  harder  to  use.</li>
            <li> It is very small even smaller than what the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars, even though it knocked my self esteem down a few points, because it does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> at least its small enough to pack.</li>
            <li> This little mirror made it intact through about 3weeks and 8000 miles of air and ground travel with me this summer packed into my suitcase.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is a little small (diameter).  </li>
            <li> Poor quality, hinge is too loose</li>
            <li> I needed a small travel mirror that was beyond the usual 5X magnification.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure anyone needs to see their pores that close.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I thought my pores were a lot smaller and my wrinkles a lot thinner.  </li>
            <li> My vision is not very good, which is why I bought the mirror - so I could see to apply makeup and tweeze brows.</li>
            <li> they are  hard  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these mirrors in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> So my complaint is aimed solely at the product itself.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Unusable, it has a ridiculous amount of distortion.</li>
            <li> The outside construction is plastic, so I foresee that it may crack if I drop the mirror (plus the added 7 years of bad luck.)</li>
            <li> The frame itself is flimsy and there is no good way of holding that mirror when you are trying to work on your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as a replacement for one that was broken.  </li>
            <li> it was broken when it got here.  </li>
            <li> But beware, the base is too thin for how heavy the bulk of the mirror is.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is distorted and useless and the price of almost $14 makes me wonder what in the world influences the price of mirrors???</li>
            <li> I  think ill  </li>
            <li> (I have bad eyesight and need glasses and so need the 10x to put on eye make up).</li>
            <li> the 10x magnify is worthless and impractical</li>
            <li> There is a hole in the base, which I&#x27;m assuming is there</li>
            <li> x10 can NOT see crap!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for an installed mirror in our simple bathroom, but I do need 10x magnification to see to insert my contacts.  This is perfect!  It can sit on the windowsill, available whenever I need it.  On the other side is a regular mirror, good to use to check the back of my hair after I&#x27;ve blown it dry.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It is perfect for travel and home.  The 10X is just what I need too. The mirror is ver clear with no distortion.</li>
            <li> I needed a small travel mirror that was beyond the usual 5X magnification.  This mirror is a perfect fit.  It is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great 1X/10X mirror...just what I was &#x27;looking&#x27; for...the plastic exterior makes it nice &amp; light &amp; easy to move around...tho&#x27; I wish it were a bit bigger...at least its small enough to pack.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but it is a little small (diameter).  I have not tried to mount it on a wall yet.</li>
            <li> love this mirror great price</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I needed.  Had difficulty finding a mirror this strong locally and was so excited to find it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> Wife really uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> read another  review  and  it  says  you have  to  hold  it  real  close to  see,  makes  it  a little  harder  to  use.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to replace an old one that had been my Mom&#x27;s.  Not only is it a true replacement it is also much lighter and easier to handle.  The magnification is perfect for mascara application and tweezing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Is it just me, or does everyone have to hold the magnifying side of this mirror within eight inches of her face to use it? My vision is not very good, which is why I bought the mirror - so I could see to apply makeup and tweeze brows. I&#x27;m able to use it for tweezing, but not for applying my makeup. I gave it four stars because the issue may not be with the mirror, but with the user.</li>
            <li> A great deal! This is the best 10X mirror, especially for the price. And it&#x27;s just large enough too. I love it!</li>
            <li> As we get older our eye sight gets worse.  This is a great mirror for putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> The mirror works ok as a regular make up mirror but the magnification side is pretty blurry depending on the angle and where in the mirror you look.  I have to get it right up to my face to get it to focus and that takes away from being hands free.  I guess for the price it should be expected.  I wish the angling on the stand was a bit better too.</li>
            <li> Fell off a bed and the hinges broke. Fragile and not worth the spend</li>
            <li> I wanted a mirror for close-up.  Wanted one a little larger, but couldn&#x27;t find one.  Great price, close-up...does the job!!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about 10x magnification. Yes, now I can pluck my eyebrows and stray facial hairs with ease but I am not sure anyone needs to see their pores that close. If you think that your skin is smooth and blackhead free stay away from 10x or you will be disillusioned!</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I needed.  I recently started to use contact lenses and needed 10x magnification and hands free viewing.  Nice and clear and seems to have a sturdy base.  Received very quick, love PRIME!</li>
            <li> Good price and the product is quality for the cost. Clear view and flips easy.</li>
            <li> The Rucci Clear Vanity Mirror, 1X/10X  is an excellent mirror. There is no distortion and the 10x magnification is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as a replacement for one that was broken.  I did not know the magnification of it.  The 10X magnification is very large.  I have to hold it very close to be able to get a clear image.  Had I known something about the magnification strengths I probably would have gotten about a 8X.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for my needs. I need to see close up for4 various tasks and this gets close up and personal.</li>
            <li> getting older, one of the first things that goes is good eyesight.  try putting eye make-up on with glasses!  not possible.  this mirror is sooo good i had to get an extra one!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for in a 10X mirror.  Excellent price, good quality mirror without waving.  The stand is plastic but I had expected that.  Would buy again in a minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Poor quality, hinge is too loose so it does not stay at the angle I want it.  But I also searched for the cheapest one, so I guess you get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> The magnifying mirror is way too powerful to use for applying makeup.  The regular side is fine for just about anything except applying makeup.</li>
            <li> This mirror really is perfect and easy to use... however, my last mirror was lighted and when ordering this I completely forgot how useful the light could be.  That being said, I was going to buy a lighted mirror after purchasing this one, and honestly could not find something simple without extra panels and bells and whistles that I did not need.  No big deal, I just turn the lights on in the bathroom or use the natural light in the room when using this mirror.  Works perfectly fine without a light.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these to use around the house and they are actually pretty nice.  They are better made than I thought they would be.  I&#x27;d buy again...</li>
            <li> nice size for limited bathroom counter space&lt;br /&gt;magnification is good for tweezing&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to a friend&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced, good value</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law.  My mom saw hers and loved it so much, I bought it for her too.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price.  It has a good, clear image. I bought this for travel purposes and it worked great.</li>
            <li> So excited to receive it - using it for medical purposes - well, it&#x27;s here and I can&#x27;t see a thing in it, it is blurrrrrr - the 5X is clear and accurate for the purpose I require to use this 10X - I can&#x27;t - so I don&#x27;t understand why people are raving about the blurring 10X mirror ??????</li>
            <li> Much better than mirrors I bought at other stores.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using magnifying mirrors for 20 years to put on my makeup. I&#x27;ve only used one brand, upgrading magnification until I&#x27;m at the present magnification of 9X. I&#x27;ve been using an older 7X version for traveling and decided to find a higher mag without breaking the bank. I decided to give the Ricci a try since it was 10X mag, great price AND was a larger diameter than most of the travel mirrors out there. I didn&#x27;t like the cheap frame, seemed very fragile, but due to the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much there. However, I found the mirror itself has a LOT of distortion and there was only a very tiny area in the center that was really functional. Again, I&#x27;ve had years in using magnifying mirrors, so I know what to expect in a quality mirror. I should have sent it back, but I didn&#x27;t. I will say the product&#x27;s package and shipping time were good. So my complaint is aimed solely at the product itself.</li>
            <li> Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.</li>
            <li> After I bought this mirror, I found I didn&#x27;t have enough space for it on my vanity. I bought a small round mirror with a magnifying lens and attached it to the large mirror on my medicine cabinet. The Rucci Clear Vanity mirror does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It magnifies.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed to replace a broken mirror in the bathroom.  The size is perfect and the magnification is excellent.  I really like it in clear because it works with all decors.  I would buy another if/when this one gets broken because it&#x27;s perfect for our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this recent purchase.  I can see myself (not so great in the morning....) as the magnification really helps with make-up application.  The outside construction is plastic, so I foresee that it may crack if I drop the mirror (plus the added 7 years of bad luck.)</li>
            <li> I need a magnifying mirror for my eyebrows and for make up. My old one, which had a stand and a light, finally broke down, so I bought this one, hoping to get a good value. However, after using it for several months now, I wished I would have paid more to get a better quality one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you put this mirror in a perfect location and position, you end up having to hold the mirror with your hand right in front of your face to actually use it for close ups. And you have to use the right distance and position to see right. The frame itself is flimsy and there is no good way of holding that mirror when you are trying to work on your face. So, it works if you need a quick close up look, but long term, I will have to look for another product that makes life a little easier than this.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it being a little bigger but it gets the job done. Nice size to put near my sink.</li>
            <li> Larger than I wanted, not as magnified as I need.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this product.  The image in the mirror is somewhat distorted.  I would not recommend this to your buyers.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it or traveling I think???</li>
            <li> I can SEE to pluck my brows without wearing my reading glasses! It didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, can even travel if need be. The only thing I would like to see improved is the holder; it should not come away from the mirror quite so easily. But for the price, I&#x27;ll deal with it!</li>
            <li> The acrylic has seams all over it so it sort of ruins the whole &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; look that it&#x27;s supposed to have. The stand has a mounting hole so that you can hang it off a wall. Both sides of the mirror work well. It&#x27;s hard to find a good 10x magnifying mirror within the price range that this product was purchased at. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. The acrylic parts could have been a bit nicer, but I won&#x27;t complain too much since the mirrors are of good quality. If the acrylic was heavier with less seams and not hollow, I would rave about it.</li>
            <li> It was too powerful for me.  Should have had a five or seven, if they make a seven? Where can I get a seven?</li>
            <li> Nice size magnifying mirror that has very little distortion.  A bonus is the non-magnifying side. I do not use the stand.</li>
            <li> Wanted a new magnifying mirror, and decided against the lighted kind, because vanity light is adequate.  This one fits in well with my other lucite accessories.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for traveling compact. It is blurring , not clear at all. It is very small even smaller than what the picture shows. I would not recommend this to anyone at all.</li>
            <li> i use this only to pluck my eyebrows…the magnification is great.&lt;br /&gt;it looks ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a once a week mirror</li>
            <li> perfect for close in facial grooming.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic mirror for the price. I am a novice when it comes to the new wave make up application so this works for me. I usually up on make up in my bathroom that has great lighting.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Holds a tilted position well without falling back upright. 10x magnification is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t have to use my reading glasses with this mirror.</li>
            <li> My other magnification mirror finally bit the dust.  I decided to try this brand and it will work great.  Good size and nice swivel.</li>
            <li> Very glad to finally find a 10x/1x mirror that is small enough to travel with, and it doesn&#x27;t need to be mounted to any wall!!!  Great mirror for a great price. I love it!!</li>
            <li> the 10 x helps me keep track of the soles of my feet as I am a diabetic  , a must for diabetics</li>
            <li> I use this every single day!  It helps you see every single detail so you can put on makeup flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Love the mirror.  Does what it is supposed to do….magnify things.  Unfortunately I thought my pores were a lot smaller and my wrinkles a lot thinner.  Not for use first thing in the morning if you want to have a good day.  I give it 4 stars, even though it knocked my self esteem down a few points, because it does what it is supposed to.  This mirror should team up with a really good skin cleansing, wrinkle diminishing product and you would have a win-win situation.</li>
            <li> it was broken when it got here.  I had to super glue it together.  its not very sturdy &amp; is too bulky for what I need it for</li>
            <li> I had a 7x but needed a little more.  I looked at some 14x in local stores and it was too much.  Ordered this 10x and it is just right for me.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its perfect, I use it every day. Whether its just to check to make sure nothings out of place or to make sure I apply my make up correctly. (I have bad eyesight and need glasses and so need the 10x to put on eye make up).</li>
            <li> This is my third one and I bought 2 for gifts.  Truly wonderful.  You can see things you are looking for and things you really don&#x27;t want to see!</li>
            <li> Basically the magnifying side is out of focus depending on the angle you&#x27;re looking at it from.  Kind of strange.  Its small plastic and just generally cheap feeling.  Probably will throw it away and buy a real mirror spending more on it.</li>
            <li> Like others said (and I should have listened) can&#x27;t really see your entire face to put make up - not enough viewing for that.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  10x magnification may be a shock for some and it prompted me to schedule an appointment for a facial.</li>
            <li> Great mirror. It took a while to get it but it has been worth the wait. It is good quality and attractive with a good base for standing.</li>
            <li> The double mirror is great--normal on one side and 10X on the other.  I can use one side for makeup and the other side to check the back of my hair.  It has a sturdy, flexible plastic cover, but I have put it inside another soft zippered case for packing, although it probably doesn&#x27;t need both. It is not tall, and I have a taller mirror I use at home.  When traveling I try to find something to set it on or sometimes just hold it to see.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my overnight bag and it is a perfect fit. The mirror itself is perfect for my needs and the magnification is great. All around I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what we needed.  However, the plastic lenses are susceptible to scratching.</li>
            <li> those nasty little hidden hairs can&#x27;t hide anymore with 10x magnification and that helps you to look a little more civilized.</li>
            <li> i just needed something small for my room and this does the trick marvelously. nothing fancy, but it looks clean and nice and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> the 10x magnify is worthless and impractical</li>
            <li> Unusable, it has a ridiculous amount of distortion. I found a better one with lighting at costco. for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Mirror is very clear and the plastic frame is of good quality. I just wish the hinge  that holds the mirror is adjustable so I can tighten or loosen the tension.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sturdy product. The magnification is stronger than I thought it would be . I think 5x would have been better for applying make-up.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our kids.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for the one I used for years.  Looks and performs exactly like the one that broke.</li>
            <li> If you want to see everything on your face, this is the mirror for you. My mother loves it!</li>
            <li> I use it every morning to put on my makeup.  Sometimes you see more than you want, but sometimes you need to.</li>
            <li> Love the 10x.  The mirror is smaller than what I thought I had ordered.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was a travel mirror.  Still a good mirror and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I took this to Europe.  It was so easy putting on my makeup.  Hotel mirrors do not have enough light.  Loaned to my sister for her vacation.  She thought that it was great also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best nor fanciest magnification mirror, but for basic makeup application and occasional use it&#x27;s perfect for what I needed and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for me. I wear cheater readers-without them I can&#x27;t see anything close up. Having this mirror has made it possible for me to apply makeup again!</li>
            <li> My old one broke but didn&#x27;t care as I didn&#x27;t care for the color. I was very pleased that I found this clear plastic one on Amazon and at a cheaper price. Very clear view. I prefer the 10x for plucking eyebrows so this works well.</li>
            <li> This mirror has a regular side and a magnified side.  I am not fond of seeing my face on the 10X side but it might come in handy for spots or blemishs.  I use it to set my hair so I can sit anywhere I please and do my hair.</li>
            <li> x10 can NOT see crap!!!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it. It&#x27;s meets here needs. Right size, magnification and the stand fits her requirements. The only thing that may&lt;br /&gt;need improvement is the strength of the stand. It isn&#x27;t very strong and broke from one drop.</li>
            <li> This little mirror made it intact through about 3weeks and 8000 miles of air and ground travel with me this summer packed into my suitcase. I brought it so as not to tie up a bathroom from my travel-mates just to put on makeup, etc... I was going to leave it in Europe just so not to have so much baggage coming home but decided it was to useful for that. The 10x mag is perfect for plucking eyebrows, you can actually shape your brow hair by hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this mirror as it was the perfect size for at home and travel. But beware, the base is too thin for how heavy the bulk of the mirror is. It&#x27;s too skinny to support the mirror, so when you try to angle it certain directions, it just falls down. There is a hole in the base, which I&#x27;m assuming is there so you can mount it down, but that would defeat my intent of being able to have the mirror anywhere. Other than that the mirrors are good quality and magnification is good.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is distorted and useless and the price of almost $14 makes me wonder what in the world influences the price of mirrors???</li>
            <li> It is a little bit smaller than I expected, but sturdy good makeup mirror. I dropped it once in the bathroom, but it is still very fine.</li>
            <li> Do  you know I cant  find a  10 power  mirrow  any  where  else in my town of Butler  I had  to  go  to a flee  market in Florida  to  get  one  so  grab  this one  they are  hard  to  find.... I  think ill  order  another  just  to have a back  up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find these mirrors in stores anymore.  This is very well made for the price and sits nicely on my window sill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I can see better while putting my make up on. Wished I bought one with a stand so it wouldn&#x27;t be so low.  But overall it is fine.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  No problems with the mirror and the resolution is great :)  It does hold its tilt for me!</li>
            <li> she likes it and price was agreeable</li>
            <li> Provides adequate magnification and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Wear glasses - not just any kind - trifocals - it is not easy to take care of your face - with glasses on - and I had ordered a Mag+ mirror and found it not strong enough.  This one was just right.  Cannot afford to get too strong - will  scare me.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and functional, which is exactly what I wanted. A small adjustment in distance fro the mirror can radically change the focus, but it is very workable.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as designed. I use it as a feng shui mirror in my home office as my back faces the door. It fits just perfectly on my desk in front of me and the swivel part of the mirror stays in place where ever I move it. Very clear reflection. Not distorted at all.</li>
            <li> Nice looking mirror for the bathroom counter.  The extra magnification comes in handy at times.  Decent quality for the price, shipped fast and arrived as expected.</li>
