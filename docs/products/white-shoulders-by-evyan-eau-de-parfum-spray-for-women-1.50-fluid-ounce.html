            <li>Such wonderful memories too!</li>

            <li>this was my mothers favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Thank You :)  </li>
            <li>I so wish this was available in a dab-on bottle instead of aerosol spray!  </li>
            <li>But I love this fragrance, regardless.</li>
            <li>A man who could not tell Chanel from Chloe will remember a girlfriend from his youth who wore this magic potion.</li>
            <li>White Shoulders is that perfect blend of flowers and flirtation.</li>
            <li>It may be the perfume men buy most often for the women in their lives.  </li>
            <li>It has never lost its popularity, and that trademark cameo on peach background has achieved iconic status.  </li>
            <li>Subtlety is always sexy.  </li>
            <li>Subtlety is always sexy.  </li>
            <li>These are the next best thing.</li>
            <li>First there is a good bit of tuberose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only scent I I&#x27;ve worn for 45 years and always get compliments on the lovely and beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>Summer time and the living is easy.</li>
            <li>Love the clean, light scent and always get compliments whenever I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23, and I think this works beautifully with my heavily retro inspired style (I&#x27;m an all pencil skirts, all the time kind of a gal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- perhaps I smelled it on someone - but I searched for it on Amazon and luckily found it!  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect floral blend of roses, gardenia, jasmine and lilac, sparked with a little hint of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came so fast and secure, I sent it to my mom and it really made her happy that I payed attention to what she asked for.  .</li>
            <li>They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product.</li>
            <li>It was a good price but not for an old product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>very fresh</li>
            <li>This is a very one of a kind clean and sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>My first love wore that!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also heard &amp;#34;my</li>
            <li>but once he takes that first innocent sniff, he&#x27;s hooked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just gotten this in the mail today what a wonderfull mothers day gift looks just like the picture and smells just like white shoulders great seller from  tankist free shipping came very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>This item came very promptly and packaged very securely.  </li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis because it is a mild and pleasant fragrance  </li>
            <li>This may or may not be true, but it certainly seems to work that way on the most unmaidenly of males.</li>
            <li>After I graduated high school, I bought myself a bottle and loved it just as much as when she wore it.  </li>
            <li>It now has quite a cloying, almost sickenly sweet  quality.  </li>
            <li>Oh, how I loved White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It has a floral scent but it isn&#x27;t super girlie.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For more than seventy years, White Shoulders has remained a favorite.</li>
            <li>Consequently, the fragrance is still wonderful, but does not last as long.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>After so many years, their men were coming home and women wanted to welcome them with something lighter and flirtier than those heavy european perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am giving 3 stars as the price for the eau de cologne is still very reasonable, the prompt shipping, and secure packaging, and last but not least, the product itself smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>She use to love this scent and its beautiful soft and totally feminine a bit of heaven for a few dollars</li>
            <li>White Shoulders was my grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li>will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Men love White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t do anything until MUCH later and at a respectable age.  </li>
            <li>Although it is deep enough to be classified as a nighttime scent, the bright gardenia and orange zest give it an ambiguity and a timelessness that is almost unequaled.  </li>
            <li>and you will be satisfied if you like a light scent for everyday.  </li>
            <li>All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  </li>
            <li>I remember that this was the only perfume she would wear and it smelled so fresh and sweet.  </li>
            <li>A good hit of amber, a little bit of pheremonal civet and musk, and a touch of oakmoss and sandalwood give the fragrance a depth and sophistication not usually found in something this floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really hope she get&#x27;s the perfume and not cologne .</li>
            <li>Really like.</li>
            <li>There are fragrances that are more blatant, but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are fragrances that are more blatant, but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My father was VERY strict</li>
            <li>Love White Shoulders,  Its an old scent that never goes out of style.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, Mostly, women like a fragrance that other women&lt;br /&gt;Compliment and Ask about; This One, always Rings that Bell.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant Presentation,Nice Price,Prompt Delivery.</li>
            <li>a classic always modern and up to date.</li>
            <li>I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops.</li>
            <li>Classic perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...</li>
            <li>This earthy fragrance was considered too suggestive for decent women during the Victorian era...</li>
            <li>Hartnell was a classic American designer of the era, and White Shoulders was the first classic American fragrance, feminine but not girlish, strong but not blatant.  </li>
            <li>The color of the liquid was tawny instead of light pink and it is a bit old-smelling.  </li>
            <li>It has become difficult to find in retail stores, so buying it here is a great convenience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But there is more to White Shoulders than that pretty little bouquet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a young woman&#x27;s scent, but a young woman of another era (in a lovely, nostalgic way) all crinolines and lace and lovely flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soft, feminine smell, young and yet vintage, a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>It is the same stuff but for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>With the stuff on the market today that is either too sweet or too sharp and spicy</li>
            <li>As noted previously, I have worn White Shoulders for many years.  </li>
            <li>clearly states Eau De Cologne, which contains more alcohol and less of the essential floral oils.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and it is increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I thought I ordered parfum, what arrived is cologne in a clear bottle.</li>
            <li>On me you get lilac, jasmine and gardenia, and a soft powdery sort of a note.</li>
            <li>clearly marked on the box and on the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>While my father and brothers gave me Channel #5, which I didn&#x27;t care for and promptly gave away because I wanted the much cheaper White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I am 68 years old, have used White Shoulders since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>Clean everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li>While in junior high, my cheerleading and gymastic coach wore White Shoulders</li>
            <li>You can never go wrong with White Shoulders especially when you get it at a great price</li>
            <li>/&gt;White Shoulders is a classic smell, not old fashioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to be a grandma</li>
            <li>A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation.</li>
            <li>A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sufficiently festive for special occasions, delicate enough for the office, and tantalizing enough for seduction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sufficiently festive for special occasions, delicate enough for the office, and tantalizing enough for seduction.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed as White Shoulders is a very beautiful fragrance.</li>

            <li> Men love White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t do anything until MUCH later and at a respectable age.  </li>
            <li> Although it is deep enough to be classified as a nighttime scent, the bright gardenia and orange zest give it an ambiguity and a timelessness that is almost unequaled.  </li>
            <li> and you will be satisfied if you like a light scent for everyday.  </li>
            <li> All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  </li>
            <li> I remember that this was the only perfume she would wear and it smelled so fresh and sweet.  </li>
            <li> A good hit of amber, a little bit of pheremonal civet and musk, and a touch of oakmoss and sandalwood give the fragrance a depth and sophistication not usually found in something this floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really hope she get&#x27;s the perfume and not cologne .</li>
            <li> Really like.</li>
            <li> There are fragrances that are more blatant, but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are fragrances that are more blatant, but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My father was VERY strict</li>
            <li> Love White Shoulders,  Its an old scent that never goes out of style.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, Mostly, women like a fragrance that other women&lt;br /&gt;Compliment and Ask about; This One, always Rings that Bell.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant Presentation,Nice Price,Prompt Delivery.</li>
            <li> a classic always modern and up to date.</li>
            <li> I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops.</li>
            <li> Classic perfume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...</li>
            <li> This earthy fragrance was considered too suggestive for decent women during the Victorian era...</li>
            <li> Hartnell was a classic American designer of the era, and White Shoulders was the first classic American fragrance, feminine but not girlish, strong but not blatant.  </li>
            <li> The color of the liquid was tawny instead of light pink and it is a bit old-smelling.  </li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find in retail stores, so buying it here is a great convenience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But there is more to White Shoulders than that pretty little bouquet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a young woman&#x27;s scent, but a young woman of another era (in a lovely, nostalgic way) all crinolines and lace and lovely flowers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft, feminine smell, young and yet vintage, a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> It is the same stuff but for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> With the stuff on the market today that is either too sweet or too sharp and spicy</li>
            <li> As noted previously, I have worn White Shoulders for many years.  </li>
            <li> clearly states Eau De Cologne, which contains more alcohol and less of the essential floral oils.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it is increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I thought I ordered parfum, what arrived is cologne in a clear bottle.</li>
            <li> On me you get lilac, jasmine and gardenia, and a soft powdery sort of a note.</li>
            <li> clearly marked on the box and on the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> While my father and brothers gave me Channel #5, which I didn&#x27;t care for and promptly gave away because I wanted the much cheaper White Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I am 68 years old, have used White Shoulders since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> Clean everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li> While in junior high, my cheerleading and gymastic coach wore White Shoulders</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with White Shoulders especially when you get it at a great price</li>
            <li> /&gt;White Shoulders is a classic smell, not old fashioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to be a grandma</li>
            <li> A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation.</li>
            <li> A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sufficiently festive for special occasions, delicate enough for the office, and tantalizing enough for seduction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sufficiently festive for special occasions, delicate enough for the office, and tantalizing enough for seduction.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as White Shoulders is a very beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> The white shoulders it last a long time.</li>
            <li> You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box</li>
            <li> clearly not old stock-</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is not the same fragrance I wore in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> putting away the Chanel #5 for the summer and tripping down memory lane with my White Shoulders!</li>
            <li> The product is not returnable, so think carefully before deciding to order.</li>
            <li> rapid and careful shipping but</li>
            <li> Not really perfum but who cares.</li>
            <li> A soft floral sweet scent for women who like florals rather than a citrus base perfume.</li>
            <li> it was a gjft for my mother, she lives in other country ,i send it to her, never used it before</li>
            <li> There are other fragrances offered by this merchant that I have on my wish list, but now I am hesitant to purchase as I was deceived with this one.</li>
            <li> Amazon had made it affordable on my very limited income, I can pamper myself!!!</li>
            <li> It evokes innocence with a little bit of sensuality.  </li>
            <li> I had an aunt that used to wear this when I was a little girl in the 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Acrid, harsh, with no staying power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry, i don&#x27;t speak english well.</li>
            <li> I am too lazy to do the refund.</li>
            <li> I like small bottles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming, there is nothing here to startle a shy romeo...</li>
            <li> I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> one tiny sniff, it was rumored, had a devastatingly aphrodesiac effect on maidens.  </li>
            <li> Too bad there aren&#x27;t expiration dates on cologne.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!  I love this fragrance and it is increasingly hard to find.  Thank you to the sellers for having this product.</li>
            <li> it was a gjft for my mother, she lives in other country ,i send it to her, never used it before and  i heard this perfume was  very famous i hope she likes it</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is the only parfum spray my mother&#x27;s side of the family will wear. I have purchased bottles of parfum in every size, bath powder, cologne, etc...over the years for my aunts, mom and grandma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Shoulders is a classic smell, not old fashioned. It is a timeless smell and one I am used to smelling on my family matriarchs when I hug them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was a good one, as described, I was not disappointed by it. I do not personally wear White Shoulders but I appreciate the non-cloying smell of it.</li>
            <li> It is what I wear-if I wear perfume.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this and I ordered it for her. It came so fast and secure, I sent it to my mom and it really made her happy that I payed attention to what she asked for.  .</li>
            <li> Received it on time and love it.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loved it. I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Loved this when I was in my 20&#x27;s and lived in Fla.  I am now 62 and reminiscing about those days and decided I would order it and see if it would still smell the same.  It does and I am happy I ordered it...putting away the Chanel #5 for the summer and tripping down memory lane with my White Shoulders!</li>
            <li> This is a scent I remember from my twenties. It stll smells as great as I remember. The best part is that it is eau de parfum at an eau de toilette price.</li>
            <li> The scent I remember. Lovely.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the White Shoulders product your mother/grandmother used. The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting. Evyan went out of business in the 80&#x27;s I believe, and the name White Shoulders was bought by Elizabeth Arden (EA Fragrances) and Perfumes Intl. They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product. Acrid, harsh, with no staying power. Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed. Learn from my experience. I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops. There is also powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you see the cursive Evyan signature, a cursive &#x27;E&#x27;, or the trademark phrase &#x27;The Best the World Has to Offer&#x27;. You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box w/cellophane with a $15 price sticker. Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too. There&#x27;s even a market for empties, which I used to just stick in my dresser drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders. Looks like the Goodwill box for them!</li>
            <li> This is always a go-to gift for my mom!  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry, i don&#x27;t speak english well. But this Eau De Parfum is nasty.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this cover cap fell off. Eau De Parfum poured out in a box. I am too lazy to do the refund. Parfum are now in the garbage can. Seller - FarmaFrag.</li>
            <li> Love White Shoulders,  Its an old scent that never goes out of style.  The bath powder is very nice also.</li>
            <li> The product I received was discolored and the fragrance was off.  I was very disappointed as White Shoulders is a very beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mother.  It&#x27;s her favorite perfume and she was happy.  Mama is a Happy Camperƒè</li>
            <li> This item came very promptly and packaged very securely.  However, it is advertised as Eau De Parfum and the label on the bottom of the bottle clearly states Eau De Cologne, which contains more alcohol and less of the essential floral oils.  Consequently, the fragrance is still wonderful, but does not last as long.  There are other fragrances offered by this merchant that I have on my wish list, but now I am hesitant to purchase as I was deceived with this one. I am giving 3 stars as the price for the eau de cologne is still very reasonable, the prompt shipping, and secure packaging, and last but not least, the product itself smells lovely.  If it were the eau de parfum, I would have given 10 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> As noted previously, I have worn White Shoulders for many years.  I use it on a daily basis because it is a mild and pleasant fragrance  I am always complimented by both females and males and am asked for the name of the cologne..</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Just gotten this in the mail today what a wonderfull mothers day gift looks just like the picture and smells just like white shoulders great seller from  tankist free shipping came very fast in the mail.Will buy again from seller very fast and the package is nice as well lovely good job.Will buy one for myself since the seller was so good.</li>
            <li> same as above!  people used to hug me and say I smelled like their Grandma.  I&#x27;m glad you asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles and I thought if I bought two I reached the maximum and got a discount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only scent I I&#x27;ve worn for 45 years and always get compliments on the lovely and beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  White Shoulders was my grandma&#x27;s favorite perfume but I don&#x27;t think this is just for grandmothers.  It evokes innocence with a little bit of sensuality.  It has a floral scent but it isn&#x27;t super girlie.  I&#x27;ve just rediscovered this fragrance and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It&#x27;s something I plan on keeping in my perfume stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Oh sheesh, this review wasn&#x27;t an insult to grandmothers.  I&#x27;m old enough to be a grandma and I wouldn&#x27;t insult myself or others with a perfume review.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is not the same fragrance I wore in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s.  It now has quite a cloying, almost sickenly sweet  quality.  The product is not returnable, so think carefully before deciding to order.</li>
            <li> Happy to find this perfume on here as it is a gift for my mum who loves this and in her area she can&#x27;t find it anywhere over there. A soft floral sweet scent for women who like florals rather than a citrus base perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for, oh, 35 years or so.  I like small bottles so it doesn&#x27;t age while I use it. The color of the liquid was tawny instead of light pink and it is a bit old-smelling.  It was a good price but not for an old product. Too bad there aren&#x27;t expiration dates on cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom last year, as she used to wear it some 30-40 years ago. She was thrilled it was still being made. However, it didn&#x27;t smell the same on her as she remembered. Perhaps because our bodies change as we age. Seems to smell the same as I remember it when just squirted into the air, but who knows.</li>
            <li> She loves it, Mostly, women like a fragrance that other women&lt;br /&gt;Compliment and Ask about; This One, always Rings that Bell.&lt;br /&gt;Elegant Presentation,Nice Price,Prompt Delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> One of my best friends wears this a lot, and I just love the aroma.  I like having a variety of scents around to suit my moods.</li>
            <li> my mom loves this and it smells good on her</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered parfum, what arrived is cologne in a clear bottle. Scent doesn&#x27;t last but 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> White Shoulders is the only scent my wife will wear. It has become difficult to find in retail stores, so buying it here is a great convenience.</li>
            <li> I love  this perfume!! I am glad I found it again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SCENT.  YOU CAN ONLY FIND IT ON THE INTERNET</li>
            <li> Always my favorite.  Fragrance is very light and not overpowering.  Classic perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear - will order again.</li>
            <li> lovely scent-&lt;br /&gt;and clearly not old stock- very fresh</li>
            <li> Great, I gave as a gift.</li>
            <li> While in junior high, my cheerleading and gymastic coach wore White Shoulders and I just loved the scent on her.  After I graduated high school, I bought myself a bottle and loved it just as much as when she wore it.  Haven&#x27;t had it since - and I&#x27;m 49!  I can&#x27;t say what made me think of this again - perhaps I smelled it on someone - but I searched for it on Amazon and luckily found it!  It arrived two days ago and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since.  Just as lovely as I remember!  One spray in the morning stays on me all day!  Thank you, thank you!  Such wonderful memories too!</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old, have used White Shoulders since I was in high school.  Love the clean, light scent and always get compliments whenever I wear it.  Amazon had made it affordable on my very limited income, I can pamper myself!!!</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with White Shoulders especially when you get it at a great price</li>
            <li> On me you get lilac, jasmine and gardenia, and a soft powdery sort of a note. It&#x27;s a very soft, feminine smell, young and yet vintage, a timeless classic. I&#x27;m 23, and I think this works beautifully with my heavily retro inspired style (I&#x27;m an all pencil skirts, all the time kind of a gal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to come up with one word to describe it I&#x27;d say... pretty or perhaps dainty. It&#x27;s a young woman&#x27;s scent, but a young woman of another era (in a lovely, nostalgic way) all crinolines and lace and lovely flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I find it enchanting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 30 years. It is the same stuff but for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfum! Great price! I always shop for good prices on this scent, looks like I have found the best place to buy it!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume, I bought it as a Christmas gift for myself. Fast service, smells just as great as I remember.</li>
            <li> mom has had many ups and downs this year health wise. this is her signature scent. bought it to keep her close.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my Mother-In -Law for Mother&#x27;s Day and I saw some of the reviews and I really hope she get&#x27;s the perfume and not cologne . I just ordered it today and they are already preparing it as of now and for the total price I was able to get her 2 bottles of her favorite perfumes instead of just 1 .</li>
            <li> What can I say...it&#x27;s White Shoulders!  All of the white flower fragrances, which, I&#x27;ve found, spark lovely memories in the older generations.  They remember it but just can&#x27;t place it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had older gentlemen say...&amp;#34;Oh, what is that perfume? My first love wore that!&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also heard &amp;#34;my mother/sister wore that&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Shoulders is the ultimate in femininity, which is a rarity these days.</li>
            <li> Was used by Debbie Reynolds...a classic always modern and up to date. Love to smell it on my wife. A timeless fragrance.</li>
            <li> rapid and careful shipping but just didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> this was my mothers favorite perfume. i bought it because the scent reminds me of all the times she would give us hugs.</li>
            <li> This was PERFECT!!--just as described, I received an eau de perfume...NOT an eau de cologne. clearly marked on the box and on the bottom of the bottle.  Thank You :)  will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I so wish this was available in a dab-on bottle instead of aerosol spray!  I am anti-aerosol for almost everything - it&#x27;s so wasteful. But I love this fragrance, regardless.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend but it smells just like my mom!! She use to love this scent and its beautiful soft and totally feminine a bit of heaven for a few dollars</li>
            <li> Really like. The white shoulders it last a long time. Very nice</li>
            <li> Men love White Shoulders.  A man who could not tell Chanel from Chloe will remember a girlfriend from his youth who wore this magic potion. White Shoulders is that perfect blend of flowers and flirtation. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, there is nothing here to startle a shy romeo...but once he takes that first innocent sniff, he&#x27;s hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The House of Hartnell introduced White Shoulders  at the end of the second world war.  After so many years, their men were coming home and women wanted to welcome them with something lighter and flirtier than those heavy european perfumes. Hartnell was a classic American designer of the era, and White Shoulders was the first classic American fragrance, feminine but not girlish, strong but not blatant.  It is a perfect floral blend of roses, gardenia, jasmine and lilac, sparked with a little hint of orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is more to White Shoulders than that pretty little bouquet.  First there is a good bit of tuberose. This earthy fragrance was considered too suggestive for decent women during the Victorian era...one tiny sniff, it was rumored, had a devastatingly aphrodesiac effect on maidens.  This may or may not be true, but it certainly seems to work that way on the most unmaidenly of males. A good hit of amber, a little bit of pheremonal civet and musk, and a touch of oakmoss and sandalwood give the fragrance a depth and sophistication not usually found in something this floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more than seventy years, White Shoulders has remained a favorite. It may be the perfume men buy most often for the women in their lives.  The House of Hartnell disappeared in the 1950s, but the fragrance was acquired by Evyan and  later became part of the Elizabeth Arden fragrance collection.  It has never lost its popularity, and that trademark cameo on peach background has achieved iconic status.  Although it is deep enough to be classified as a nighttime scent, the bright gardenia and orange zest give it an ambiguity and a timelessness that is almost unequaled.  There are fragrances that are more blatant, but none have the unforgettable allure of White Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sufficiently festive for special occasions, delicate enough for the office, and tantalizing enough for seduction. Subtlety is always sexy.  A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation. So is this perfume.melessness that is almost unequaled.

Subtlety is always sexy.  A bare white shoulder is an invitation to temptation. So is this perfume.</li>
            <li> Clean everyday fragrance.  Not overbearing and you will be satisfied if you like a light scent for everyday.  Price is great too.</li>
            <li> I had an aunt that used to wear this when I was a little girl in the 1960&#x27;s.  I remember that this was the only perfume she would wear and it smelled so fresh and sweet.  With the stuff on the market today that is either too sweet or too sharp and spicy I too will become the progenitor of keeping this scent in vogue in my family and at work by wearing it. the last time I took the subway in nyc a woman approached me and asked me what I was wearing. I said &amp;#34;white shoulders&amp;#34; that was about six years ago and I never forgot that. This is a very one of a kind clean and sweet smelling perfume. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife likes White Shoulders which they don&#x27;t make anymore.  These are the next best thing. Not really perfum but who cares.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my sister-in-law.  She loved it, so I am happy.  It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> WOW!  What memories as a teenager in the 1960s bursting with raging hormones and not knowing what to do with it all.  My father was VERY strict so I didn&#x27;t do anything until MUCH later and at a respectable age.  Oh, how I loved White Shoulders.  While my father and brothers gave me Channel #5, which I didn&#x27;t care for and promptly gave away because I wanted the much cheaper White Shoulders.  Makes me feel like a gypsy or a flower child.  What a thrill this is to re-experience my teenage life.  Summer time and the living is easy.</li>
