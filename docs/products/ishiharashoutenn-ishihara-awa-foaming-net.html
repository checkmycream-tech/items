            <li>it makes my milk cleanser leathers well and more effective!</li>
            <li>Now, I get so many compliments on my skin even without wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li>Meh, to each they&#x27;re own.</li>
            <li>and it feels really nice.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a rip off for what it is to be honest</li>
            <li>When I was in China, people used to always ask if I had some kind of skin condition because my forehead was covered in pimples.</li>
            <li>(I know, first world problems and incredibly lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can easily rub two hands together and bam! suds.</li>
            <li>Would probably buy more often if it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>i thought quality would be better.</li>
            <li>I love all the bubbles</li>
            <li>Put your favorite foaming soap and squish around.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>And so cute and functional.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the service and the product. :)</li>
            <li>I just started using korean skincare products, more specifically TonyMoly&#x27;s eggpore soap.</li>
            <li>(super affordable)&lt;br /&gt;-foams up cleanser really nicely and fast&lt;</li>
            <li>Get it if you can, love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Creates foam easily and saves time instead of using hand to create foam.</li>
            <li>but it fell apart easily thou</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty popular.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the simplest most useful skincare product I own right now, not to mention it&#x27;s CHEAP.</li>
            <li>This foaming net is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but boy is it worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this foaming net to wash my face more effectively instead of just rubbing a bar of soap on my face.</li>
            <li>This little net is perfect for making ANY foam wash ever better!</li>
            <li>Kinda fell apart too quickly but it did get the job done while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and is a lot more fun to use than my cleanser alone</li>
            <li>It is more fragile than I thought, but i still love this product.</li>
            <li>--it actually makes washing your face a enjoyable experience!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Amazing foaming net!!</li>
            <li>the foam that it creates consists of bubbles too large to effectively clean skin?</li>
            <li>Makes very fluffy bubbles that makes gentle cleansing such a wonderful experience. :)</li>
            <li>but no, I actually really love this and will buy again and again until I die lol.</li>
            <li>Totally get this product I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this foaming net.</li>
            <li>For one, it pays for itself because I only have to use 1/3 or less of the amount of product I normally use which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I use is with my Sana Nameraka Isoflavone Cleansing Wash, and it makes my product foam up so much with such little product and its really dense too, which is super surprising!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cool and leaves my face feeling really fresh and the foam isn&#x27;t as strong as just applying the cleanser to the face so it feels less stripped of it&#x27;s moisture, my face feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>This little thing is so cute!</li>
            <li>and I have large oily clogged pores.</li>
            <li>For the most part, Asian facial cleansers are meant to be super foamy because it&#x27;s believed that you shouldn&#x27;t really touch/rub your skin while cleansing (exfoliating being an exception).</li>
            <li>the idea is great so that net dries during day with little hang up hook.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>otherwise i really like it.</li>
            <li>Komenuka Bijin Ns-k All-natural Facial Cleansing Foam 100g + Free Sample]]</li>
            <li>I do like it, but probably won&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this anymore because I found that I didn&#x27;t really care too much for the Ibuki line and found that making my cleanser foamy was something laborious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have cons for the product itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product does it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>This little foaming net is really amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is a rather unique foaming net.</li>
            <li>For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with the line Shiseido, it&#x27;s a Japanese skin care line</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this costs substantially less if bought in Japan as it is made in China, but it works so well</li>
            <li>I found that I was able to cut my product use in half.</li>
            <li>Because of its design I get way more foam than the traditional net.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is wet the net with warm water</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But just so you are aware, the whole point of this is ONLY to foam up</li>
            <li>This handy little sundry has a way of making those often pricey cleansers last.</li>
            <li>Adorable foam net, but is not what I expected like.</li>
            <li>creates a great thick foam with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>It makes the bubbles super tiny where it gets deep in your pores.</li>
            <li>arrived exactly on time, and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>This little foaming net is SO COOL.</li>
            <li>&quot; are made out of and it is filled with 3 different colored pieces of tulle-like material that are gathered into small balls, in case you can&#x27;t tell in the stock photo.  </li>
            <li>The net is a soft type of net that bath \\&quot;poufs\\</li>
            <li>The thick luxurious foam that it helps creates makes washing your face a mini spa experience and really helps you achieve that deep down clean.</li>

            <li> The title of my review might make the foaming net sounds like it&#x27;s bad, but honestly, there&#x27;s no other way to describe it.</li>
            <li> I expected maybe the size of my palm such as the one I get at my local asian market.</li>
            <li> I simply wet the pouf, rub some of my soap on the middle of the net, and rub the net into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> has already stretched out.</li>
            <li> I actually plan to buy another one, so I can keep one in my shower and the other at the sink where I wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li> I liquify African black soap and it still works to foam.</li>
            <li> Only bad side is that I have used it for a little more than a month and one of the foam makers(?)</li>
            <li> Does what it says but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an essential product needed for an everyday routine.</li>
            <li> so it is damp, not dripping wet, put a small dab of a foaming cleanser in the middle and then just start squishing it around in one hand</li>
            <li> It has 3 small net balls in a bag.</li>
            <li> You also get a small suction cup hook to hang the net in the shower.</li>
            <li> The little loofas inside the net broke apart after a few use.</li>
            <li> I then just squeeze the foaming net until all the foam is forced out and wash my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little while to come, though.</li>
            <li> Just so stinking small!</li>
            <li> it is too expensive for what it is..  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This little net is perfect for making ANY foam wash ever better! I can&#x27;t wash my face without it! Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Does what it says but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an essential product needed for an everyday routine. I keep wondering, what&#x27;s the point? I can easily rub two hands together and bam! suds. But I do notice that I don&#x27;t need as must facial cleaner when using the foaming net. Meh, to each they&#x27;re own. The product itself is perfect and just as described.</li>
            <li> The little loofas inside the net broke apart after a few use. Just buy a facial brush and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> the idea is great so that net dries during day with little hang up hook.  mesh coud be a bit softer on outside otherwise i really like it.</li>
            <li> Good to use, save on cleanser by using this. Creates foam easily and saves time instead of using hand to create foam.</li>
            <li> Kinda fell apart too quickly but it did get the job done while it lasted.</li>
            <li> This foaming net is great. I bought it because it felt like my cleansers were only working at surface level and I have large oily clogged pores. My skin has improved since using this, the foam penetrates without leaving my skin feeling stripped. I liquify African black soap and it still works to foam. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a person on Youtube so I tried it out. It works really well, and is a lot more fun to use than my cleanser alone and it feels really nice. Only bad side is that I have used it for a little more than a month and one of the foam makers(?) has already stretched out. It is more fragile than I thought, but i still love this product. Would probably buy more often if it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> love! will purchase again definitely! it makes my milk cleanser leathers well and more effective!</li>
            <li> Just so stinking small! I expected maybe the size of my palm such as the one I get at my local asian market. This \\&quot;loofah\\&quot; I think is barbie doll intended, about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> it is too expensive for what it is..  i thought quality would be better.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a rip off for what it is to be honest but no, I actually really love this and will buy again and again until I die lol. For one, it pays for itself because I only have to use 1/3 or less of the amount of product I normally use which is awesome. I love all the bubbles it&#x27;s so cool and leaves my face feeling really fresh and the foam isn&#x27;t as strong as just applying the cleanser to the face so it feels less stripped of it&#x27;s moisture, my face feels cleaner. Totally get this product I love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing foaming net!! I use is with my Sana Nameraka Isoflavone Cleansing Wash, and it makes my product foam up so much with such little product and its really dense too, which is super surprising! It works so well, it makes my product feel like velvet on my skin! Get it if you can, love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> This is a rather unique foaming net. It has 3 small net balls in a bag. Put your favorite foaming soap and squish around. Because of its design I get way more foam than the traditional net. You also get a small suction cup hook to hang the net in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it but it fell apart easily thou and I thought this product was a bit over priced.</li>
            <li> It was perfect. And so cute and functional. A little pricey but worth it. The balls inside helped make it easier for my cleanser to foam.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while to come, though.</li>
            <li> This little foaming net is really amazing!  I&#x27;m sure that this costs substantially less if bought in Japan as it is made in China, but it works so well that I didn&#x27;t mind paying over $8.00 for it. I actually plan to buy another one, so I can keep one in my shower and the other at the sink where I wash my face at night.  I&#x27;ve taken several photos that I have attempted to post; hopefully they will show up!  The net is a soft type of net that bath \\&quot;poufs\\&quot; are made out of and it is filled with 3 different colored pieces of tulle-like material that are gathered into small balls, in case you can&#x27;t tell in the stock photo.  All you have to do is wet the net with warm water so it is damp, not dripping wet, put a small dab of a foaming cleanser in the middle and then just start squishing it around in one hand and then \\&quot;wring\\&quot; off the foam to use it.  The foam is so creamy it is almost like shaving cream--it actually makes washing your face a enjoyable experience!  I use mine with KOMENUKA BIJIN CLEANSING FOAM that I bought here on Amazon. [[ASIN:B008U404M2 Komenuka Bijin Ns-k All-natural Facial Cleansing Foam 100g + Free Sample]]</li>
            <li> This handy little sundry has a way of making those often pricey cleansers last. I found that I was able to cut my product use in half. The thick luxurious foam that it helps creates makes washing your face a mini spa experience and really helps you achieve that deep down clean.</li>
            <li> Adorable foam net, but is not what I expected like. But still good.</li>
            <li> I love this foaming net. Makes very fluffy bubbles that makes gentle cleansing such a wonderful experience. :)</li>
            <li> the foam that it creates consists of bubbles too large to effectively clean skin? It&#x27;s just not dense enough. I prefer to make a cloud of suds with just my two hands. This net creates foam quicker and easier, and the foam is lighter than what you would make just rubbing your hands together. but i think the foam is inferior to foam made using the traditional way.</li>
            <li> The title of my review might make the foaming net sounds like it&#x27;s bad, but honestly, there&#x27;s no other way to describe it. I do like it, but probably won&#x27;t use it much. I bought it because I bought a Shiseido Ibuki starter kit from Sephora. For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with the line Shiseido, it&#x27;s a Japanese skin care line that&#x27;s pretty popular. For the most part, Asian facial cleansers are meant to be super foamy because it&#x27;s believed that you shouldn&#x27;t really touch/rub your skin while cleansing (exfoliating being an exception). If your cleanser doesn&#x27;t come out as foam, you should buy a foaming net so that your cleanser will be foamy. I don&#x27;t use this anymore because I found that I didn&#x27;t really care too much for the Ibuki line and found that making my cleanser foamy was something laborious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-cost (super affordable)&lt;br /&gt;-foams up cleanser really nicely and fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have cons for the product itself. The only con I can think of is that I have to physically rub it to get foam  (I know, first world problems and incredibly lazy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product does it&#x27;s job very well. If you want something to foam up, get this. But just so you are aware, the whole point of this is ONLY to foam up cleanser- DON&#x27;T USE THIS AS A SUBSTITUTE FACE SCRUB/SPONGE. That&#x27;s not what this is for.</li>
            <li> arrived exactly on time, and the product was as expected. I am satisfied with the service and the product. :)</li>
            <li> This little thing is so cute! Does exactly as described! I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> REALLY great product. I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months and it&#x27;s still in working condition. After using foam cleansers, my skin has cleared up immensely. When I was in China, people used to always ask if I had some kind of skin condition because my forehead was covered in pimples. Now, I get so many compliments on my skin even without wearing any makeup!</li>
            <li> I just started using korean skincare products, more specifically TonyMoly&#x27;s eggpore soap. I bought this foaming net to wash my face more effectively instead of just rubbing a bar of soap on my face. This little foaming net is SO COOL. It&#x27;s the simplest most useful skincare product I own right now, not to mention it&#x27;s CHEAP. creates a great thick foam with minimal effort. I simply wet the pouf, rub some of my soap on the middle of the net, and rub the net into the palm of my hand. so simple. I then just squeeze the foaming net until all the foam is forced out and wash my face. I can tell already this is going to help me cleanser last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> very happy with product and seller</li>
            <li> It makes the bubbles super tiny where it gets deep in your pores. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but boy is it worth it!</li>
