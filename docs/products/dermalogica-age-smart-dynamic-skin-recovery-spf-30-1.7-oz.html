            <li>Nice to find something that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I liked how my skin felt and purchased a starter size to put it to the test for a month.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so good and is great for the mature skin  </li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>so I buy many of them</li>
            <li>but i still like the age repair better.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>you do get more bang for your buck and with the bonus of glowing skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light, non greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, and unscented, goes on smoothly with no fuss.</li>
            <li>Smart Skin Recovery feels very refreshing, light and just right on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, most creams with SPF feel heavy and Dermalogica Age</li>
            <li>Which means more protection against the sun.&lt;br /&gt;The woman that does my facials every 3 months highly recommended it and it is working!</li>
            <li>For all-day exposure, I use an SPF 50+  full spectrum non-greasy sweat-resistant sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have always tried to take good care of my skin, but after moving to Central FL the sun, heat, and humidity plays havoc with my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the age smart rich moisturizing cream!</li>
            <li>After using these products I experienced \\&quot;old skin\\&quot; sloughing off replaced with \\&quot;new\\&quot; skin that is soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>As for the smell... not so good unless you like smelling like men&#x27;s shaving cream all day long.</li>
            <li>This cream is very silky and blends in very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday moisturizer with some sun protection.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and does feel nice but it does not go on heavy or creamy.</li>
            <li>but this was the first time i tried this one.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and have found them to be consistent and my skins responds&lt;br /&gt;nicely to them.</li>
            <li>I am 61 and have been told I have pretty skin tone.</li>
            <li>So far so good, it burns sometimes though if it overlaps with other lotions.</li>
            <li>I am now musing all of the Age Smart line of Dermatologica</li>
            <li>Dermalogica Age Smart Overnight Repair Serum 0.5</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the daily hydrofoliant I have seen a huge difference in my sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I cover my face, neck, top of ears with slightly less than a quarter size amount.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dermalogica products for a few years and I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica Age smart dynamic Skin recovery SPF for 10 years as a skin protection from the sun!  </li>
            <li>I have now purchased the entire Dermalogica Age Smart Skin line.</li>
            <li>but it does make it feel soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft .</li>
            <li>I have used this product over one month and find my skin to be soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>SPF 30 works well on an average day but would not be my choice for a full day in the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands with SPF and found most of them to be too thick and not easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Dermalogica should really look into adding a different essential oil.</li>
            <li>product was used on my face after a professional facial.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica for years but this is a dud. It leaves my face a little on the oily side but it does make it feel soft. As for the smell... not so good unless you like smelling like men&#x27;s shaving cream all day long. Dermalogica should really look into adding a different essential oil. At least the product is not animal tested which is a BIG PLUS +</li>
            <li> I love this product  It makes my skin feel so good and is great for the mature skin  I am now musing all of the Age Smart line of Dermatologica</li>
            <li> all dermalogoca products are great so I buy many of them but this was the first time i tried this one. it is very good but i still like the age repair better. this one has a weird smell as if there is a talc in it or something. it is easy to use and does feel nice but it does not go on heavy or creamy.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist swears by Dermalogica. I&#x27;ve been using this product for more almost three weeks and the good news is that it is not harming my skin. It&#x27;s too soon to determine any long term effects.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005KW8K00 Dermalogica Age Smart Overnight Repair Serum 0.5 oz/15 ml]]I love this product.  The aroma is intoxicating.  I just started using it and can&#x27;t wait to see the results</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It has actually lightened my skin over the past year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means it has lightened those brown age spots!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it has an SPF30. Which means more protection against the sun.&lt;br /&gt;The woman that does my facials every 3 months highly recommended it and it is working!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for a few years and I love them. This cream is very silky and blends in very quickly.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 4 years.love it..only product with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face oily.</li>
            <li> A small amount and my face and neck are smooth and firm</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have tried other products from this line&lt;br /&gt;and have found them to be consistent and my skins responds&lt;br /&gt;nicely to them. Nice to find something that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Will be a repeat customer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer with some sun protection. Goes on a bit thick but penetrates well. SPF 30 works well on an average day but would not be my choice for a full day in the sun. For all-day exposure, I use an SPF 50+  full spectrum non-greasy sweat-resistant sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best products I have ever used. Found the line when on vacation and when I got home I ordered this product. Makes my face so soft . Love it</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry since I moved to CA, from FL.  I started using this product and has made a big difference on my face.  I can say you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica Age smart dynamic Skin recovery SPF for 10 years as a skin protection from the sun!  I use it in combination with the age smart rich moisturizing cream! I&#x27;m  65 and have dryer skin with some aging lines.  I like the way both creams work together to soften the lines and add moisture along with protecting my face from sun damage.</li>
            <li> So far so good, it burns sometimes though if it overlaps with other lotions.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005CRVWQM Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;This product was used on my face after a professional facial. I liked how my skin felt and purchased a starter size to put it to the test for a month. This lotion has SPF30 which is sufficient for my face. The lotion is light, non greasy. A little goes a long way. I cover my face, neck, top of ears with slightly less than a quarter size amount. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands with SPF and found most of them to be too thick and not easily absorbed into the skin. I have used this product over one month and find my skin to be soft and hydrated. Used in conjunction with the daily hydrofoliant I have seen a huge difference in my sometimes sensitive skin. Dead skin cells are a thing of the past! I am 61 and have been told I have pretty skin tone. I have always tried to take good care of my skin, but after moving to Central FL the sun, heat, and humidity plays havoc with my skin. I don&#x27;t like to wear make-up in the heat.  After using these products I experienced \\&quot;old skin\\&quot; sloughing off replaced with \\&quot;new\\&quot; skin that is soft and radiant. I have now purchased the entire Dermalogica Age Smart Skin line. Although somewhat expensive, this line is no more expensive than good skin products at a department store or spa. Plus, a little product goes a very long way and should last several months. If you can only afford a few products to get started with this product line, I highly recommend the skin resurfacing cleanser, the daily hydrofoliant, the antioxidant spray, and finish with the $35. Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry the line but will find the lowest price for each product in a list format when you do a search. Be watchful of the shipping charges though.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, most creams with SPF feel heavy and Dermalogica Age Smart Skin Recovery feels very refreshing, light and just right on my skin.</li>
            <li> as we age we all need a boost and this product delivers what it advertises. you do get more bang for your buck and with the bonus of glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this daily as we&#x27;re out in the sun a lot.  It&#x27;s non greasy, and unscented, goes on smoothly with no fuss.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter-in -law, she loves the product. I buy it every yr for her birthday.</li>
            <li> This product glides on the face so well, I use it under my makeup.  I usually have oily skin, but with this product, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as oily and my makeup goes over it very well.</li>
