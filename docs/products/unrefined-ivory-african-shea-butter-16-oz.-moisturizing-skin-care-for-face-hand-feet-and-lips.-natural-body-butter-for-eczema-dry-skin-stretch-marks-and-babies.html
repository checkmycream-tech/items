            <li>hoping to see more magic long-term effect.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the affected part felt softer to the touch many hours after application.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s skin rash and had the same excellent result.</li>
            <li>I am getting a second jar just for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to have found this product by Shea Scentsation, definitely a great and a must buy!</li>
            <li>Communication with the sellers has been delightful &amp; I look forward to buying more with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>In love.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I stopped using lotion just to use this product because I get a much better result from the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>My most favorite scent has to be Ylang-ylang.</li>
            <li>I love how it does not leave a greasy residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s AWESOME to purchase a product from someone who actually cares about their customers.</li>
            <li>I love the shea butters from Shea Scentsations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Shea Sensations almost since it came on the market and am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It has become both my husband and my favorite skin product.  </li>
            <li>very rich.</li>
            <li>It came at a perfect time because I had the most severe dry skin condition in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin felt good from the beginning, but I would say after 2-3 weeks, I really fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that has worked well and quickly on my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I found out and liked right away</li>
            <li>The grainy texture is easily abated by warming the product.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>The result is really smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This shea butter softens after the first use &amp; I love that it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes with so much educational information on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little greasey feeling at first than absorbs and your skin feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I was using regular lotion, but didn&#x27;t feel too good about using petroleum based products.</li>
            <li>The new jar arrived quickly and has a very nice, soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Sun-damaged skin, the result of playing outdoor tennis without adequate protection, was removed from my scalp by a dermatologist about two years ago.</li>
            <li>but it was the quick relief from my skin condition that won me over.</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and my skin was the driest it had ever been.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and will keep it and order more as soon as I get low on the product.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very natural &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to !</li>
            <li>Also lightly applied to my face and I can actually see fine lines gone!  </li>
            <li>I used to do this with a petroleum-based product, but wanted something more natural since this stuff gets absorbed into your body.</li>
            <li>I shared it with my younger sister, who really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the pure lemongrass essential oil, but if you want to use your own scents, then the plain version of Shea Scentsations is perfect.</li>
            <li>We have both the lemongrass and plain and they are both great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure that the general use on my skin will be beneficial, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for after I nick myself shaving, which I usually do around my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My body loves this pure shea butter!  </li>
            <li>It melts easily and becomes a clear yellowish liquid.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is fine so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a big jar, so I may use it for a whole year or more, it&#x27;s worthy.</li>
            <li>The next day (today), her face looked about 70% better.</li>
            <li>INSTANT GRATIFICATION : )  </li>
            <li>So I am using it plain and it does a really good job of softening my skin.</li>
            <li>While I personally was unable to smell the rose scent in this jar, the product itself is very nice.</li>
            <li>After several weeks I was pleased to see a gradual reduction in redness and the emergence of normal looking skin color.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at first, but it absorbs into the skin nicely after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Comes in a large container.</li>
            <li>I like that it is so pure - no additives, no waxy feel.  </li>
            <li>It has a different kind of smell to it, but the scent goes away not long after you apply it.</li>
            <li>I use it on face and hand, so moisturizing, and you don&#x27;t feel extra oily, just comfortable.</li>
            <li>but the cost has been prohibitive, this product is so reasonable &amp; has surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more Shea Butter in the near future.!</li>
            <li>Was kind of hard due to it is Jan. Place container in warm water for about 15 to 20 min.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Heals cracked skin and nice to use heat a small amount and use on hair</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more and looking forward to trying other varieties!  </li>
            <li>This product does have some odor although it&#x27;s not overpowering nor is it particularly offensive.  </li>
            <li>I add different essential oils to make everyone&#x27;s favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>It was inside a sandwich bag that was open and when I opened the box the jar was half in and half out to the bag with the top off it and the top was cracked!  </li>
            <li>First, I put the Shea butter on my skin for general use.</li>
            <li>My skin (especially the back of my hands) shows less age, is more elastic &amp; in general looks healthier with more luster &amp; sheen.</li>
            <li>Good results, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li>After having read some reviews of several other shea suppliers here on Amazon, I  noted that most complaints were about the odor.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fixed ASAP.!</li>
            <li>Other shea butters I have purchased smell the same, either more or less, but that familiar smell is there.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s completely gone by tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked for something natural and organic</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and it works great as far as keeping her skin from looking like she has a bad rash.</li>
            <li>I would be interested to hear from other users, or from the marketer of this product, regarding this assumption.&lt;br /&gt;ALG</li>
            <li>Arrived just as expected,  very high quality.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care for the natural shea smell, you can melt this product in a double boiler, let it COOL for 30 minutes, then add a few drops of a scented SKIN-FRIENDLY essential oil of your choice...</li>
            <li>Since I was unable to smell the rose scent, the owners replace the jar at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed thick, but quickly melts so that a little spreads all over.  </li>
            <li>I usually just stick it in the microwave for a few seconds and its usallly ok for use after that.</li>
            <li>I feel it so good on my skin in dry chilly weather.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of raw shea UNSCENTED from ANY supplier</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product that has worked well and quickly on my very dry skin.  I plan to continue using it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Yes, it has that &amp;#34;smoky&amp;#34; smell, but I&#x27;m used to it now. From what I understand, it is the result of how the shea butter is processed. Other shea butters I have purchased smell the same, either more or less, but that familiar smell is there. I have purchased both an unscented product and a scented product (ylang ylang). Very pleased with both. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at first, but it absorbs into the skin nicely after a few minutes. I typically rub down my feet after a shower and put my socks and shoes on for the day. My feet are no longer rough or cracked. I used to do this with a petroleum-based product, but wanted something more natural since this stuff gets absorbed into your body. For my hands, I&#x27;ll rub it into my skin and put my winter gloves on before leaving the house or I&#x27;ll use it before handwashing the dishes (I wear gloves). My elbows are no longer rough either. I use it on my face, as well. But, only at night. Love how my skin looks and feels in the morning. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> The shea butter product is very thick. I usually just stick it in the microwave for a few seconds and its usallly ok for use after that.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is fine so far. I love the smell and it feels great. It&#x27;s a little greasey feeling at first than absorbs and your skin feels wonderful.  I&#x27;m starting to itch now but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related yet to the butter.  My big disappoint was the delivery. It came in a box way too big for it with a small piece of bubble bag that wasn&#x27;t even on it.  here was a lot of space in the box for it to roll around.It was inside a sandwich bag that was open and when I opened the box the jar was half in and half out to the bag with the top off it and the top was cracked!  So for that it gets 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of raw shea UNSCENTED from ANY supplier so I can&#x27;t compare to any other product.  After having read some reviews of several other shea suppliers here on Amazon, I  noted that most complaints were about the odor.  This product does have some odor although it&#x27;s not overpowering nor is it particularly offensive.  It smells a bit like wood smoke...which is about as close of a description as I can give.  If you don&#x27;t care for the natural shea smell, you can melt this product in a double boiler, let it COOL for 30 minutes, then add a few drops of a scented SKIN-FRIENDLY essential oil of your choice...mix well, put it back in the jar and pop it in the frig for a couple hours to re-solidify.  Otherwise, buy this shea product already scented.  The grainy texture is easily abated by warming the product.  I&#x27;m making my own body lotion so melted it over a double boiler with other oils I&#x27;m using.  It melts easily and becomes a clear yellowish liquid.  It blends well with the other oils too.  Because I didn&#x27;t care for the odor of the plain oils, I added a few drops of a skin-friendly essential oil which worked very well.  I received the product from Amazon a bit earlier than the anticipated date.  It was packaged well.  Everything arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I am planning on making a body butter with this shea butter, coconut oil and essential oils but haven&#x27;t done it yet.  So I am using it plain and it does a really good job of softening my skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product. Excellent skin moisturizer. Heals cracked skin and nice to use heat a small amount and use on hair</li>
            <li> I use it on face and hand, so moisturizing, and you don&#x27;t feel extra oily, just comfortable. it&#x27;s a big jar, so I may use it for a whole year or more, it&#x27;s worthy. hoping to see more magic long-term effect.</li>
            <li> First, I put the Shea butter on my skin for general use. Good results, but nothing dramatic. Then, I put it on an itchy patch of skin that had been bothering and puzzling me for weeks. Amazingly, it cleared up in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week after that, a friend of mine had a very red eczema or dermatitis (I don&#x27;t know which) patch the size of a quarter on her cheek. She had tried coconut oil, to no effect, so I gave her some of my shea butter. The next day (today), her face looked about 70% better. I won&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s completely gone by tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that the general use on my skin will be beneficial, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure shea butter definitely has both therapeutic and cosmetic benefits. Buy some now. And, no, I don&#x27;t work for the company.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to with no harmful additives. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other moisturizer.  I feel it so good on my skin in dry chilly weather. It does its job on dry skin.</li>
            <li> While I personally was unable to smell the rose scent in this jar, the product itself is very nice. A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time. The shea butter leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. Since I was unable to smell the rose scent, the owners replace the jar at no cost to me. The new jar arrived quickly and has a very nice, soft scent.  I am very happy with the product.  I shared it with my younger sister, who really liked it.  The owners of the company are wonderful to work with and strive hard to make you happy.</li>
            <li> Sun-damaged skin, the result of playing outdoor tennis without adequate protection, was removed from my scalp by a dermatologist about two years ago. It never healed as expected, leaving an unsightly redness in the surgically repaired area. On a whim, since I was using Shea Butter on my dry hands, I tried it on my scalp. After several weeks I was pleased to see a gradual reduction in redness and the emergence of normal looking skin color. It appears that this Raw Shea Nut product from ScentSations, has an unanticipated anti-inflammatory action. I would be interested to hear from other users, or from the marketer of this product, regarding this assumption.&lt;br /&gt;ALG</li>
            <li> After having tried to no avail numerous moisturizers &amp; skin lubricants  for my severe dry skin condition a friend of mine suggested that I try Shea butter. It came at a perfect time because I had the most severe dry skin condition in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found out and liked right away was its Lavender scent but it was the quick relief from my skin condition that won me over. I&#x27;ve never had anything that gave a faster result and a longer lasting one at that. I also noticed that the affected part felt softer to the touch many hours after application. I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s skin rash and had the same excellent result. I am getting a second jar just for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to have found this product by Shea Scentsation, definitely a great and a must buy!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this amazing organic shea butter. This shea butter softens after the first use &amp; I love that it&#x27;s organic.  I have always loved products with shea butter but the cost has been prohibitive, this product is so reasonable &amp; has surpassed my expectations.  I wear sandals all year long &amp; this helps keep my feet \\&quot;sandal ready.\\&quot; I am also using this product to make lip balms, lip conditioners &amp; whipped body butters for my family.  I add different essential oils to make everyone&#x27;s favorite scent.  Communication with the sellers has been delightful &amp; I look forward to buying more with essential oils.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to ! Moisturizing my skin is no longer an issue, as well as worrying about all the chemicals in regular litions.</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and my skin was the driest it had ever been. I was using regular lotion, but didn&#x27;t feel too good about using petroleum based products. I looked for something natural and organic and I found this product. It has somewhat of a gritty texture, but it turns liquidy after rubbing it between my palms. It has a different kind of smell to it, but the scent goes away not long after you apply it. My skin felt good from the beginning, but I would say after 2-3 weeks, I really fell in love with the product. My skin looks and feels great and I like that it feels that way all day. I will definitely be ordering again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> Received item in 2 days. Comes in a large container. Was kind of hard due to it is Jan. Place container in warm water for about 15 to 20 min. Tried on clean face.....VOILA!!!!!! In love. Don&#x27;t think I have need for other skin products. INSTANT GRATIFICATION : )  you have to try..... for optimum body contentment. Will be ordering other fragrances</li>
            <li> Works great.  Arrived quickly.  Does everything the ad said it would.  Great moisturizer.  My skin was exceptionally dry from sun / wind in Florida.  It actually flaked.  Started rubbing this on my legs and feet each night and after only a couple days -- a world of difference.  Also lightly applied to my face and I can actually see fine lines gone!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and will keep it and order more as soon as I get low on the product.  Recommended it to my family.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  Arrived just as expected,  very high quality.  I love that it comes with so much educational information on how to use it.  Great company!!  Will be ordering more and looking forward to trying other varieties!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> very rich. I can use this product at night only.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face which is so dry!!!  Very nice product, good for cracked feet also. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Shea Butter. I stopped using lotion just to use this product because I get a much better result from the Shea Butter. My most favorite scent has to be Ylang-ylang. I love how it does not leave a greasy residue on my skin. I use it as a lip balm also. My daughter has eczema and it works great as far as keeping her skin from looking like she has a bad rash. I think that it&#x27;s AWESOME to purchase a product from someone who actually cares about their customers. If something is wrong they are on it and it&#x27;s fixed ASAP.! Keep up the good work. I will be purchasing more Shea Butter in the near future.! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT THERE IS MADE FOR YOUR SKIN.!</li>
            <li> I love the shea butters from Shea Scentsations. We have both the lemongrass and plain and they are both great. I really like the smell of the pure lemongrass essential oil, but if you want to use your own scents, then the plain version of Shea Scentsations is perfect. What I do is put a sufficient dab of it in the palm of one hand and rub my palms together until the butter melts--doesn&#x27;t take long. Then I put it on my arms and face and wherever else I feel like. The result is really smooth skin. It&#x27;s also great for after I nick myself shaving, which I usually do around my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Shea Sensations almost since it came on the market and am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My body loves this pure shea butter!  Shea scentsations is changing my skin - I get so many compliments on how smooth and healthy my skin has become! At first it seemed thick, but quickly melts so that a little spreads all over.  I like that it is so pure - no additives, no waxy feel.  It has become both my husband and my favorite skin product.  The dry skin on my shoulders and legs is no more!! You will love it too!!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream I have ever used. I found it excellent for all body parts including the face. My skin (especially the back of my hands) shows less age, is more elastic &amp; in general looks healthier with more luster &amp; sheen. The fragrance is very natural &amp; refreshing. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is good for dehydrated skin. Long time keeping moist. But scent is not good for me. I will try another scent next purchase.</li>
