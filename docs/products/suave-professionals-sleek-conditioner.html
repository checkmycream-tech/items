            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>He used to use bar soap but came across this shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice scented shampoo can tell its a mens shampoo, good amount for good price, probably going to last a while</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers nicely and keeps my and clean?</li>

            <li>If your looking for a great shampoo I would definitely recommend trying this one.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found it for such a good trade too.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair smell clean without an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>This shampoo provides a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair clean and fresh and I love that it contains no conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Packaged was received quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I would compare this to many professional products we have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>This cleans well and the price was right for the 6 bottles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does not overdry my husbands scalp and leaves my hair feeling smoothe with very few fly aways.</li>
            <li>So far, this one seems fine.</li>
            <li>I love using these, just wish amazon had a pack of the big ones for subscribe and save</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying Suave Shampoo</li>
            <li>Suave shampoo for men, funny concept.  </li>
            <li>Once I figure that out, I will be able to determine if its low price equals high value or not.</li>
            <li>has a clean smell that is appropriate for a high school boy, as opposed to the heavily scented ones like AXE.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com for coming to the rescue.</li>
            <li>Although the product says shampoo for men I purchased it for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It is light and not extremely masculine.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is Jolly Rancher scented.</li>
            <li>My fiance is very picky about using actual shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel any charge when using this, especially one from the ocean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it much cheaper than buying the single bottles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The real test is  - how long will it last.</li>
            <li>I have greasy thick hair, and this is pretty much the only thing I can find to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I dislike having to apply shampoo and conditioner separately.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and it doesn&#x27;t break this bank! It also makes my hair smell clean without an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Packaged was received quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> My hair is so fresh and clean since I started using shampoo, its amazing and I am so glad I found it for such a good trade too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to daily shampoo</li>
            <li> WHAT? OK.. it is just what you would expect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you LIKE this stuff! Then GREAT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my small town, I just can&#x27;t find it! Therefore, I order it on Amazon! Much better price!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be switching ever unless price goes up! I love using these, just wish amazon had a pack of the big ones for subscribe and save</li>
            <li> Nice scented shampoo can tell its a mens shampoo, good amount for good price, probably going to last a while</li>
            <li> Smells good, good lather and does the job...all i expect in a shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product off and on for years but it has been difficult to find locally. It really leaves my hair clean and fresh and I love that it contains no conditioners.  Thanks Amazon.com for coming to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Everything went as specified when the purchase was made.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, but I ordered it and didn&#x27;t realize it was not the 2 in1 I had been using. Order conditioner if you need it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a great price. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is not a mind blowing product, in my case I am the only guy in the house with four other females and I figured I should purchase my own shampoo. The product is good at a deal since it is better than not using any shampoo but once out of the shower the scent is gone and neither do I see or feel any prolong beneficial effect. Not great but okay.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price; what&#x27;s there not to love? Buy in bulk and save</li>
            <li> Great Packaging! Use this method all the time for all my deliveries! Don&#x27;t change a thing on this type of packaging.</li>
            <li> This cleans well and the price was right for the 6 bottles.  My husband likes it is made for guys.</li>
            <li> Although the product says shampoo for men I purchased it for the whole family. I bought the 6 pack so that we would have a few to stock the shelves! I was pleasantly suprised by the scent. It is light and not extremely masculine. My husband loves it and I do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not overdry my husbands scalp and leaves my hair feeling smoothe with very few fly aways. I would compare this to many professional products we have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the two in one, but I didn&#x27;t read carefully. This shampoo provides a clean scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. I would recommend getting the two in one, as this one may leave your hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Gave mine to a homeless shelter which they will love because its a good shampoo. Not the dollar store stuff they are use to.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo to use. It cleans great and rinses out well. I have greasy thick hair, and this is pretty much the only thing I can find to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of scents Amazon stocks. This particular scent is Jolly Rancher scented. I&#x27;m having trouble deciding which flavor, but I think the green one is very close to the smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nicely and keeps my and clean? I would recommend this product, although a bit more expensive online than buying at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Was searching for a replacement for my previous brands. So far, this one seems fine. The real test is  - how long will it last. Once I figure that out, I will be able to determine if its low price equals high value or not.</li>
            <li> My fiance is very picky about using actual shampoo. He used to use bar soap but came across this shampoo and love it. He has very fine, oily hair and it usually gets greasy by the end of the day. With using this shampoo this isn&#x27;t an issue. It smells great and works amazing for the price! We got subscribe and save it was an even better deal!</li>
            <li> I have a teenage son that must use half a bottle of shampoo at a time.  I usually buy these in a six pack from amazon since it&lt;br /&gt;it much cheaper than buying the single bottles.&lt;br /&gt;This has a clean smell that is appropriate for a high school boy, as opposed to the heavily scented ones like AXE.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Suave Shampoo and I love it. It leaves my hair soft and smelling great! If your looking for a great shampoo I would definitely recommend trying this one.</li>
            <li> Suave shampoo for men, funny concept.  I don&#x27;t usually conceive or consider that a shampoo could be &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  Maybe a bit of an overstatement but this shampoo has a great scent and is as excellent a shampoo as any I&#x27;ve used.  And, as always with Suave, it&#x27;s a great deal, especially buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel any charge when using this, especially one from the ocean.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell like anything to strong either.  The liquid is blue so that&#x27;s cool.</li>
