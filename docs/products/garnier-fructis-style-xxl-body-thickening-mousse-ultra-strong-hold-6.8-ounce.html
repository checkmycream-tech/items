            <li>This thickening mousse is awesome.  </li>

            <li>This stuff smells SO GOOD &amp; works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say goodbye to overpriced over hyped mousse.  </li>
            <li>Great styling</li>
            <li>But I saw the great price for this product and decided to try it out...</li>
            <li>this is the best product I&#x27;ve found and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair and gives me a fabulous blowout every time, best volume ever.</li>
            <li>but I personally love it!!</li>
            <li>It did, to be fair, make my hair look a bit fuller, but it just looked trashy.  </li>
            <li>that I loved.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to break the bank to look really good.</li>
            <li>so good luck</li>
            <li>This mousse is a good mousse</li>
            <li>With a good cut and Fructis products my hair is looking good again.</li>
            <li>For best results I apply it right when I turn off the shower</li>
            <li>It works better than any mousse I have ever had!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mousse ever!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask much more of that!</li>
            <li>Body this product adds is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much because I&#x27;ve been using Tigi Bed Head products and thought they were the best.  </li>
            <li>The best I have found and the most economical too.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother, and she ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>I got this because it was cheap and had good reviews, and so I put it in my hair while it was damp before putting in curlformers.</li>
            <li>I see the price has more than doubled since my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mousses and have never encountered one as ineffective as this one.  </li>
            <li>We tend to think more is better, but that&#x27;s not always the case.  </li>
            <li>I love this mousse and can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>Time for her to enjoy it too!</li>
            <li>I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is more crunchy then what I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this Mousse and it works like product states.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over six months now and continue to love it.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I love this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>You can still see some of my scalp under my fine, thinning hair, but it is better than it was before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my kid very happy - and price-wise is cheaper than most other options I viewed online.</li>
            <li>This is the best product than any other thickners.</li>
            <li>Try it if you have fine, thinning hair and you will see improvement.</li>
            <li>the years my hair has gotten thinner and since it has always been fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth more than $3.</li>
            <li>I applied 2 \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; of the mousse, making sure to get the roots pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this mousse a try since it was on sale, and had overall good experiences with Garnier products.  </li>
            <li>Good overall experience</li>
            <li>It smells fresh too i like it.</li>
            <li>So i dont use too much and it works best when you blow dry your hair upside down and start to add it in at the roots your hair gets more volume.</li>
            <li>Finally found Revlon ColorSilk dyes which don&#x27;t damage my hair then went on a search for mousse and hairspray that won&#x27;t break my fragile locks and give me great body and movement.</li>
            <li>Just you&#x27;re basic hair mousse with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>(left it wrapped up until most moisture was wicked away by the towel).  </li>
            <li>I use only Garnier Fructis products on my hair and I love the results.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and natural with more body/volume.  </li>
            <li>If you need some on your ends because you are doing well defined curls mix it with an oil/silicon serum first in your hands then lightly put into ends such as Garnier Anti-Frizz Serum...</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>Appreciated as a gift together with Garnier Fructis Anti-Humidity Hairspray</li>
            <li>If you tried to put all 2-3 in all at once you will get to much buildup in one area as mousse isn&#x27;t really spreadable once it hits your hair.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this makes sense or not, but I don&#x27;t really care for this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews and have to say, if this product isn&#x27;t working for you or is making your hair look oily or brittle, you&#x27;re probably using too much, which is easy to do.  </li>
            <li>But my hair look incredible, and I&#x27;m my own worst critic when it comes to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s thickening mousse was rated highly by Allure magazine and is my go-to mousse.  </li>
            <li>It had enough volume that I was able to use my flat iron on it (but not the roots!)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s just damp, and I reapply a little bit more...</li>
            <li>My hair looks better than with the other product!!</li>
            <li>I naturally have super thick hair and loose curls, which I think is why this mousse works so good on my hair</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t super big volume, but even fine hair is going to weigh itself down at the roots..</li>
            <li>It may not work good on thin and clear hair!</li>
            <li>did nothing for my fine hair but weigh it down and leave a film on it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past.</li>
            <li>and wow.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally blond hair that I dye medium brown.</li>
            <li>Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter.</li>
            <li>Many styling products such as this are gummy in my funky hair, but this is not  as long as I don&#x27;t go overboard with the product.</li>
            <li>so I have tried everything Paul Mitchell, Biolage, Keratase, Sebastian, Redkin, and lower end brands such as Tresemme, Pantene Triple Action Volume Mousse, etc....</li>
            <li>I was kinda afraid at the beginning because I&#x27;m not used to mousses and normally I use big sexy hair powder!</li>

            <li> unless you are planning on doing some dramatic curls with an iron then you can lightly work through to almost the ends.</li>
            <li> this Garnier product beats everything hands down so far.</li>
            <li> This is a strange product.</li>
            <li> I let my hair towel dry itself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fully dry</li>
            <li> Such an affordable product, and she previously used mousse that cost $20.</li>
            <li> Basically, I was wanting to actually start curling my hair and start being non-lazy, but my hair is always super limp and lame.</li>
            <li> and my hair is dripping wet, then I just leave my hair in a towel for 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> Then I flipped all my hair forward and down.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a hair growth formula that weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It has slight damage on the ends as it is about down to my shoulder blades</li>
            <li> If I use it when it&#x27;s humid, it&#x27;s kinda gooey, if I use it on a less humid day, it not as gooey.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue to order due to price.</li>
            <li> it adds volume, but sometimes a little build up:</li>
            <li> ( But it does add crazy volume but if you use too much sometiems your hair gets a greasy look.</li>
            <li> I am not one to review products, but felt compelled to share my experience with this one, only because I&#x27;ve never used a mousse that made my hair look worse than it did when pre-product.  </li>
            <li> I like moveable, styled, hold.. not the freeze dried look and</li>
            <li> Thankfully  I have found that using this body thickening mousse it doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair and leave it limp.</li>
            <li> I used the recommended amount, and felt like my hair looked sticky and stiff after drying.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I can&#x27;t vouch for what it will do for straight, thin hair...</li>
            <li> It also made my hair look unusually dry and unhealthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Usually depending on the style I&#x27;m going for 4 golf balls one at a time to roots is the max and 2 golf balls for lighter/regular days.</li>
            <li> so when that happens I always turn to Ebay and can usually find it.</li>
            <li> If you have dark and thick hair go for it!</li>
            <li> this will keep your ends from looking dull with mousse.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair upside down on med heat, then finished it off with the cold shot for a couple of minutes to help it set.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> No more thin looking hair!  </li>
            <li> and I was using the wrong hair dye before (l&#x27;oreal preference).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Garnier is no longer making it,</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair dirty.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was going to have bald spots in my part line..</li>
            <li> BAD!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>

            <li> This mousse is great! I was kinda afraid at the beginning because I&#x27;m not used to mousses and normally I use big sexy hair powder! But it does works awesome! A lot of volume and body to the hair! It may not work good on thin and clear hair! But on mine does! If you have dark and thick hair go for it!</li>
            <li> When I purchased from Amazon during September 2013, this product was $1.29 via Amazon Prime so I gave it a try. I like the fruity apple scent. Also, I did not notice any thickening effects. Just you&#x27;re basic hair mousse with a lovely scent. I see the price has more than doubled since my purchase. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth more than $3.</li>
            <li> I am not one to review products, but felt compelled to share my experience with this one, only because I&#x27;ve never used a mousse that made my hair look worse than it did when pre-product.  I decided to give this mousse a try since it was on sale, and had overall good experiences with Garnier products.  I used the recommended amount, and felt like my hair looked sticky and stiff after drying.  It also made my hair look unusually dry and unhealthy looking.  I&#x27;ve tried many mousses and have never encountered one as ineffective as this one.  It did, to be fair, make my hair look a bit fuller, but it just looked trashy.  Save your money.  Pantene&#x27;s thickening mousse was rated highly by Allure magazine and is my go-to mousse.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with it from now on.</li>
            <li> I was using a mousse that retails for $35. that I loved. I bought this one on a whim just to see what results I&#x27;d get. I was shocked! My hair looks better than with the other product!! This gives the hair a thicker look and lots of volume that lasts all day. No more thin looking hair!  I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> Great product! It works better than any mousse I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Appreciated as a gift together with Garnier Fructis Anti-Humidity Hairspray</li>
            <li> Basically, I was wanting to actually start curling my hair and start being non-lazy, but my hair is always super limp and lame. I got this because it was cheap and had good reviews, and so I put it in my hair while it was damp before putting in curlformers. The results were quite good! Actual volume happened. 10/10 will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good overall experience</li>
            <li> I got this because of the reviews on here.  I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much because I&#x27;ve been using Tigi Bed Head products and thought they were the best.  Not when it comes to mousse though.  I have fine,long hair, all one length.  I thought for the price of the Garnier XXL Body mousse I had nothing to lose to give it a try.  I let my hair towel dry itself (left it wrapped up until most moisture was wicked away by the towel).  Then I flipped all my hair forward and down.  I applied 2 \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; of the mousse, making sure to get the roots pretty well.  I blow dried my hair upside down on med heat, then finished it off with the cold shot for a couple of minutes to help it set.  I flipped my hair back and wow.  It wasn&#x27;t super big volume, but even fine hair is going to weigh itself down at the roots.. But my hair look incredible, and I&#x27;m my own worst critic when it comes to my hair.  It had enough volume that I was able to use my flat iron on it (but not the roots!) and I still had volume, and even a bit of a healthier sheen to my hair.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews and have to say, if this product isn&#x27;t working for you or is making your hair look oily or brittle, you&#x27;re probably using too much, which is easy to do.  We tend to think more is better, but that&#x27;s not always the case.  I&#x27;m happy to say goodbye to overpriced over hyped mousse.  This is now a permanent part of my &#x27;hair fixin&#x27; routine.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made it!</li>
            <li> Works well with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Many styling products such as this are gummy in my funky hair, but this is not  as long as I don&#x27;t go overboard with the product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blond hair that I dye medium brown. It has slight damage on the ends as it is about down to my shoulder blades and I was using the wrong hair dye before (l&#x27;oreal preference). Finally found Revlon ColorSilk dyes which don&#x27;t damage my hair then went on a search for mousse and hairspray that won&#x27;t break my fragile locks and give me great body and movement. I like moveable, styled, hold.. not the freeze dried look and Garniers Style XXXL Body Thickening Mousse used with the Anti-Humidity Flexible Control Hairspray is the perfect styling product combo for me. I haven&#x27;t had problems with residue, dullness, etc...but the key to any styling product is not to over do it especially when it comes to Mousse and Hairspray. Mousse should always be roots and crown only! unless you are planning on doing some dramatic curls with an iron then you can lightly work through to almost the ends. I put a golf ball sized amount worked into my hair line area than another golf ball into the back then another around the middle. Usually depending on the style I&#x27;m going for 4 golf balls one at a time to roots is the max and 2 golf balls for lighter/regular days. If you tried to put all 2-3 in all at once you will get to much buildup in one area as mousse isn&#x27;t really spreadable once it hits your hair. If you need some on your ends because you are doing well defined curls mix it with an oil/silicon serum first in your hands then lightly put into ends such as Garnier Anti-Frizz Serum...this will keep your ends from looking dull with mousse. I hope this helps you...this is the best product I&#x27;ve found and it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair and gives me a fabulous blowout every time, best volume ever. I am a product junkie so I have tried everything Paul Mitchell, Biolage, Keratase, Sebastian, Redkin, and lower end brands such as Tresemme, Pantene Triple Action Volume Mousse, etc....this Garnier product beats everything hands down so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff burns my scalp... BAD! I wish I would have never bought it... I am still hoping to find someone to give it away to that I don&#x27;t like so they can feel the BURN too.</li>
            <li> I love this mousse and can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores any more. Not sure if I will continue to order due to price. The same product was about $4.50 in stores. I plan to try another voluminzing mousse by the same brand. Everything that works seems to get discontinued.</li>
            <li> Great styling aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my kid very happy - and price-wise is cheaper than most other options I viewed online.</li>
            <li> Body this product adds is amazing.  I use only Garnier Fructis products on my hair and I love the results. The best I have found and the most economical too. You don&#x27;t have to break the bank to look really good.</li>
            <li> This thickening mousse is awesome.  I&#x27;ve never used any type of mousse product before, I always stick with sprays.  But I saw the great price for this product and decided to try it out... I love it!  I naturally have super thick hair and loose curls, which I think is why this mousse works so good on my hair haha.  For best results I apply it right when I turn off the shower and my hair is dripping wet, then I just leave my hair in a towel for 10-15 minutes so it&#x27;s just damp, and I reapply a little bit more...so by the time it&#x27;s fully dry there&#x27;s voluminous curls everywhereee!  I definitely recommend this product, especially if you have hair like mine.  Sorry I can&#x27;t vouch for what it will do for straight, thin hair...but I personally love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this body thickening mousse 3 times.  It makes my hair very soft and natural with more body/volume.  It doesn&#x27;t feel or look  like I put anything on my hair. You can still see some of my scalp under my fine, thinning hair, but it is better than it was before. I had been using a hair growth formula that weigh down my hair.  Yes, I would recommend this product.  Try it if you have fine, thinning hair and you will see improvement.</li>
            <li> did nothing for my fine hair but weigh it down and leave a film on it. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past. Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter. Time for her to enjoy it too! This stuff smells SO GOOD &amp; works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I want to give a star review I just dont want to write alot  if I give it a 5 star review that means I love it and would recommend it. thank you</li>
            <li> Not the best mousse.. It is more crunchy then what I had hoped. Scrunch serums are supposed to be crunchy but mousse isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it looks like the company has discontinued it so when that happens I always turn to Ebay and can usually find it. I love this product and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mousse ever! I love this stuff. Unfortunately, Garnier is no longer making it, so good luck finding it anywhere.</li>
            <li> This mousse is a good mousse it adds volume, but sometimes a little build up:( But it does add crazy volume but if you use too much sometiems your hair gets a greasy look. So i dont use too much and it works best when you blow dry your hair upside down and start to add it in at the roots your hair gets more volume. It smells fresh too i like it.</li>
            <li> This is a strange product. Seriously. It tends to work differently depending on the weather.  If I use it when it&#x27;s humid, it&#x27;s kinda gooey, if I use it on a less humid day, it not as gooey.  I don&#x27;t know if this makes sense or not, but I don&#x27;t really care for this product.  I don&#x27;t like to be at the mercy of the elements for a hair product to work for me or not work for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother, and she ended up loving it. Such an affordable product, and she previously used mousse that cost $20. Now she is switching to this product! What a steal!</li>
            <li> I love this Mousse and it works like product states. Can&#x27;t ask much more of that!</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair dirty.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over six months now and continue to love it.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my hair has gotten thinner and since it has always been fine I was afraid I was going to have bald spots in my part line.. Thankfully  I have found that using this body thickening mousse it doesn&#x27;t gum up my hair and leave it limp. The style lasts all day and still has body the next morning. With a good cut and Fructis products my hair is looking good again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product than any other thickners.</li>
