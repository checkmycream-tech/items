            <li>--it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS BEAUTIFUL.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used on hands and feet with great results.    </li>
            <li>I got this because I had read great reviews on acne message boards and beauty message boards about this product.  </li>
            <li>The price is great for the amount that you get.  </li>
            <li>I suggest that you use either the lotion counterpart to this great cream or go to another lighter-base face cream.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention, this lotion is great under my makeup ...</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>My skin is happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for winter weather.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great</li>
            <li>it is great.  </li>
            <li>It works great for him</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>No process or product works for everyone, but I offer this up as a good solution for great skin.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon and I am a very good customer!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that the jar says that it is \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; and has the Good Housekeeping Seal.</li>
            <li>We loved Cetpahil up until now.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a good</li>
            <li>Those are the best places to get advice on what product to try because it&#x27;s been tried and true.  </li>
            <li>It also does an excellent job of retaining moisture, but that is true of every lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be safe!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>This really is the best moisturizer you can buy.</li>
            <li>Superior to most body creams.</li>
            <li>(Eucerin is nice, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the Lanolin in their product)</li>
            <li>liquid foundation glides over the cream so nicely that my skin looks prettier than ever.</li>
            <li>as sometime I get itchy face after a warm shower.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil lotion is lighter and is the perfect hydrating lotion for my face year round, but the cream in the jar is perfect for my hands, nails and cuticles, even feet.</li>
            <li>Every one should have this product no matter what kind of skin you have</li>
            <li>when you apply a lot of cream with or without makeup, you do end up looking and feeling quite greasy, but i think that comes with any kind of cream.</li>
            <li>Next morning, I am always impressed at how good my hands look.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>honestly i can&#x27;t remember my skin feeling so healthy.</li>
            <li>These products make my skin look great, so I rarely need make-up.  </li>
            <li>Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li>To learn more, you can try looking up my review of Theraplex emollient.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers raved about the cetaphil cream and how it can be used for everything.</li>
            <li>Maybe better.</li>
            <li>Simply the best there is.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize after you use astringent on your face.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, be sure to moisturize the skin under your eyes, around your eyes and around your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream -</li>
            <li>(well, it IS cheap, for its size!)</li>
            <li>In fact, I love the feeling of spreading this soft-buttery cream all over my face twice a day - it feels like I&#x27;m spoiling myself,</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have anything more to say, except don&#x27;t play basketball with anyone who works for the NSA.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it after applying</li>
            <li>Love love.</li>
            <li>I love Cetaphil cos</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>I use more in the winter (Chicago) and I literally slather it on.</li>
            <li>Love my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I always use this product, works wonders!  :)</li>
            <li>- I actually love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>It is not thick or greasy and looks great under mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I normally use the body shop&#x27;s body butter, which is GREAT, but I wanted to switch to a low-budget option.</li>
            <li>Surprised, I started investigating and found some not so great information about Aquaphor.    </li>
            <li>After our toddler was diagnosed with Eczema, we found that Aquaphor was either not doing much good or was really being downright harmful.</li>
            <li>It was a relief: for the first time in many years I could wash my hands without hurting them!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
            <li>Very good for people with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>very good cream for people who suffer from dry skin, they recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many nail and cuticle creams, oils, lotions and whatever that make bold claims as to their ability to perform miracles on your cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews about this cream I decided to try it, and it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>This tub is huge</li>
            <li>Sounds great... if it only wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
            <li>Since they start using the Cetaphil Cream, the skin was from cracking to smooth.  </li>
            <li>It feels cheap and synthetic, and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic products.</li>
            <li>Got this for an elderly friend and she loves it, goes on smooth and disappears at once</li>
            <li>These products are fragrance free and dermatologist recommended.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is.  </li>
            <li>and during the day i go really light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t break me out and helps with winter itching.</li>
            <li>It felt good every time I put it on, but it took 2 days to completely heal my hands.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>One swipe of the hand is good enough to moisturize your face.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I have started using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion too - and it is another case of product love.</li>
            <li>when actually, I&#x27;m giving myself good skin.</li>
            <li>I think it has to do with Macadamia Nut Oil (non-allergen to him) vs Sweet Almond Oil (allergen to him).</li>
            <li>This lotion is not as greasy as Eucerin, which is very greasy (but also is the most moisturizing).</li>
            <li>But if you truly want a non-greasy feeling lotion, you are better off buying a higher quality lotion albeit at a higher price.</li>
            <li>I believe all the scrubbing and super cleansing of skin (as touted by the media) contributes to acne, wrinkles, rashes, etc.</li>
            <li>NOT OILY OR GREASY AND REALLY LOCKS IN MOISTURE!!</li>
            <li>but this time after first time using this product it compels me to write this review!</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and the product is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of gardening and landscaping, sometimes forgetting to wear gloves, so I continue using the cream in the jar even in summer to quickly calm, hydrate and heal my hands.  </li>
            <li>It really is fragrance free, not just in terms of perfumes, but it doesn&#x27;t smell chemical-y either, which was a relief to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews online</li>
            <li>Particularly on my face, it&#x27;s great, a must, for dry skin</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t worth it-premium product or not.  .</li>
            <li>Not only does it do its job in moisturizing my face, but it&#x27;s a huge jar!  </li>
            <li>Even when I was in Brazil, and the price was more than double the cost in US$, I bought it</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on I thought this could work.</li>
            <li>If I could rate it even higher, I would.</li>
            <li>First, after seeing a doctor with my ichy skin, she suggested that I try this brand and as it turned out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products including Gold Bond</li>
            <li>but nothing really help except this one!</li>
            <li>and now I have much better sleep at night and still see that my skin is moist after next day.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and Cetaphil facial moisturizing cream are awesome.  </li>
            <li>FROM THE VERY 1st application, my son&#x27;s skin appeared hydrated, moisturized, and plump!</li>
            <li>THANKS CETAPHIL!</li>
            <li>This worked better than several national brands I tried before.</li>
            <li>I have found several lotions from Shiseido and Amore Pacific to be very non-greasy but they also cost about 3-5 times more than this lotion (based on volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fragrance free and gets rid of dry skin so quick.</li>
            <li>This is the large jar of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>Overall a tremendous product that works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate to have good genetics, but when combined with Olay Regenerist Serum (or the less expensive Equate/CVS alternatives) and Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, I can honestly say I look closer to 25</li>
            <li>My husbands doctor recommended it for his dry skin due to diabetes and it works great.  </li>
            <li>My spouse had huge problems with eczema on his legs and feet...until he started using this terrific cream.  </li>
            <li>If you do have any form of eczema, it is important to get your cream or lotion on within 3 minutes of getting out of the tub or shower - so that you trap as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>I noticed how my leather arm chair was really shiny every time I put some on my arm.</li>
            <li>This stuff really gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>I was very desvatated about their skin problem.  </li>
            <li>My face was really flakey and peeling off, it looked like dandruff spilled on my face.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need too much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>(really!..almost, practically) and gentle.</li>
            <li>It becomes very liquidy and feels like silk</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>If you order this - make sure you do so with other products so that the shipping charge is spread out over 4 or 5 items - and doesn&#x27;t make it seem you are paying as much to buy it ($10 per jar) as you are to ship it otherwise</li>
            <li>In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl&#x27;s skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard plenty of good things about Cetaphil, but didn&#x27;t think that my skin necessarily counted as &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;dry&#x27;</li>
            <li>I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
            <li>It does NOT cause me any acne breakouts at all - and I am very prone to acne if I do not follow a careful routine of cleansing, applying Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (AHA), and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is well tolerated, not greasy at all.. highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all types of skin</li>
            <li>*is* creamy and heavy, but on the skin, it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
            <li>Ive tried almost everything with varying results, from Proactive to expensive products, and havent been as happy with them as I am with the Cetaphil line of products.</li>
            <li>is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such soft, smooth, clear skin before in my life.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly before bedtime when I lather it on my hands and work it in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>- I would say it&#x27;s normal?</li>
            <li>so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion.</li>
            <li>One last beauty tip (and this might seem odd) but this cream makes a great leave-in hair conditioner for my extremely long auburn hair that has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>B00113HNB4 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic (20 Oz)]]</li>
            <li>These products have really improved the condition of my skin in that my skin is much softer and is NOT dry.  </li>
            <li>I went home and ordered it right away, because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the physical stores I checked.</li>
            <li>The price is high compared to average moisturizers but with how long the a single tub lasts it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I already know how effective this product is for treating dry skin that due to whether or heat.</li>
            <li>the genuine Cetaphil has a creamier texture and goes on feeling less greasy along with having a cleaner scent and IMHO</li>
            <li>lotion is also a decent value considering this is a 16 ounce size jar which is about 80% volume of a full roll of toilet paper (the jar is a circular shape as a toilet paper</li>
            <li>I do not use it as much anymore since it cured my dry skin, if you have eczema, this really helps.</li>
            <li>I have two daughters who are 3 and 1/2 years old and 2 years old now.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of cream and lotion (both for baby and adult) and NONE works.  </li>
            <li>This product completely removed all traces of redness, heat, rash, or itchyness that I used to feel after every shower on my face, chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li>No frizz - no greasy-look, not too soft to hold a curl, but looks soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>my entire life and didnt really want to use this product.</li>
            <li>And now that my 3 month old son has it too..</li>
            <li>I needed help with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and people say I look 40.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn&#x27;t work out...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I tried Vaseline CoCoa Butter Deep Conditioning Body Lotion, Nivea Essentially Rich Body Lotion, Dermasil Dry Skin Treatment, Aquaphor, and NONE OF THEM WORKED!  </li>
            <li>As an over-40 female with acne-prone, sensitive skin, almost everything irritated my skin and caused breakouts, redness, and irritation (particularly on the eyelids).</li>
            <li>We first apply Cetaphil cream, wait for it to be absorbed and then apply a film of Theraplex emollient (the one that is thick and waxy and comes in a tub).</li>
            <li>#34;mom, I like the other moisturizer that we were using better.&amp;#34; So, I made a special trip down the street to Walgreens and re-purchased the CETAPHIL gentle cleansing soap as well as the Moisturizing Cream all for $18!</li>
            <li>But overall, I found it far far far too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Last month, June 2014, I decided to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this cream after using Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser dry.</li>
            <li>A little spendy but worth the price.</li>
            <li>You would think I would learn and put it on religiously, but I forget,because I am so busy.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old finally said, &amp;</li>
            <li>Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel.</li>
            <li>My husband is recently recovering from a severe leg injury and this is the ONLY handcream that can cope with the injured skin around his skin graft and old wound sites.  </li>
            <li>Now I can wash my hands without pain, I am not ashamed to display my hands anymore, and during the Winter my body skin is not dry.  </li>
            <li>and you may think it will never dry, but it does, and it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li>In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
            <li>In the end, I went with Cetaphil because it was the best deal price-wise, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!</li>
            <li>I  took used cetaphil for the heck of it since no other moisturizer didn&#x27;t really work and after a little over a week I saw a drastic change in my face.</li>
            <li>I live in in Albuquerque,but before this winter, my hands were never this dry, but this January Before ordering this cream my hands and fingers were literally splitting open and bleeding.</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of lotion including all the ones that say for extremely dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil cream is a long lasting, deeply moisturizing product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been having dry, irritating, itchy skin on my face for most of the summer.</li>
            <li>My 1 year old son&#x27;s cheeks were very dry</li>
            <li>I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>

            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream!</li>
            <li> Basically, it is as wonderful as everyone says it is!</li>

            <li> The price is great for the amount that you get.  </li>
            <li> I suggest that you use either the lotion counterpart to this great cream or go to another lighter-base face cream.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention, this lotion is great under my makeup ...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for winter weather.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> it is great.  </li>
            <li> It works great for him</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> No process or product works for everyone, but I offer this up as a good solution for great skin.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon and I am a very good customer!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that the jar says that it is \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; and has the Good Housekeeping Seal.</li>
            <li> We loved Cetpahil up until now.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a good</li>
            <li> Those are the best places to get advice on what product to try because it&#x27;s been tried and true.  </li>
            <li> It also does an excellent job of retaining moisture, but that is true of every lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be safe!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> This really is the best moisturizer you can buy.</li>
            <li> Superior to most body creams.</li>
            <li> (Eucerin is nice, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the Lanolin in their product)</li>
            <li> liquid foundation glides over the cream so nicely that my skin looks prettier than ever.</li>
            <li> as sometime I get itchy face after a warm shower.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil lotion is lighter and is the perfect hydrating lotion for my face year round, but the cream in the jar is perfect for my hands, nails and cuticles, even feet.</li>
            <li> Every one should have this product no matter what kind of skin you have</li>
            <li> when you apply a lot of cream with or without makeup, you do end up looking and feeling quite greasy, but i think that comes with any kind of cream.</li>
            <li> Next morning, I am always impressed at how good my hands look.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> honestly i can&#x27;t remember my skin feeling so healthy.</li>
            <li> These products make my skin look great, so I rarely need make-up.  </li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> To learn more, you can try looking up my review of Theraplex emollient.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers raved about the cetaphil cream and how it can be used for everything.</li>
            <li> Maybe better.</li>
            <li> Simply the best there is.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize after you use astringent on your face.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, be sure to moisturize the skin under your eyes, around your eyes and around your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream -</li>
            <li> (well, it IS cheap, for its size!)</li>
            <li> In fact, I love the feeling of spreading this soft-buttery cream all over my face twice a day - it feels like I&#x27;m spoiling myself,</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have anything more to say, except don&#x27;t play basketball with anyone who works for the NSA.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it after applying</li>
            <li> Love love.</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil cos</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> I use more in the winter (Chicago) and I literally slather it on.</li>
            <li> Love my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I always use this product, works wonders!  :)</li>
            <li> - I actually love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> It is not thick or greasy and looks great under mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I normally use the body shop&#x27;s body butter, which is GREAT, but I wanted to switch to a low-budget option.</li>
            <li> Surprised, I started investigating and found some not so great information about Aquaphor.    </li>
            <li> After our toddler was diagnosed with Eczema, we found that Aquaphor was either not doing much good or was really being downright harmful.</li>
            <li> It was a relief: for the first time in many years I could wash my hands without hurting them!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
            <li> Very good for people with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> very good cream for people who suffer from dry skin, they recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many nail and cuticle creams, oils, lotions and whatever that make bold claims as to their ability to perform miracles on your cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews about this cream I decided to try it, and it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> This tub is huge</li>
            <li> Sounds great... if it only wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
            <li> Since they start using the Cetaphil Cream, the skin was from cracking to smooth.  </li>
            <li> It feels cheap and synthetic, and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products.</li>
            <li> Got this for an elderly friend and she loves it, goes on smooth and disappears at once</li>
            <li> These products are fragrance free and dermatologist recommended.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is.  </li>
            <li> and during the day i go really light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t break me out and helps with winter itching.</li>
            <li> It felt good every time I put it on, but it took 2 days to completely heal my hands.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> One swipe of the hand is good enough to moisturize your face.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I have started using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion too - and it is another case of product love.</li>
            <li> when actually, I&#x27;m giving myself good skin.</li>
            <li> I think it has to do with Macadamia Nut Oil (non-allergen to him) vs Sweet Almond Oil (allergen to him).</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as greasy as Eucerin, which is very greasy (but also is the most moisturizing).</li>
            <li> But if you truly want a non-greasy feeling lotion, you are better off buying a higher quality lotion albeit at a higher price.</li>
            <li> I believe all the scrubbing and super cleansing of skin (as touted by the media) contributes to acne, wrinkles, rashes, etc.</li>
            <li> NOT OILY OR GREASY AND REALLY LOCKS IN MOISTURE!!</li>
            <li> but this time after first time using this product it compels me to write this review!</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and the product is great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of gardening and landscaping, sometimes forgetting to wear gloves, so I continue using the cream in the jar even in summer to quickly calm, hydrate and heal my hands.  </li>
            <li> It really is fragrance free, not just in terms of perfumes, but it doesn&#x27;t smell chemical-y either, which was a relief to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews online</li>
            <li> Particularly on my face, it&#x27;s great, a must, for dry skin</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t worth it-premium product or not.  .</li>
            <li> Not only does it do its job in moisturizing my face, but it&#x27;s a huge jar!  </li>
            <li> Even when I was in Brazil, and the price was more than double the cost in US$, I bought it</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on I thought this could work.</li>
            <li> If I could rate it even higher, I would.</li>
            <li> First, after seeing a doctor with my ichy skin, she suggested that I try this brand and as it turned out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products including Gold Bond</li>
            <li> but nothing really help except this one!</li>
            <li> and now I have much better sleep at night and still see that my skin is moist after next day.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and Cetaphil facial moisturizing cream are awesome.  </li>
            <li> FROM THE VERY 1st application, my son&#x27;s skin appeared hydrated, moisturized, and plump!</li>
            <li> THANKS CETAPHIL!</li>
            <li> This worked better than several national brands I tried before.</li>
            <li> I have found several lotions from Shiseido and Amore Pacific to be very non-greasy but they also cost about 3-5 times more than this lotion (based on volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fragrance free and gets rid of dry skin so quick.</li>
            <li> This is the large jar of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Overall a tremendous product that works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to have good genetics, but when combined with Olay Regenerist Serum (or the less expensive Equate/CVS alternatives) and Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, I can honestly say I look closer to 25</li>
            <li> My husbands doctor recommended it for his dry skin due to diabetes and it works great.  </li>
            <li> My spouse had huge problems with eczema on his legs and feet...until he started using this terrific cream.  </li>
            <li> If you do have any form of eczema, it is important to get your cream or lotion on within 3 minutes of getting out of the tub or shower - so that you trap as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li> I noticed how my leather arm chair was really shiny every time I put some on my arm.</li>
            <li> This stuff really gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was very desvatated about their skin problem.  </li>
            <li> My face was really flakey and peeling off, it looked like dandruff spilled on my face.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need too much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> (really!..almost, practically) and gentle.</li>
            <li> It becomes very liquidy and feels like silk</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> If you order this - make sure you do so with other products so that the shipping charge is spread out over 4 or 5 items - and doesn&#x27;t make it seem you are paying as much to buy it ($10 per jar) as you are to ship it otherwise</li>
            <li> In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl&#x27;s skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard plenty of good things about Cetaphil, but didn&#x27;t think that my skin necessarily counted as &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;dry&#x27;</li>
            <li> I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno</li>
            <li> It does NOT cause me any acne breakouts at all - and I am very prone to acne if I do not follow a careful routine of cleansing, applying Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (AHA), and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is well tolerated, not greasy at all.. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all types of skin</li>
            <li> *is* creamy and heavy, but on the skin, it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry.</li>
            <li> Ive tried almost everything with varying results, from Proactive to expensive products, and havent been as happy with them as I am with the Cetaphil line of products.</li>
            <li> is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such soft, smooth, clear skin before in my life.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly before bedtime when I lather it on my hands and work it in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> - I would say it&#x27;s normal?</li>
            <li> so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion.</li>
            <li> One last beauty tip (and this might seem odd) but this cream makes a great leave-in hair conditioner for my extremely long auburn hair that has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li> B00113HNB4 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic (20 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> These products have really improved the condition of my skin in that my skin is much softer and is NOT dry.  </li>
            <li> I went home and ordered it right away, because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the physical stores I checked.</li>
            <li> The price is high compared to average moisturizers but with how long the a single tub lasts it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I already know how effective this product is for treating dry skin that due to whether or heat.</li>
            <li> the genuine Cetaphil has a creamier texture and goes on feeling less greasy along with having a cleaner scent and IMHO</li>
            <li> lotion is also a decent value considering this is a 16 ounce size jar which is about 80% volume of a full roll of toilet paper (the jar is a circular shape as a toilet paper</li>
            <li> I do not use it as much anymore since it cured my dry skin, if you have eczema, this really helps.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who are 3 and 1/2 years old and 2 years old now.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of cream and lotion (both for baby and adult) and NONE works.  </li>
            <li> This product completely removed all traces of redness, heat, rash, or itchyness that I used to feel after every shower on my face, chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li> No frizz - no greasy-look, not too soft to hold a curl, but looks soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> my entire life and didnt really want to use this product.</li>
            <li> And now that my 3 month old son has it too..</li>
            <li> I needed help with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and people say I look 40.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn&#x27;t work out...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I tried Vaseline CoCoa Butter Deep Conditioning Body Lotion, Nivea Essentially Rich Body Lotion, Dermasil Dry Skin Treatment, Aquaphor, and NONE OF THEM WORKED!  </li>
            <li> As an over-40 female with acne-prone, sensitive skin, almost everything irritated my skin and caused breakouts, redness, and irritation (particularly on the eyelids).</li>
            <li> We first apply Cetaphil cream, wait for it to be absorbed and then apply a film of Theraplex emollient (the one that is thick and waxy and comes in a tub).</li>
            <li> #34;mom, I like the other moisturizer that we were using better.&amp;#34; So, I made a special trip down the street to Walgreens and re-purchased the CETAPHIL gentle cleansing soap as well as the Moisturizing Cream all for $18!</li>
            <li> But overall, I found it far far far too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Last month, June 2014, I decided to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this cream after using Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser dry.</li>
            <li> A little spendy but worth the price.</li>
            <li> You would think I would learn and put it on religiously, but I forget,because I am so busy.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old finally said, &amp;</li>
            <li> Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel.</li>
            <li> My husband is recently recovering from a severe leg injury and this is the ONLY handcream that can cope with the injured skin around his skin graft and old wound sites.  </li>
            <li> Now I can wash my hands without pain, I am not ashamed to display my hands anymore, and during the Winter my body skin is not dry.  </li>
            <li> and you may think it will never dry, but it does, and it&#x27;s non-greasy.</li>
            <li> In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well.</li>
            <li> In the end, I went with Cetaphil because it was the best deal price-wise, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!</li>
            <li> I  took used cetaphil for the heck of it since no other moisturizer didn&#x27;t really work and after a little over a week I saw a drastic change in my face.</li>
            <li> I live in in Albuquerque,but before this winter, my hands were never this dry, but this January Before ordering this cream my hands and fingers were literally splitting open and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of lotion including all the ones that say for extremely dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil cream is a long lasting, deeply moisturizing product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve been having dry, irritating, itchy skin on my face for most of the summer.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old son&#x27;s cheeks were very dry</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather.</li>
            <li> I rub a small amount between my hands, glide it into clean wet hair, blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has been my standby for years now, especially in the dry winter months when everything dehydrates, especially my nails, cuticles and hands.  </li>
            <li> They somewhat worked for a little while, but they don&#x27;t completely get rid of the red patches....</li>
            <li> Also, some people&#x27;s reviews said that it was heavy and creamy, and I really didn&#x27;t want my skin to feel oily after using a moisturizer, especially if it was supposed to be for people with extremely dry/sensitive skin, when my skin actually wasn&#x27;t that dry?  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me 10 years ago and I still use in when I occasionally have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I saw many different dermatologists, general clinic, alergists, acupuncturists, anyone who I thought could help; however, no doctor gave me any product that helped, my hands were always in bad shape, hurting whenever I took a shower, washed dishes, etc.  </li>
            <li> Just a few days after using this cream, along with the gentle cleanser, my face had way less oil and my pore size was much smaller.</li>
            <li> I bought the Mustela Stelatopia cream, the wash, and the milky bath oil when my little girl was about 1 month old.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this cream has been so high.</li>
            <li> You can visually see white rivulets of sweat running down your face...</li>
            <li> i admit that at first, i was a little bit wary of this so-called&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but \\&quot;absolutely wondrous and revolutionizing\\&quot; product (i kept the receipt in case of returning)</li>
            <li> it cure my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not as dry anymore</li>
            <li> Do you have Rosacea or some type of dry skin?  </li>
            <li> Soaks into dry skin and is wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rub the Cleanser on your skin (anywhere) and wipe off with a dry wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my husband&#x27;s dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I have recurring cellulitis due to deep vein thrombosis in both legs which makes for very very dry skin due to inadequate blood flow in the upper dermal layers of my skin on my lower legs-</li>
            <li> Now his skin is clear and soft where it used to be scaly and an angry red.    </li>
            <li> Yes, a little definitely goes a long way with cetaphil!</li>
            <li> Of course, this could be because I hadn&#x27;t been previously using a moisturizer, so the difference might not be as big for someone who is already using something?</li>
            <li> They had eczema and their skin is very dry since they were born (face and all over the body).  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a few years short of 40, and wish I&#x27;d have known about this product from the start!</li>
            <li> I now use it from head to toe and have the softest skin, even my feet that used to be rough are now silky.</li>
            <li> It did NOT leave my face, upper eyelids, ears, or neck with a heavy, greasy feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I tried all types of moisturizers that later dried on his cheeks causing his cheeks to look leathery.</li>
            <li> I have slathered this stuff on thick, several times a day when I first bought it because I was having such a bad time with redness and itchyness at that time - this lotion completely soothed and removed all those symptoms!</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin, rough hair and five months of no light.</li>
            <li> And I had to stop using this on my face due to grease.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing.</li>

            <li> &quot; Lubriderm, which I also find somewhat greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> You can use the cream year round on your face and rest of your body, but it might feel a bit heavy for summer months.</li>
            <li> Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it?</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results.  </li>
            <li> Then I bought the Mosturizing cream, the heavy one, and my hands improved 90%!  </li>

            <li> Only have to use it after I shower and my usually horribly chapped skin is soft and supple for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I have used these products for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> At least there&#x27;s a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick but doesn&#x27;t give your skin that shiny, greasy look you&#x27;d expect from a product this thick.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be heavy and make my oil and acne worse.</li>
            <li> Its thick too, and blends in well.</li>
            <li> no more acne!</li>
            <li> After six years of using this cream as a night cream and body lotion, I was shocked to find out some time last year that parabens were added to the ingredients without warning customers in advance.</li>
            <li> but then the acne would look all flaky and even looked worse with makeup over it.  </li>
            <li> As a kid, I had terrible eczema, and this is the only cream I could use that would help heal my skin.</li>

            <li> I put them on after every time I washed my hands, which is a lot because I have a child care, and don&#x27;t like to be sick.</li>
            <li> I hate to write a bad review, but I was disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> However: The ones from Fall &#x27;14 had added parabens...so disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews about this cream I decided to try it, and it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made. As an over-40 female with acne-prone, sensitive skin, almost everything irritated my skin and caused breakouts, redness, and irritation (particularly on the eyelids). Even sunscreen became impossible to wear on my face. After using Cetaphil cream for 2 weeks, all belemishes are gone and my skin has regained balance and softness. It is not thick or greasy and looks great under mineral foundation. I&#x27;ve also used on hands and feet with great results.    I&#x27;m fortunate to have good genetics, but when combined with Olay Regenerist Serum (or the less expensive Equate/CVS alternatives) and Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, I can honestly say I look closer to 25 than 45 with zero skin problems. No process or product works for everyone, but I offer this up as a good solution for great skin.</li>
            <li> it cure my dry skin. It is well tolerated, not greasy at all.. highly recommended</li>
            <li> This really is the best moisturizer you can buy. As a kid, I had terrible eczema, and this is the only cream I could use that would help heal my skin. I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me 10 years ago and I still use in when I occasionally have dry skin.  I do not use it as much anymore since it cured my dry skin, if you have eczema, this really helps.</li>
            <li> My family no longer uses another product ever since we discovered Cetaphil. After our toddler was diagnosed with Eczema, we found that Aquaphor was either not doing much good or was really being downright harmful. During one of the desperate night-time itching episodes, I slathered on some Cetaphil Cream instead of Aquaphor. The itching immediately went down. Surprised, I started investigating and found some not so great information about Aquaphor.    At least in our case, Cetaphil cream (NOT the lotion - thats too weak)in combination with a heavy moisturizer, worked wonders for our toddlers eczema. The national eczema association also rates it well but not as highly simply because of the presence of almond oil, a potential allergen (Not a problem with our toddler).    We first apply Cetaphil cream, wait for it to be absorbed and then apply a film of Theraplex emollient (the one that is thick and waxy and comes in a tub). This was worked miracles for our child. To learn more, you can try looking up my review of Theraplex emollient.</li>
            <li> I hate to write a bad review, but I was disappointed in this product because it contains several parabens, chemicals knows to cause cancer. It was recommended to me by someone, I tried to find the ingredients when I purchased it, so I will not buy it again. I cannot believe that the jar says that it is \\&quot;dermatologist recommended\\&quot; and has the Good Housekeeping Seal. Please investigate parabens before buying this product. I love Amazon and I am a very good customer! Be safe!</li>
            <li> I normally use the body shop&#x27;s body butter, which is GREAT, but I wanted to switch to a low-budget option. Many reviewers raved about the cetaphil cream and how it can be used for everything. Sounds great... if it only wasn&#x27;t so greasy. I noticed how my leather arm chair was really shiny every time I put some on my arm. This stuff really gets everywhere. And I had to stop using this on my face due to grease. Yes, a little definitely goes a long way with cetaphil! But overall, I found it far far far too greasy.  This tub is huge so it&#x27;s gonna take a while to use it up.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have found for my aging skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smooths out the cracks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Lee</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I&#x27;VE BEEN A USER FOR 6 YEARS AND NOTHING ELSE COMPARES! NOT OILY OR GREASY AND REALLY LOCKS IN MOISTURE!! THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who are 3 and 1/2 years old and 2 years old now.  They had eczema and their skin is very dry since they were born (face and all over the body).  I was very desvatated about their skin problem.  I have tried all kinds of cream and lotion (both for baby and adult) and NONE works.  Since they start using the Cetaphil Cream, the skin was from cracking to smooth.  Unbelievable results.  Definitely recommend this product.  NOTE: We tried the Cetaphil lotion, but it does not work as well as the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil products for over 10 years.  This is a wonderful moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Before this, I would have to switch out my cleansing and moisturizing products about every 6 months.  This has been the longest lasting product and I plan on using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I had to go to this when Moisturel Cream was discontinued after 30 years. I like this just as well. Maybe better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for years.  Simply the best there is.  My husband is recently recovering from a severe leg injury and this is the ONLY handcream that can cope with the injured skin around his skin graft and old wound sites.  This is SERIOUS dry skin - flaky, peeling, etc. &amp; Cetaphil keeps it supple.  When we run out and try other things (including beeswax products, cocoa butter products) his skin looks MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with Psoriases on the palm of my hands since 1989.  I saw many different dermatologists, general clinic, alergists, acupuncturists, anyone who I thought could help; however, no doctor gave me any product that helped, my hands were always in bad shape, hurting whenever I took a shower, washed dishes, etc.  I lived in Africa in 2004 and local people didn&#x27;t want to take money from me because they thought I had Leprosy...  Last year, on a market, shopping for the week, I saw Cetaphil soap and bought it.  It was a relief: for the first time in many years I could wash my hands without hurting them! Then I bought the Mosturizing cream, the heavy one, and my hands improved 90%!  Now I can wash my hands without pain, I am not ashamed to display my hands anymore, and during the Winter my body skin is not dry.  Even when I was in Brazil, and the price was more than double the cost in US$, I bought it and I do not regret:  I will never be without Cetaphil soap and cream again!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a miracle facial cream. I have eczema and i&#x27;ve been having dry, irritating, itchy skin on my face for most of the summer. My face was really flakey and peeling off, it looked like dandruff spilled on my face. I  took used cetaphil for the heck of it since no other moisturizer didn&#x27;t really work and after a little over a week I saw a drastic change in my face. Not as dry anymore and the flakey skin is almost gone. The itching went down a bit but i would recommend hydrocortisone for the itches. Overall a tremendous product that works! Highly recommend for all types of skin</li>
            <li> I got this because I had read great reviews on acne message boards and beauty message boards about this product.  Those are the best places to get advice on what product to try because it&#x27;s been tried and true.  Not only does it do its job in moisturizing my face, but it&#x27;s a huge jar!  The price is great for the amount that you get.  It truly hydrates my skin, but I only use it on my face.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hands, feet, elbows or knees.  I&#x27;m going to give it a shot.  Be sure to moisturize after you use astringent on your face.  One swipe of the hand is good enough to moisturize your face. You don&#x27;t need too much.  I&#x27;ve used generous quantities before and woke up with a greasy face.  A little can go a long way.  Lastly, be sure to moisturize the skin under your eyes, around your eyes and around your mouth.  These are the wrinkle spots that you want to keep hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years as an overall moisturizer, for face and body.  I don&#x27;t look my age and I \\&quot;blame\\&quot; genetics and Cetaphil cream for my youthful-looking skin!  My spouse had huge problems with eczema on his legs and feet...until he started using this terrific cream.  Now his skin is clear and soft where it used to be scaly and an angry red.    The only drawback is that Cetaphil cream is thick/heavy and tends to run into your eyes when you sweat.  It is VERY painful when it drops into your eyes.  You can visually see white rivulets of sweat running down your face...no wonder it stings your eyes!  I suggest that you use either the lotion counterpart to this great cream or go to another lighter-base face cream.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry, itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather. I have all kinds of lotion, and for some reason never tried Cetaphil. I bought this and it&#x27;s now the only thing I use--it&#x27;s that good! In addition to dry, my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well. I&#x27;ve used Aveeno with some success, since it&#x27;s unscented, as is this. I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it&#x27;s extremely moisturizing. I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry. It&#x27;s the longest-lasting lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not at all too heavy though, or sticky and it absorbs well. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent. I would highly recommend this to anyone, from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).</li>
            <li> Cetaphil cream is a long lasting, deeply moisturizing product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and eczema. It goes on thick but doesn&#x27;t give your skin that shiny, greasy look you&#x27;d expect from a product this thick. When my eczema flares it gets really bad. With traditional lotions, I had to reapply constantly to control dryness and flaking, Cetaphil lasts all day with one hearty application. The price is high compared to average moisturizers but with how long the a single tub lasts it&#x27;s a great value. I&#x27;ve tried generic Cetaphil from store brands and while they worked well, but side by side the genuine Cetaphil has a creamier texture and goes on feeling less greasy along with having a cleaner scent and IMHO is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> This is the large jar of Cetaphil. This is an amazing moisturizer cream. It has no yucky fragrance or chemicals that are irritants, so it works wonders on damaged hurting skin. I just got done using my chainsaw is some limbs, then weed eating. My hands were all scraped up, with a cut thumb. This cream is on my hands and helping as I write this. Absorber quickly and does not leave a greasy or slick feel. Gets into your skin to where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> I live in in Albuquerque,but before this winter, my hands were never this dry, but this January Before ordering this cream my hands and fingers were literally splitting open and bleeding. I tried all kinds of lotion including all the ones that say for extremely dry sensitive skin. I put them on after every time I washed my hands, which is a lot because I have a child care, and don&#x27;t like to be sick. I went to my Doctor and she said to try Cetaphil moisturizing cream. I went home and ordered it right away, because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the physical stores I checked. The first time I put it on I thought this could work. It felt good every time I put it on, but it took 2 days to completely heal my hands. When I forget to put it on now after a day or two my fingers start to split open and bleed again. You would think I would learn and put it on religiously, but I forget,because I am so busy. I guess some people have to learn the hard way and that includes me.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this cream - it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my skin and boy I can tell the difference.  No itching!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good for people with dry skin.  Superior to most body creams.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this cream has been so high. It feels cheap and synthetic, and does not absorb well. (well, it IS cheap, for its size!)</li>
            <li> I never knew that a moisturizing cream could make such an impact on the health of my skin. I&#x27;m a few years short of 40, and wish I&#x27;d have known about this product from the start! This product completely removed all traces of redness, heat, rash, or itchyness that I used to feel after every shower on my face, chest and shoulders. It has kept eczema (atopic dermatitis) from flaring on the backs of my earlobes (applied twice daily to earlobes - that&#x27;s all). It does NOT cause me any acne breakouts at all - and I am very prone to acne if I do not follow a careful routine of cleansing, applying Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (AHA), and moisturizing. I have slathered this stuff on thick, several times a day when I first bought it because I was having such a bad time with redness and itchyness at that time - this lotion completely soothed and removed all those symptoms! I have found that when I do feel an itchy blotch, I can slather this cream on, and the heat and itchyness stops soon, and the blotch goes away. I&#x27;m in heaven with this stuff. I love it so much, I have started using the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser lotion too - and it is another case of product love. I&#x27;ll be a Cetaphil buyer forever. (Eucerin is nice, but I can&#x27;t tolerate the Lanolin in their product) If I could rate it even higher, I would. Fantastic products. PS: I forgot to mention, this lotion is great under my makeup ... liquid foundation glides over the cream so nicely that my skin looks prettier than ever. I&#x27;ve never had such soft, smooth, clear skin before in my life. In fact, I love the feeling of spreading this soft-buttery cream all over my face twice a day - it feels like I&#x27;m spoiling myself, when actually, I&#x27;m giving myself good skin. I now use it from head to toe and have the softest skin, even my feet that used to be rough are now silky. If you do have any form of eczema, it is important to get your cream or lotion on within 3 minutes of getting out of the tub or shower - so that you trap as much moisture as possible. :) One last beauty tip (and this might seem odd) but this cream makes a great leave-in hair conditioner for my extremely long auburn hair that has a tendency to frizz. I rub a small amount between my hands, glide it into clean wet hair, blow dry and style. No frizz - no greasy-look, not too soft to hold a curl, but looks soft and touchable. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have been battling acne and oily skin my entire life and didnt really want to use this product. I thought it would be heavy and make my oil and acne worse. But, I was proven wrong. Just a few days after using this cream, along with the gentle cleanser, my face had way less oil and my pore size was much smaller. I have now used the cleanser and moisturizer for two months now and couldnt be happier. Ive tried almost everything with varying results, from Proactive to expensive products, and havent been as happy with them as I am with the Cetaphil line of products. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Winter itching relieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything more to say, except don&#x27;t play basketball with anyone who works for the NSA.</li>
            <li> I have had acne forever until I started using this cream.  All the other face creams would clog my pores.  So I wouldn&#x27;t put lotion on but then the acne would look all flaky and even looked worse with makeup over it.  Now, I wash with a cream or soap cleanser, followed with Clinique Clarifying Toner (#4) and finish with this lotion.  MY FACE IS BEAUTIFUL.  And finally (I&#x27;m 40)... no more acne!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews online but this time after first time using this product it compels me to write this review! First, after seeing a doctor with my ichy skin, she suggested that I try this brand and as it turned out she&#x27;s 100% correct. I&#x27;ve been getting itchy skin a few months ago. I&#x27;ve tried many different products including Gold Bond but nothing really help except this one! I purchased from local Costco store and applied a think layer after shower on that night I felt like new person no more itchy skin and rash!!! Just 1 time use I already know how effective this product is for treating dry skin that due to whether or heat. I&#x27;ll be using this brand going forward and consider getting a cleansing gel from this company as sometime I get itchy face after a warm shower. I definitely suggest you try this before visiting doctor office if you have rash or itchy skin especially at night time. I  wish I could started using this product earlier but didn&#x27;t know until doctor suggested and now I have much better sleep at night and still see that my skin is moist after next day.[[ASIN:B00113HNB4 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, Non-comedogenic (20 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Scentfree (really!..almost, practically) and gentle. Also, you get quite a bit for your money. Its thick too, and blends in well. Great for acne. !</li>
            <li> The items arrived in 2 days after the order, and I just paid for regular shipping cost - \great service! I have been using Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream as night cream. So far so good. I didn&#x27;t notice anything different compared to the more expensive products I had used before.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer. Love the feel of it after applying</li>
            <li> Got this for an elderly friend and she loves it, goes on smooth and disappears at once so woo hoo</li>
            <li> We loved Cetpahil up until now. But I still like it since my husband and I don&#x27;t have ezcema issues. But our sons do: My 4 y.o. son has ezcema since he was a baby. It is not as bad now. But I&#x27;ve noticed about 6 months ago that he cannot tolerate the Cetaphil Cream Tub. He can only handle the Cetaphil Lotion. I think it has to do with Macadamia Nut Oil (non-allergen to him) vs Sweet Almond Oil (allergen to him). And now that my 3 month old son has it too..I think we&#x27;ll try Aquaphor since it doesn&#x27;t have any nut oils in it.</li>
            <li> Do you have Rosacea or some type of dry skin?  Cetaphil daily facial cleanser and Cetaphil facial moisturizing cream are awesome.  It did NOT leave my face, upper eyelids, ears, or neck with a heavy, greasy feel to it.  These products have really improved the condition of my skin in that my skin is much softer and is NOT dry.  I have Rosacea and the cleansor did NOT irritate my breakouts at all and does an excellent job cleaning my face.  These products are fragrance free and dermatologist recommended.  My only regret: I wish I had found the Cetaphil products sooner!</li>
            <li> Love love. I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Tested in one of the driest climates and its the best moisturizer. Happy with the purchase. Planning to use other products by Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> My skin is happy. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I would like to disagree with the advertisement and other reviewers on the claim that this product is \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot;. This lotion is not as greasy as Eucerin, which is very greasy (but also is the most moisturizing). This lotion is just as greasy and heavy as \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; Lubriderm, which I also find somewhat greasy and heavy.  What is non-greasy? I have found several lotions from Shiseido and Amore Pacific to be very non-greasy but they also cost about 3-5 times more than this lotion (based on volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion, however, does not LOOK greasy on my face, which might be the half of the value. It also does an excellent job of retaining moisture, but that is true of every lotion I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is also a decent value considering this is a 16 ounce size jar which is about 80% volume of a full roll of toilet paper (the jar is a circular shape as a toilet paper so I thought it would be a good comparison)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an excellent moisturizer that does not look greasy, then this will do its job. But if you truly want a non-greasy feeling lotion, you are better off buying a higher quality lotion albeit at a higher price.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old son&#x27;s cheeks were very dry no matter what I put on it! I tried all types of moisturizers that later dried on his cheeks causing his cheeks to look leathery. I asked around for advice and one of my girlfriend&#x27;s recommended that I use CETAPHIL Moisturizing Cream. FROM THE VERY 1st application, my son&#x27;s skin appeared hydrated, moisturized, and plump! I tried Vaseline CoCoa Butter Deep Conditioning Body Lotion, Nivea Essentially Rich Body Lotion, Dermasil Dry Skin Treatment, Aquaphor, and NONE OF THEM WORKED!  After an hour or so, my son&#x27;s skin went back to its leathery look.&lt;br /&gt;  I noticed that an hour later with CETAPHIL that my son&#x27;s skin STILL looked moisturized and plump! By the end of the day when my son&#x27;s skin was STILL moisturized and plump I WAS SOLD on CETAPHIL! My husband, 2 daughters, and I are all now using CETAPHIL!&lt;br /&gt;  Last month, June 2014, I decided to try a new moisturizer. My 6 year old finally said, &amp;#34;mom, I like the other moisturizer that we were using better.&amp;#34; So, I made a special trip down the street to Walgreens and re-purchased the CETAPHIL gentle cleansing soap as well as the Moisturizing Cream all for $18! THANKS CETAPHIL!</li>
            <li> very good cream for people who suffer from dry skin, they recommend</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil cos it&#x27;s fragrance free and gets rid of dry skin so quick. I use it for both face and body</li>
            <li> I have used everything...the mot expensive moisturizers on the planet. Simply put, this is all I use now.  Particularly on my face, it&#x27;s great, a must, for dry skin and I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is.  If it was triple the price, my review wouldn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s simply the best. I use more in the winter (Chicago) and I literally slather it on. Less in the summer when it&#x27;s humid. Soaks into dry skin and is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is a must have as well. Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many nail and cuticle creams, oils, lotions and whatever that make bold claims as to their ability to perform miracles on your cuticles and nails.  None of them lived up to their claims, not even close.  And, these treatments always seem to have esoteric places to buy them, then they disappear from the market, so that always makes me suspicious of their claims. You can buy Cetaphil lotion or cream just about anywhere. In fact, they even have a lotion with an SPF of 15.      Cetaphil has been my standby for years now, especially in the dry winter months when everything dehydrates, especially my nails, cuticles and hands.  Cetaphil lotion is lighter and is the perfect hydrating lotion for my face year round, but the cream in the jar is perfect for my hands, nails and cuticles, even feet. I use it mostly before bedtime when I lather it on my hands and work it in for a few minutes. It becomes very liquidy and feels like silk and you may think it will never dry, but it does, and it&#x27;s non-greasy. Next morning, I am always impressed at how good my hands look. I do a lot of gardening and landscaping, sometimes forgetting to wear gloves, so I continue using the cream in the jar even in summer to quickly calm, hydrate and heal my hands.  You can use the cream year round on your face and rest of your body, but it might feel a bit heavy for summer months. I just hope Galderma doesn&#x27;t ever change this wonderful cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and the product is great for my dry skin. Love my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It moisturizes me and my babies skin well. I always use this product, works wonders!  :)</li>
            <li> I bought the Mustela Stelatopia cream, the wash, and the milky bath oil when my little girl was about 1 month old. They somewhat worked for a little while, but they don&#x27;t completely get rid of the red patches.... They work, but they are more expensive and they don&#x27;t work as well as....     OK, here is what works for my child: (1) I apply a thick layer of Cetaphil cream (not the lotion)all over after bath or whenever the skin looks irratated, (2) I stopped using any baby wash until the condition greatly improved, then only use baby wash no more than once a week, and rinse well. At the beginning, I applied Cetaphil on her several times a day. After about two or three days, all the redness went away. In the past 14 months, Cetaphil cream has been what keeps my little girl&#x27;s skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for winter weather.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Only have to use it after I shower and my usually horribly chapped skin is soft and supple for 24 hours.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to family and friends.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky like Eucerin does.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing cream!</li>
            <li> un ladrón e irresponsable... nunca llego la mercancía. Muy mal servicio.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial moisturizer before, but with winter coming around, I thought I would try one out. I&#x27;d heard plenty of good things about Cetaphil, but didn&#x27;t think that my skin necessarily counted as &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or &#x27;dry&#x27; - I would say it&#x27;s normal? Also, some people&#x27;s reviews said that it was heavy and creamy, and I really didn&#x27;t want my skin to feel oily after using a moisturizer, especially if it was supposed to be for people with extremely dry/sensitive skin, when my skin actually wasn&#x27;t that dry?  In the end, I went with Cetaphil because it was the best deal price-wise, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed! I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 week (morning and night), and it has already made a BIG difference on my skin! Of course, this could be because I hadn&#x27;t been previously using a moisturizer, so the difference might not be as big for someone who is already using something? However the fact remains that it definitely works!  It really is fragrance free, not just in terms of perfumes, but it doesn&#x27;t smell chemical-y either, which was a relief to me. The moisturizer itself *is* creamy and heavy, but on the skin, it&#x27;s very light - I actually love the feel of it. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all when you put it on.  Basically, it is as wonderful as everyone says it is! Even if you don&#x27;t have eczema or dry/sensitive skin, it is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I bought this bc I needed help with sensitive skin.  This product worked wonders until my issue came back.  My doctor figured it was because I kept dipping my fingers into the tub, even after washing my hands.  I switched to a tube of Cetaphil and voila! the problem resolved.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great n my skin! I had cancer and I was allergic too a lot of things but this helps!!!!!</li>
            <li> Every one should have this product no matter what kind of skin you have it is great.  My husbands doctor recommended it for his dry skin due to diabetes and it works great.  A little spendy but worth the price.</li>
            <li> i admit that at first, i was a little bit wary of this so-called&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but \\&quot;absolutely wondrous and revolutionizing\\&quot; product (i kept the receipt in case of returning) but now i think i&#x27;m hooked!!! it&#x27;s been about a week since i started using the cream and the facial wash. and my skin is noticeably softer and prettier! when you apply a lot of cream with or without makeup, you do end up looking and feeling quite greasy, but i think that comes with any kind of cream. so usually i&#x27;ll pack it in at night, sorta as a moisturizing mask i guess, and during the day i go really light. and it works! amazing!! honestly i can&#x27;t remember my skin feeling so healthy. i don&#x27;t know how they did it, but it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer because it isn&#x27;t as greasy feeling as others- and absorbs into the skin faster. I have recurring cellulitis due to deep vein thrombosis in both legs which makes for very very dry skin due to inadequate blood flow in the upper dermal layers of my skin on my lower legs- so I have to use moisturizer every day to keep it from flaking off. This worked better than several national brands I tried before. If you order this - make sure you do so with other products so that the shipping charge is spread out over 4 or 5 items - and doesn&#x27;t make it seem you are paying as much to buy it ($10 per jar) as you are to ship it otherwise it isn&#x27;t worth it-premium product or not.  .</li>
            <li> I use this cream after using Cetaphil&#x27;s Gentle Skin Cleanser dry. Rub the Cleanser on your skin (anywhere) and wipe off with a dry wash cloth. Then apply the cream as necessary. I am 65 years old and people say I look 40. I have used these products for at least 10 years. These products make my skin look great, so I rarely need make-up.  If you are acne prone, after using the Cleanser, swipe with Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel. This deep cleans pores and still keeps you moisturized. Sudden acne outbreaks should be tolerated for at least a little while as the products bring &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; to the surface. Hang in there. Unless you have been digging ditches all day, these products get the job done. I believe all the scrubbing and super cleansing of skin (as touted by the media) contributes to acne, wrinkles, rashes, etc. Give your skin a break and it will look great!</li>
            <li> This is heavier than the lotions so I normally use it on my arms and legs, and a dab on my face at night with the lotion. It&#x27;s fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t break me out and helps with winter itching. I recommend for sensitive skin types like mine, because cold weather makes my life miserable. Always has. Dry skin, rough hair and five months of no light. At least there&#x27;s a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues. Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it? I&#x27;d really appreciate it, if this global warming deal doesn&#x27;t work out...thanks. Oh by the way, I think they changed the formula because it&#x27;s easier to spread.</li>
            <li> After six years of using this cream as a night cream and body lotion, I was shocked to find out some time last year that parabens were added to the ingredients without warning customers in advance. Please beware if you are looking for paraben-free products. Our creams bought in 2013 did not have parabens in them. However: The ones from Fall &#x27;14 had added parabens...so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This worked well. Dermatologist recommends cerave soap and cetaphil cream. Helped!!! Use on hands, too.</li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my husband&#x27;s dry hands.  It works great for him and I also use it on my face and hands.</li>
