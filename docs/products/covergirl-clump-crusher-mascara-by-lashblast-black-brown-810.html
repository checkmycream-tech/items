            <li>*without any special remover*. Great mascara.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look especially full, but it gets the job done, and most importantly, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>

            <li>Its at a great price point, easy to handle easy to appy.</li>

            <li>I wish they would put some kind of texture on the wands for gripping purposes.</li>

            <li>Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>have two favorite mascaras that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful and natural!</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is as good as any when you first use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new to makeup and this is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara, and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a mascara junkie.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique, better than any mascara I ever got.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara often, but this is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smear, clump or run, that I&#x27;ve been using it every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I never have a problem with flaking.  </li>
            <li>The Lashblast is easy to apply and the results are appealing--no struggling with refining an application.</li>
            <li>I always get so irritated when mascaras clump up so easily...</li>
            <li>Easy on in the morning, easy off when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>Got crumbly very quickly.</li>
            <li>Lasta all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and easily washes off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (if you know what you&#x27;re doing).</li>
            <li>The mascara itself seems just fine, but I&#x27;m no connoisseur.</li>
            <li>The color was perfect for myself and always go with the darkest black.</li>
            <li>appreciate a curved brush, so that&#x27;s a big win for this one.</li>
            <li>This has been a fabulous investment.</li>
            <li>Especially for what I paid here on Amazon, this was a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non clumpy, perfect for everyday use and for nights out.</li>
            <li>This product has a great rubber brush, which makes placing color on individual lashes a breeze!  </li>
            <li>Its a nice option when you dont want a really pricey brand.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t brush off and leave flecks on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump or feel heavy, but my lashes look great!</li>
            <li>Goes on clump free and smooth</li>
            <li>Volume building potential is great.</li>
            <li>Eye popping clump free because of how the silicone brushes made.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star rating because goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>It dries quickly so if you use an eyelash brush like I do, you&#x27;d better be quick or you&#x27;ll find yourself combing out eyelash tangles.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking, easy to remove at night, nice color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also resists the smudges we are all familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes off a lot easier too, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to pull your lashes out to get them clean.</li>
            <li>I love this product it left my lashes looking amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily and comes off very readily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It applied easy and left my lashes looking great for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on all night with just the right amount of lift that I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size to apply the mascara to my eye lashes and not have it smudge on my lids!</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear, but maybe use something more exciting for a night-out look.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a really good mascara that didn&#x27;t clump, so I purchased this one only because it had a $1.50 off coupon associated with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good color, I prefer black, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I am completely loyal to clump crusher</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump as quickly as some.</li>
            <li>I also love that they use bright colors for the container itself because its cute and makes it a lot easier to find in a crazy makeup bag :)</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara, as far as normal mascaras go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One is expensive but worth every penny, &#x27;Diorshow&#x27; by Dior, the other is dirt cheap but beloved by many (including me!), &#x27;Great Lash&#x27; by Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diorshow</li>
            <li>It is great as an every day mascara, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural?</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara by far.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that Covergirl had such a great product</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>No clumping issue just the right texture</li>
            <li>Great Lash, in the iconic pink and green tube, gives super volume but clumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brown-black color is pretty light, more brown than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used of that color</li>
            <li>which is my first time using a wand like this, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another tube when I finished up the first one</li>
            <li>Anyway, this mascara looks so pretty on.</li>
            <li>I use CG LashBlash Length Mascara as my first coat, then this clump buster to finish.  </li>
            <li>This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  </li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it did anything more special than any other waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>It is true to its name and goes on clean without clumps, however, it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>This Black Brown shade is amazing.</li>
            <li>The black brown color is really nice</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don&#x27;t need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I use the curve (inside) under my lashes by gently jiggling the lashes from the root to end</li>
            <li>And it really stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li>And, to my delight, the wand shape really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>Works very well, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I really like the results of the combo.</li>
            <li>I found this mascara to be very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>It really does crush the clumps.</li>
            <li>but this stuff makes people ask me if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also didn&#x27;t give much volume or thickness at ALL even with a couple coats.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascarra.</li>
            <li>As someone who has used Revlon brand mascara for years, I have to say that cover girl is soooo much</li>
            <li>With revlon, there was always way too much mascara when pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Covergirl mascara line, but I really wish that they would re-engineer their wands...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>Not too much length power.</li>
            <li>I need very little mascara, so I&#x27;ve been search for one that goes on easy and light and does not clump.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS had a problem with that because I wouldn&#x27;t put it on right the first time and would try to correct it until my lases were in three big clumps</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I apply only once throughout the day, others might one to apply more than this, as this is not a long wear (24 hours, not even 12 hours)</li>
            <li>I love the color, not too dark.</li>
            <li>I have very long lashes, but they&#x27;re light at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it won a award for being the best mascara this year but - not so much - too bad</li>
            <li>I still get the lashes unseparated at the ends, making it look like I half as many.  </li>
            <li>I thought, WTH?, so I bought only one (in black-brown), in case I didn&#x27;t like it, but now I&#x27;m regretting not buying more because the coupon could only be used once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would Highly recommend</li>
            <li>(WOW!!)</li>
            <li>It takes like 15 coats to look like a normal 2 coats.</li>
            <li>I only wear it occasionally, and I like this because it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite that I have used so far but still does clump a little which is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I actually was able to get it cheaper on Amazon, than at my local big box store.</li>
            <li>The way the brush is designed is far better than the usual mascara brush.</li>
            <li>It does not give a bold or thick look (not much volume), but it gives a nice, moderate curl and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>If you want a more dramatic look, go for the black, but the black brown does a great job of enhancing lashes while still looking fairly natural.</li>
            <li>It has a brush that you&#x27;ve never seen before and you can&#x27;t really tell how much mascara is on the brush, but I expect not much.  </li>
            <li>However, the tube I recieved from here was old</li>
            <li>You have to follow the directions - use 2 coats, both light, instead of one heavy coat.</li>
            <li>It really separates my lashes and covers all the tiny lashes too.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will buy in the future</li>
            <li>I mean, for the free that I got it for, how can I REALLY complain?</li>
            <li>It wasnt dramatic which I liked  </li>
            <li>If you work outside or in high humidity, I would opt for their waterproof version.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitivities, I highly recommend sticking with a product you already know and use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>They are too smooth and slick and sometimes slip from your grip.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used some expensive and cheap ones!!  </li>
            <li>Barely darkens my lashes, no volume or length.</li>
            <li>I will probably go back to the wet and messy version to accent my eyes better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Because the formula is dryer than usual, for the first time ever, I can apply mascara on my bottom lashes and it looks natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and not a single clump or flake.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper when you consider not spending the gas, the headache and the crazy dressed people :)</li>
            <li>I use the arch (the butt or back of the curve) on top of my lashes to help with curling them by gently turning the wand (my wrist) away from me (slightly downward at the root and then slightly upward from the middle of my lashes to the end of them), sometimes with a slight jiggle motion.</li>
            <li>(and this has happened since the first few times</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a decent product.</li>
            <li>and I like to wear this on regular days for a more natural and less dramatic look.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What a nice product!  </li>
            <li> For a darker mascara, this is definitely a nice product!</li>
            <li> I pair this with the orange Covergirl thickening one and together they do an OK job, still like BUXOM the best!</li>
            <li> I personally love the rubber bristles and think they make it a lot easier, faster and has your lashes looking perfectly separated.</li>

            <li> Love the brush on this Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara!</li>

            <li> Nothing amazing, but it works well for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it for a good deal.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice mascara that defines the lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Gives you nice lashes.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> *without any special remover*. Great mascara.</li>
            <li> Great, great length on the lashes without clumping, far exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look especially full, but it gets the job done, and most importantly, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I love my Covergirl mascara and have purchased this one many times!</li>
            <li> Its at a great price point, easy to handle easy to appy.</li>
            <li> Loved it no clumps its light and airy.</li>
            <li> I wish they would put some kind of texture on the wands for gripping purposes.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Clump Crusher,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m mostly happy.</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara pretty good.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many eye products</li>

            <li> I love all the lash blast mascaras.</li>

            <li> ive tried so many different mascaras and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this color</li>
            <li> May favorite go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I find I get more clumps w this brand</li>
            <li> Love my lashes.</li>
            <li> Most brands are.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the price.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and it does not clump.</li>
            <li> Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> have two favorite mascaras that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful and natural!</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is as good as any when you first use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new to makeup and this is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a mascara junkie.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique, better than any mascara I ever got.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara often, but this is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smear, clump or run, that I&#x27;ve been using it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I never have a problem with flaking.  </li>
            <li> The Lashblast is easy to apply and the results are appealing--no struggling with refining an application.</li>
            <li> I always get so irritated when mascaras clump up so easily...</li>
            <li> Easy on in the morning, easy off when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> Got crumbly very quickly.</li>
            <li> Lasta all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and easily washes off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (if you know what you&#x27;re doing).</li>
            <li> The mascara itself seems just fine, but I&#x27;m no connoisseur.</li>
            <li> The color was perfect for myself and always go with the darkest black.</li>
            <li> appreciate a curved brush, so that&#x27;s a big win for this one.</li>
            <li> This has been a fabulous investment.</li>
            <li> Especially for what I paid here on Amazon, this was a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non clumpy, perfect for everyday use and for nights out.</li>
            <li> This product has a great rubber brush, which makes placing color on individual lashes a breeze!  </li>
            <li> Its a nice option when you dont want a really pricey brand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t brush off and leave flecks on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump or feel heavy, but my lashes look great!</li>
            <li> Goes on clump free and smooth</li>
            <li> Volume building potential is great.</li>
            <li> Eye popping clump free because of how the silicone brushes made.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star rating because goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> It dries quickly so if you use an eyelash brush like I do, you&#x27;d better be quick or you&#x27;ll find yourself combing out eyelash tangles.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking, easy to remove at night, nice color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also resists the smudges we are all familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes off a lot easier too, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to pull your lashes out to get them clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product it left my lashes looking amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily and comes off very readily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It applied easy and left my lashes looking great for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on all night with just the right amount of lift that I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size to apply the mascara to my eye lashes and not have it smudge on my lids!</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear, but maybe use something more exciting for a night-out look.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a really good mascara that didn&#x27;t clump, so I purchased this one only because it had a $1.50 off coupon associated with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good color, I prefer black, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I am completely loyal to clump crusher</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump as quickly as some.</li>
            <li> I also love that they use bright colors for the container itself because its cute and makes it a lot easier to find in a crazy makeup bag :)</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara, as far as normal mascaras go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One is expensive but worth every penny, &#x27;Diorshow&#x27; by Dior, the other is dirt cheap but beloved by many (including me!), &#x27;Great Lash&#x27; by Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diorshow</li>
            <li> It is great as an every day mascara, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural?</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that Covergirl had such a great product</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> No clumping issue just the right texture</li>
            <li> Great Lash, in the iconic pink and green tube, gives super volume but clumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brown-black color is pretty light, more brown than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used of that color</li>
            <li> which is my first time using a wand like this, and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another tube when I finished up the first one</li>
            <li> Anyway, this mascara looks so pretty on.</li>
            <li> I use CG LashBlash Length Mascara as my first coat, then this clump buster to finish.  </li>
            <li> This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  </li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it did anything more special than any other waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> It is true to its name and goes on clean without clumps, however, it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> This Black Brown shade is amazing.</li>
            <li> The black brown color is really nice</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don&#x27;t need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I use the curve (inside) under my lashes by gently jiggling the lashes from the root to end</li>
            <li> And it really stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> And, to my delight, the wand shape really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I really like the results of the combo.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be very clumpy.  </li>
            <li> It really does crush the clumps.</li>
            <li> but this stuff makes people ask me if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t give much volume or thickness at ALL even with a couple coats.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascarra.</li>
            <li> As someone who has used Revlon brand mascara for years, I have to say that cover girl is soooo much</li>
            <li> With revlon, there was always way too much mascara when pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Covergirl mascara line, but I really wish that they would re-engineer their wands...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> Not too much length power.</li>
            <li> I need very little mascara, so I&#x27;ve been search for one that goes on easy and light and does not clump.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS had a problem with that because I wouldn&#x27;t put it on right the first time and would try to correct it until my lases were in three big clumps</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I apply only once throughout the day, others might one to apply more than this, as this is not a long wear (24 hours, not even 12 hours)</li>
            <li> I love the color, not too dark.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, but they&#x27;re light at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it won a award for being the best mascara this year but - not so much - too bad</li>
            <li> I still get the lashes unseparated at the ends, making it look like I half as many.  </li>
            <li> I thought, WTH?, so I bought only one (in black-brown), in case I didn&#x27;t like it, but now I&#x27;m regretting not buying more because the coupon could only be used once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would Highly recommend</li>
            <li> (WOW!!)</li>
            <li> It takes like 15 coats to look like a normal 2 coats.</li>
            <li> I only wear it occasionally, and I like this because it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite that I have used so far but still does clump a little which is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I actually was able to get it cheaper on Amazon, than at my local big box store.</li>
            <li> The way the brush is designed is far better than the usual mascara brush.</li>
            <li> It does not give a bold or thick look (not much volume), but it gives a nice, moderate curl and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> If you want a more dramatic look, go for the black, but the black brown does a great job of enhancing lashes while still looking fairly natural.</li>
            <li> It has a brush that you&#x27;ve never seen before and you can&#x27;t really tell how much mascara is on the brush, but I expect not much.  </li>
            <li> However, the tube I recieved from here was old</li>
            <li> You have to follow the directions - use 2 coats, both light, instead of one heavy coat.</li>
            <li> It really separates my lashes and covers all the tiny lashes too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will buy in the future</li>
            <li> I mean, for the free that I got it for, how can I REALLY complain?</li>
            <li> It wasnt dramatic which I liked  </li>
            <li> If you work outside or in high humidity, I would opt for their waterproof version.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitivities, I highly recommend sticking with a product you already know and use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> They are too smooth and slick and sometimes slip from your grip.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used some expensive and cheap ones!!  </li>
            <li> Barely darkens my lashes, no volume or length.</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to the wet and messy version to accent my eyes better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Because the formula is dryer than usual, for the first time ever, I can apply mascara on my bottom lashes and it looks natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and not a single clump or flake.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper when you consider not spending the gas, the headache and the crazy dressed people :)</li>
            <li> I use the arch (the butt or back of the curve) on top of my lashes to help with curling them by gently turning the wand (my wrist) away from me (slightly downward at the root and then slightly upward from the middle of my lashes to the end of them), sometimes with a slight jiggle motion.</li>
            <li> (and this has happened since the first few times</li>
            <li> Other than that it was a decent product.</li>
            <li> and I like to wear this on regular days for a more natural and less dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it as far as making my VERY thin, fine eyelashes stand out.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the purchase, the product came completely dry, I feel cheated, the first time I buy this mascara brand not recommend</li>
            <li> Just makes it really awkward for me to apply; I&#x27;m sure that is personal preference.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural i got the color in black</li>
            <li> I ordered it in black brown because that is the natural color of my lashes</li>
            <li> It last for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I used to use that when I did work outside but waterproof is also harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as long as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> My lashed looked long and not clumpy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, runs</li>
            <li> It has a rather dry consistency.</li>
            <li> I figured it would not live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The mascara is easy to apply -- just thick enough to coat the lashes and provide a little length, but not so thick that it gets clumpy or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely no clumping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never had clumping issues with other CG mascaras, but whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my other CG mascaras, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> A bit too wet but great-glamorous results!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump like other mascaras do</li>
            <li> I gave the other one to a friend that was looking to try this brand out.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using my other mascaras in favor of this one, and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I used the black or very black mascara, however, the effect is still present.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of mascara that left globs on my upper lids and my lashes stuck together.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very stiff and helps to separate even after the second coat.</li>
            <li> Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don&#x27;t end up with clumps in the process!</li>
            <li> I am down to the bottom of the tube and it still isn&#x27;t clumping.</li>
            <li> There is still a little clumping sometimes, but much less than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> one complaint is that it seems like the brush doesn&#x27;t get fully coated inside the tube of mascara -- I can still see the green color of the bristles where there should actually be brown-black mascara coating it.</li>
            <li> It clumps less than some mascaras but still has some.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super volumizing, but lengthens the lashes to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I have been in search for something that lengthens my invisible eyelashes without being a clumpy mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the black brown color.</li>
            <li> It defines my lashes and lengthens them well with a little work.</li>
            <li> However, I still get little chunks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too dark though!</li>
            <li> Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is).</li>
            <li> I apply a little heavily</li>
            <li> It has dried out and clumps on my lashes</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on thin and the brush definitely does not produce clumps.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara everyday for over a year now.</li>
            <li> Added bonus - it doesn&#x27;t leave dark smudges under my eyes - one of the very few mascaras that don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I usually wear blackest black, but this is a nicer shade.</li>
            <li> (I had a little, very little darkening under my eyes by the end of the day, and this was after sweating).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have been using Rapid Lash Growth to grow lashes for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> But no more.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> No more using a needle to separate your lashes after a coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> I like black/brown for a less dramatic everyday look.</li>
            <li> No major complaints, it is just that I found it impossible to use the brush since it&#x27;s half curved.</li>
            <li> While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it&#x27;s not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a mascara will ever give me the length I want, but at least this stays on and doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> It came out thick, clumped my lashes together and flaked off all day.</li>
            <li> and this product isn&#x27;t clumpy or too thick.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find it, and continue to be disappointed when I try new ones.  </li>
            <li> I used the black-brown mascara for subtly, so my lashes aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they would have been had</li>
            <li> (At least I have not had that problem)!</li>
            <li> very thick on the wand.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Aaah....I really like this mascara. I was searching for a really good mascara that didn&#x27;t clump, so I purchased this one only because it had a $1.50 off coupon associated with it. I thought, WTH?, so I bought only one (in black-brown), in case I didn&#x27;t like it, but now I&#x27;m regretting not buying more because the coupon could only be used once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is curved, which is my first time using a wand like this, and now I&#x27;m hooked. I use the arch (the butt or back of the curve) on top of my lashes to help with curling them by gently turning the wand (my wrist) away from me (slightly downward at the root and then slightly upward from the middle of my lashes to the end of them), sometimes with a slight jiggle motion. I use the curve (inside) under my lashes by gently jiggling the lashes from the root to end and then by just brushing them up. I use the side of the wand to help give them a fuller and feathery look and to further push my lashes up, lengthening them, sort of. For my lower lash, I use the all side of the wand to create a fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons I noticed with this mascara:&lt;br /&gt;Non-lengthening (I have to try to provide some length to my lashes).&lt;br /&gt;Raccoon eyes (I had a little, very little darkening under my eyes by the end of the day, and this was after sweating).&lt;br /&gt;Though I apply only once throughout the day, others might one to apply more than this, as this is not a long wear (24 hours, not even 12 hours) mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;ve found MY mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a picture of my third time using this mascara. I used the black-brown mascara for subtly, so my lashes aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they would have been had I used the black or very black mascara, however, the effect is still present.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of mascara for years and it&#x27;s perfect for me.  It goes on smoothly and easily and comes off very readily at the end of the day.  If you work outside or in high humidity, I would opt for their waterproof version.  I used to use that when I did work outside but waterproof is also harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara often, but this is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smear, clump or run, that I&#x27;ve been using it every day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRAND it goes on smooth and very easy to apply. It last for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this mascara doesn&#x27;t ever clump!  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I never have a problem with flaking.  I didn&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another tube when I finished up the first one, it&#x27;s that good. 😆  Debi B.</li>
            <li> I had been using L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara to fill out my chemotherapy thinned lashes and it worked well for that. However, too soon it got clumpy and flaky, so I decided to try this. I love it. It defines my lashes and lengthens them well with a little work. Because the formula is dryer than usual, for the first time ever, I can apply mascara on my bottom lashes and it looks natural! Added bonus - it doesn&#x27;t leave dark smudges under my eyes - one of the very few mascaras that don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, and not a single clump or flake. You should try it.</li>
            <li> No major complaints, it is just that I found it impossible to use the brush since it&#x27;s half curved. Just makes it really awkward for me to apply; I&#x27;m sure that is personal preference. The mascara itself seems just fine, but I&#x27;m no connoisseur.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Priced better on Amazon than even Walmart.</li>
            <li> This mascara works ok</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I actually was able to get it cheaper on Amazon, than at my local big box store. Much cheaper when you consider not spending the gas, the headache and the crazy dressed people :)&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, this mascara looks so pretty on. People often ask me if I am wearing false lashes. Umm, nope. Lol! And it really stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> What a nice product!  The Lashblast is easy to apply and the results are appealing--no struggling with refining an application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various CoverGirl mascaras over the years, and when Costco recently stopped selling them in bulk I turned to Amazon. This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Clump Crusher,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m mostly happy. (I&#x27;ve never had clumping issues with other CG mascaras, but whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate a curved brush, so that&#x27;s a big win for this one. The mascara is easy to apply -- just thick enough to coat the lashes and provide a little length, but not so thick that it gets clumpy or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it seems like the brush doesn&#x27;t get fully coated inside the tube of mascara -- I can still see the green color of the bristles where there should actually be brown-black mascara coating it. With my other CG mascaras, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem. It makes me feel like there&#x27;s not enough mascara in this bottle (and this has happened since the first few times I used it). But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be affecting the application, so four stars it is!</li>
            <li> This has been a fabulous investment. Great, great length on the lashes without clumping, far exceeding my expectations. And, to my delight, the wand shape really seems to make a difference. Play around with it and see how the wand is most effective on your lashes!</li>
            <li> It is great as an every day mascara, not too heavy. It is true to its name and goes on clean without clumps, however, it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Does the job I bought it for... however the quality of the mascara has drastically changed in the 2 months that I have used this mascara.... It has dried out and clumps on my lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique, better than any mascara I ever got. However, I still get little chunks.</li>
            <li> wonderful product works good and looks great, doesnt clump up like alot of others... Im in love with it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, runs</li>
            <li> Great mascara! I always love Cover Girl!! I apply a little heavily so there are still some lashes that stick together but I wouldn&#x27;t call them clumps. Great color, lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I only use Covergirl. I don&#x27;t get clumps, or fake looking lashes. I get simply fuller looking, darker, thicker lashes. I like the curve on the wand. It helps get into the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara pretty good.  Stays on well.  I don&#x27;t know that it did anything more special than any other waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> A bit too wet but great-glamorous results!</li>
            <li> Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is). I&#x27;m Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don&#x27;t end up with clumps in the process!</li>
            <li> very thick on the wand. Clumps galore...ugh!  and it makes my eyes itch. Threw it out after two uses.</li>
            <li> best mascara ever owned. guaranteed no clumps. I buy this one every time because it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I decided to try this mascara and it&#x27;s ok.  It has a brush that you&#x27;ve never seen before and you can&#x27;t really tell how much mascara is on the brush, but I expect not much.  I will probably go back to the wet and messy version to accent my eyes better.</li>
            <li> The application is nice and smooth.  There is still a little clumping sometimes, but much less than other products I have tried.  Comes off a lot easier too, so you don&#x27;t feel like you have to pull your lashes out to get them clean.</li>
            <li> it does work well. No clumping issue just the right texture</li>
            <li> No clumps, but it&#x27;s as if there&#x27;s no mascara, either! Barely darkens my lashes, no volume or length.</li>
            <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t get everywhere, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I use CG LashBlash Length Mascara as my first coat, then this clump buster to finish.  I really like the results of the combo.</li>
            <li> I like it. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> For a darker mascara, this is definitely a nice product! I tend to prefer a lighter mascara but this is advertised as being a thicker one so I can&#x27;t say anything about that. It&#x27;s not too dark though! Especially for what I paid here on Amazon, this was a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it for a good deal.  Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be very clumpy.  As soon as I use this up, I am going back to my former mascara, which is also Covergirl.  I don&#x27;t know why they call this a Clump Crusher.</li>
            <li> love the color and brush</li>
            <li> Although this mascara worked rather well, I prefer the end results of a more expensive product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it is great for lengthening, separating and making lashes appear much fulle. I am completely loyal to clump crusher its the only one I will buy from now on. However, the tube I recieved from here was old I would love to return it in exchange for another one.</li>
            <li> I always get so irritated when mascaras clump up so easily...I can&#x27;t afford to buy fancy brands all the time. So this was a relief to find! Not too expensive, but it works quite well. It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look especially full, but it gets the job done, and most importantly, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP! Hallelujah.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, and gives a very natural look. The mascara goes on thin and the brush definitely does not produce clumps. It does not give a bold or thick look (not much volume), but it gives a nice, moderate curl and looks very natural. Great for everyday wear, but maybe use something more exciting for a night-out look.</li>
            <li> I did not think I would like this brush but now I actually prefer it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Clump Crusher&amp;#34;. No, it isn&#x27;t. It came out thick, clumped my lashes together and flaked off all day. It dries quickly so if you use an eyelash brush like I do, you&#x27;d better be quick or you&#x27;ll find yourself combing out eyelash tangles.  Non-clumping masacara--where are you???</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It did not cause any flaking and separates lashes well.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mascara that defines the lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.  (At least I have not had that problem)!</li>
            <li> I love the color, not too dark. And it applies great with the curved brush</li>
            <li> Like Covergirl mascara and I&#x27;m using it now :)))</li>
            <li> I love this product it left my lashes looking amazing. It didn&#x27;t leave any clumping or anything. It applied easy and left my lashes looking great for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion*</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it&#x27;s not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don&#x27;t need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I got the black/brown and it works great! I would definitely buy a second one when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Does not end up under my eyes halfway through the day</li>
            <li> My neighbor introduced me to this mascara. It is really great. I&#x27;m allergic to many eye products and I don&#x27;t have any problem with this. It really does crush the clumps. Magic.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s non clumpy, perfect for everyday use and for nights out. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove. I have darker under eye skin and I hate mascara that stays behind. This comes off after staying on all day.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to find my holy grail mascara.  I have yet to find it, and continue to be disappointed when I try new ones.  I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;I hate clumping, so the name instantly got my attention.  I will say this product does help with clumping issues and there is not too much extra product on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was ok, but not great.  I will definitely use it, but I do not see myself repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Good quality! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but mascara is a must and this product isn&#x27;t clumpy or too thick.</li>
            <li> Looks so natural i got the color in black brown.&lt;br /&gt;It is clump free and great just what i wanted!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t clump like other mascaras do and it curls and lengthens with no effort at all.</li>
            <li> Easy on in the morning, easy off when I wash my face at night. No need for makeup remover. My favorite mascara by far.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to mascara everyday for over a year now. Looks beautiful and natural!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used some expensive and cheap ones!!  It doesn&#x27;t clump!!  It defines almost every lash!!  I&#x27;m in my 60s and have been using Rapid Lash Growth to grow lashes for the past 3 months. Now that I have great lashes, I need a great mascara and this is it!!  Try it!!</li>
            <li> No clumps! The black brown color is really nice</li>
            <li> Got crumbly very quickly. The brush only allows for a tiny amount to go on at a time. It takes like 15 coats to look like a normal 2 coats.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara, as far as normal mascaras go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one isn&#x27;t clumpy at all, so it does what it&#x27;s name says!  I just don&#x27;t like it as far as making my VERY thin, fine eyelashes stand out.  I pair this with the orange Covergirl thickening one and together they do an OK job, still like BUXOM the best!</li>
            <li> I love all the lash blast mascaras. This brush is awesome. I love how it&#x27;s curved. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the black brown color.</li>
            <li> ive tried so many different mascaras and this one is the best. I have long lashes so I can get a decent look with almost anything, if I painted them with black paint id look alright lol but this stuff makes people ask me if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li> This mascara advertises no clumps. It really doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes. I love this color I usually wear blackest black, but this is a nicer shade. I am down to the bottom of the tube and it still isn&#x27;t clumping. I am going to use this again and again.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. Nothing amazing, but it works well for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush. It clumps less than some mascaras but still has some. It is my favorite that I have used so far but still does clump a little which is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product has a great rubber brush, which makes placing color on individual lashes a breeze!  Absolutely no clumping.  It&#x27;s not super volumizing, but lengthens the lashes to my satisfaction.  If you want a more dramatic look, go for the black, but the black brown does a great job of enhancing lashes while still looking fairly natural.</li>
            <li> May favorite go-to mascara. I only wear it occasionally, and I like this because it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Good quality and came on time.</li>
            <li> I still get the lashes unseparated at the ends, making it look like I half as many.  Consistency is good.</li>
            <li> The brown-black color is pretty light, more brown than other mascaras I&#x27;ve used of that color name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t give much volume or thickness at ALL even with a couple coats. Definitely no clumps though!</li>
            <li> Clump crusher? Not so much. I find I get more clumps w this brand</li>
            <li> Gives you nice lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes, but they&#x27;re light at the ends.  I need very little mascara, so I&#x27;ve been search for one that goes on easy and light and does not clump.  This does the trick, and well.  Lasta all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge and easily washes off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw it mentioned in a blog containing info on the best drug-store makeup. This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t clump. You have to follow the directions - use 2 coats, both light, instead of one heavy coat.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> I mean, for the free that I got it for, how can I REALLY complain?</li>
            <li> I really like this mascarra. Its at a great price point, easy to handle easy to appy. It lasted all day and it didnt make my eyes water at all. My lashed looked long and not clumpy! I was really surprised that Covergirl had such a great product and I didnt even know. Its a nice option when you dont want a really pricey brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work great for me</li>
            <li> Works great. Love my lashes.</li>
            <li> Loved it no clumps its light and airy. Didnt have to separate my lashes. It wasnt dramatic which I liked  will purchase again.♡</li>
            <li> As someone who has used Revlon brand mascara for years, I have to say that cover girl is soooo much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the amount that gets on the brush is just perfect. With revlon, there was always way too much mascara when pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it doesn&#x27;t flake at all! It stays on all night with just the right amount of lift that I&#x27;m looking for!</li>
            <li> Written by my wife: This is my very favorite mascara. It has a rather dry consistency. It really separates my lashes and covers all the tiny lashes too. The brush is very stiff and helps to separate even after the second coat.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the purchase, the product came completely dry, I feel cheated, the first time I buy this mascara brand not recommend</li>
            <li> I like the Covergirl mascara line, but I really wish that they would re-engineer their wands...They are too smooth and slick and sometimes slip from your grip. I wish they would put some kind of texture on the wands for gripping purposes.</li>
            <li> It is as good as any when you first use it. Most brands are. The applicator is very good. I may wash it and use it to comb through and separate lashes when the mascara is done.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it won a award for being the best mascara this year but - not so much - too bad I got 2 tubes!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!!!  The way the brush is designed is far better than the usual mascara brush.</li>
            <li> No smudge mascara.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Doesn&#x27;t clump as quickly as some.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  No clumping, no sticky lashes.  Goes on nice and stays on all day.  Would Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I accidentally order two of these. But as they were only $4 with Amazon Prime (WOW!!) I didn&#x27;t really care. I gave the other one to a friend that was looking to try this brand out. I ordered it in black brown because that is the natural color of my lashes and I like to wear this on regular days for a more natural and less dramatic look. No clumps. I ALWAYS had a problem with that because I wouldn&#x27;t put it on right the first time and would try to correct it until my lases were in three big clumps and i&#x27;d just have to wash it off and start all over again. But no more.</li>
            <li> I am becoming a mascara junkie.  I have been in search for something that lengthens my invisible eyelashes without being a clumpy mess.  This mascara does a great job of not clumping.  I don&#x27;t think a mascara will ever give me the length I want, but at least this stays on and doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara, doesn&#x27;t run or clump. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and NO CLUMPS!  I was so tired of mascara that left globs on my upper lids and my lashes stuck together.  I do need to apply two coats to get enough color (brown-black).</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will buy in the future</li>
            <li> I really liked how easy this mascara was to apply. It even lasted longer than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love the brush on this Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara! It&#x27;s just the right size to apply the mascara to my eye lashes and not have it smudge on my lids! The color is great and it lasts all day! A+++ Recommendation!</li>
            <li> I love my Covergirl mascara and have purchased this one many times! I personally love the rubber bristles and think they make it a lot easier, faster and has your lashes looking perfectly separated. The color was perfect for myself and always go with the darkest black. I also love that they use bright colors for the container itself because its cute and makes it a lot easier to find in a crazy makeup bag :)</li>
            <li> I love the cover girl mascara! It seperates your lashes so they aren&#x27;t spider lashes! Cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascaras, but the Clump Crusher is one of the best!  It separates my lashes beautifully and distributes lots of colour with no clumping.  I bought it in brown/black.  I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitivities, I highly recommend sticking with a product you already know and use on a regular basis. It caused severe eye irritation for me. Other than that it was a decent product. I had to reapply once throughout the day of use. Easy to apply (if you know what you&#x27;re doing). It&#x27;s a good color, I prefer black, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It doesn&#x27;t brush off and leave flecks on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump or feel heavy, but my lashes look great!</li>
            <li> I really like it...It&#x27;s a nice product..recommend it!</li>
            <li> Goes on clump free and smooth</li>
            <li> I always have a tube of the brown/black on hand &amp; use it daily. No flakes or clumps or smudges or spider lashes, stays put until I wash it off *without any special remover*. Great mascara.</li>
            <li> Maybelline always has the best mascara. This is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is great mascara.  I have stopped using my other mascaras in favor of this one, and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Love the price.</li>
            <li> I always end up coming back to this mascara. The brush is awesome, no clumping. Volume building potential is great. Not too much length power. I like black/brown for a less dramatic everyday look. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love the lashblast mascara line and this one is very nice. I love the brush and it does not clump. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, easy to remove at night, nice color. Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I confess. I bought this because I caught an Amazon coupon. I figured it would not live up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;I have two favorite mascaras that I&#x27;ve used for years. One is expensive but worth every penny, &#x27;Diorshow&#x27; by Dior, the other is dirt cheap but beloved by many (including me!), &#x27;Great Lash&#x27; by Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diorshow is about as perfect a mascara as can be had. Great Lash, in the iconic pink and green tube, gives super volume but clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How would Covergirl&#x27;s &#x27;Clump Crusher&#x27; compare? Well, it is smack dab between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump. No more using a needle to separate your lashes after a coat of mascara. Not as lash lengthening as Dior, but only by a hair....errr....eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;It also resists the smudges we are all familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a value priced every day mascara, this is great stuff!</li>
            <li> great mascara would purchase again</li>
            <li> Eye popping clump free because of how the silicone brushes made.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star rating because goes on smoothly but it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look as long as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new to makeup and this is great. It doesn&#x27;t clump and my lashes look great.</li>
