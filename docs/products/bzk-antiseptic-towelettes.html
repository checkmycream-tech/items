            <li>The best to use.</li>
            <li>The best part about them is they don&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>However, the company that distributes this product is great for shipping response!</li>
            <li>Win, win, win, and win!</li>
            <li>Great wipes.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for their usage and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if the product is any good yet, but the shipping method leaves a lot to be desired.  </li>
            <li>great product love it.</li>
            <li>These things are the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Large moist towelettes, a great alcohol substitute.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should think about using some more sturdy packaging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay a buck or two more for the box to arrive intact.</li>
            <li>Great for camping and keeping in the car for a quick clean-up or to use to clean wounds</li>
            <li>Some research suggests that BZK is a better skin anesthetic.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>These are in more of a foil</li>
            <li>It seems that there is nowhere to get the authentic PGI wipes, but I like even the Hygea ones better than these Dynarex ones.</li>
            <li>Super handy to have around at home.  </li>
            <li>These are much better than any free ones you will get.</li>
            <li>These are great and much better than most commercial grade towelettes.</li>
            <li>Tear rather easily</li>
            <li>Consistency and Quality are important with antiseptics.</li>
            <li>effective and easy to open</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh every time..</li>
            <li>Great product...when I get ready to order again I will be ordering from the same vendor.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack and use in many different applications.</li>
            <li>This way, when my toddler gets scraped up it&#x27;s much easier to use these to clean it off than an alcohol based wipe.</li>
            <li>These are nice and big, so they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li>I use these to make sure things stay as germ-free as possible.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what Amazon Caveat says: &amp;#34;Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>They unfold without tearing, have plenty of moisture, near oder free.  </li>
            <li>I can see why there had been so many complaints about the last brand I had used.</li>
            <li>There was no discernible odor, the size made the towelettes very easy to handle, easy to open packaging, and last but not least - the price was right.  </li>
            <li>They are very moist, don&#x27;t sting or burn my mom and each come sealed in its own little pouch for sanitation.</li>
            <li>They are very moist.</li>
            <li>These are large, very wet, and work great for skinned knees or other cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and a decent price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for some personal first aid kits I was making for the family!</li>
            <li>The BZ Chloride is great for wound care and zit care actually, but this is a little too watered down.</li>
            <li>The product had the exact same Amazon Item #, so be aware that Amazon probably uses a FIFO system for &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; items, products with the same relative specifications.  </li>
            <li>All marked Reorder</li>
            <li>My second purchase of this supposed product was not identical to the first order, placed about three months earlier.  </li>
            <li>More irritating than anything.</li>
            <li>The individual packaging is thicker and sturdier than the former brand I&#x27;d been using, and, unlike the other brand, the packets were lined up in rows of three, very neatly packaged.</li>

            <li> I take these packets everywhere. Easy to pack and use in many different applications.</li>
            <li> These are nice and big, so they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li> If you need these you know what you are looking for. These are quality wipes that do not tear. These are much better than any free ones you will get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to UTI&#x27;s. I use these to make sure things stay as germ-free as possible. They&#x27;ve been a big help.</li>
            <li> The best to use. does not sting.. Clean and fresh every time.. Take them any where.. Fits in small spaces</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if the product is any good yet, but the shipping method leaves a lot to be desired.  It arrived in a broken usps envelope.  The box containing the towelettes was also broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towelettes inside look okay, but it&#x27;s sad that I bought these to put into first-aid kits to prevent infections and they are already \\&quot;compromised\\&quot;.  Time will tell if they work as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller should think about using some more sturdy packaging.  I&#x27;d pay a buck or two more for the box to arrive intact.</li>
            <li> Great for camping and keeping in the car for a quick clean-up or to use to clean wounds</li>
            <li> Large moist towelettes, a great alcohol substitute.  Some research suggests that BZK is a better skin anesthetic.  Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Great product...when I get ready to order again I will be ordering from the same vendor. This is a needed personal item that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this supposed product was not identical to the first order, placed about three months earlier.  The product had the exact same Amazon Item #, so be aware that Amazon probably uses a FIFO system for &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; items, products with the same relative specifications.  Perhaps, to blame Amazon is inaccurate as both shipments were from different sources and may have contained outdated product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what Amazon Caveat says: &amp;#34;Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.&amp;#34;  (Their ASN # B0057Z24WK)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One or two pads out of ten is barely moist or too dry to use--a problem if counting out a number for travel: A lesson learned!  There are no date codes on either the box or the individual packets.  All marked Reorder No. 1303, Lot #2805833.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order and try a different brand--Consistency and Quality are important with antiseptics.</li>
            <li> These are great and much better than most commercial grade towelettes.</li>
            <li> Tear rather easily and I found I can buy them at my local medical supply store for only $2.75 for the same 100 box.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for some personal first aid kits I was making for the family!</li>
            <li> These things are the absolute best.  Super handy to have around at home.  The best part about them is they don&#x27;t sting.  This way, when my toddler gets scraped up it&#x27;s much easier to use these to clean it off than an alcohol based wipe.</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars for one reason. One out of every 7-8 is bone dry upon opening the individual package. Otherwise a great product! More irritating than anything.</li>
            <li> Great wipes. They are very moist.</li>
            <li> excellent product. effective and easy to open</li>
            <li> great product love it.</li>
            <li> Great product! These are large, very wet, and work great for skinned knees or other cuts and scrapes. I recommended them to everyone in my CPR/First Aid class when I re-certified recently.</li>
            <li> I have used these PDI wipes for 2 years for cleaning before self cathetering, for cleaning (male) body parts and hands.  Haven&#x27;t had an infection yet.  They unfold without tearing, have plenty of moisture, near oder free.  I have tried \\&quot;dynarex\\&quot; brand, which tear to pieces when trying to unfold.  Can&#x27;t us alcohol.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for their usage and I am pleased. They are very moist, don&#x27;t sting or burn my mom and each come sealed in its own little pouch for sanitation. Use one and toss it! Highly recommend and a decent price too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> Some of the wipes come in paper-like packaging.  These are in more of a foil so they last longer.  i&#x27;m a little disappointed with the new way they manufacture but still good.</li>
            <li> Between me, my husband and our dog we&#x27;re always dinging or bashing something. I keep these, along with triple antibiotic ointment and sting stuff, in my purse/the cars/the boat/the dog&#x27;s go bag -- everywhere we may need them. Don&#x27;t leave home without them!</li>
            <li> We use these for catherizations while traveling. The individual packaging is thicker and sturdier than the former brand I&#x27;d been using, and, unlike the other brand, the packets were lined up in rows of three, very neatly packaged. I can see why there had been so many complaints about the last brand I had used. These towelettes are also thicker and seem bigger. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this one again!</li>
            <li> These wipes are NOT PDI wipes.  They are not even the Hygea wipes that replaced the PDI wipes.  They are very dry and small and pretty much useless.  It seems that there is nowhere to get the authentic PGI wipes, but I like even the Hygea ones better than these Dynarex ones.</li>
            <li> My bad, I thought these would be more antiseptic concentrated products, not just for hand-cleaning. The BZ Chloride is great for wound care and zit care actually, but this is a little too watered down.</li>
            <li> We needed to use these before post-surgical dressing changes - had to have a non-alcohol product because of my respiratory problems.  There was no discernible odor, the size made the towelettes very easy to handle, easy to open packaging, and last but not least - the price was right.  Win, win, win, and win!</li>
            <li> The last two boxes of this product were not the usual standard.  The die cut perforations are very poor and must use a scissors to separate the individual packages.  However, the company that distributes this product is great for shipping response!</li>
