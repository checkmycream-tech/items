            <li> The only negative thing is the tank is small and has to be refilled often.</li>
            <li> no machine oil, although the tank can be hard to get off regardless</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as stated</li>

            <li> Delivery was quick, two days from California to Texas...... Genuine product, not a clone. BIG CLOUDS EXCELLENT FLAVOR!!!</li>

            <li> Love it, great sub ohm tank.</li>
            <li> By far one of the best Sub ohm tank based atomizer. Aspire really nailed it, my wife loves it and swapping coils is so easy a monkey could do it.  I started with this atomizer + 5ml replacement , now on the dripper but this is my go to when I&#x27;m driving on long road trips and cant safely drip.</li>
            <li> Perfect I always dreamed I would get a better tank and the aspire made it happen.</li>
            <li> Awesome buy, exactly what I wanted, and exactly as described</li>
            <li> Love everything about this works very well definitely satisfied</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than expected.  Good price.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> All was as described. Great product!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRICE! IT IS ONLY A $30 TANK. U CAN GET THE TANK &amp; BATTERY FOR $75. SEARCH PEOPLE!</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping 100% authentic aspire sub ohm tank will be ordering again when they get the V2</li>
            <li> Awsome tank fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this tank.  The wheel that allows the multiple airflow can get in the way when trying to remove the whole tank.  However,  this produces great vapor and great flavor.  It&#x27;s the subohm experience while not having to build coils.  Coils last me around 2 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t had any other subohm tanks but I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment! Excellent tank! Thank you</li>
            <li> Authentic tank with great flavor. The only negative thing is the tank is small and has to be refilled often. I picked up a 5ml tank and now it holds a lot more juice.</li>
            <li> Great tank gets the job done spits tons of clouds</li>
            <li> Of all the tanks I have, this one by far is my absolute most favorite!</li>
            <li> very quick delivery! authentic aspire atlantis, big clouds, great quality! no machine oil, although the tank can be hard to get off regardless if you tighten it too much. you do need to refill it often, so keep that i mind. a full tank and being chained vaped (hit over and over again) will last you about 30 minutes. if your mot chain vaping it will last you much longer!</li>
