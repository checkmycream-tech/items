            <li>My skin has never felt better!</li>
            <li>I was given this product by Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are my own! :)</li>
            <li>or so i saw more bright supple skin.</li>
            <li>Light feeling cream that provides great moisture.</li>
            <li>I must admit, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I sometimes could not even wear eyeshadow, and it&#x27;s amazing how well this has helped.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely with no greasy/lotiony feel or shine.</li>
            <li>I get an uneasy feeling about what kind of chemicals I&#x27;m putting  on my skin.</li>
            <li>nice for summer not greacy</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my face feel so nice and hydrated, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>and she also has my kind of skin type</li>
            <li>It also balances my skin tone out quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I have kind of&lt;br /&gt;sensitive</li>
            <li>Kind of smells a bit like Ponds moisturizer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- pleasant light scent and consistency</li>
            <li>Feels light and silky and has the best fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li>Love most of Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li>My most favorite Neutrogena product yet!</li>
            <li>Like this product a lot,  very light and smells nice</li>
            <li>I loved that this product did not leave my face dry or too oily but with the perfect amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>and before I go to bed at night, and for the first time in years I have felt like my skin is really happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great and innovative, new product!!!</li>
            <li>Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I had more pimples this morning than I ever had even at the height of puberty.</li>
            <li>I should of known better.</li>
            <li>The price of the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>received the bottle from influenster complementary and tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>But many skin care products use it (including Olay)</li>
            <li>overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this in many ways: alone, with serums, with oil, under moisturizer, and over day creams.</li>
            <li>And hooooooboy do I love it.</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>, sure.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Most hyaluronic acid serums are meant to be used in combination with a lotion.</li>
            <li>If you like Clinque Moisture Surge you will love this.</li>
            <li>I will order more</li>
            <li>Lotions &amp; creams were melting off in the warmth, but this gel is much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing and not like a cream or any gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>at all over all ok</li>
            <li>I reviewed this product for Influenster and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a faithful cera ve user but don&#x27;t love the consistency.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I so love this product on my skin.</li>
            <li>Feels so refreshing</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that this cream is not oily!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I dont see a change in my skin</li>
            <li>My completion never looked better</li>
            <li>really refreshing.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you get the GEL CREAM...</li>
            <li>This one nourishes your skin more and you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking shiny.</li>
            <li>Much better than creams.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Cannot beat the price it works better than $100 face creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>top of working</li>
            <li>and I love the jar.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Refreshingly hydrating</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly; I love the texture.</li>
            <li>and I truly love using this product.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>, my skin is beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li>I got this product through Influentster in a voxbox and was SO excited to try it!</li>
            <li>Goes on nice, i like the consistency of the gel cream, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Excellent on winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought the gel and it worked great, but because I have mature skin I used to put moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been lucky to have pretty great skin, not a ton of breakouts</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on brand name creams, but this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used at night.  </li>
            <li>It lightly moisturizes and is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>I believe she would give this 5 stars, but I am giving 4 since it isn&#x27;t breastfeeding &amp;#34;safe.&amp;#34; For full transparency, I had the opportunity to test this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>So if there are concerns about smell or sensitive skin, the gel cream would be a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how light weight it feels</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however, this opinion is my own</li>
            <li>The smell was not too strong but it smelled clean and refreshing like a beach or a spa.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and fresh, nothing</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it goes on so smoothly and makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is delightful, and reasonably-priced enough that it seems worth it to buy another tub when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>If scent is too strong (or I don&#x27;t like it, period)</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful that I was able to test this product and be able to help more viewers with this product.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>For some women it may work just fine.</li>
            <li>how well it works - noticeable difference in skin texture and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a jar that was like 3 times this size because I seem to go through it so quickly!</li>
            <li>It goes on really light and mostly absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>really feels great on your skin and makes it very smooth and soft....</li>
            <li>It costs more but it is def worth it.</li>
            <li>leaves face feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try :3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight,</li>
            <li>Maybe the gel does have a perfume in it, but the gel cream is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Feels great, especially after the sun.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the formula of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>This product is not fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free for testing from Influencer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it feels light and non-greasy</li>
            <li>and after I apply it my face feels smooth .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth self.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>while I admire the clever marketing, I can’t say that I’m impressed with the actual product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light on my skin while keeping my face moisturized the whole day!</li>
            <li>I liked the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, but it did not work on my dry skin as well as the Night Cream did (that stuff works great, night or day - haha).  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong fragrance in the jar, but it quickly dissipates after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I was chosen to receive this from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I received a free full size jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel from Influenster about two months ago</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>the original and for extra-dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells like clean water and reminds me of the scent from Bath and Body Works called Dancing Waters.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This product promises that it is light, and soak in quickly-</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>We all noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>much better, much cheaper.</li>
            <li>That is a good ingredient since studies show that applied topically</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>The container is quite bulky for the amount of product, but I have enjoyed the gel-cream so much that I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>You can really tell that your skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Also, it does have a smell, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out, but after doing some research, I discovered the main ingredient, hyaluronic acid, isn&#x27;t breastfeeding safe.</li>
            <li>I honestly could not write a strong enough review for this cream.</li>
            <li>It also has a very clean smell, which I really like.</li>
            <li>The best part is that one dot about the size of a fingernail is enough to moisturize the entire face and even the neck if you stretch it.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and absorbs without being sticky.</li>
            <li>my face has been super</li>
            <li>The gel does not leave your face greasy like most of them normally do.</li>
            <li>Although I have used other brands of gels with hyaluronic acid,  this one, by far, has turned out to be the best for me.</li>
            <li>Pretty much no scent --- very important for face creams.  </li>
            <li>It is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster and Neutrogena, I got to try this full size product for free.</li>
            <li>Safe on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>it really softens those fine lines and moisturizes the skin..  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy and feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin, comparable to clinique moisturizing gel!</li>
            <li>For me personally, the extra-dry skin worked way better than the original, which is why I ended up buying the full size.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product is ideal for a light wash of hydration, but not a deep drink for VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and since it is 16th of 19 listed ingredients (11th in Olay) I don’t know that there is enough here to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this product complimentary of influenster, and im</li>
            <li>so if your looking for something for all skin types, especially oily, that feels good and not one  bit greasy or makes your face sweat more, especially in Florida heat, you found it!!</li>
            <li>I wish it was offered in a larger container as I have found that it also works beautifully on my hands so I have been using a little more</li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>right by your nose.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>This has improved my face with the use of my Clarisonic as it leaves my skin clean and ready to soak up the product.</li>
            <li>This particular moisturizer I like because it has a watery light texture</li>
            <li>The cream rehydrates my dry skin without clogging my pores, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Very soothing and cool....</li>
            <li>This is a fairly light cream and can’t say my skin felt particularly moisturized even immediately after first use.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and leaves no trace, just soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel it soaking in quickly and locking in the moisture.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li>as I think I&#x27;ll need that come winter, but this feels fantastic and keeps me moisturized throughout my day so far!</li>
            <li>If HA is your main concern, I would just get a bottle of readily available pure HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I had tried many other remedies with no appreciable results except my wallet becoming much lighter.</li>
            <li>It may be great for others with dry but not very dry skin but for me it did nothing.</li>
            <li>5 stars because it does exactly what the label says.</li>
            <li>and my skin is incredibly smooth, hydrated, and baby soft.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty.</li>
            <li>and it was more than enough to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>the blue color and ads with lots of water make you think “moisture, moisture, moisture” :)  </li>
            <li>My favorite way so far is under my day cream as a light wash to add extra moisture</li>
            <li>no white plastic layer on top of cream inside lid.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Neutrogena finally is selling it here in the States.  </li>
            <li>It did moisturize my skin, which felt smooth and soft, and plumped.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, cooling and moisturizing all for a very low price.</li>
            <li>After a week of using this the scars are mostly invisible, the tiny wrinkles are gone and the shadows under my eyes that it didn&#x27;t advertise to help with are GONE!</li>
            <li>First moisture that does not make me sweat.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t feel greasy after putting it on, and can put makeup on shortly after applying.</li>
            <li>but if I wet my face I can kind of feel it still on there somehow.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it, it felt like putting ocean water on my face without the saltiness.</li>
            <li>I became interested in using gel-based moisturizers when I tried Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief&amp;#34; - however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out over $20 per container.</li>
            <li>nice but not much difference to the skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is important for people like me who have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This gel clearly didn&#x27;t banish my acne, but it did make my skin feel super soft and smooth - after the first use!</li>
            <li>Already tried the hydro-gel, like hydro cream better, fragrance free, slightly thicker texture than hydro-gel and hydrate skin well without break out.</li>
            <li>Very soft and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li>I bought the gel cream, and this actually works better than a lot of the high end products I was using before!</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the gel-cream for extra dry skin and was told by neutrogena that they had to change one of the ingredients and it will be just as effective as the original.  </li>
            <li>Quick dry and makes skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Very clever packaging-</li>
            <li>I used to use cetaphil for my dry skin but it did make my skin more oily.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really strong for a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Like that this one feels a little more substantial but still absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So I made a special trip to the store for Olay which will last until my next subscribe and save delivery from Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I have yet to check the ingredients on Ewg.org- Skindeep to see exactly what it is I&#x27;m putting on my face, but I think if that checks out, this is my new summer moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and I have been using it every day since in place of my normal clean and clear lotion routine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s greaseless, orderless, light and the next morning</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I’ve used just about every one available and have settled on Eucerin Smoothing Repair for body and have used Olay Micro sculpting as my facial moisturizer for years.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry/sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Thanks to Prime&lt;br /&gt;I can save myself a trip to store which is often out of product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li>Really hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really is dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>he said they really like this product &amp; they</li>
            <li>moisturizing, fast aborb</li>
            <li>Caused a face break out and really clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I also have very dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li>I do not blame anyone for  giving it a try after reading this because it is cheap enough but if money is not an issue try something else.</li>
            <li>Works very well for added moisture</li>
            <li>I started using this when I was on a BP regimen for my acne, and it really helped to counter the dryness that the BP caused.</li>
            <li>My skin is more dry than oily, and I also live in the deep-deep south.</li>
            <li>The smell in the container is strong, but not unpleasant - just different, and possibly the smell you&#x27;d expect from a product that is gel - not oil - based.</li>
            <li>Unlike other &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; that just sit on top of your skin, this has hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend adding oil, it really gives no benefit and seems to break it down more than</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super dry skin, but I feel like this is gentle and plumps up my skin when I use it!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this, less than two days before my flakies were no longer around.</li>
            <li>main selling point here seems to be the fact that it contains hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, I ended up going to a local store to buy some more of the Deep Moisture Night Cream.  </li>
            <li>Great at moisturizing my oily sensitive skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is perfect to use as a primer under the makeup as it feels the same as the expensive primer from S******X.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this brand of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for a moisturizing product bearing the Neutrogena name.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was excited as I suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle smell, absorbs very fast cant say enough about it!!</li>
            <li>This item I will continue to use as It&#x27;s gentle for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have noticed that I haven&#x27;t gotten my normal monthly break outs since I have been using this</li>
            <li>It states that this is for extra dry skin, but I think it would be ok for everyone except the truly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is generally on the dry end of the spectrum and this lotion really quenched my skin quickly and lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>Pro beauty tip: Apply it to damp skin (right after the shower) to give an extra boost of moisture.</li>
            <li>I live in the Arizona desert and try everything I can to keep my skin moisturized</li>
            <li>Living in the desert, I’m a patsy for new moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always cautious and worried about trying new products.</li>
            <li>my new moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quickly healed severely dry skin, in three days.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always concerned when I try a new product.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And the last thing I want on a hot Summer day is a face as shiny as a new penny.</li>
            <li>I do not usually do reviews</li>
            <li>I wake up to even toned, plump, soft skin!  </li>
            <li>I was thinking, &amp;#34;no way is this going to moisturize my skin.&amp;#34; However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li>I have been using Ponds Dry Skin Cream for many years and have never decided to try anything else because Ponds works on my dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s SUPER dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida near the gulf coast aka, humidity capital of the world.  </li>
            <li>Since it is in the gel format, it sinks into the skin quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the formula for normal skin, the water gel, and after several night&#x27;s use, I really can say I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and you only need a little dab here and there.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily forehead and nose, but right around the edges of my mouth and on my cheeks, it can get so dry that I flake.</li>
            <li>I wake up and my skin is replenished and baby soft.  </li>
            <li>I was completely surprised</li>
            <li>/&gt;- unimpressive ingredient list (i.e. the hyaluronic acid [sodium hyaluronate on the list] is near</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used the neutrogena wipes in the hydrating formula, the scent is nearly identical.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t use..</li>
            <li>Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>I have used oils and various moisturizing products, and I really like this one a lot.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doesnt irritate at all - i have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year looking 60 year old</li>
            <li>Non greasy, can be applied directly around eyes.</li>
            <li>Using this product helped to keep its natural moisture without getting too oily.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so supple and soft.</li>
            <li>I have a face cream drawer filled with products that I used a few times</li>
            <li>But it turns out the amount of active ingredients is too low for it to be effective and the other stuff is not anything to write home about.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like slathering moisturiser all over my face because it tends to feel like too much gunk on my face, and never completely soaks in.</li>
            <li>No breakouts with either one, both absorb quickly, but the gel-cream dries a little bit shinier than the gel.</li>
            <li>I really dislike the other similar water gel style of this cream which has a very perfumey scent.</li>
            <li>I love the fact you only need a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li>Since I previously had to use a heavy cream, it was brutal during summer months when I would sweat, so I&#x27;m excited to be able to use an effective product this summer!</li>
            <li>Although I probably need extra dry, I got it mainly because its Fragrance-free, Oil-Free, Dye-free, which the normal water gel doesnt list.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena go back to the old ingredients!</li>
            <li>First off, pay attention to which one you buy -- there are two and the gel-cream is fragrance-free, while the other is not.</li>
            <li>so even though the price is a little on the high side, it lasts for long enough to be worth it!</li>
            <li>And the next morning my face didn’t feel soft and moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li>YOUR FACE FEELS SILKY SOFT THE ENTIRE DAY.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 71 years old and recently my face etc.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;It totally makes my face soft &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Neutrogena Hydro Boost holds up the higher end serums (I was spending $50+ previously).</li>
            <li>But I live in a dry climate and needed something just like this.</li>
            <li>Because I live in Colorado and with this bipolar weather my face has been so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I also seem to be going through it much faster than other facial lotions.</li>
            <li>(Minus the normal pms simpletons)</li>
            <li>my skin is very dry, it will sting a bit to my skin, but it also leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I can totally recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and now in the harshness of winter</li>
            <li>If you have dry sensitive skin &amp; want odorless</li>
            <li>Dry sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizer in the evening to balance the harsh ingredients in my daily face wash (Dr. Brandt&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pores No More&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, break-out prone skin and this product leaves my skin hydrated and fresh without irritating it or causing break outs.</li>

            <li> This stuff makes my face feel so nice and hydrated, without feeling greasy.</li>

            <li> It also balances my skin tone out quite nicely.</li>

            <li> This is a great and innovative, new product!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I had more pimples this morning than I ever had even at the height of puberty.</li>
            <li> I should of known better.</li>
            <li> The price of the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> received the bottle from influenster complementary and tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> But many skin care products use it (including Olay)</li>
            <li> overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this in many ways: alone, with serums, with oil, under moisturizer, and over day creams.</li>
            <li> And hooooooboy do I love it.</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> , sure.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Most hyaluronic acid serums are meant to be used in combination with a lotion.</li>
            <li> If you like Clinque Moisture Surge you will love this.</li>
            <li> I will order more</li>
            <li> Lotions &amp; creams were melting off in the warmth, but this gel is much better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing and not like a cream or any gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> at all over all ok</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a faithful cera ve user but don&#x27;t love the consistency.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I so love this product on my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels so refreshing</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that this cream is not oily!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I dont see a change in my skin</li>

            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you get the GEL CREAM...</li>
            <li> This one nourishes your skin more and you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Much better than creams.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price it works better than $100 face creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> top of working</li>
            <li> and I love the jar.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Refreshingly hydrating</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly; I love the texture.</li>
            <li> and I truly love using this product.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> , my skin is beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li> I got this product through Influentster in a voxbox and was SO excited to try it!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice, i like the consistency of the gel cream, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent on winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought the gel and it worked great, but because I have mature skin I used to put moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky to have pretty great skin, not a ton of breakouts</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on brand name creams, but this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used at night.  </li>
            <li> It lightly moisturizes and is quite refreshing.</li>
            <li> I believe she would give this 5 stars, but I am giving 4 since it isn&#x27;t breastfeeding &amp;#34;safe.&amp;#34; For full transparency, I had the opportunity to test this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> So if there are concerns about smell or sensitive skin, the gel cream would be a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how light weight it feels</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however, this opinion is my own</li>
            <li> The smell was not too strong but it smelled clean and refreshing like a beach or a spa.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light and fresh, nothing</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it goes on so smoothly and makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is delightful, and reasonably-priced enough that it seems worth it to buy another tub when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> If scent is too strong (or I don&#x27;t like it, period)</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful that I was able to test this product and be able to help more viewers with this product.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> For some women it may work just fine.</li>
            <li> how well it works - noticeable difference in skin texture and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a jar that was like 3 times this size because I seem to go through it so quickly!</li>
            <li> It goes on really light and mostly absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> really feels great on your skin and makes it very smooth and soft....</li>
            <li> It costs more but it is def worth it.</li>
            <li> leaves face feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try :3</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight,</li>
            <li> Maybe the gel does have a perfume in it, but the gel cream is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Feels great, especially after the sun.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the formula of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> This product is not fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free for testing from Influencer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it feels light and non-greasy</li>
            <li> and after I apply it my face feels smooth .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth self.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> while I admire the clever marketing, I can’t say that I’m impressed with the actual product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light on my skin while keeping my face moisturized the whole day!</li>
            <li> I liked the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, but it did not work on my dry skin as well as the Night Cream did (that stuff works great, night or day - haha).  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong fragrance in the jar, but it quickly dissipates after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was chosen to receive this from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel from Influenster about two months ago</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> the original and for extra-dry skin.</li>
            <li> It smells like clean water and reminds me of the scent from Bath and Body Works called Dancing Waters.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product promises that it is light, and soak in quickly-</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> We all noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> much better, much cheaper.</li>
            <li> That is a good ingredient since studies show that applied topically</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> The container is quite bulky for the amount of product, but I have enjoyed the gel-cream so much that I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> You can really tell that your skin is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Also, it does have a smell, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it out, but after doing some research, I discovered the main ingredient, hyaluronic acid, isn&#x27;t breastfeeding safe.</li>
            <li> I honestly could not write a strong enough review for this cream.</li>
            <li> It also has a very clean smell, which I really like.</li>
            <li> The best part is that one dot about the size of a fingernail is enough to moisturize the entire face and even the neck if you stretch it.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and absorbs without being sticky.</li>
            <li> my face has been super</li>
            <li> The gel does not leave your face greasy like most of them normally do.</li>
            <li> Although I have used other brands of gels with hyaluronic acid,  this one, by far, has turned out to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty much no scent --- very important for face creams.  </li>
            <li> It is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster and Neutrogena, I got to try this full size product for free.</li>
            <li> Safe on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> it really softens those fine lines and moisturizes the skin..  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy and feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin, comparable to clinique moisturizing gel!</li>
            <li> For me personally, the extra-dry skin worked way better than the original, which is why I ended up buying the full size.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product is ideal for a light wash of hydration, but not a deep drink for VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> and since it is 16th of 19 listed ingredients (11th in Olay) I don’t know that there is enough here to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary of influenster, and im</li>
            <li> so if your looking for something for all skin types, especially oily, that feels good and not one  bit greasy or makes your face sweat more, especially in Florida heat, you found it!!</li>
            <li> I wish it was offered in a larger container as I have found that it also works beautifully on my hands so I have been using a little more</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> right by your nose.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  </li>
            <li> This has improved my face with the use of my Clarisonic as it leaves my skin clean and ready to soak up the product.</li>
            <li> This particular moisturizer I like because it has a watery light texture</li>
            <li> The cream rehydrates my dry skin without clogging my pores, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Very soothing and cool....</li>
            <li> This is a fairly light cream and can’t say my skin felt particularly moisturized even immediately after first use.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and leaves no trace, just soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel it soaking in quickly and locking in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping.</li>
            <li> as I think I&#x27;ll need that come winter, but this feels fantastic and keeps me moisturized throughout my day so far!</li>
            <li> If HA is your main concern, I would just get a bottle of readily available pure HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I had tried many other remedies with no appreciable results except my wallet becoming much lighter.</li>
            <li> It may be great for others with dry but not very dry skin but for me it did nothing.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it does exactly what the label says.</li>
            <li> and my skin is incredibly smooth, hydrated, and baby soft.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty.</li>
            <li> and it was more than enough to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> the blue color and ads with lots of water make you think “moisture, moisture, moisture” :)  </li>
            <li> My favorite way so far is under my day cream as a light wash to add extra moisture</li>
            <li> no white plastic layer on top of cream inside lid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad Neutrogena finally is selling it here in the States.  </li>
            <li> It did moisturize my skin, which felt smooth and soft, and plumped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, cooling and moisturizing all for a very low price.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this the scars are mostly invisible, the tiny wrinkles are gone and the shadows under my eyes that it didn&#x27;t advertise to help with are GONE!</li>
            <li> First moisture that does not make me sweat.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t feel greasy after putting it on, and can put makeup on shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> but if I wet my face I can kind of feel it still on there somehow.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it felt like putting ocean water on my face without the saltiness.</li>
            <li> I became interested in using gel-based moisturizers when I tried Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief&amp;#34; - however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out over $20 per container.</li>
            <li> nice but not much difference to the skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is important for people like me who have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This gel clearly didn&#x27;t banish my acne, but it did make my skin feel super soft and smooth - after the first use!</li>
            <li> Already tried the hydro-gel, like hydro cream better, fragrance free, slightly thicker texture than hydro-gel and hydrate skin well without break out.</li>
            <li> Very soft and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li> I bought the gel cream, and this actually works better than a lot of the high end products I was using before!</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the gel-cream for extra dry skin and was told by neutrogena that they had to change one of the ingredients and it will be just as effective as the original.  </li>
            <li> Quick dry and makes skin feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very clever packaging-</li>
            <li> I used to use cetaphil for my dry skin but it did make my skin more oily.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really strong for a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like that this one feels a little more substantial but still absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So I made a special trip to the store for Olay which will last until my next subscribe and save delivery from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I have yet to check the ingredients on Ewg.org- Skindeep to see exactly what it is I&#x27;m putting on my face, but I think if that checks out, this is my new summer moisturizer!</li>
            <li> and I have been using it every day since in place of my normal clean and clear lotion routine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s greaseless, orderless, light and the next morning</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I’ve used just about every one available and have settled on Eucerin Smoothing Repair for body and have used Olay Micro sculpting as my facial moisturizer for years.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry/sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thanks to Prime&lt;br /&gt;I can save myself a trip to store which is often out of product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and this really takes care of it.</li>
            <li> Really hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really is dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> he said they really like this product &amp; they</li>
            <li> moisturizing, fast aborb</li>
            <li> Caused a face break out and really clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I also have very dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I do not blame anyone for  giving it a try after reading this because it is cheap enough but if money is not an issue try something else.</li>
            <li> Works very well for added moisture</li>
            <li> I started using this when I was on a BP regimen for my acne, and it really helped to counter the dryness that the BP caused.</li>
            <li> My skin is more dry than oily, and I also live in the deep-deep south.</li>
            <li> The smell in the container is strong, but not unpleasant - just different, and possibly the smell you&#x27;d expect from a product that is gel - not oil - based.</li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; that just sit on top of your skin, this has hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend adding oil, it really gives no benefit and seems to break it down more than</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super dry skin, but I feel like this is gentle and plumps up my skin when I use it!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this, less than two days before my flakies were no longer around.</li>
            <li> main selling point here seems to be the fact that it contains hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, I ended up going to a local store to buy some more of the Deep Moisture Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> Great at moisturizing my oily sensitive skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect to use as a primer under the makeup as it feels the same as the expensive primer from S******X.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this brand of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for a moisturizing product bearing the Neutrogena name.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was excited as I suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle smell, absorbs very fast cant say enough about it!!</li>
            <li> This item I will continue to use as It&#x27;s gentle for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have noticed that I haven&#x27;t gotten my normal monthly break outs since I have been using this</li>
            <li> It states that this is for extra dry skin, but I think it would be ok for everyone except the truly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is generally on the dry end of the spectrum and this lotion really quenched my skin quickly and lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> Pro beauty tip: Apply it to damp skin (right after the shower) to give an extra boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> I live in the Arizona desert and try everything I can to keep my skin moisturized</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, I’m a patsy for new moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always cautious and worried about trying new products.</li>
            <li> my new moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quickly healed severely dry skin, in three days.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always concerned when I try a new product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And the last thing I want on a hot Summer day is a face as shiny as a new penny.</li>
            <li> I do not usually do reviews</li>
            <li> I wake up to even toned, plump, soft skin!  </li>
            <li> I was thinking, &amp;#34;no way is this going to moisturize my skin.&amp;#34; However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li> I have been using Ponds Dry Skin Cream for many years and have never decided to try anything else because Ponds works on my dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SUPER dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida near the gulf coast aka, humidity capital of the world.  </li>
            <li> Since it is in the gel format, it sinks into the skin quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the formula for normal skin, the water gel, and after several night&#x27;s use, I really can say I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and you only need a little dab here and there.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily forehead and nose, but right around the edges of my mouth and on my cheeks, it can get so dry that I flake.</li>
            <li> I wake up and my skin is replenished and baby soft.  </li>
            <li> I was completely surprised</li>
            <li> /&gt;- unimpressive ingredient list (i.e. the hyaluronic acid [sodium hyaluronate on the list] is near</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used the neutrogena wipes in the hydrating formula, the scent is nearly identical.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t use..</li>
            <li> Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have used oils and various moisturizing products, and I really like this one a lot.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doesnt irritate at all - i have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year looking 60 year old</li>
            <li> Non greasy, can be applied directly around eyes.</li>
            <li> Using this product helped to keep its natural moisture without getting too oily.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so supple and soft.</li>
            <li> I have a face cream drawer filled with products that I used a few times</li>
            <li> But it turns out the amount of active ingredients is too low for it to be effective and the other stuff is not anything to write home about.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like slathering moisturiser all over my face because it tends to feel like too much gunk on my face, and never completely soaks in.</li>
            <li> No breakouts with either one, both absorb quickly, but the gel-cream dries a little bit shinier than the gel.</li>
            <li> I really dislike the other similar water gel style of this cream which has a very perfumey scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fact you only need a little bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I previously had to use a heavy cream, it was brutal during summer months when I would sweat, so I&#x27;m excited to be able to use an effective product this summer!</li>
            <li> Although I probably need extra dry, I got it mainly because its Fragrance-free, Oil-Free, Dye-free, which the normal water gel doesnt list.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena go back to the old ingredients!</li>
            <li> First off, pay attention to which one you buy -- there are two and the gel-cream is fragrance-free, while the other is not.</li>
            <li> so even though the price is a little on the high side, it lasts for long enough to be worth it!</li>
            <li> And the next morning my face didn’t feel soft and moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li> YOUR FACE FEELS SILKY SOFT THE ENTIRE DAY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 71 years old and recently my face etc.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;It totally makes my face soft &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Neutrogena Hydro Boost holds up the higher end serums (I was spending $50+ previously).</li>
            <li> But I live in a dry climate and needed something just like this.</li>
            <li> Because I live in Colorado and with this bipolar weather my face has been so dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I also seem to be going through it much faster than other facial lotions.</li>
            <li> (Minus the normal pms simpletons)</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry, it will sting a bit to my skin, but it also leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I can totally recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, and now in the harshness of winter</li>
            <li> If you have dry sensitive skin &amp; want odorless</li>
            <li> Dry sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer in the evening to balance the harsh ingredients in my daily face wash (Dr. Brandt&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pores No More&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, break-out prone skin and this product leaves my skin hydrated and fresh without irritating it or causing break outs.</li>
            <li> I have extra dry skin because I live in a very dry area</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth jar of  Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry, and I do see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The extra dry skin cream has no scent at all and is not blue like the water gel is.</li>
            <li> had sadly gotten extremely dry and my wrinkles much more visible.</li>
            <li> I am sending this back and sticking to my philosophy renewed hope in a jar dry.</li>
            <li> I put it on and fifteen minutes later my skin feels dry again.</li>
            <li> I have INSANELY dry skin, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> and if something is harsh on my skin my broken capillaries will flare and gladly that doesn&#x27;t happen with this one.</li>
            <li> has the effect of making enlarged pores look even larger (likely due to the hyaluronic acid)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My regular Ponds face cream is not natural by any means but this Hydro Boost has almost half as many ingredients and questionable ones...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long time before trying this</li>
            <li> I felt like compared to other products, this left my skin looking and feeling drier soon after application</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I promise you this will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry skin and are looking for a product with lots of moisture, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin that thirsts for moisture after every shower and face washing.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne and extremely dry skin as a teenager.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this formula would not be suited for people with severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the Winter</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> does not make me break out, and my skin is not longer dry.</li>
            <li> I put it all over my face, including over my eyelids because they are always so dry</li>
            <li> and I have to use something that will keep the dry spots from showing up all day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to put a lot on my face to make my dry patches go away.</li>
            <li> I had really dry and flaky skin on and around my nose</li>
            <li> Most I&#x27;ve found leave my skin greasy or feel heavy not to mention expensive.  </li>
            <li> Overall I like this product, and look forward to trying it in summer when I&#x27;m less dry.</li>
            <li> This cream did not alleviate my dry, tight feeling facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried way too many products only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I still have a half of a jar left-</li>
            <li> Normally even Neutrogena products are too heavy or harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to very dry skin and thought this would help.</li>
            <li> Like a few others have said, one application in 12-hours might not be enough if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> For super cold, winter weather, I may switch back to my heavier creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that won&#x27;t make me feel completely greasy, but still hydrate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, thanks to a retinol product I used every night for a week, and ever since, every little thing makes my skin go crazy with a red rash.  </li>
            <li> ive tried a few different brands of hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> Not want I expected.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, a little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my combination skin (which would get dry in the T-Zone due to my face wash).</li>
            <li> But a few days later I ran out my usual Olay and ended up using this for the next couple of days.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it soft.&lt;br /&gt;While it may seem expensive for being less than two ounces, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> left(a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry/flaky skin and this cures it.</li>
            <li> me start by saying I am half black, half white, have oily skin, even with tanning, and!</li>
            <li> Which should be a while, as a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> so I was very skeptical when it came to this oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I have a few small scars and am starting to get a few tiny wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to use a heavy cream moisturizer to relieve my dry skin...</li>
            <li> I feel like for the money I paid, it&#x27;s so not worth it.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying the other version for drier skin types!</li>
            <li> extremely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I have the typical T-zone type of skin, so</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because my first purchase I actually saw an immediate difference in my skin&#x27;s moisture level.</li>
            <li> and I still have over half a jar</li>
            <li> My skin seemed dry and tired, not soft and plump.  </li>
            <li> When I received Hydro Boost, I was a little ways into my twin pregnancy, and my face was a mess.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this gel due to the base being hydraloronic acid and water.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this for a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a lightweight gel that is not sticky or heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I woke up with pimpled all over my chin, jaw line, and a few on my neck.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Influenster to try out a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent and two weeks in, no skin allergy issues.</li>
            <li> This product showed a difference in hours and solved all my problems in a few days.</li>
            <li> It provides moisture without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little lazy about skin care...</li>
            <li> With the cold wintery winds my face has been a constant battle to keep moist and from getting dry and cracking.  </li>
            <li> My face dries out pretty bad in the Winter months</li>
            <li> i the past few months.</li>
            <li> I checked prices in my local stores, and it&#x27;s a tad expensive for the amount you get, $29 for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will make my skin look improved</li>
            <li> that just wouldn&#x27;t go away with any of the moisturizers I had in the past.</li>
            <li> I am not someone who typically has sensitive skin, but this broke me out really bad.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not suitable for daytime unless you use a separate sunscreen) for a week and no redness appeared whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> it may help replace the hyaluronic acid your skin loses over time and, like glycerin, it does act as a humectant, pulling moisture from the air.  </li>
            <li> At least, pricey for me, but I did check and</li>
            <li> This is not I love it!</li>
            <li> It seriously makes my skin feel so plump and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was, as always a little skeptical of products like this.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- expensive (considering the ingredient list)</li>
            <li> , I am sorry for waiting!&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and my breakout consisting of painful cyst pimples is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and oh, man am I sorry I did!</li>
            <li> I do not like tub containers, because it&#x27;s very difficult to keep bacteria out of the products.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed, but I decided to share it with my Mom instead.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt leave a greasy feel because its not oil based it is water base.</li>
            <li> By day three I looked awful.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I live in the Arizona desert and try everything I can to keep my skin moisturized, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on brand name creams, but this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used at night.  I put it on it&#x27;s greaseless, orderless, light and the next morning I wake up and my skin is replenished and baby soft.  WHAT a value it is!  I am so happy I tried it.  If you have dry skin, I promise you this will make a difference.  Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> Skin feels good all day.</li>
            <li> Feels so silky on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this! 5 stars because it does exactly what the label says. I&#x27;ve used this morning and night since I got it a couple of days ago and my skin is incredibly smooth, hydrated, and baby soft. I have extremely dry/flaky skin and this cures it. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in winter too. Goes on nicely with no greasy/lotiony feel or shine. Doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. Used it on my neck too and it actually smoothed out some of my neck wrinkles. Going to get one for my mom too!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like give it a 3.5 star rating because I like the way my skin feels when I put it on and it stays moisturized for hours. What I don&#x27;t like is the chemical smell. Ever time  I use it I get an uneasy feeling about what kind of chemicals I&#x27;m putting  on my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this product! It smells like clean water and reminds me of the scent from Bath and Body Works called Dancing Waters. This moisturizer is a lightweight gel that is not sticky or heavy on your skin. Just a little bit goes a long way. If you have extremely dry skin and are looking for a product with lots of moisture, I would not recommend this product. It lightly moisturizes and is quite refreshing. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I do not usually do reviews but I felt that I should on this one..... I am not someone who typically has sensitive skin, but this broke me out really bad. I woke up with pimpled all over my chin, jaw line, and a few on my neck. I had more pimples this morning than I ever had even at the height of puberty. I am sending this back and sticking to my philosophy renewed hope in a jar dry. It costs more but it is def worth it. I don&#x27;t know if this was just me but this stuff destroyed my skin. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am not happy with this product. I feel like for the money I paid, it&#x27;s so not worth it. I have been using Ponds Dry Skin Cream for many years and have never decided to try anything else because Ponds works on my dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I should of known better. If it it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it ladies!! The ingredients are totally different compared to my regular Ponds. I have really dry skin that thirsts for moisture after every shower and face washing. My regular face cream is oil based. This Neutrogena Hydro Boost is not. For that simple fact, it does not hydrate my skin to the level that I need. I put it on and fifteen minutes later my skin feels dry again. There are many questionable ingredients in this Hydro Boost. My regular Ponds face cream is not natural by any means but this Hydro Boost has almost half as many ingredients and questionable ones... (synthetic beeswax? blue dye?)  The packaging is pretty. It looks like it will work. For some women it may work just fine. I suffered from acne and extremely dry skin as a teenager. I have since found an oil based moisturizer that works and I made the mistake of buying this thinking that this fancy looking product would be incredibly hydrating and the hydraulic acid would help prevent wrinkles. I have stopped using this and went back to my regular. much better, much cheaper. actually hydrating.</li>
            <li> this product is great for my combination skin! its smells great. It doesnt leave a greasy feel because its not oil based it is water base. ive tried a few different brands of hyaluronic acid but none worked as well as this one. i highly recommend this brand of hyaluronic acid. i notice immediate softened skin and within a week or so i saw more bright supple skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Influenster to try out a few months ago. I was really excited to try it out, but after doing some research, I discovered the main ingredient, hyaluronic acid, isn&#x27;t breastfeeding safe. I was a bit disappointed, but I decided to share it with my Mom instead. Since trying it out, she&#x27;s loved how it feels! She lives in Chicago, and this has been a great moisturizer for the colder/dryer months that doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling. I believe she would give this 5 stars, but I am giving 4 since it isn&#x27;t breastfeeding &amp;#34;safe.&amp;#34; For full transparency, I had the opportunity to test this product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Ive heard alot of buzz about this product i the past few months. I was so excited when I was chosen to receive this from Influenster to test and review. I used this 2 times per day for over 2 weeks now. I used about a dime sized amount and it was more than enough to cover my face and neck. The product went on evenly and soaked in almost immediately.The smell was not too strong but it smelled clean and refreshing like a beach or a spa. I loved that this product did not leave my face dry or too oily but with the perfect amount of moisture. I used this moisturizer under my makeup and it helped my makeup last longer and stayed in place longer with fewer touch-ups. This is a great and innovative, new product!!! I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review. It did not influence my opinion. #BehindTheGlow #Neutrogena @Influenster @Neutrogena</li>
            <li> I love the fact you only need a little bit to go a long way. The price of the product is outstanding. I am very grateful that I was able to test this product and be able to help more viewers with this product. The gel does not leave your face greasy like most of them normally do. I would definitely buy this again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the bottle from influenster complementary and tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have very sensitive, break-out prone skin and this product leaves my skin hydrated and fresh without irritating it or causing break outs. Like a few others have said, one application in 12-hours might not be enough if you have really dry skin. I have a couple patches that needed two applications. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and I absolutely love it. I have extra dry skin because I live in a very dry area and I have thyroid issues. I have tried way too many products only to be disappointed. Neutrogena always seems to be what I go back to. This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, I’m a patsy for new moisturizers.  I’ve used just about every one available and have settled on Eucerin Smoothing Repair for body and have used Olay Micro sculpting as my facial moisturizer for years.  I’ve been extremely happy with the Olay product but when I saw a TV ad for this Neutrogena product, I wanted to try it.  Very clever packaging- the blue color and ads with lots of water make you think “moisture, moisture, moisture” :)  So, patsy that I am, I picked up a jar the next day at a big box store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.  This is a fairly light cream and can’t say my skin felt particularly moisturized even immediately after first use.  And the next morning my face didn’t feel soft and moisturized at all.  I shrugged it off and set the jar aside accepting it as a lesson learned.  But a few days later I ran out my usual Olay and ended up using this for the next couple of days.  By day three I looked awful.  My skin seemed dry and tired, not soft and plump.  So I made a special trip to the store for Olay which will last until my next subscribe and save delivery from Amazon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main selling point here seems to be the fact that it contains hyaluronic acid.  That is a good ingredient since studies show that applied topically it may help replace the hyaluronic acid your skin loses over time and, like glycerin, it does act as a humectant, pulling moisture from the air.  But many skin care products use it (including Olay) and since it is 16th of 19 listed ingredients (11th in Olay) I don’t know that there is enough here to be effective.  If HA is your main concern, I would just get a bottle of readily available pure HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I admire the clever marketing, I can’t say that I’m impressed with the actual product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this gel due to the base being hydraloronic acid and water. But it turns out the amount of active ingredients is too low for it to be effective and the other stuff is not anything to write home about. The fragrance is really strong for a facial moisturizer. U can probably just rub it on your wrist as perfume and leave it at that.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it.  Very nice consistency.  Adds good moisture to skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always concerned when I try a new product. But I live in a dry climate and needed something just like this. I was completely surprised how well it works - noticeable difference in skin texture and fine lines. Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent and two weeks in, no skin allergy issues. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I have been using this for a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- pleasant light scent and consistency&lt;br /&gt;- leaves face feeling silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- unhygienic container&lt;br /&gt;- unimpressive ingredient list (i.e. the hyaluronic acid [sodium hyaluronate on the list] is near the end)&lt;br /&gt;- has the effect of making enlarged pores look even larger (likely due to the hyaluronic acid)&lt;br /&gt;- need to use blotting sheets a short while after application&lt;br /&gt;- expensive (considering the ingredient list)</li>
            <li> I got this product through Influentster in a voxbox and was SO excited to try it! I have dry, sensitive skin, and now in the harshness of winter it&#x27;s SUPER dry and sensitive. I feel that this product is ideal for a light wash of hydration, but not a deep drink for VERY dry skin. I look forward to trying the other version for drier skin types! If you&#x27;ve used the neutrogena wipes in the hydrating formula, the scent is nearly identical. It&#x27;s nice and light and fresh, nothing overwhelming!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this in many ways: alone, with serums, with oil, under moisturizer, and over day creams. My favorite way so far is under my day cream as a light wash to add extra moisture and it works quite well like that. It&#x27;s also splendid under makeup alone, as it dries quickly and leaves no residue! I don&#x27;t recommend adding oil, it really gives no benefit and seems to break it down more than anything.&lt;br /&gt;If my skin is very dry, it will sting a bit to my skin, but it also leaves my skin very soft. I think if you have combo skin this would be PERFECT for you! Overall I like this product, and look forward to trying it in summer when I&#x27;m less dry. I think it&#x27;s worth a try :3</li>
            <li> best product on the market great moisturizer</li>
            <li> ordered june 22 and arrived june 25.  the gel cream looks used, box was torn when arrived.  no white plastic layer on top of cream inside lid.</li>
            <li> Light feeling cream that provides great moisture. It does not feel greasy and works well under my makeup. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster and Neutrogena, I got to try this full size product for free. And hooooooboy do I love it. It&#x27;s light weight, sure. It feels kinda watery, sure. But it QUENCHES my skin. I have an oily forehead and nose, but right around the edges of my mouth and on my cheeks, it can get so dry that I flake. After my morning routine, I&#x27;ve switched to using this as my moisturizer and buhbye flakes! Plus, my oily zone is not so oily feeling, while still feeling refreshed and hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;I want to try the thicker cream one as I think I&#x27;ll need that come winter, but this feels fantastic and keeps me moisturized throughout my day so far!</li>
            <li> I have really dry/sensitive skin and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It seriously makes my skin feel so plump and hydrated. I wish there was a jar that was like 3 times this size because I seem to go through it so quickly!</li>
            <li> hydrated face and felt so good.  Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth jar of  Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry, and I do see a difference in my skin.  It is much more hydrated.  Although I have used other brands of gels with hyaluronic acid,  this one, by far, has turned out to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using hyaluronic acid off and on for a while. I have been buying the overpriced stuff that my esthetician sells so when I saw Neutrogena hydro boost I was excited. I have read some of the customer reviews and have noticed that a lot of people’s responses are 1) this doesn’t moisturize enough and 2) the smell. I bought the gel cream, and this actually works better than a lot of the high end products I was using before! Most hyaluronic acid serums are meant to be used in combination with a lotion. So if these buyers are buying just the gel, it wouldn’t feel the same throughout the day as a lotion or cream. The cream gel however seems to be both the serum and a moisturizer making this perfect for keeping skin hydrated. It states that this is for extra dry skin, but I think it would be ok for everyone except the truly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also complaints I noticed about the smell. Maybe the gel does have a perfume in it, but the gel cream is fragrance free. So if there are concerns about smell or sensitive skin, the gel cream would be a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Neutrogena Hydro Boost holds up the higher end serums (I was spending $50+ previously). I am thrilled (and so is my wallet) to have found this!</li>
            <li> Very nice if you&#x27;re experiencing menopausal acne like me.</li>
            <li> really feels great on your skin and makes it very smooth and soft....</li>
            <li> Not want I expected.  Trashed it.</li>
            <li> Feels great, especially after the sun.</li>
            <li> If you like Clinque Moisture Surge you will love this. Very light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Good for humid climates.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Quick dry and makes skin feel smooth and moisturized. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that seems to keep my face moisturized. If you have dry sensitive skin &amp; want odorless this is it.</li>
            <li> Like that this one feels a little more substantial but still absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the formula of this moisturizer. Since it is in the gel format, it sinks into the skin quickly and does not feel greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this formula would not be suited for people with severely dry skin. It is not moisturizing enough. Also, I wish that they would change the packaging. I do not like tub containers, because it&#x27;s very difficult to keep bacteria out of the products.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FEELS WONDERFUL, NOT GREASY AND EASILY ABSORBED, AND YOUR FACE FEELS SILKY SOFT THE ENTIRE DAY.</li>
            <li> it really softens those fine lines and moisturizes the skin..  I will order more</li>
            <li> Trerrific, as always!</li>
            <li> Already tried the hydro-gel, like hydro cream better, fragrance free, slightly thicker texture than hydro-gel and hydrate skin well without break out.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary of influenster, and im so glad i got to try it out! It moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy and feels very refreshing and cooling on the skin, comparable to clinique moisturizing gel!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Will continue to order this product. Thanks to Prime&lt;br /&gt;I can save myself a trip to store which is often out of product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free from Influenster.  I am very happy with this product. I have dry skin in the Winter and this really takes care of it. I will definitetly be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size jar of Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel from Influenster about two months ago and I have been using it every day since in place of my normal clean and clear lotion routine. I must admit, it is amazing. It goes on very smooth and absorbs really quickly. It does have a strong fragrance in the jar, but it quickly dissipates after its rubbed in. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for two months and I still have a half of a jar left- so even though the price is a little on the high side, it lasts for long enough to be worth it! My skin is generally on the dry end of the spectrum and this lotion really quenched my skin quickly and lasted the whole day. I also have noticed that I haven&#x27;t gotten my normal monthly break outs since I have been using this, my skin is beautiful and clear.</li>
            <li> Really hurt my eyes. If you have sensitive eyes don&#x27;t use.. After 3 weeks it still did not go away.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I purchased this gel cream hoping it would be lighter for So Cal summers.  Lotions &amp; creams were melting off in the warmth, but this gel is much better.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t have super dry skin, but I feel like this is gentle and plumps up my skin when I use it!</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizers I even tried. Really is dermatologist recommended.I showed it to my dermatologist he said they really like this product &amp; they highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it goes on so smoothly and makes my face feel so smooth. Definitely a must have item.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Neuterogena Products and this does what it says. One of the best products I have used.  Hydrates the skin with no sticky feel.</li>
            <li> I got the formula for normal skin, the water gel, and after several night&#x27;s use, I really can say I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s really refreshing and not like a cream or any gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  This formula is all the rage in Asia and I&#x27;m glad Neutrogena finally is selling it here in the States.  I have sensitive skin, thanks to a retinol product I used every night for a week, and ever since, every little thing makes my skin go crazy with a red rash.  This product did not cause any reaction at all.  I used it every night (it&#x27;s not suitable for daytime unless you use a separate sunscreen) for a week and no redness appeared whatsoever.  It did moisturize my skin, which felt smooth and soft, and plumped.  There is a subtle fragrance, but it dissipates quickly and caused no issues.  It absorbs very quickly and leaves no trace, just soft skin.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a great drugstore option for dehydrated skin. I can really feel it soaking in quickly and locking in the moisture. The extra dry skin cream has no scent at all and is not blue like the water gel is.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> the Neutrogena Hydro Gel. I was, as always a little skeptical of products like this. I have the typical T-zone type of skin, so I don&#x27;t like slathering moisturiser all over my face because it tends to feel like too much gunk on my face, and never completely soaks in. And the last thing I want on a hot Summer day is a face as shiny as a new penny. This product promises that it is light, and soak in quickly- your perfect Summer moisturiser. I have tried it for 2 weeks now, off an on, and I do like it. I feel like at night, it&#x27;s perfect. For the morning, I use a moisturizer with SPF, so I had been in the market for a lighter one for nighttime. I checked prices in my local stores, and it&#x27;s a tad expensive for the amount you get, $29 for the bottle. At least, pricey for me, but I did check and it&#x27;s cheaper online, so I may have to order from there.  I have yet to check the ingredients on Ewg.org- Skindeep to see exactly what it is I&#x27;m putting on my face, but I think if that checks out, this is my new summer moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a long time before trying this and oh, man am I sorry I did! Yep, that&#x27;s right, I am sorry for waiting!&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying I am half black, half white, have oily skin, even with tanning, and! I live in Florida near the gulf coast aka, humidity capital of the world.  I&#x27;ve been lucky to have pretty great skin, not a ton of breakouts but they do happen, but I was terrified of using any lotions, until I turned 27 and my skin started to show that I don&#x27;t take proper precautions. So, I tried this and again, WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?! this is a wonderful product! The eye cream is great but this, oh man! I apply it before bed, post shower (and I tan, a lot) and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is actually loving it! And even better, no breakouts! (Minus the normal pms simpletons) so if your looking for something for all skin types, especially oily, that feels good and not one  bit greasy or makes your face sweat more, especially in Florida heat, you found it!!</li>
            <li> I have unhydrated flaky gross skin... I know, I know, I need to drink water!  I&#x27;m always looking for hydrating face products.  Most I&#x27;ve found leave my skin greasy or feel heavy not to mention expensive.  This gel cream is a dream! Although I probably need extra dry, I got it mainly because its Fragrance-free, Oil-Free, Dye-free, which the normal water gel doesnt list.  It is ultra lightweight and not at all greasy.  My face actually feels like I splashed it with water when I put it on. Unlike other &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; that just sit on top of your skin, this has hyaluronic acid which &amp;#34;locks in&amp;#34; moisture.  Pro beauty tip: Apply it to damp skin (right after the shower) to give an extra boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> nice for summer not greacy at all over all ok</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and maybe I needed to try this product for longer but after a week of using it, I saw no improvement in my skin so I stopped. I felt like compared to other products, this left my skin looking and feeling drier soon after application and I found myself reapply multiple times per day. No thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, cooling and moisturizing all for a very low price. I wear this under my heavier moisturizer and/or foundation. I&#x27;ve also applied it after serum to lock in the serum.</li>
            <li> Feels light and silky and has the best fresh scent. I reviewed this product for Influenster and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great lightweight moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been a faithful cera ve user but don&#x27;t love the consistency. This is a great alternative</li>
            <li> moisturizing, fast aborb</li>
            <li> extremely moisturizing! I am ony 40 with very healthy skin but I have a few small scars and am starting to get a few tiny wrinkles. After a week of using this the scars are mostly invisible, the tiny wrinkles are gone and the shadows under my eyes that it didn&#x27;t advertise to help with are GONE! I love this stuff!! Gentle smell, absorbs very fast cant say enough about it!!</li>
            <li> Love most of Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. Leaves my skin smooth and feeling fresh. Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel so nice and hydrated, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> best moisturizer till date. its a gel based formula and goes good with almost all foundations i use</li>
            <li> First moisture that does not make me sweat.</li>
            <li> Living in Phoenix, I am constantly looking for something to hydrate my skin.  I have used oils and various moisturizing products, and I really like this one a lot.  It is my new favorite.  I use it night and day under a basic moisturizer with sunscreen.  On days I am not going out, I just use it alone, and really like the texture of my skin after using it a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
            <li> This product is not fragrance free.  If you get migraines from cosmetic fragrances, do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> May work for some but not me... Caused a face break out and really clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for testing from Influencer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little lazy about skin care... When I received Hydro Boost, I was a little ways into my twin pregnancy, and my face was a mess. I&#x27;d been thinking I needed to figure out some low maintenance way of doing SOMETHING to get that &amp;#34;pregnancy glow&amp;#34; I had been promised. This gel clearly didn&#x27;t banish my acne, but it did make my skin feel super soft and smooth - after the first use! I love that I don&#x27;t feel greasy after putting it on, and can put makeup on shortly after applying. Regular lotions don&#x27;t absorb quickly enough for me! This stuff is delightful, and reasonably-priced enough that it seems worth it to buy another tub when this one is gone. Which should be a while, as a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Not greasy and cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> No scent and this is what I need. I so love this product on my skin. Feels so refreshing and it&#x27;s worth the price! I&#x27;ve been using MAC moisturizer for months but I shall say Neutrogena can replace it. I didn&#x27;t get break outs and it&#x27;s very light on my skin while keeping my face moisturized the whole day! I will definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used! I have combination skin and very sensitive skin. This doesn&#x27;t make my face oily and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin at all. I have finally found my go to cream! Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> The container is quite bulky for the amount of product, but I have enjoyed the gel-cream so much that I don&#x27;t mind it. The cream rehydrates my dry skin without clogging my pores, and my skin has never looked better! I also enjoy that this cream is not oily!</li>
            <li> No smell. Goes on nice, i like the consistency of the gel cream, and absorbs quickly. No sticky residue or anything on skin. Leaves skin feeling soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt irritate at all - i have sensitive skin.  Not sure if it will make my skin look improved (i dont think there is any such thing as a miracle cream out there) but I will probably keep using it in hopes of staving off aging and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I dont see a change in my skin</li>
            <li> Pretty much no scent --- very important for face creams.  If scent is too strong (or I don&#x27;t like it, period) I can&#x27;t stand having it on my face since there&#x27;s no getting away from the smell amplified right by your nose.  Texture is perfect.  It goes on really light and mostly absorbs quickly so I can&#x27;t tell it is still there but if I wet my face I can kind of feel it still on there somehow.  I have acne prone skin and have not had any problems yet.  I really dislike the other similar water gel style of this cream which has a very perfumey scent.</li>
            <li> You can really tell that your skin is more hydrated. You can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my combination skin. My completion never looked better I&#x27;m a 40 year looking 60 year old 😂</li>
            <li> My skin is more dry than oily, and I also live in the deep-deep south. Skin stays perfectly hydrated all day, never feels greasy. I am so impressed. Will definitely buy forever!</li>
            <li> i bought this in cvs not on amazon but I had to review it! I have acne prone skin. only thing that has EVER helped that problem is proactiv. I also have very dry/oily skin. so I&#x27;m always cautious and worried about trying new products. I used to use cetaphil for my dry skin but it did make my skin more oily. I saw on a beauty gurus instagram that she had started to use this and she also has my kind of skin type so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I LOVE IT! the first time I used it, it felt like putting ocean water on my face without the saltiness. really refreshing. does not make me break out, and my skin is not longer dry. I put it all over my face, including over my eyelids because they are always so dry I sometimes could not even wear eyeshadow, and it&#x27;s amazing how well this has helped. it&#x27;s not oily at all. I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin. I had high hopes for a moisturizing product bearing the Neutrogena name. I was sorely disappointed.  This cream did not alleviate my dry, tight feeling facial skin. It may be great for others with dry but not very dry skin but for me it did nothing. I do not blame anyone for  giving it a try after reading this because it is cheap enough but if money is not an issue try something else.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Neutrogena Deep Moisture Night Cream ran out. I liked the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, but it did not work on my dry skin as well as the Night Cream did (that stuff works great, night or day - haha).  My face dries out pretty bad in the Winter months and I have to use something that will keep the dry spots from showing up all day.  After a week of using the Hydro Boost Gel Cream, I ended up going to a local store to buy some more of the Deep Moisture Night Cream.  I think the Hydro Boost Gel Cream will be perfect for Summer though when I&#x27;m looking for something lighter.</li>
            <li> Works very well for added moisture</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Goes on smooth &amp; absorbs quickly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very soft and full of moisture.  Safe on my very sensitive skin.  No fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent on winter dry skin.  Non greasy, can be applied directly around eyes. Quickly healed severely dry skin, in three days.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, the perfect moisturizer...great foundation for primer and foundation. Alert: Make sure you get the GEL CREAM...the gel only has fragrance and Blue dye 1. Packaging is almost identical. I made that mistake today and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I have combination dry/ oily skin. It&#x27;s hard to find a product that won&#x27;t make me feel completely greasy, but still hydrate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I got two samples of this through a beauty box:the original and for extra-dry skin. For me personally, the extra-dry skin worked way better than the original, which is why I ended up buying the full size. This one nourishes your skin more and you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking shiny. It absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it soft.&lt;br /&gt;While it may seem expensive for being less than two ounces, a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t need to put a lot on my face to make my dry patches go away.</li>
            <li> Good value and works great. Much better than creams. We all noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> My most favorite Neutrogena product yet! I camp and boat all summer....it takes a toll on my skin. This has been a life saver this year!</li>
            <li> Love this product! With the cold wintery winds my face has been a constant battle to keep moist and from getting dry and cracking.  Using this product helped to keep its natural moisture without getting too oily.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Non greasy and hydrates.</li>
            <li> Great at moisturizing my oily sensitive skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Goes on very smooth and you only need a little dab here and there.  I have Rosacea and it does not irritate my face which is a big plus.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t judge on whether my skin has been improved.  I will update in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Love how light weight it feels</li>
            <li> what is the difference between the gel crean and the water one</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful gel cream! I became interested in using gel-based moisturizers when I tried Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief&amp;#34; - however, I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out over $20 per container. I needed a moisturizer in the evening to balance the harsh ingredients in my daily face wash (Dr. Brandt&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pores No More&amp;#34;). This gel cream just did the trick. It dries quickly, a little goes a long way, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my combination skin (which would get dry in the T-Zone due to my face wash). The smell in the container is strong, but not unpleasant - just different, and possibly the smell you&#x27;d expect from a product that is gel - not oil - based. However, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on my face when applied. This is a really impressive product by Neutrogena! I will be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I honestly could not write a strong enough review for this cream. I lather this stuff on in the morning and before I go to bed at night, and for the first time in years I have felt like my skin is really happy. My dermatologist even said there was a noticeable difference in the moisture content of my skin. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. The best part is that one dot about the size of a fingernail is enough to moisturize the entire face and even the neck if you stretch it. Definitely plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day since April. My skin looks and feels no different than when I was using Oil of Olay. I will go back to that, once this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to very dry skin and thought this would help. I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Great for acne prone skin! I suffer on/off with cystic acne. This gel hydrates my skin so well! I wake up every morning and my face feels so supple and soft. It also balances my skin tone out quite nicely. I wake up to even toned, plump, soft skin!  I started using this when I was on a BP regimen for my acne, and it really helped to counter the dryness that the BP caused.</li>
            <li> I bought the gel and it worked great, but because I have mature skin I used to put moisturizer on top of it. So I decided to try the gel-cream for extra dry skin and was told by neutrogena that they had to change one of the ingredients and it will be just as effective as the original.  When I used the cream it made my skin peel, I had to stop using it. I was so disappointed because my first purchase I actually saw an immediate difference in my skin&#x27;s moisture level. Neutrogena go back to the old ingredients!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!! :)</li>
            <li> nice but not much difference to the skin</li>
            <li> Irritated my skin, didn&#x27;t moisturize just left a shiny film on my face. I stopped using it and my breakout consisting of painful cyst pimples is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE USED AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have a face cream drawer filled with products that I used a few times but then they irritated my face, or just did not do the job.  I reluctantly purchased this. Normally even Neutrogena products are too heavy or harsh for my face.  This is not I love it! Cannot beat the price it works better than $100 face creams I have tried. I even notice improvement in my hands.  Must have ... I actually will usd this until it is gone and have already bought another! Dry sensitive skin...you have to try this product.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot,  very light and smells nice</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, Extra Dry&amp;#34; is literally the answer to my prayers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 71 years old and recently my face etc. had sadly gotten extremely dry and my wrinkles much more visible. I had tried many other remedies with no appreciable results except my wallet becoming much lighter. This product showed a difference in hours and solved all my problems in a few days. I hope they never stop making it!! (Neutrogena, Are you listening??) I wish it was offered in a larger container as I have found that it also works beautifully on my hands so I have been using a little more each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of working so nicely it is relatively inexpensive and I love the jar. Try it I am sure you will like it!</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I purchased this in April and I still have over half a jar left(a little goes a long way). It leaves my skin soft and smooth. Dries quickly and absorbs without being sticky. I have acne prone skin and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs since using this. I will continue to use Neutrogena hydro boost. A must have in my daily facial regimen.</li>
            <li> Refreshingly hydrating</li>
            <li> Saw an ad or on t.v. &amp; decided to try it&lt;br /&gt;because my face has been super dry.&lt;br /&gt;It totally makes my face soft &amp; hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance, dyes, etc. I have kind of&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin when it comes to fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&amp; this product didn&#x27;t make my face break&lt;br /&gt;out or anything, just totally hydrated it.&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of Neutrogena products &amp;&lt;br /&gt;this one is another great one. Highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product that works as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> I had really dry and flaky skin on and around my nose that just wouldn&#x27;t go away with any of the moisturizers I had in the past. I just bought this gel cream and it&#x27;s a godsend. So glad I bought this, less than two days before my flakies were no longer around. I will be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> First off, pay attention to which one you buy -- there are two and the gel-cream is fragrance-free, while the other is not. This is important for people like me who have extremely sensitive skin. I cannot use products with fragrance. The gel-cream is great. It goes on so smoothly; I love the texture. It absorbs quickly and makes my face feel great. I would point out that I&#x27;ve found it cheaper at local stores. I also seem to be going through it much faster than other facial lotions. But it feels light and non-greasy so I think it will be perfect for a summer morning moisturizer. For super cold, winter weather, I may switch back to my heavier creams.</li>
            <li> I have INSANELY dry skin, especially during the winter months. I&#x27;ve always had to use a heavy cream moisturizer to relieve my dry skin...so I was very skeptical when it came to this oil free moisturizer. I was thinking, &amp;#34;no way is this going to moisturize my skin.&amp;#34; However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works! Since I previously had to use a heavy cream, it was brutal during summer months when I would sweat, so I&#x27;m excited to be able to use an effective product this summer! It also has a very clean smell, which I really like. I&#x27;ve definitely found my new moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, however, this opinion is my own and I truly love using this product.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and cool....</li>
            <li> I have both the gel and the gel-cream.  I use the latter on the days I swim and the pool water dries up my skin.  No breakouts with either one, both absorb quickly, but the gel-cream dries a little bit shinier than the gel.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Put it on in the morning the next day my face looked smoother.</li>
            <li> I received this moisturizer for reviewing purposes from #Influenster - When they sent this to me I was excited as I suffer from dry skin. This has improved my face with the use of my Clarisonic as it leaves my skin clean and ready to soak up the product. This particular moisturizer I like because it has a watery light texture and after I apply it my face feels smooth . This moisturizer is perfect to use as a primer under the makeup as it feels the same as the expensive primer from S******X. This item I will continue to use as It&#x27;s gentle for my sensitive skin and if something is harsh on my skin my broken capillaries will flare and gladly that doesn&#x27;t happen with this one. I can totally recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It provides moisture without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. When I found out I was receiving this product.. I was ecstatic! Why? Because I live in Colorado and with this bipolar weather my face has been so dry and flaky. After using it twice a day, I noticed on the 3rd day my face was going back to it&#x27;s smooth self. I have combination skin, so this product worked out perfect for me. Also, it does have a smell, it&#x27;s not bad. Kind of smells a bit like Ponds moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product! Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Goes on very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave already feeling at all!!! I&#x27;m hooked! My skin has never felt better! I was given this product by Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are my own! :)</li>
