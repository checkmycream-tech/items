            <li>great for my frizzy, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great lightweight gel for summer, before swimming to protect hair from chlorine, etc,&lt;br /&gt;although</li>
            <li>The is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I read the great reviews and was hoping this would help relax my curl a bit</li>
            <li>I have always been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>it relaxed the texture of my hair amazingly!</li>
            <li>Just a dab spread over all my hair before blowdrying helps me to a perfect blow-out that is frizz and static resistant -- even during the summer in the Gulf South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the instructions to get best results!</li>
            <li>If you have an event and can&#x27;t get your hair relaxed in time, this is a good stop-gap measure.</li>
            <li>I guess it does what its supposed to do because her hair sure looks great</li>
            <li>This is one of the most effective products out there for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this as the price was too good to be true, and it was.  </li>
            <li>Not for fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I love this brand&#x27;s shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to go out and have my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li>The Phyto Phytodefrisant Hair Relaxing Balm makes my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Humidity and heat are my enemies :))  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many silicones with no luck</li>
            <li>Works even better than leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love products by Phyto, but this one leaves me wanting....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use a 50/50 mix with a gel that has a littler more body.</li>
            <li>This way I get the smoothing, straightening effect of this product plus more hold.  </li>
            <li>This product is not only wonderful</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The price was a much better deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>(of course he wanted me to purchase it in the salon for A LOT MORE $$.)</li>
            <li>The best part my hair stayed frizz free for two entire days.</li>
            <li>But sometimes I want a good blowout and this product really helps with that.  </li>
            <li>What is working in preventing frizzies is this product, ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment Oil, which works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I have fine relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I apply this on damp hair and it help control the frizz in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that makes your hair look like it&#x27;s best version without looking overly styled or artificial.</li>
            <li>This makes a huge difference on my hair in controlling frizz and flyaways.  </li>
            <li>The product is light and smells nice,but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>The balm is smooth and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair</li>
            <li>This product works wonders, it makes my hair smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>It really worked out very well and the product seems to be well liked by customers and the feel of the product on the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>I doubt very much this is the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product the first time on a cruise, and now am so glad I can get it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Even at Amazon&#x27;s good price Phytodefrisant is still an expensive potion but a very good one.  </li>
            <li>Honestly by the end of day one I had to put it in ponytail because again I live in Florida</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped, my hair felt clean again.  </li>
            <li>Not with this balm, it keeps my straight hair in top shape with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair straight and this product helps me a lot.</li>
            <li>I just love it so much.</li>
            <li>It may be a quick read</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference very first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks PHYTO!!</li>
            <li>My hair stays smooth, shiny, and very health looking until I wash it again.  </li>
            <li>Worth the effort to obtain and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>You may have a better experience, but I had to buy Head &amp; Shoulders to clear my scalp.</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my curly hair, it relaxes the curls much more easily.</li>
            <li>The cheaper price from this seller is indeed too good to be true - don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>No frizz and my hair is super straight after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>but  without any  weight, feels clean and light not like most styling creams that are so heavy and  sticky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Phyto for several years and love their line of products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because that product was like magic to me before.</li>
            <li>I first found out about PHYTO, when a pharmacist in Barcelona Spain recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I also am using  a deep moisturizing conditioner regularly,but this product puts my hair over the top,makes it super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>This one does not and leave my hair super shiny and soft but it gives it body so I can set my hair on hot curlers and get the wave or curl I want without the frizz.</li>
            <li>I do tend to have super sensitive skin, so that could have just been my experience.</li>
            <li>Really flattens frizzies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so watery that it requires careful capturing in your hand to be sure it makes it to your hair.</li>
            <li>and you could actually hear the sloshing sound when you shake the tube.</li>
            <li>I swim three days a week and this product really delivers.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does what it says.</li>
            <li>and fine.and I had given up ever straightening it because my hair was breaking off so much.</li>
            <li>This is really meant for straightening hair but it really protected it .</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair straight</li>
            <li>It really is a miracle product, without the oily, greasy, product feeling.  </li>
            <li>Whole thing was sqished.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I think if the product was the correct consistency, it would work really well.  </li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very curly and tends to frizz if I try to fight the curl.  </li>
            <li>But the price is still very steep for the size of the product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so the heat gets to you especially with thick hair, but my ponytail was still in perfect condition as far as frizz and hold were concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did also want to mention that the packaging has changed but from what I understand it is still the original formula and same product just an upgraded look.</li>
            <li>since other reviewers have mentioned this, my product wasn&#x27;t a balm, but more like a gel consistency, not watery, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and live in Florida!  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser can make it look straight and silky though, and I came as close as I ever have to that with this stuff with a blow dryer on high.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This left me with so many white flakes, I cannot even begin to start.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very very watery, different from the many other tubes I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would have given it all 5 stars if it were just a little thicker.</li>
            <li>This is a must have product for natural curl hair!!</li>
            <li>Normal boar bristle hairbrushes can&#x27;t even penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and the high humidity causes my hair to be frizzy and uncontrollable.  </li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower as it gives my color treated hair both an extra boost of shine and also provides a barrier between my hair and the heat from blow-drying and straighteners or curling irons.</li>
            <li>I gave it one star for the light consistency and the other for the scent.</li>
            <li>and I rarely even need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My relaxer was growing out,so I had 1 1/2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li>It did not relax my new growth.</li>
            <li>After blow drying, some of my new growth was still wavy.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>and I just bought a new batch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking to switch to a new product.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast but unfortunately the product has changed so I cannot give a good review.</li>
            <li>My hairs was super dry ,was breaking and frizzy.</li>
            <li>You need to apply pretty liberally and HEAT STYLE - that is the key.</li>
            <li>Not sure if seller added something, or if they just make it more watery now?</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida, where humidity is pretty much the norm, and I have super curly thick hair that usually no matter how much product I use frizzes up by the middle of the day and is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot tell that it helps at all with my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>It tames, softens and shines markedly both ways.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some on Amazon and received a completely liquid consistency</li>
            <li>It is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>Soft tube comes retail-packaged in a flimsy cardstock box.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve had a professional keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have mildly curly hair and needed something to make it less curly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to run this through my hair while wet as suggested use my hair gel to set and my AG hair spray for a little hold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like liquid coming out of the tube, leaves white streaks when it dries if not thoroughly distributed, and does not work nearly as well as the old balm.</li>
            <li>Just a small dab on damp clean hair, comb through and blow dry on high.</li>
            <li>, so perhaps results with a blow out would be different (but I go to a professional for blow outs).  </li>
            <li>As a new push-up practitioner, I was unaware of all of the potential contained in this one exercise.</li>
            <li>air dry my hair when I wear it curly, or flat iron it when I wear it straight</li>
            <li>To Do More Push-ups&amp;#34; contains not only numerous potential push-up workouts but also options for how to perform the individual push-ups based on your strength level, weak spots, and goals.</li>
            <li>that is an overstatement, in fact, I use this on days when I let my hair dry naturally, and the waves and curls are still bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I can use it to style curly and my curls stay soft but frizz-free, or I can use it when I blow my hair dry</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super thick, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Put it on wet hair before styling and blow dry for glassy, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s watered down, does nothing to tame curls and created a white flaky residue (even with light usage).</li>

            <li> This stuff really does what it says.</li>
            <li> and fine.and I had given up ever straightening it because my hair was breaking off so much.</li>
            <li> This is really meant for straightening hair but it really protected it .</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair straight</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle product, without the oily, greasy, product feeling.  </li>
            <li> Whole thing was sqished.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I think if the product was the correct consistency, it would work really well.  </li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very curly and tends to frizz if I try to fight the curl.  </li>
            <li> But the price is still very steep for the size of the product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so the heat gets to you especially with thick hair, but my ponytail was still in perfect condition as far as frizz and hold were concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did also want to mention that the packaging has changed but from what I understand it is still the original formula and same product just an upgraded look.</li>
            <li> since other reviewers have mentioned this, my product wasn&#x27;t a balm, but more like a gel consistency, not watery, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and live in Florida!  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser can make it look straight and silky though, and I came as close as I ever have to that with this stuff with a blow dryer on high.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This left me with so many white flakes, I cannot even begin to start.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very very watery, different from the many other tubes I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would have given it all 5 stars if it were just a little thicker.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for natural curl hair!!</li>
            <li> Normal boar bristle hairbrushes can&#x27;t even penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and the high humidity causes my hair to be frizzy and uncontrollable.  </li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower as it gives my color treated hair both an extra boost of shine and also provides a barrier between my hair and the heat from blow-drying and straighteners or curling irons.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star for the light consistency and the other for the scent.</li>
            <li> and I rarely even need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My relaxer was growing out,so I had 1 1/2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> It did not relax my new growth.</li>
            <li> After blow drying, some of my new growth was still wavy.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> and I just bought a new batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to switch to a new product.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast but unfortunately the product has changed so I cannot give a good review.</li>
            <li> My hairs was super dry ,was breaking and frizzy.</li>
            <li> You need to apply pretty liberally and HEAT STYLE - that is the key.</li>
            <li> Not sure if seller added something, or if they just make it more watery now?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where humidity is pretty much the norm, and I have super curly thick hair that usually no matter how much product I use frizzes up by the middle of the day and is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot tell that it helps at all with my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It tames, softens and shines markedly both ways.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some on Amazon and received a completely liquid consistency</li>
            <li> It is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Soft tube comes retail-packaged in a flimsy cardstock box.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve had a professional keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have mildly curly hair and needed something to make it less curly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to run this through my hair while wet as suggested use my hair gel to set and my AG hair spray for a little hold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like liquid coming out of the tube, leaves white streaks when it dries if not thoroughly distributed, and does not work nearly as well as the old balm.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab on damp clean hair, comb through and blow dry on high.</li>
            <li> , so perhaps results with a blow out would be different (but I go to a professional for blow outs).  </li>
            <li> As a new push-up practitioner, I was unaware of all of the potential contained in this one exercise.</li>
            <li> air dry my hair when I wear it curly, or flat iron it when I wear it straight</li>
            <li> To Do More Push-ups&amp;#34; contains not only numerous potential push-up workouts but also options for how to perform the individual push-ups based on your strength level, weak spots, and goals.</li>
            <li> that is an overstatement, in fact, I use this on days when I let my hair dry naturally, and the waves and curls are still bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I can use it to style curly and my curls stay soft but frizz-free, or I can use it when I blow my hair dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super thick, wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Put it on wet hair before styling and blow dry for glassy, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watered down, does nothing to tame curls and created a white flaky residue (even with light usage).</li>
            <li> (after drying/using a flat iron) until my next shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair and use it every time after I have washed my hair prior to blow drying or air drying.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very, very long way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a retail outlet a while ago to see if it would help when I blow dry and flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, once that&#x27;s successfully accomplished, the end results are beautiful--smooth, shiny curls without the usual frizz!</li>
            <li> I also take the Phyto Food Supplement (Phytophanere) because my hair was falling out several months ago, I believe due to long term dieting.  </li>
            <li> as well for the days where I&#x27;m not washing my hair but want to re-style it (or simply add a little extra shine.)</li>
            <li> Works well for dry hair</li>
            <li> and when I blow dry and flatten it.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Does it job but feels like nothing when your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing for my hair, after blow drying my hair was dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I usually put the product in my hair, let my hair air dry (it will feel soft at this point, but it won&#x27;t look shiny/silky yet) and then style with my straightening iron -</li>
            <li> I add it to my leave in conditioner when leaving my thick curly frizzy mane to dry naturally</li>
            <li> if you wear it all day it tends to get a little flaky by the later afternoon.</li>
            <li> Only need a little.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste in ever sense of the word.</li>
            <li> Tube was partially crushed, but intact.  </li>
            <li> I then flat ironed and there was little change.</li>
            <li> I use a dab of it with a dab PHYTO phytolisse (serum de finition) on naturally dried hair before I flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it one last final try and put some on dry hair this morning before using a curling iron, and again it came out worse</li>
            <li> I tend to like light products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I can touch my hair all day long!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes blow drying easier and quicker and it only takes a small amount for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from Ulta for the past several years</li>
            <li> The issue is probably due to my hair&#x27;s texture, but I will not use this item again.</li>
            <li> I have tried, creams, sprays, gels and other forms of hair smoothing products.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is extremely watery -- after reading some reviews online</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical, try it at Sephora first (no hassle return policy &amp; they give samples).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry, thick, coarse, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with this product or reason to recommend it other than it works for me!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally unusable &amp; a waste of hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a product, was sent the wrong item, I sent it back only to have them say THEY did not send it.</li>
            <li> I also have very thick, long, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Like several other reviewers, I found the product from this seller to be thin like water, and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> so well I tried to find it in the local beauty supply stores and was not successful.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy and like it needed washing pre-maturely.  </li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Used the blow dryer and flat iron, and it came out worse than it would had I not used it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and have had trouble finding a product that gives it some shine and control without being gummy or stiff.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they changed the formula or product I got was expired</li>
            <li> No more creams, oils etc in the process.</li>
            <li> A lot of info but not overwhelming to the uninitiated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made with hold in mind, so I usually create a hair gel cocktail.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and had negative results.</li>
            <li> This company sucks...</li>
            <li> I have complained to the company, filed a complaint on Amazon, Still NO REFUND.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always been a thick gel.</li>
            <li> Too much product makes my hair greasy-looking and feeling awful.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the seller is to blame for selling fake products.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I think there is something wrong with the bottle I received.  </li>
            <li> But this balm was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and I was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product is usable, so did not complain, but disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well for dry hair</li>
            <li> I love this brand&#x27;s shampoo.  But this balm was a disappointment.  I cannot tell that it helps at all with my naturally wavy/frizzy hair.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Phytp Phytodefrisant Botanical Hair Relaxer did not work for me.I had heigh expectations and I was greatly disappointed.I have fine relaxed hair.My relaxer was growing out,so I had 1 1/2 inches of new growth.I followed the directions and had negative results.The product is light and smells nice,but that&#x27;s it.It did not relax my new growth.After blow drying, some of my new growth was still wavy.I then flat ironed and there was little change.By the following day my hair had reverted back as if nothing had been done.It was a total waste in ever sense of the word.I will not purchase this product again.I gave it one star for the light consistency and the other for the scent.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product that it used to be.  It&#x27;s watered down, does nothing to tame curls and created a white flaky residue (even with light usage). It&#x27;s totally unusable &amp; a waste of hard earned money.  The shipment was fast but unfortunately the product has changed so I cannot give a good review.</li>
            <li> Even at Amazon&#x27;s good price Phytodefrisant is still an expensive potion but a very good one.  I add it to my leave in conditioner when leaving my thick curly frizzy mane to dry naturally and when I blow dry and flatten it.  It tames, softens and shines markedly both ways.  This is one of the most effective products out there for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it.  Ever.  Really flattens frizzies.  Not for fine hair!  Sometimes I don&#x27;t blow out my hair and I just let it curl and this still keeps the frizzies away.  If they stop making this, I will have to shave my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time on a cruise, and now am so glad I can get it at Amazon.  It works wonders on my dry hair.  I live in Florida and the high humidity causes my hair to be frizzy and uncontrollable.  Not with this balm, it keeps my straight hair in top shape with no frizz.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to go out and have my hair look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> This company sucks... I ordered a product, was sent the wrong item, I sent it back only to have them say THEY did not send it. I have complained to the company, filed a complaint on Amazon, Still NO REFUND. NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would have given it all 5 stars if it were just a little thicker. It&#x27;s so watery that it requires careful capturing in your hand to be sure it makes it to your hair. However, once that&#x27;s successfully accomplished, the end results are beautiful--smooth, shiny curls without the usual frizz!</li>
            <li> It works great!  Holds but  without any  weight, feels clean and light not like most styling creams that are so heavy and  sticky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Phyto for several years and love their line of products.  The Balm is one of my favorites.  Great</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  It&#x27;s the best thing for frizz and curls!</li>
            <li> She loves the stuff.  I guess it does what its supposed to do because her hair sure looks great and if momma is happy Im happy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they changed the formula or product I got was expired but this ain&#x27;t no balm. The content sloshed while inside the tube and you could actually hear the sloshing sound when you shake the tube. Didn&#x27;t even have squeeze the tube after opening it; the contents just poured out like water. And didn&#x27;t work as advertised either. Perhaps the seller is to blame for selling fake products. The seller I got it from was HBC DEPOT.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, where humidity is pretty much the norm, and I have super curly thick hair that usually no matter how much product I use frizzes up by the middle of the day and is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to run this through my hair while wet as suggested use my hair gel to set and my AG hair spray for a little hold and I was done. No more creams, oils etc in the process. The best part my hair stayed frizz free for two entire days. Honestly by the end of day one I had to put it in ponytail because again I live in Florida and it&#x27;s still practically summer here so the heat gets to you especially with thick hair, but my ponytail was still in perfect condition as far as frizz and hold were concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a frizz fighter this is it, and I suggest getting the biggest tube they have because you will never want to be without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also want to mention that the packaging has changed but from what I understand it is still the original formula and same product just an upgraded look.</li>
            <li> I apply this on damp hair and it help control the frizz in my fine hair. Also, it helps with combing, since I have blond hair, it tangles a lot after the wash, so this balm helps with brushing.</li>
            <li> I love my hair straight and this product helps me a lot. It makes blow drying easier and quicker and it only takes a small amount for that.</li>
            <li> This is a gem. The balm is smooth and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and I just bought a new batch.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used and I would highly recommend it.  I swim three days a week and this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> I was a Phyto fan for about a decade. This pricey product was my only saving grace in humid summer months. I purchased some on Amazon and received a completely liquid consistency so I figured I received some expired product. I bought some at a local store that was had the same consistency. After some digging, I&#x27;ve learned that Phyto has changed the formula. It&#x27;s like liquid coming out of the tube, leaves white streaks when it dries if not thoroughly distributed, and does not work nearly as well as the old balm. I&#x27;m looking to switch to a new product. It&#x27;s such a shame because that product was like magic to me before.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and have had trouble finding a product that gives it some shine and control without being gummy or stiff. This is a great product that makes your hair look like it&#x27;s best version without looking overly styled or artificial. None of the stores in my area carry it, so I had to search online. Worth the effort to obtain and well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years now and it&#x27;s great. it relaxed the texture of my hair amazingly! can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> The only product that I have ever used to get rid of the frizz that actually worked!!  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This tube was not the gel it was supposed to be. It poured out like water and didn&#x27;t work as well as the gel, which I&#x27;ve used for years. Probably a knock off, would not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does what it says.I didn&#x27;t expect it to be perfect but it is. My hairs was super dry ,was breaking and frizzy. It is naturally wavy and fine.and I had given up ever straightening it because my hair was breaking off so much. This is really meant for straightening hair but it really protected it . I noticed the difference very first use. And after 3 uses I notice that  it reduced my breakage and every time I use it the change  is drastically improved. I also am using  a deep moisturizing conditioner regularly,but this product puts my hair over the top,makes it super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Phyto Phytodefrisant Hair Relaxing Balm makes my hair more manageable.  When I blow dry my curly hair, it relaxes the curls much more easily.</li>
            <li> This left me with so many white flakes, I cannot even begin to start. It also does not last after your scalp sweats. You may have a better experience, but I had to buy Head &amp; Shoulders to clear my scalp. I do tend to have super sensitive skin, so that could have just been my experience. If you have an event and can&#x27;t get your hair relaxed in time, this is a good stop-gap measure. I bought this because I read that Michelle Obama&#x27;s stylist used it on her, and she has great hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and live in Florida!  Humidity and heat are my enemies :))  I use this product each time I wash my hair and it keeps my hair straight (after drying/using a flat iron) until my next shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for natural curl hair!! I just love it so much. I can touch my hair all day long!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the lightness of this book. It may be a quick read but it packs a punch. As a new push-up practitioner, I was unaware of all of the potential contained in this one exercise. &amp;#34;How To Do More Push-ups&amp;#34; contains not only numerous potential push-up workouts but also options for how to perform the individual push-ups based on your strength level, weak spots, and goals. A lot of info but not overwhelming to the uninitiated. Well-done!</li>
            <li> Almost definitely a knockoff if you buy from the \\&quot;Beauty MAS\\&quot; third-party seller. I&#x27;ve purchased this product from Ulta for the past several years and it&#x27;s always been a thick gel. Like several other reviewers, I found the product from this seller to be thin like water, and it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair. The cheaper price from this seller is indeed too good to be true - don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used ths for years....great for my frizzy, wavy/curly hair. It says it relaxes over time but that is an overstatement, in fact, I use this on days when I let my hair dry naturally, and the waves and curls are still bouncy.  Put it on wet hair before styling and blow dry for glassy, straight hair.  It really is a miracle product, without the oily, greasy, product feeling.  Does it job but feels like nothing when your hair is dry.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A tiny bit goes a very, very long way.  Too much product makes my hair greasy-looking and feeling awful.  Just a dab spread over all my hair before blowdrying helps me to a perfect blow-out that is frizz and static resistant -- even during the summer in the Gulf South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging for shipping: ugh.  Soft tube comes retail-packaged in a flimsy cardstock box.  This box was shipped in a barely-padded envelope.  Whole thing was sqished.  Tube arrived deformed but not torn or opened.</li>
            <li> Packaging insufficient .  Tube was partially crushed, but intact.  Product is usable, so did not complain, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and in humid weather it&#x27;s super thick, wiry and frizzy. Normal boar bristle hairbrushes can&#x27;t even penetrate my hair. My hairdresser can make it look straight and silky though, and I came as close as I ever have to that with this stuff with a blow dryer on high. I&#x27;ve tried many silicones with no luck but this did the trick. Just a small dab on damp clean hair, comb through and blow dry on high. Works even better than leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is one I will never be without. My hair is very dry, thick, coarse, and frizzy. This product works wonders, it makes my hair smooth &amp; silky. You need to apply pretty liberally and HEAT STYLE - that is the key. I usually put the product in my hair, let my hair air dry (it will feel soft at this point, but it won&#x27;t look shiny/silky yet) and then style with my straightening iron - it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use a dab of it with a dab PHYTO phytolisse (serum de finition) on naturally dried hair before I flat iron it.  It seems to penetrate my hair where some products seem to just coat it.  My hair stays smooth, shiny, and very health looking until I wash it again.  I also take the Phyto Food Supplement (Phytophanere) because my hair was falling out several months ago, I believe due to long term dieting.  The food supplement stopped my hair from falling out and regrew what did fall out.  It also made my nails stronger and my nails and eyebrows thicker.  I first found out about PHYTO, when a pharmacist in Barcelona Spain recommended it.  Thanks PHYTO!!</li>
            <li> Great lightweight gel for summer, before swimming to protect hair from chlorine, etc,&lt;br /&gt;although if you wear it all day it tends to get a little flaky by the later afternoon.</li>
            <li> Very very watery, different from the many other tubes I have purchased elsewhere. Not sure if seller added something, or if they just make it more watery now? It seems to work the same, but I don&#x27;t like the consistentcy anymore, comes out like water. Will not order from this vender again.</li>
            <li> I have mildly curly hair and needed something to make it less curly.  This helps relax it well and makes my hair look like I want it to.  Just make sure to follow the instructions to get best results!</li>
            <li> Love products by Phyto, but this one leaves me wanting....The issue is probably due to my hair&#x27;s texture, but I will not use this item again. Sorry.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel heavy and like it needed washing pre-maturely.  You know that feeling, when it starts to itch at temples.  I felt it was this product vs the shampoo and/or conditioner doing it.  As soon as I stopped, my hair felt clean again.  I tend to like light products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel dirty.  What is working in preventing frizzies is this product, ALTERNA BAMBOO Smooth Pure Kendi Oil Pure Treatment Oil, which works beautifully.  Note: I have no affiliation with this product or reason to recommend it other than it works for me!  http://www.amazon.com/ALTERNA-BAMBOO-Smooth-Kendi-Treatment/dp/B0045WBFAI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396720679&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;bamboo+kendi+oil</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  No frizz and my hair is super straight after blow drying.  Smells good too!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not made with hold in mind, so I usually create a hair gel cocktail.  I use a 50/50 mix with a gel that has a littler more body. This way I get the smoothing, straightening effect of this product plus more hold.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have tried, creams, sprays, gels and other forms of hair smoothing products. They all leave a film on the hair. This one does not and leave my hair super shiny and soft but it gives it body so I can set my hair on hot curlers and get the wave or curl I want without the frizz. Holds up beautifully in humid weather too.</li>
            <li> This product is not only wonderful but you can&#x27;t beat the price. I was amazed that I found it on Amazon I got this product on a cruise I went on. It worked so well I tried to find it in the local beauty supply stores and was not successful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Put it in hair before I style it and after I am done. Only need a little. I love it</li>
            <li> Well, I guess it works...but I need 2 palm-fulls of the product in order to straighten my not even shoulder-length, frizzy (but not curly) hair.  I think there is something wrong with the bottle I received.  The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; is extremely watery -- after reading some reviews online I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s supposed to be watery at all.  It just pours out when I open the lid.  I think if the product was the correct consistency, it would work really well.  Perhaps the supplier stored it at the incorrect temperature?  I don&#x27;t know...</li>
            <li> This makes a huge difference on my hair in controlling frizz and flyaways.  I love this stuff.  A little goes a long way.  I have long blonde hair and use it every time after I have washed my hair prior to blow drying or air drying.  It does not weigh my hair down.  Gives my hair shine.  If you are skeptical, try it at Sephora first (no hassle return policy &amp; they give samples).  The price was a much better deal on Amazon.  It came fast.</li>
            <li> The is a great product.  I plan on buying again.  A friend bought a tube on a cruise and let me borrow this product.  I have very curly/frizzy hair.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s thick and coarse.  I read the great reviews and was hoping this would help relax my curl a bit and/or keep frizz at bay, but it does neither.  Instead, even the smallest amount makes my hair greasy (when I wear it curly or straighten it)...yet it&#x27;s still frizzy, with no defined curls when I wear it curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I air dry my hair when I wear it curly, or flat iron it when I wear it straight, so perhaps results with a blow out would be different (but I go to a professional for blow outs).  Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> It really worked out very well and the product seems to be well liked by customers and the feel of the product on the hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and purchased it from Ulta.  I have always been happy with the results.  I tried this as the price was too good to be true, and it was.  I doubt very much this is the authentic product.  The consistency is like water, it just pours out of the tube.  It did nothing for my hair, after blow drying my hair was dry and frizzy.  It didn&#x27;t come in a box, just the tube with plastic wrap on it.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s very curly and tends to frizz if I try to fight the curl.  But sometimes I want a good blowout and this product really helps with that.  I don&#x27;t like gels or mousses that leave a crunch.  This doesn&#x27;t.  I can use it to style curly and my curls stay soft but frizz-free, or I can use it when I blow my hair dry and I rarely even need to use a flat iron.  A little goes a long way, which is nice.  But the price is still very steep for the size of the product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It was recommended to be by my stylist (of course he wanted me to purchase it in the salon for A LOT MORE $$.) I use it right out of the shower as it gives my color treated hair both an extra boost of shine and also provides a barrier between my hair and the heat from blow-drying and straighteners or curling irons. For day-to-day extra conditioning I also use [[ASIN:B000MPFHB0 Phyto Phytomist Conditioner-5.07 oz.]] as well for the days where I&#x27;m not washing my hair but want to re-style it (or simply add a little extra shine.)</li>
            <li> I also have very thick, long, dry, frizzy hair. I purchased this product at a retail outlet a while ago to see if it would help when I blow dry and flat iron my hair.  I tried it several times and didn&#x27;t see any improvement.  Since then I&#x27;ve had a professional keratin treatment.  Now that the keratin is starting to wear off I thought I&#x27;d give Phyto one last try.  I applied it rather liberally after shampoo and conditioner.  Used the blow dryer and flat iron, and it came out worse than it would had I not used it at all.  I gave it one last final try and put some on dry hair this morning before using a curling iron, and again it came out worse than had I not used it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since other reviewers have mentioned this, my product wasn&#x27;t a balm, but more like a gel consistency, not watery, not greasy.</li>
