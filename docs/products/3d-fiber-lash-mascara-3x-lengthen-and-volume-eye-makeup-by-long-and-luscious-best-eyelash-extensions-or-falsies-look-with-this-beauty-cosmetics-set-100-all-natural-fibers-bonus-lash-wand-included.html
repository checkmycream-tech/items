            <li>I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li>I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>In my experience with 3D Lash products, it is best to have a steady hand, or as you apply the fibers, they can fall into your eye.</li>
            <li>It becomes very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the smoothness of the gel mascara and higher intesity it gave and that the fibers went on easily and didn&#x27;t get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Have used more effective 3D mascara</li>
            <li>Love it, still getting use to it.</li>
            <li>Really an interesting concept</li>
            <li>So as you use more often, you&#x27;ll find your favorite way to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>#4 - Apply more Lash Gel, to assist in setting your fibers in place.</li>
            <li>(I prefer to do this 2x just to be sure it is set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and fuller.o be sure it is</li>
            <li>satisfied the fibers got all over my eyes</li>
            <li>The cheaper versions are actually better</li>
            <li>I love the case.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I got an awesome discounted price for my Long &amp; Lucious Mascara</li>
            <li>Defintely excited!</li>
            <li>Also the  case it all is in upon arrival was more than what was expecting and the instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and so great.</li>
            <li>steps are easy and as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Some fibers do fall onto your cheeks during application but brush off easily.</li>
            <li>she loved it highly recommend</li>
            <li>I also really liked the pretty case that came with it -</li>
            <li>Not to mention, I&#x27;m pretty sure my smash box mascara looks better than the 3D fiber lashes anyways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used black as that&#x27;s what works best to make my lashes bold and outline my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that this mascara held up throughout the day&#x27;s events, and did not even &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; during the couple of hot flashes I had.  </li>
            <li>worth it to me!</li>
            <li>Packaging is beautiful, the mascara comes in this neat black case so you can easily throw it in your purse when on the go</li>
            <li>Special note:  </li>
            <li>Cool product.</li>
            <li>But the instructions that came were clear enough that I was able to get a great look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my lashes that full bodied look that they need.</li>
            <li>Love this product it really works.</li>
            <li>üé§üé§üé§üé∂üé∂üé∂üëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèømakes my eyelash full and thicker.</li>
            <li>It did show some increase in the length to my eyelashes, but I only used it twice because each time I got more and more of the fibers on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It has a nice dark color and you can wear one coat for daytime drama or add additional coats for more evening drama.</li>
            <li>Great stuff but a little work, but</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s much easier, therefore leaving me free of needing to brush the fibers off.</li>
            <li>So, far I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about trying this product, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about all the loose fibers.</li>
            <li>The product also easily removes with your normal soap and water.</li>
            <li>Right after applying the gel, grab the fibers and apply them midshaft to ends.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, packaging fine and liked the little box in came on, makes easier to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>It is a great product in my opinion, but I recommend you follow the directions as stated in the small pamphlet in the package.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for all those out there that desire a more full and long eye lash look.</li>
            <li>When it is humid, they will more likely stick to your face.</li>
            <li>but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend more money on it.  </li>
            <li>It was delievered exactly when they said it would be.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>so I was interested to try this and compare.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only saved me money, my lashes look better.</li>
            <li>Until now, the only mascara I could find that works good enough was from Avon.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that it is made with 100% all natural fibers made with green tea.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very luxurious.</li>
            <li>If the fibers wouldn&#x27;t go all over, including in my eyes, I&#x27;d really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>An avid Amazon shopper who relies on online reviews for my own shopping decisions, I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the fibers kept getting into my eyes and making them get dry and turn red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of this kind of mascara before, you layer it on OVER your usual product.  </li>
            <li>The more humid the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to brush the fibers away from the face.</li>
            <li>It came tightly packaged in a cute box with intructions.</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more vavavoom in my look and this mascara gave it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I naturally have very think eyelashes</li>
            <li>It is normal when applying the fibers, for some to fall below the eye, and onto the face.</li>
            <li>#3 - Slide the Fiber applicator up along the prepped lashes as you would normally proceed when applying your mascara.</li>
            <li>I normally use Younique</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like it was too much or too little for the application I did but felt comfortable with it which is what I want in makeup products</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always trying to find new products to add to my kit.</li>
            <li>This product performed better than expected and I only put on one coat.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin and eyes and no reactions from these products!</li>
            <li>like the fullness that this product created but not enough with the clumping to rate it higher.</li>
            <li>You can have the look you want hassle free simply by putting on Long and Lushes when you do your normal morning make up routine.</li>
            <li>Looks so natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true if you&#x27;re irritant with fibers getting into your eyes, you may want to either hold/put a mirror on your lap/dresser and look down on the mirror when applying the fibers</li>
            <li>It comes in such a classy box and looks really high end (and is).</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I was able to get it on a discount promotion</li>
            <li>This particular item comes with an extra lash brush which is helpful if you need to comb through any clumps.</li>
            <li>I used to get my lashes extended every two weeks and would actually go damn near broke doing it.  </li>
            <li>Fiber mascara can be a little tricky at first to use, but I&#x27;ve learned that if you put your regular mascara on first (don&#x27;t let it dry) then apply the lash gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister as she has very sensitive eyes and regular mascara turns her eyes puffy and red, this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the handy little sheet enclosed (thank you!) and applied this over a small mirror on the sink.  </li>
            <li>I have long eye lashes as it is but Long &amp; Lushes mascara really accentuated them and gave them an even fuller, longer look.</li>
            <li>It may seem like extra work at first, but I assure you once you&#x27;ve used it a few times, it really only adds maybe a minute to your daily routine.</li>
            <li>Makes such a dramatic and full look!   </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, still getting use to it. So, far I love the results.  Arrived on time, packaging fine and liked the little box in came on, makes easier to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> The length and visibility of lashes - whoa dude.  I&#x27;d never heard of this kind of mascara before, you layer it on OVER your usual product.  Really an interesting concept and I can see myself using this product instead of fake lashes, which annoy me due to their weight on my eyelids.  Cool product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I was able to get it on a discount promotion so I thought &amp;#34;why not try it&amp;#34; and was amazed by the results. Very happy with this product and have recommended it to my friends and will buy again.</li>
            <li> The tube was already finished within 3 days. It is no good. Do not buy</li>
            <li> I used these with a discount for my opinion and they worked well. I was very impressed by the smoothness of the gel mascara and higher intesity it gave and that the fibers went on easily and didn&#x27;t get into my eyes. Also the  case it all is in upon arrival was more than what was expecting and the instructions were easy to follow. Even though it was 3 I didn&#x27;t feel like it was too much or too little for the application I did but felt comfortable with it which is what I want in makeup products and I have sensitive skin and eyes and no reactions from these products!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous trying something like this, but I&#x27;m so happy I did! I wanted a little more vavavoom in my look and this mascara gave it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a little bit of a learning curve, I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to do it with dropping the fibers all over. But the instructions that came were clear enough that I was able to get a great look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long the set will last, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as she has very sensitive eyes and regular mascara turns her eyes puffy and red, this stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product &amp;#34;Long &amp; Luscious&amp;#34; is the third 3D Lash product I&#x27;ve ever tried. It is a great product in my opinion, but I recommend you follow the directions as stated in the small pamphlet in the package. My lashes are blonde in color and very hard to see without mascara, or use of a 3D lash product. In my experience with 3D Lash products, it is best to have a steady hand, or as you apply the fibers, they can fall into your eye. It is normal when applying the fibers, for some to fall below the eye, and onto the face. For that, I prefer to have a piece of paper, or even a cotton cloth to hold below my lower lashes as I apply the fiber application - to avoid any fibers falling onto my face. For me it&#x27;s much easier, therefore leaving me free of needing to brush the fibers off. Sometimes that can be difficult depending on humidity. The more humid the atmosphere, the more difficult it is to brush the fibers away from the face. When it is humid, they will more likely stick to your face. Or another method would be to prepare your lashes before adding any other makeup to your face, then you can just take a wet washcloth, cotton makeup cloth, or even a baby wipe across your face to remove any fibers that have fallen down past your lashes. The fibers that fall aren&#x27;t anything that you can avoid, it&#x27;s part of the process. So as you use more often, you&#x27;ll find your favorite way to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The steps are easy and as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Step #1 - Apply your regular mascara, or Lash primer&lt;br /&gt;Step #2 - Apply the Lash Gel (this would be the longer of the two tubes included in your set)&lt;br /&gt;Step #3 - Slide the Fiber applicator up along the prepped lashes as you would normally proceed when applying your mascara. (I also like to carefully place the fiber applicator on the lash area closest to my eye lid, therefor applying on both sides off the lashes for a thicker look)&lt;br /&gt;Step #4 - Apply more Lash Gel, to assist in setting your fibers in place. (I prefer to do this 2x just to be sure it is set)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can follow this with a mascara/eyelash comb to separate your lashes as needed or preferred.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience it is my preference to not place the fiber wand back into the tube for at least 30 seconds after application to allow any transferred Lash Gel to dry. I also agree with the instructions regarding only doing ONE eye at a time. I appreciate the look this Long &amp; Luscious 3D Lash product gives to my eyes. With blonde eyelashes, it is so difficult to extend my normal lashes.

            <li> Honestly, the fibers kept getting into my eyes and making them get dry and turn red. Not to mention, I&#x27;m pretty sure my smash box mascara looks better than the 3D fiber lashes anyways. I guess it could be worse but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend more money on it.  Even when I asked my family to guess which eye had on the expensive 3d fiber mascara, they guessed my normal mascara instead.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> im not at all satisfied the fibers got all over my eyes and it is a horrible product over all</li>
            <li> The fibers were too loose and kept falling in my eyes... The cheaper versions are actually better</li>
            <li> I really love this 3D mascara! I naturally have very think eyelashes and they are blond so even harder to see. I&#x27;ve always used black as that&#x27;s what works best to make my lashes bold and outline my eyes. I have to say a word about how beautiful the packaging of this set is! It comes in such a classy box and looks really high end (and is). It is a well made product and works great. It gives my lashes that full bodied look that they need. Really happy with the purchase and loved the customer service - they sent me e-mails to follow up to ensure I was really, truly happy. Hard to find in this day and age. Will buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara. Makes such a dramatic and full look!   I got an awesome discounted price for my Long &amp; Lucious Mascara so I could try it out myself and review - so thankful!  Packaging is beautiful, the mascara comes in this neat black case so you can easily throw it in your purse when on the go and it keeps the set together very nicely.   Everyone girl needs one!</li>
            <li> After having damaged eye lashes from getting lash extension, I decided to go a different route and try out some 3D mascara. I LOVE THIS STUFF! My lashes look as full as what they do whenever I wear strip lashes, and I&#x27;m impressed at the length too! I&#x27;m a celebrity hair and makeup artist so I&#x27;m always trying to find new products to add to my kit. This will for sure be one of them!  Fiber mascara can be a little tricky at first to use, but I&#x27;ve learned that if you put your regular mascara on first (don&#x27;t let it dry) then apply the lash gel. Right after applying the gel, grab the fibers and apply them midshaft to ends. If you have your head tilted downwards, the fibers won&#x27;t sprinkle on your face. After applying the fibers, put a coat of the gel over top to seal them in! You can keep going back and forth with the gel and fibers until the desired length is achieved! It may take a couple tried to get the hang of it, but once you do you&#x27;ll be in love too!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter she loved it highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and my eyelashes have been slowly diminishing in length and quantity over the last 5 years or so. Until now, the only mascara I could find that works good enough was from Avon. I won&#x27;t be purchasing that product again. I&#x27;m not looking for mega lashes. I&#x27;m just want lashes. This product performed better than expected and I only put on one coat. That&#x27;s enough for me. It took me all of 2 minutes to do my lashes compared to my usual time of 6-8 minutes and multiple coats and the need to separate them. This is self separating if you put the gel on as you separate them with the brush. I received this product at a reduced price for testing, evaluation and review purposes but I&#x27;ve now found my forever mascara. The packaging is very luxurious. I love the case. You will too.</li>
            <li> Finally got the hang of it...Looks so natural and it last all day. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Really make your lashes beautiful!</li>
            <li> After my own mascara and TWO applications of this, I had longer lashes.  However, it does not compare to just one application of more expensive brand 3d fiber and gel application. If you&#x27;re spending the money, spend the extra $10.</li>
            <li> It was delievered exactly when they said it would be. It came tightly packaged in a cute box with intructions. Cant wait to go home and try it out! Defintely excited!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear mascara (or much makeup at all) but when I need to dress up, I need mascara.  My hair is naturally red, so my eyelashes are blond and just not noticeable.  I followed the directions on the handy little sheet enclosed (thank you!) and applied this over a small mirror on the sink.  Some stuff did fall off and land on my cheek, but I have always had that happen with regular mascara too.  I was pleased that this mascara held up throughout the day&#x27;s events, and did not even &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; during the couple of hot flashes I had.  I also really liked the pretty case that came with it - I am much less likely to lose the mascara since it is in a case.  All in all, I definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Special note:  I am often provided a sample for review and testing at a discounted price.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. An avid Amazon shopper who relies on online reviews for my own shopping decisions, I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  Have a Blessed Day!</li>
            <li> Definitely better than regular mascara. The fibers get everywhere. Follow specific directions for this product. Have used more effective 3D mascara but this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works.</li>
            <li> Great stuff but a little work, but worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I like the volume that this mascara provides but in honesty the clumping is a factor. When i comb through the lashes to remove the clumps the extended area is also removed and I need to re apply. The packaging looks inexpensive for the price that is being paid as well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fullness that this product created but not enough with the clumping to rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about all the loose fibers. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times, and no matter how careful I apply it, I get the fibers in my eyes. Then, I&#x27;m unable to put in my contacts because my eyes are irritated. It did show some increase in the length to my eyelashes, but I only used it twice because each time I got more and more of the fibers on my cheeks. Even after time throughout the day, I had fibers fall off onto my face, which made it look like dirt or something was on my face. I was careful to follow directions,such as apply leaning over a mirror so the fibers fall down, and to use my mascara first, then the gel, then the fibers then the gel again. I did a get a little clumping on the second application,but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. If the fibers wouldn&#x27;t go all over, including in my eyes, I&#x27;d really like this product.</li>
            <li> The fiber do not stay on my lashes. By the end of the day I look like  raccoon. I really wanted to like it. And the shipping took over 12 days to get here.</li>
            <li> Uh oh it&#x27;s magic, you know! üé§üé§üé§üé∂üé∂üé∂üëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèøüëçüèømakes my eyelash full and thicker. The advice I got from other post kinda helped me a lot. (Than You for that) üëçüèø. It&#x27;s true if you&#x27;re irritant with fibers getting into your eyes, you may want to either hold/put a mirror on your lap/dresser and look down on the mirror when applying the fibers and you&#x27;ll actually see the fibers falls on the mirror instead of getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li> The fibers get in my eyes. I can not wear this mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and I love it. I have long eye lashes as it is but Long &amp; Lushes mascara really accentuated them and gave them an even fuller, longer look. I&#x27;ve received numerous complements on my eye lashes just since wearing it today. I recommend this product for all those out there that desire a more full and long eye lash look. The great thing is that it is made with 100% all natural fibers made with green tea. You don&#x27;t have to wear falsies or go get eye extensions. You can have the look you want hassle free simply by putting on Long and Lushes when you do your normal morning make up routine. The application of it took only a few minutes and the instructions given are very simple.  I&#x27;ve included before and after photos for you to see. #1) no mascara, #2) regular mascara coat &amp; #3) Long and Lushes mascara</li>
            <li> I received the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Long and Luscious. I normally use Younique so I was interested to try this and compare. They&#x27;re very similar. This particular item comes with an extra lash brush which is helpful if you need to comb through any clumps. It may seem like extra work at first, but I assure you once you&#x27;ve used it a few times, it really only adds maybe a minute to your daily routine. It becomes very easy to use. You simply apply your mascara, then their gel mascara, then brush on some fibers, the gel again, and repeat as desired. I found that one coat of fibers was enough for me. Some fibers do fall onto your cheeks during application but brush off easily. The product also easily removes with your normal soap and water. It has a nice dark color and you can wear one coat for daytime drama or add additional coats for more evening drama. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I. LOOOOVVEEE this product!! I used to get my lashes extended every two weeks and would actually go damn near broke doing it.  My friend introduced me to this product and I was SOLD!!! It&#x27;s not only saved me money, my lashes look better. It&#x27;s all natural and so great.</li>
