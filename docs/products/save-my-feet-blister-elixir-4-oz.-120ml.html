            <li>Best way to judge doneness is by a dry, velvety feel.</li>
            <li>I love it, but wish it was available in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Use a teaspoon&#x27;s worth per foot and apply it more like you would a glaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several years and it is the most amazing stuff out there for women (or men for that matter).</li>

            <li>Be sure to put it on clean feet and then let it dry before putting shoes on.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Daughter got her first out of college job and with that came the need to wear heels all the time.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to wear the prettiest shoes that match my outfit exactly, and not suffer the consequences</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it says.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safer to just smooth it all over the general</li>
            <li>This product is seriously amazing - absolutely necessary, especially for summer shoes.</li>
            <li>Yep, this stuff really works...</li>
            <li>After using the elixir, I had absolutely no rubbing or irritation after wearing the shoes for more than five hours.  </li>
            <li>I have reviewed this product before, but it really works on protecting your feet from rubbing shoes.  </li>
            <li>it is worth every penny and more and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I did reapply about two-thirds of the way through the day, but that&#x27;s a small trade off for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is almost like I am a normal person.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Our daughters used it to keep from getting blisters when they bought new boots.</li>
            <li>After a weekend of walking around in new and quite ridiculous heels, I was still blister free.</li>
            <li>I do have to reapply it more often than it says but it is well worth it and less expensive than the prescription ointments.</li>

            <li> The first time, I was sparing and rubbed the stuff in hard.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> so the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And this year I was really worried because I had bought new Birkenstocks and because of the cold spring had not gotten a chance to properly break them in.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy such an expensive product, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> After that I can spend the day walking the louvre or Versailles without a single blister.</li>
            <li> Now that sandal weather is here, I will put it on my feet every single day.  </li>
            <li> If you put it on and let it dry, it makes 4 hours shoes into 8 hour shoes!</li>
            <li> Plus only a small amount lasts the entire day</li>
            <li> I treat it just like lotion, put it on my feet in the morning and give it a few minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on new shoes and ridiculously expensive shoes</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little thicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little miracle worker.</li>
            <li> and I thought it might be helpful to offer a few observations based on trial-and-error experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I carry a small container in my purse too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it does it, because it is not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts about 1-2 years, as you don&#x27;t use but a small amount on spots where you tend to get sores from shoes.</li>
            <li> Wait at least 15 minutes before you put on shoes.</li>
            <li> It was a little expensive, but I used it a majority of the three weeks</li>
            <li> EVERYONE should have this - no more bandages on heels!!</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of plastering my ankles with protective tape just to wear dressier shoes to work, so I decided to give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> It even helps people who wear thongs or flip flops that rub the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Also, a painful callus between the toes is now painless.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several years and it is the most amazing stuff out there for women (or men for that matter). I use it on new shoes and ridiculously expensive shoes I&#x27;ve had and could never wear. Every woman needs to have a bottle at work, home, the car and a travel size...it is worth every penny and more and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is sold to do.  I bought some for a friend as well and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> This product is seriously amazing - absolutely necessary, especially for summer shoes. I can&#x27;t believe how perfectly it works. I used to always get blisters whenever wearing shoes without socks; now never. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This cream will keep your feet from getting blisters from strappy sandals. I wouldn&#x27;t live without it.  My daughter does Irish dance and uses it before her classes and competitions with great success.</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever found to prevent new shoe blisters. Our daughters used it to keep from getting blisters when they bought new boots.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product! Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Yep, this stuff really works...and I thought it might be helpful to offer a few observations based on trial-and-error experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Per the words of Greta Garbo, don&#x27;t be stingy, baby. The first time, I was sparing and rubbed the stuff in hard. Mistake. Use a teaspoon&#x27;s worth per foot and apply it more like you would a glaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t try to spot-dab by guessing where a blister might erupt. It&#x27;s safer to just smooth it all over the general area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Wait at least 15 minutes before you put on shoes. This is key. No idea why, but the barrier concoction seems to need time to set itself up on your skin. Best way to judge doneness is by a dry, velvety feel.</li>
            <li> This product is the best at protecting your feet.  I can wear all kinds of shoes without fear of blisters.  Plus only a small amount lasts the entire day so the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands, this is the best. Works with all shoes.</li>
            <li> I was always getting sore areas and blisters on my feet when not wearing socks or hose. Started using this and it works! Just make sure to put it on and wait about 15-20 min before putting on shoes for best result. I carry a small container in my purse too.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST non blister lotion I have ever used.  I use it on my feet before I put on my socks and hiking boots and or tennis shoes for a work out or walk.  It is also wonderful for your bare feet before sandals or new shoes, pumps, flip flops, anything.  You will never get a cut or blister again with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Peaches and Boo Boo antiblister cream is the perfect solution for the woman, or man who wants to be hose free but gets sores from not wearing socks or stockings with shoes. It even helps people who wear thongs or flip flops that rub the wrong way. The working woman who must wear heels every day will be most grateful for this product. Be sure to put it on clean feet and then let it dry before putting shoes on.</li>
            <li> I have a rare skin disorder called Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex. It causes blisters on my hands and feet with the slightest heat and friction. Walking has always been a struggle regardless of the shoes I wear especially in the summer. I have been using Save My Feet for a year now and it has made my life so much better. It is almost like I am a normal person. This stuff is great. I do have to reapply it more often than it says but it is well worth it and less expensive than the prescription ointments.</li>
            <li> This is so great for preventing blisters.  Also, a painful callus between the toes is now painless.  It only takes the smallest amount, so a bottle lasts for years.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave everyone some before her wedding in Vegas.  After a weekend of walking around in new and quite ridiculous heels, I was still blister free. This is now one of my go-to gifts for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I lead a study abroad class for three weeks in Europe. We walk ALOT. The plague of the trip is always the blisters that I get. I was looking for something that could help, and I have found it. I treat it just like lotion, put it on my feet in the morning and give it a few minutes to dry. After that I can spend the day walking the louvre or Versailles without a single blister. And this year I was really worried because I had bought new Birkenstocks and because of the cold spring had not gotten a chance to properly break them in. Not to worry peaches and boo did the job. It was a little expensive, but I used it a majority of the three weeks I was on the trip and only used about a third of the bottle. I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy such an expensive product, but it is worth it.  I used it when wearing a new pair of patent leather sandals that rubbed the top of my foot.  After using the elixir, I had absolutely no rubbing or irritation after wearing the shoes for more than five hours.  I hope it works as well in 90 degree summer weather.  I love it, but wish it was available in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for babies and children&#x27;s tender feet, too.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE should have this - no more bandages on heels!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff to save your feet from blisters.  Wish it were a little thicker. Holds up for about 4 hours and you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of plastering my ankles with protective tape just to wear dressier shoes to work, so I decided to give this product a shot. It&#x27;s a little miracle worker. I had my low heals on without socks all day and didn&#x27;t have to use any tape. I&#x27;m not sure how it does it, because it is not oily or greasy at all. I did reapply about two-thirds of the way through the day, but that&#x27;s a small trade off for such a great product. I&#x27;m going to tell all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Daughter got her first out of college job and with that came the need to wear heels all the time.  Someone recommended this and after a week of the misery that comes with breaking your feet into heels, this arrived from Amazon.  She reports that it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift for Christmas one year. The bottle lasts about 1-2 years, as you don&#x27;t use but a small amount on spots where you tend to get sores from shoes. If you put it on and let it dry, it makes 4 hours shoes into 8 hour shoes! It allows me to wear the prettiest shoes that match my outfit exactly, and not suffer the consequences</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says.  My shoes also stay on better with this.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this product before, but it really works on protecting your feet from rubbing shoes.  Now that sandal weather is here, I will put it on my feet every single day.  You will be suprised at how good your heels look as a by product of the cream.</li>
