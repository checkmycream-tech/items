            <li>and it&#x27;s 100 times better.</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments on how cute their hair is.</li>
            <li>sure if I Google this product, I will find a ton of styles to try.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>These are wonderful to do so many different hair styles!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to know how I do it, and they get the greatest familiar smile when I tell them about this gadget.</li>
            <li>very flimsy and cheap plastic, better off to make my own.</li>
            <li>The little one works perfect for toddlers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(But for $1.97 and free shipping</li>
            <li>Just burn your money, both of these cheap knock offs broke before they were used.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>I think the real topsytail was better quality and worked better.</li>
            <li>But there seems to be a plastic seam right at the top of the circle, so when you pull the hair through, it stresses that seam.  </li>
            <li>This item might have been a re-produced version of the original.</li>
            <li>buy the original topsy tail</li>
            <li>I remember making my mom order the original topsy tail off of the t.v.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this.</li>
            <li>The first time I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (who&#x27;s hair is fine)</li>
            <li>i have been able to do so many different styles</li>
            <li>It is worth the inexpensive price you pay.</li>
            <li>I kind of kick myself for not getting one earlier.</li>
            <li>This is a fun tool</li>
            <li>it didnt worth the money ..</li>
            <li>Both pieces broke the first time we tried to use them.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, but it broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Both pieces broke the first time I used them on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>this this cool little tool my kids love it to &#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think these little gadgets are great and very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This little tool is so cool, because it makes your normal ponytail look elegant.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it--get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>it works, it&#x27;s just really flimsy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, can I really complain?)&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t it very sturdy</li>
            <li>But I figured out on my own that the small tool which has a small hole on the bottom is good for when you&#x27;re doing a \\&quot;Topsy</li>
            <li>This tool does work as described, but it is very flimsy and I am pretty sure it will break if I try to pull it too hard.  </li>
            <li>It made the look much more tight &amp; clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These two Topsy Tails are what I had hoped they would be in that they are very flexible and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I do my 6yr old daughter&#x27;s hair a lot.  </li>
            <li>so it cant hold the her in a good way to pull it down , ita was hard using it</li>
            <li>I knew they wouldn&#x27;t last too long with the low price, but to have them break on the first attempt is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old reluctantly will allow me to do her hair, but 30 minutes later all bows, ponies, or headbands are nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li>I use the smaller one for my 2 year old twin girls&#x27; hair every day</li>
            <li>I use them on both my daughters- one with fine curly hair and the other with thick straight hair.</li>
            <li>It popped right in half the 2nd time we used it.</li>
            <li>I have had it for only about a week and use it on my 6 year old daughter who has long hair to her bottom</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the first one I bought broke within a few times use (the smaller one).</li>

            <li> The smaller one is too small to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has hair down to her waist).  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money paid.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great for all hair types. The only thing is that the first one I bought broke within a few times use (the smaller one). I bought a new one. It is worth the inexpensive price you pay. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Both pieces broke the first time we tried to use them.  We were not able to pull any hair through the loops without them breaking.  I knew they wouldn&#x27;t last too long with the low price, but to have them break on the first attempt is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. Attempting to twist my hair was nearly impossible without it breaking.</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was a teenager. I had long hair and put it up in a ponytail all the time during the summer months. This little tool is so cool, because it makes your normal ponytail look elegant.</li>
            <li> Been looking everywhere for this product.</li>
            <li> These styling tool are just a little rugged pulls the hair when applying but once they are in position it makes a beautiful hair style</li>
            <li> I do my 6yr old daughter&#x27;s hair a lot.  She loves having her hair done &amp; not just in a typical way. I can do the \\&quot;Topsy Tail\\&quot; without the tool but I figured I&#x27;d get it and try it out. It worked great.  I kind of kick myself for not getting one earlier. It made the look much more tight &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;The directions that come with the tool are small pictures &amp; in a foreign language; so not helpful or useful in tips.  But I figured out on my own that the small tool which has a small hole on the bottom is good for when you&#x27;re doing a \\&quot;Topsy Tail\\&quot; and you have hair that you don&#x27;t put in it but you want pulled through where your \\&quot;flipped\\&quot; portion is. I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense but it worked great.  And even better it was much quicker and less painful for my daughter than having my fingers try &amp; separate and pull hair through.</li>
            <li> The bigger one of the two broke the 2nd time we used it.  It broke at the top of the loop.  The smaller one is too small to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair (she has hair down to her waist).  Good thing I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it--get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love the two sizes and they work well.  Would order again.  I use them on both my daughters- one with fine curly hair and the other with thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> This works o.k. in my hair and it is a good thing it has pictures for direction because I can&#x27;t read the language the directions was written in.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but it broke the first time I tried to use it. The plastic loops are not durable and snapped when I tried to pull my hair through.</li>
            <li> I got them n before i got to use them they broke very poorly made very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This item would be great if it was durable. After only 4 times using the large tool it broke, the small one is still working but it doesn&#x27;t work well on lots of hair.</li>
            <li> These two Topsy Tails are what I had hoped they would be in that they are very flexible and soft. No complaints here...</li>
            <li> i have been able to do so many different styles this this cool little tool my kids love it to &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;they say its better cause now i dont have to try and force there hair into a topsytail</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the mini. I love doing topsy tails for my daughter. Directions were in Chinese, but I believe anyone ordering it knows what to do.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! &#x3D;) I will be ordering more soon for gifts to my daughter and friends.... they are so handy to have!!!</li>
            <li> These came from Korea and took about 4 weeks.  My granddaughter finally got them in the mail.  It just took to long.</li>
            <li> I have looked for yrs for one of these, I bought 2 so I would have them for a long time. This is a fun tool and I recommend to all who have long hair.</li>
            <li> not sturdy enough to flip hair</li>
            <li> This item might have been a re-produced version of the original. The ponytail tool broke after 1 use. The braider tool broke after 2 uses. Thank goodness the total price including shipping was under $6.00 but I still feel like I through my money away. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This tool does work as described, but it is very flimsy and I am pretty sure it will break if I try to pull it too hard.  I use mine to pull my french braid inside out so it looks like an up-do.  All of the packaging is in Chinese(?), but you can figure it out by the pictures.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a zero I would.  Both pieces broke the first time I used them on my daughters hair.  They are flimsy and made of plastic.  Not worth the money paid.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did...buy the original topsy tail it works much better.</li>
            <li> This item is ok...it works, it&#x27;s just really flimsy. I think the real topsytail was better quality and worked better.</li>
            <li> I have had it for only about a week and use it on my 6 year old daughter who has long hair to her bottom and it is a little thick, it couldn&#x27;t handle her hair, broke the first smaller one first use and the bigger one the other day :( very flimsy and cheap plastic, better off to make my own.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old reluctantly will allow me to do her hair, but 30 minutes later all bows, ponies, or headbands are nowhere to be found. This gives her enough of a challenge to keep her hair done for at least 4 hours. The plastic is very thin and bendable, in the hands of a toddler it doesn&#x27;t have a chance. Be sure to keep it out of reach.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really good for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very angry and disappointed in the 2pcs hair ponytail styling tool set (pink). The first time I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (who&#x27;s hair is fine) it broke. Guess you get what you pay for. [[ASIN:B005HAU77O 2pcs Hair Braid Braider Ponytail Styling Tool Set (Pink)]]</li>
            <li> Bummer!  Headline says it all.  Shouldn&#x27;t have wasted our money.  Bought similar product @ CVS and it&#x27;s 100 times better.</li>
            <li> it didnt worth the money .. it was a bad quality and it is very soft so it cant hold the her in a good way to pull it down , ita was hard using it</li>
            <li> I remember making my mom order the original topsy tail off of the t.v. when it first came out. I was so excited to find this. I use the smaller one for my 2 year old twin girls&#x27; hair every day and I always get compliments on how cute their hair is. Everyone wants to know how I do it, and they get the greatest familiar smile when I tell them about this gadget.</li>
            <li> The little one works perfect for toddlers.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughters ahair and have been using them everytime I fix her hair, awesome product, good seller, recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I do think these little gadgets are great and very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for this item in stores and never found it...Thanks Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed with the packaging because it is in Chinese and the pictures are so tiny on the packaging that I cannot really follow some of the other more intricate hairstyles for my 6 year old.&lt;br /&gt;(But for $1.97 and free shipping, can I really complain?)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if I Google this product, I will find a ton of styles to try.&lt;br /&gt;Just a nice way to finish off my daughter&#x27;s hair and not have that darn ponytail band sticking out of the top of her head!!</li>
            <li> Just burn your money, both of these cheap knock offs broke before they were used. How? By removing a bit of excess plastic.</li>
            <li> Made of very cheap, flimsy plastic. Broke the first time I tried to use it. Do not purchase this product! It is a piece of junk!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful to do so many different hair styles! My daughter is always getting so many compliments on her hair!</li>
            <li> I got mine today and immediately used on my Lil girls hair when I opened it it looked very cheap n thought this is guna break but it didn&#x27;t it very sturdy n I love it I definitely would purchase again if needed</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was in great condition.  But there seems to be a plastic seam right at the top of the circle, so when you pull the hair through, it stresses that seam.  It popped right in half the 2nd time we used it.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I received the product later than promised.  Now I have to buy the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;</li>
