            <li>The  oil is good quality and priced well.</li>
            <li>And aromatherapy is great in many circumstances.</li>
            <li>This is perhaps a nice fragrance to diffuse in your home, but used in the laundry,</li>
            <li>Nice aroma.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and can&#x27;t wait to use it in my lotions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to make the recipes yet, but I have to say this scent would not be a favorite.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that there are labels on the top of the cap.</li>
            <li>I used this oil in combination with others for a facial moisturizer and it works great!  </li>
            <li>I look forward to diffusing it more.</li>
            <li>It stimulates my senses for sure.</li>
            <li>Essential Oil is a great help for many things.</li>
            <li>I really was hoping that this would be a light rosy-floral scent, but to me it smells kind of like flowery furniture polish.  </li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Essential Oils  are great.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that this is a real oil and of top quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, much stronger than I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It is really powerful!</li>
            <li>Researched Amazon for the best product for my hard earned money and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for laundry use with a house full of boys.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, when it&#x27;s blended with other oils, the end result will be great.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I needed, smells true to palmarosa.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used Palmarosa oil.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I am interested in.  </li>
            <li>will buy again in the future, but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Love this company and their essential oils!</li>
            <li>I loved the Palmarosa Oil and will definitely buy from Plant Therapy in the future.  </li>
            <li>It is so strong it totally overwhelmed me</li>
            <li>This is, obviously, purely subjective because evreyone has their owns scents they like, but I ordered this based on the reviews</li>
            <li>But for now, I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>This has a rather unusual smell.  </li>
            <li>There is a bit too much citrus to the scent for my liking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be order more essential oils and blends from Plant Therapy again.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soft rose scent to add to my facial toners, but this was definitely not a soft scent.</li>
            <li>I suspect it will add a nice layer when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li>Also,I LOVE that the caps are easy to remove without being insecure for storage and travel.  </li>
            <li>and I love the oils I have bought from this company in the past and</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting,strong,clean and pure.  </li>
            <li>I have used other essential oils that are more expensive but do not have the labels on top and the bottles are a PAIN to open.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to essential oils, and ordered it because it was listed as an ingredient in several EO recipes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very picky about which essential oil companies I use since it is so easy to alter the quality of the oil or even fake it.</li>

            <li> This is the first time that I have used Palmarosa oil. I love the smell and can&#x27;t wait to use it in my lotions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about which essential oil companies I use since it is so easy to alter the quality of the oil or even fake it. I feel confident that this is a real oil and of top quality. I also like the variety of oils that you can get from Plant Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be order more essential oils and blends from Plant Therapy again.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have not had a chance to use this oil as of yet. When I do get to use it, I&#x27;ll have an opinion. But for now, I can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li> Palmarosa is very good for the skin &amp; the oils I received are living up to expectations.</li>
            <li> This is, obviously, purely subjective because evreyone has their owns scents they like, but I ordered this based on the reviews and I thought I would like it. It is so strong it totally overwhelmed me and I actually got headaches from it. Maybe that&#x27;s what palmarosa is supposed to smell like. I was looking for a soft rose scent to add to my facial toners, but this was definitely not a soft scent. It is really powerful!</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.  Smells great. Perfect for my uses.</li>

            <li> This is perhaps a nice fragrance to diffuse in your home, but used in the laundry, my poor husband and boys feel like they smell like they have flowery lady perfume on. It&#x27;s very strong, much stronger than I would prefer. We will use it up but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for laundry use with a house full of boys. It is a quality product, it&#x27;s just not &#x27;for me&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Plant Therapy Essential Oils  are great.  The scent is long lasting,strong,clean and pure.  I LOVE that there are labels on the top of the cap.

I have used other essential oils that are more expensive but do not have the labels on top and the bottles are a PAIN to open.</li>
            <li> This has a rather unusual smell.  May take some getting used to.  I suspect it will add a nice layer when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> I used this oil in combination with others for a facial moisturizer and it works great!  Everything was shipped on time and intact.</li>
