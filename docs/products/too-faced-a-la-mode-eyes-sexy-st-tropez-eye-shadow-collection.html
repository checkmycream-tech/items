            <li>Hopefully i will not be getting a bunch of email requests to raise my honest review of this product.</li>
            <li>I always use a primer---that&#x27;s really the best way to optimize the colors</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use these eyeshadows and as soon as I got the palette I swatched the colors on my arm--- good thing I did.</li>
            <li>i love anything from too faced and the colors are nice you can come up with so many looks</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite summertime palettes.</li>
            <li>Love the colors however I was expecting more pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Fantastic palette!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great and modern.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m getting better at application and blending techniques.</li>
            <li>Love this pallet.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>i love this eye palette every single color is so beautiful and bright</li>
            <li>The shadows are highly pigmented and give your eyes a nice blast of color!</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely beautiful and they last all day.</li>
            <li>if there all like that but be sides that it was fine</li>
            <li>I really really like, really cool, 100% recommended, very vivid and beautiful colors, the better.</li>
            <li>so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Without a book I would have been randomly trying to pair colors together and probably not been able to come up with looks as great as the ones shown!</li>
            <li>love the Glamour Guide because it helps me put colors together and apply them in a way that I normally don&#x27;t know how to do</li>
            <li>---I&#x27;m not crazy about these colors</li>
            <li>It came right on time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for so many different looks.</li>
            <li>the colors are really pretty</li>
            <li>the colors are so very pigmented and blend so well together.</li>
            <li>too faced really hit it well with this palette</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a maroon color than it is pink.</li>
            <li>Seller also took the time to wrap up the palette really well too.</li>
            <li>At first look the packaging (containing the palette) was worn and not the normal Too Faced quality.</li>
            <li>However they don&#x27;t necessarily look much different on my eyes except for first large eyeshadow on the top of the palette.</li>
            <li>The St. Tropez is also extremely pretty and natural looking with just a hint of glitter to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shadows themselves are pretty nice and don&#x27;t have any weird smell or texture, but the overall quality was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>favorite color is the Monaco because it&#x27;s so vibrant and different than any other pinks I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The pink didn&#x27;t stand out as much as I hoped and the dark blue is just kind of so-so.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I am not crazy about these colors and they just looked different from what I expected.</li>
            <li>and i needed a smaller shadow pallet to fit into a small cosmetic bag as all my other pallets are large and don&#x27;t really travel well for short trips when you&#x27;re trying to keep luggage to a minimum.</li>
            <li>the only down part for me was the top part of the makeup case is a little lose when you open it</li>

            <li> the only down part for me was the top part of the makeup case is a little lose when you open it</li>
            <li> First off- one of the smaller shadows was broken and a mess all over the whole pallet, there is no option to contact the seller for a replacement and I am anti spending money to return it when it should have been the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> Shadows are versatile as in they can be worn either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Too Faced makes some kick a$$ eye shadow and are a little cheaper then the Naked Pallet.</li>
            <li> Too Faced&#x27;s other eyeshadows don&#x27;t irritate my skin or smell like metal.</li>
            <li> However I use it as a sparkly topper for the other eye shadows in the palette</li>
            <li> The only negative about this palette is that I saw that bottom pink color to be brighter</li>
            <li> As always&#x27; too faced brings the beauty and never lets u down</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid of the dark pink at first</li>
            <li> but it can be a subtle dot of color or can be played up for a deep impact at night.</li>
            <li> You can create an everyday look or a nude smokey eye for during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> If you are new to too faced eyeshadow palettes you might not notice anything wrong with this, but if you aren&#x27;t you might notice something wrong with this.</li>
            <li> The actual palette wasn&#x27;t too horrible, but definitely not as sturdy as it should be.</li>
            <li> and I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not real too faced product very unhappy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to go wrong with Too</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of my favorite summertime palettes. the colors are so very pigmented and blend so well together. too faced really hit it well with this palette</li>
            <li> Love it so amazing and great pigmentation</li>
            <li> It came right on time the only down part for me was the top part of the makeup case is a little lose when you open it I&#x27;m not sure if there all like that but be sides that it was fine i love anything from too faced and the colors are nice you can come up with so many looks</li>
            <li> I love this! Came in on time. I&#x27;ve used it for so many different looks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and authentic</li>
            <li> Love the colors however I was expecting more pigmentation.</li>
            <li> This eye palette is all a lady needs! You can create an everyday look or a nude smokey eye for during the day. I was a little afraid of the dark pink at first but it can be a subtle dot of color or can be played up for a deep impact at night. The tutorials given with the product are helpful as well.</li>
            <li> No box and a mirror also feels lose</li>
            <li> I really really like, really cool, 100% recommended, very vivid and beautiful colors, the better. You will not regret buying it</li>
            <li> Not real too faced product very unhappy</li>
            <li> Fantastic palette! The shadows are highly pigmented and give your eyes a nice blast of color! Shadows are versatile as in they can be worn either wet or dry.Great staying power both with and without a primer.</li>
            <li> I recieved this palette today in the mail and I am not happy at all. I was so excited to use these eyeshadows and as soon as I got the palette I swatched the colors on my arm--- good thing I did. After having the shadows on my arm for like 30 seconds, I got a red puffy rash on my arm. Then- when cleaning it off I noticed it smelled like metal. Too Faced&#x27;s other eyeshadows don&#x27;t irritate my skin or smell like metal. I am definitely getting my money back.</li>
            <li> First off- one of the smaller shadows was broken and a mess all over the whole pallet, there is no option to contact the seller for a replacement and I am anti spending money to return it when it should have been the quality I expected. This is no longer offered through Sephora or I would&#x27;ve ordered it from there and earned points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the colors are really pretty and i needed a smaller shadow pallet to fit into a small cosmetic bag as all my other pallets are large and don&#x27;t really travel well for short trips when you&#x27;re trying to keep luggage to a minimum. All in all, I would not buy from this seller again because i didn&#x27;t like that there was no option to contact the seller- only to return or leave feedback. Hopefully i will not be getting a bunch of email requests to raise my honest review of this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> This palette is to die for! The packaging is great and modern. The colors are absolutely beautiful and they last all day. It is definitely a great value and I am so happy to own it.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite color is the Monaco because it&#x27;s so vibrant and different than any other pinks I have ever had. I like that it goes on the same shade as what it looks like in the palette itself. The St. Tropez is also extremely pretty and natural looking with just a hint of glitter to it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Glamour Guide because it helps me put colors together and apply them in a way that I normally don&#x27;t know how to do so I&#x27;m getting better at application and blending techniques. Without a book I would have been randomly trying to pair colors together and probably not been able to come up with looks as great as the ones shown!</li>
            <li> As always&#x27; too faced brings the beauty and never lets u down</li>
            <li> The only negative about this palette is that I saw that bottom pink color to be brighter but it&#x27;s more of a maroon color than it is pink. Other than that it is a beautiful palette and the colors are beautiful and apply beautifully.</li>
            <li> i love this eye palette every single color is so beautiful and bright</li>
            <li> Too Faced makes some kick a$$ eye shadow and are a little cheaper then the Naked Pallet. That being said, I am not crazy about these colors and they just looked different from what I expected. The pink didn&#x27;t stand out as much as I hoped and the dark blue is just kind of so-so.  I always use a primer---that&#x27;s really the best way to optimize the colors and I never have to reapply eye-shadow during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to go wrong with Too Faced eye-shadow---I&#x27;m not crazy about these colors but that is no reflection on the product----Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this pallet. I also have Summer Eyes that was very popular, but this one is better. Love the colors.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, in perfect condition! The colors are amazing!</li>
            <li> Beautiful palette!! I love the colors!! In the picture the three larger eye shadows on the left of the palette look almost identical but in person they do look different in person. However they don&#x27;t necessarily look much different on my eyes except for first large eyeshadow on the top of the palette. It does not have any color payoff at all. However I use it as a sparkly topper for the other eye shadows in the palette so I am not disappointed. I can get a neutral look out of this palette and I can get a lot of color as well which is why I would recommend this palette. Seller also took the time to wrap up the palette really well too.</li>
            <li> If you are new to too faced eyeshadow palettes you might not notice anything wrong with this, but if you aren&#x27;t you might notice something wrong with this. At first look the packaging (containing the palette) was worn and not the normal Too Faced quality. The actual palette wasn&#x27;t too horrible, but definitely not as sturdy as it should be. The shadows themselves are pretty nice and don&#x27;t have any weird smell or texture, but the overall quality was not as good as I expected. I suggest only buying this type of product from Sephora or the Too Faced online store. Hope this helped!</li>
