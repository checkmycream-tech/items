            <li>Many people can&#x27;t believe how old I am, including my doctor.  </li>
            <li>It lasted so long, so it was economical as well as very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>What I recieved was a tub, the kind you get body butters and such in.</li>
            <li>It will probably go faster now that I am using it on my feet, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several other brands, but always have the best results with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed with my other time wise products.  </li>
            <li>My face is soaking it in right now.</li>
            <li>so I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>our grandmothers had it right.</li>
            <li>MK is a great product and getting it at this price you cannot go wrong, thank you :-)</li>
            <li>You have to own this if you have dry skin but even if you have an oily t-zone like me</li>
            <li>It smells like an old lady and its so strong.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product had been firm, not as \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; in past, still excellent product...will buy again to keep hands from chapping due to type of employment...also good to put on feet with socks at night!</li>
            <li>I was first given this product years ago when I had a severe sunburn that was also on my face...</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay products and have been using them for almost the last year.</li>
            <li>My fault for not looking into exactly what this stuff was.</li>
            <li>As for me, I do not like it (and this is the first Mary Kay product I&#x27;ve used that I did not like).</li>
            <li>I would have gladly payed an extra dollar to order it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>Much better than waiting for sister who sells the same product to figure out when she can get it in.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>When I put it on at first</li>
            <li>It is the only way to get your 100% satisfaction guarantee and to make sure that products being sold have not expired.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you all the ways this product will make your life better because there isn&#x27;t enough room here to do it.</li>
            <li>So glad this is finally in a tube.</li>
            <li>I love constantly hearing how I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
            <li>I did a lot better on the second night.</li>
            <li>Same Mary Kay I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, can be multi-FUNCTIONAL especially in winter.</li>
            <li>Literally, the first ingredient is petrolatum, the second is mineral oil -- as in, the cheapest, most pore-cloggin,</li>
            <li>I first bought this product 4 years ago and use it every night</li>
            <li>i used this for a many years and especially in the winter for my lips.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this item.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mary Kay and please never discontinue!  </li>
            <li>use this everyday on my face, lips, cuts feels so good</li>
            <li>it quickly absorbs into the skin leaving your hands very soft!</li>
            <li>The Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream is great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marvelous and &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; such a number of skin issues... check it out, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy from this vendor again - very easy and professional.</li>
            <li>It does say it is for extremely dry skin, but I had no idea it would be more like a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li>To top it off, 6 months ago I had an allergic reaction to a mascara which damaged the skin around my eyes and ever since the skin has been dry and peeling and swollen and</li>
            <li>I have always had dry skin and have used this for years and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was going to be, but I do thoroughly enjoy this product, especially to use on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in winter!!</li>
            <li>the TRUE test will be in summer when I break out my sandals!), but the short term is VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you need extra moisture for dry skin, this is good.  </li>
            <li>I love the Mary Kay Emollient Night Cream and as usual was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Because of very dry lips and cuticles, I use it mostly for them.</li>
            <li>Great for cuticles and any other dry areas.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and just after one night of using the cream, my face felt drastically smoother.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth the next day.</li>
            <li>As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products.</li>
            <li>So really what is the real difference?</li>
            <li>So you know this review is from a real consultant ....</li>
            <li>It really works to relieve dryness &amp; prevent wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost 2 years now and it has improved the skin on my face so much.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>more like just putting on vaseline, but pink and have a purfume smell.</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, it&#x27;s ready for another day of abuse.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for sometime and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is very emolient and a bit greasy</li>
            <li>I love that pink &amp;#34;stuff &amp;#34</li>
            <li>The price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li>the tubes are very convenient for traveling, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li>And I noticed that it makes it  very greasy and shinny looking</li>
            <li>Slather this on your hands at night and sleep with a pair of cotton gloves - you&#x27;ll wake up with your hands so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works 100 times better then lotion for me and my skin is left feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I apply it over warm water in the am, so it&#x27;s not too heavy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li>It is much thicker and takes three times the amount as the other I used to be able to purchase.</li>
            <li>If you live in a dry climate, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>This product is really nice for those people that have extremely dry skin and plus u only need a dab</li>
            <li>(my previous tube lasted more than a year of pretty frequent use).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>After all, it is marketed to older women.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my doctor to use on splits in the vaginal area that happen to older women.  </li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and callous free with regular use.  </li>
            <li>I am more of a bold pink myself ----raspberry or wild plum, to be specific.</li>
            <li>My wife has used the product for several years and she is totally satisfied with it and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the smell is VERY STRONG (perfume-ish) and my husband can&#x27;t be anywhere near it as it gives him an instant headache.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since high school.</li>
            <li>recommend this highly</li>
            <li>My favorite cream since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to put on in this type of container than in the old jars.</li>
            <li>Even though it is worth the extra money, why pay it if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>Just a few days of wearing socks at night with this cream has healed the flip flop feet that most of us get each season.</li>
            <li>Love this product- especially in the winter for my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find any other eye cream that&#x27;s that thick, ever since they discontinued the Almay eye cream, which I used to love.</li>
            <li>After a dog bite that took a chunk out of my right index finger, my doctor suggested that I use Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream on it with a band-aid.</li>
            <li>I gave my last tube to my daughter in law last week and was in a fine sweat until Amazon got me a new one.</li>
            <li>My wife cant live without this.</li>
            <li>If you ever had a baby with diaper rash, you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a new tube of emollient.</li>
            <li>Rich and soft and a love the very subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to using this night cream for three weeks now and my face is looking fresh and young again....</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter who has very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not too long ago my neck revealed my true age....which I denied... after using Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream on my neck, upward strokes only, I will deny my true age and people believe me.</li>
            <li>If anyone has ever used Aquaphor the consistency is very similar but this absorbs faster in my opinion and even if you wash your hands right after applying it, they still stay soft.  </li>
            <li>First I only buy products from my consultant who happens to be my Sister.  </li>
            <li>It appears greasy at first,  but that is only temporary.  </li>
            <li>First let me clarify by saying, I would like to technically rate this product a 4.5 because of the smell.  </li>
            <li>So if your looking for a night cream, give this one a shot, but be warned, it is very rich and you need a very little bit.</li>
            <li>And after just a week of use my eyes had completely healed - no more wrinkles and they actually look better than they did before!</li>
            <li>This product is worth it to buy if you have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Perfect to smear all over any exposed area when you are skiing or are in dry, cold wind.  </li>
            <li>I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally.</li>
            <li>It works well on very dry skin, however I&#x27;m just not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li>My friends (and my daughter) say that I have clear skin, and wondered how I kept it that way.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The order was received very shortly after I ordered, and was packaged very well with no damage at all.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 44 years old.</li>
            <li>So if you have one close by, get this from your local rep, its much cheaper</li>
            <li>I have use since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li>I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days??</li>
            <li>it was really greasy and it felt really gross.</li>
            <li>keeps his feet so soft now.</li>
            <li>I have used this around my eyes since my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Doing this nightly would keep my heels soft and uncracked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old.</li>
            <li>was about ready to give up hope when last week I remembered that my mom always bought this stuff for my grandma</li>
            <li>Gent le &amp; healing for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>63 years old and use it</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Of course, I would recommend allowing your hands to completely absorb it before washing them if you can.  </li>
            <li>I am 84 years old and have no wrinkles on my cheeks or forehead.</li>
            <li>Kay has so reduced the volumn of their already expensive products by repackaging, tubes versus jars, etc., that it makes these products no longer a good choice.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and thick.</li>
            <li>Significant improvement is seen in just a few applications.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes this old lady&#x27;s skin overnight, smells great, even helps heal broken skin and pimples, for a reasonable cost because you need use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li>This is an extremely good dry skin cream but not hardly as good as it was back when it came in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since Mary Kay was brand new back in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not just an average cream that soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I used too much of the cream and applied it to a dry face.</li>
            <li>She enjoyed the color of pale pink.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands, elbows, and feet extra soft!</li>
            <li>I also have very dry skin from the weather changing so much</li>
            <li>This little tube lasts quite awhile - definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I have even started using it on my feet, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell a significant long term difference (only about a week and in winter and not EVERY DAY...</li>
            <li>It is the only cream that makes my face soft all night and day.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks, my pores are far less visible, my skin is incredibly soft and fine lines are dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li>I realize that the company can not claim that their cream has a healing component, but I would say that it definitely played a part in beautifyling the outcome as far as cosmetic scarring goes.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel soft and gives some of the radiance back!</li>
            <li>I put this night cream on my feet and put thick and comfy socks on over it and have a smooth night of comfy sleep</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for those with dry skin or Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I was slightly disappointed that Mary Kay had slightly changed the scent of the product though; now it is more rose</li>
            <li>I just picked up a new tube of this from my local MK rep, and it was $11 plus tax, total $11.77.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s Extra Emollient Night Cream on my dry feet one night, and I was very turned off by the product.</li>
            <li>I received a round jar that says Mary Kay and the right name</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t understand though why we pay double shipping for 2 small products that will fit in the same box.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and apply it to your freshly washed and somewhat moist face - it also works well on your lips and can be used on your hands.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s worth the money because a few ounces will last forever.)</li>
            <li>and this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>but inside is a pink waxy substance that is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED.</li>
            <li>Though called a &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; this is literally just pink, highly fragranced vaseline.</li>
            <li>Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide.</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer ashy or dry, it looks hydrated and feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like super thick Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>If you have a cold, and your nose is raw from using a tissue every other minute, this is without a doubt the best stuff to soothe your aching nose.</li>
            <li>This product works good for dry skin, especially if you spend a lot of time outside in the cold.  </li>
            <li>but I will dab a little on my lips, and it really softens them up.</li>
            <li>Though it is not convenient to really rub it into the scalp,  I put a little on my pocket comb.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> As a nurse I also use it on my hands, which take a lot of abuse from constant washing, with great results.</li>
            <li> After 3 wks, the hole is filled in...thanks to God, of course,  AND the Mary Kay cream, it is healed, with virtually no scarring.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I would prefer in the former jar, but the tube is good too.</li>

            <li> I have been a loyal customer because of prompt receipt of product but this time it took longer.</li>
            <li> Luckily my mom had some lying around</li>
            <li> I even bought it as a gift for a pregnant friend.</li>
            <li> Have used extra emollient night cream for many, many years...</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping as well!!</li>
            <li> If you live in a humid climate, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> When I was a girl, there were a lot of rumors about exactly where Mary Kay got the formula for this product--some old leather tanning guy, a healer lady who made her own ointments...</li>
            <li> So good for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gives good moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li> and the fragrance is a little strong, it will be good for you.</li>
            <li> It was really greasy for my face and on my hands, also couldn&#x27;t stand the smell!!</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels, makes my skin feel soft and silky!</li>
            <li> The next morning they felt and looked so much better!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream is the best cream for dry skin that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This a fast, easy, and economical way to purchase Mary Kay Night Cream.  </li>
            <li> Apply it at night and your skin will look amazing the next day!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product a couple days ago... and the results are amazing.. and instant!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing short of amazing</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Many people can&#x27;t believe how old I am, including my doctor.  </li>
            <li> It lasted so long, so it was economical as well as very satisfying.  </li>
            <li> What I recieved was a tub, the kind you get body butters and such in.</li>
            <li> It will probably go faster now that I am using it on my feet, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands, but always have the best results with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed with my other time wise products.  </li>
            <li> My face is soaking it in right now.</li>
            <li> so I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> our grandmothers had it right.</li>
            <li> MK is a great product and getting it at this price you cannot go wrong, thank you :-)</li>
            <li> You have to own this if you have dry skin but even if you have an oily t-zone like me</li>
            <li> It smells like an old lady and its so strong.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product had been firm, not as \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; in past, still excellent product...will buy again to keep hands from chapping due to type of employment...also good to put on feet with socks at night!</li>
            <li> I was first given this product years ago when I had a severe sunburn that was also on my face...</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products and have been using them for almost the last year.</li>
            <li> My fault for not looking into exactly what this stuff was.</li>
            <li> As for me, I do not like it (and this is the first Mary Kay product I&#x27;ve used that I did not like).</li>
            <li> I would have gladly payed an extra dollar to order it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Much better than waiting for sister who sells the same product to figure out when she can get it in.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> When I put it on at first</li>
            <li> It is the only way to get your 100% satisfaction guarantee and to make sure that products being sold have not expired.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you all the ways this product will make your life better because there isn&#x27;t enough room here to do it.</li>
            <li> So glad this is finally in a tube.</li>
            <li> I love constantly hearing how I don&#x27;t look my age</li>
            <li> I did a lot better on the second night.</li>
            <li> Same Mary Kay I&#x27;ve used for many years.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, can be multi-FUNCTIONAL especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Literally, the first ingredient is petrolatum, the second is mineral oil -- as in, the cheapest, most pore-cloggin,</li>
            <li> I first bought this product 4 years ago and use it every night</li>
            <li> i used this for a many years and especially in the winter for my lips.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Mary Kay and please never discontinue!  </li>
            <li> use this everyday on my face, lips, cuts feels so good</li>
            <li> it quickly absorbs into the skin leaving your hands very soft!</li>
            <li> The Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream is great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marvelous and &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; such a number of skin issues... check it out, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy from this vendor again - very easy and professional.</li>
            <li> It does say it is for extremely dry skin, but I had no idea it would be more like a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li> To top it off, 6 months ago I had an allergic reaction to a mascara which damaged the skin around my eyes and ever since the skin has been dry and peeling and swollen and</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and have used this for years and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was going to be, but I do thoroughly enjoy this product, especially to use on my hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in winter!!</li>
            <li> the TRUE test will be in summer when I break out my sandals!), but the short term is VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you need extra moisture for dry skin, this is good.  </li>
            <li> I love the Mary Kay Emollient Night Cream and as usual was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because of very dry lips and cuticles, I use it mostly for them.</li>
            <li> Great for cuticles and any other dry areas.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother and just after one night of using the cream, my face felt drastically smoother.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth the next day.</li>
            <li> As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products.</li>
            <li> So really what is the real difference?</li>
            <li> So you know this review is from a real consultant ....</li>
            <li> It really works to relieve dryness &amp; prevent wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 years now and it has improved the skin on my face so much.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> more like just putting on vaseline, but pink and have a purfume smell.</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, it&#x27;s ready for another day of abuse.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for sometime and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is very emolient and a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I love that pink &amp;#34;stuff &amp;#34</li>
            <li> The price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> the tubes are very convenient for traveling, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> And I noticed that it makes it  very greasy and shinny looking</li>
            <li> Slather this on your hands at night and sleep with a pair of cotton gloves - you&#x27;ll wake up with your hands so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works 100 times better then lotion for me and my skin is left feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I apply it over warm water in the am, so it&#x27;s not too heavy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker and takes three times the amount as the other I used to be able to purchase.</li>
            <li> If you live in a dry climate, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product is really nice for those people that have extremely dry skin and plus u only need a dab</li>
            <li> (my previous tube lasted more than a year of pretty frequent use).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> After all, it is marketed to older women.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor to use on splits in the vaginal area that happen to older women.  </li>
            <li> It keeps them soft and callous free with regular use.  </li>
            <li> I am more of a bold pink myself ----raspberry or wild plum, to be specific.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the product for several years and she is totally satisfied with it and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the smell is VERY STRONG (perfume-ish) and my husband can&#x27;t be anywhere near it as it gives him an instant headache.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since high school.</li>
            <li> recommend this highly</li>
            <li> My favorite cream since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to put on in this type of container than in the old jars.</li>
            <li> Even though it is worth the extra money, why pay it if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Just a few days of wearing socks at night with this cream has healed the flip flop feet that most of us get each season.</li>
            <li> Love this product- especially in the winter for my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find any other eye cream that&#x27;s that thick, ever since they discontinued the Almay eye cream, which I used to love.</li>
            <li> After a dog bite that took a chunk out of my right index finger, my doctor suggested that I use Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream on it with a band-aid.</li>
            <li> I gave my last tube to my daughter in law last week and was in a fine sweat until Amazon got me a new one.</li>
            <li> My wife cant live without this.</li>
            <li> If you ever had a baby with diaper rash, you can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a new tube of emollient.</li>
            <li> Rich and soft and a love the very subtle fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using this night cream for three weeks now and my face is looking fresh and young again....</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter who has very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not too long ago my neck revealed my true age....which I denied... after using Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream on my neck, upward strokes only, I will deny my true age and people believe me.</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever used Aquaphor the consistency is very similar but this absorbs faster in my opinion and even if you wash your hands right after applying it, they still stay soft.  </li>
            <li> First I only buy products from my consultant who happens to be my Sister.  </li>
            <li> It appears greasy at first,  but that is only temporary.  </li>
            <li> First let me clarify by saying, I would like to technically rate this product a 4.5 because of the smell.  </li>
            <li> So if your looking for a night cream, give this one a shot, but be warned, it is very rich and you need a very little bit.</li>
            <li> And after just a week of use my eyes had completely healed - no more wrinkles and they actually look better than they did before!</li>
            <li> This product is worth it to buy if you have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Perfect to smear all over any exposed area when you are skiing or are in dry, cold wind.  </li>
            <li> I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally.</li>
            <li> It works well on very dry skin, however I&#x27;m just not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li> My friends (and my daughter) say that I have clear skin, and wondered how I kept it that way.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The order was received very shortly after I ordered, and was packaged very well with no damage at all.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 44 years old.</li>
            <li> So if you have one close by, get this from your local rep, its much cheaper</li>
            <li> I have use since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days??</li>
            <li> it was really greasy and it felt really gross.</li>
            <li> keeps his feet so soft now.</li>
            <li> I have used this around my eyes since my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Doing this nightly would keep my heels soft and uncracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old.</li>
            <li> was about ready to give up hope when last week I remembered that my mom always bought this stuff for my grandma</li>
            <li> Gent le &amp; healing for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> 63 years old and use it</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Of course, I would recommend allowing your hands to completely absorb it before washing them if you can.  </li>
            <li> I am 84 years old and have no wrinkles on my cheeks or forehead.</li>
            <li> Kay has so reduced the volumn of their already expensive products by repackaging, tubes versus jars, etc., that it makes these products no longer a good choice.</li>
            <li> It is very rich and thick.</li>
            <li> Significant improvement is seen in just a few applications.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes this old lady&#x27;s skin overnight, smells great, even helps heal broken skin and pimples, for a reasonable cost because you need use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely good dry skin cream but not hardly as good as it was back when it came in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since Mary Kay was brand new back in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not just an average cream that soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I used too much of the cream and applied it to a dry face.</li>
            <li> She enjoyed the color of pale pink.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands, elbows, and feet extra soft!</li>
            <li> I also have very dry skin from the weather changing so much</li>
            <li> This little tube lasts quite awhile - definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I have even started using it on my feet, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell a significant long term difference (only about a week and in winter and not EVERY DAY...</li>
            <li> It is the only cream that makes my face soft all night and day.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my pores are far less visible, my skin is incredibly soft and fine lines are dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> I realize that the company can not claim that their cream has a healing component, but I would say that it definitely played a part in beautifyling the outcome as far as cosmetic scarring goes.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel soft and gives some of the radiance back!</li>
            <li> I put this night cream on my feet and put thick and comfy socks on over it and have a smooth night of comfy sleep</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for those with dry skin or Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed that Mary Kay had slightly changed the scent of the product though; now it is more rose</li>
            <li> I just picked up a new tube of this from my local MK rep, and it was $11 plus tax, total $11.77.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s Extra Emollient Night Cream on my dry feet one night, and I was very turned off by the product.</li>
            <li> I received a round jar that says Mary Kay and the right name</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand though why we pay double shipping for 2 small products that will fit in the same box.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and apply it to your freshly washed and somewhat moist face - it also works well on your lips and can be used on your hands.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s worth the money because a few ounces will last forever.)</li>
            <li> and this product does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> but inside is a pink waxy substance that is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED.</li>
            <li> Though called a &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; this is literally just pink, highly fragranced vaseline.</li>
            <li> Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer ashy or dry, it looks hydrated and feels soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like super thick Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> If you have a cold, and your nose is raw from using a tissue every other minute, this is without a doubt the best stuff to soothe your aching nose.</li>
            <li> This product works good for dry skin, especially if you spend a lot of time outside in the cold.  </li>
            <li> but I will dab a little on my lips, and it really softens them up.</li>
            <li> Though it is not convenient to really rub it into the scalp,  I put a little on my pocket comb.  </li>
            <li> This particular item is at least 10 years old!</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin and live in a dry climate this emolient is invaluable.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin, or wrinkling issues around the eyes or on their face in general - keeps it all at bay.</li>
            <li> I had used all the usual moisture creams which helped for a brief time,  but this product seems to have no alcohol and really works.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on the very last day possible to make the deadline - If I had realized that it would take that long</li>
            <li> Some what hard to apply and can cause bangs to become oily, it will have to really moisturize my skin to continue use!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Vasaline or the old pink satin hands mask (in fact it smells the same and is pink just like it used to be).  </li>
            <li> so I expect this tube to last a very long time</li>
            <li> , she sure is...too bad the rest of her looks nearly 60!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin on your hands feet or even your face, the Extra Emolient night cream is your answer.  </li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing but difficult to spread, and very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 days I saw instant improvement with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get really dry skin on my hands and feet, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> the constant watering makes the eyelid and below eye areas dry.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes had deep wrinkles because of how dry the skin was. </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone with dry skin, especially during the winter season.</li>
            <li> I have extra flaky dry skin .</li>
            <li> ; it healed my badly burn leg from my motorcycle pipe when nothing the doctors gave me would, it&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands all day long, and this cream helps with the dry and cracking skin</li>
            <li> used this a long time and help with dry skin especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> My forehead had become a very dry patch, flaking daily.</li>
            <li> and this makes them soft and my hands no longer feel tight or itchie from dry</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know what I expected for the low price!  </li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s what makes the moisture stay long</li>
            <li> how long you rub it in)</li>
            <li> I will be using this EVERY night for as long as they sell it.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a facial night cream, a salve for diaper chapped bottoms on my grandchildren and for rough &amp; dry heals and hands.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little and it last forever!</li>
            <li> A little is a lot, so it will last for several years.</li>
            <li> It actually DOES what every other skin cream CLAIMS to do.  </li>
            <li> In the summer I would always have dry, cracked rogh, sore heels due to constantly wearing flip flops.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter &amp;</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it since I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried makes my skin greasy and yet I still have dry patches</li>
            <li> everywhere dry skin tends to form.</li>
            <li> Unless you have supper dry scaly skin skip this product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy but nothing clears up dry skin patches as well as this.</li>
            <li> they are so dry they spit this cream</li>
            <li> My husband, who is a carpenter uses it in his dry cracked hands from handling wood.</li>
            <li> I even use it on areas like my hands and feet when the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> am and pm on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hands</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my really dry face without getting oily.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> AND I also apply in the morning after my shower as my face is a bit dry....</li>
            <li> but it heals everything from burns to cuts, scars, dry cracked feet, chapped lips, dry nose...</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry heels.</li>
            <li> Softens dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is a thick gel-like pink substance that is very greasy.</li>
            <li> While it leave a small greasy residue directly after applying (and that is based on the amount you apply and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 83 year old and have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works well to use on cuticles, any rough, dry places, pamper hands, too.</li>
            <li> The odd smell though was enough for my dogs to take one whiff &amp; run from me.</li>
            <li> I previously used a similar Elizabeth Arden product.  </li>
            <li> For the past 2 years the skin around my mouth has become very dry, red, scaly, peeling, sore, and overall unattractive.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it!</li>
            <li> I can not live without this cream!</li>
            <li> Moisterizes very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was going through peri-menopause and was very dry &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Along with Mary Kay moisture mask, this is my must have product for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> , MY SKIN HAS BECOME VERY DRY AROUND MY NOSE AND MOUTH</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and crack during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> She made me use it for one ridiculously dry elbow I have - and it was like a miracle - totally healed in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I was not familiar with the \\&quot;Extra Emollient Night Cream\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I put a little bit extra around my under eyes and corners of my eyes and it has helped hydrate that area so that my crows feet are almost non existent.  </li>
            <li> so I used a little much last night....</li>
            <li> Helps prevent dry skin from getting to that extreme point where you have to worry about cracking and soreness.</li>
            <li> recommand to other people and encourage to use it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought my dry skin would get less dry as summer got here, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> When I read the word \\&quot;cream\\&quot; I expected a creamy lotion type product.</li>
            <li> It seemed like about a fourth of the tube was missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d shoved in the back of a drawer years ago because I thought it was too heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> I tried to do without it this past winter (and only use the MK tinted moisturizer) and had a dry patch on my forehead</li>
            <li> Overnight the skin around my eyes and mouth were noticeably less dry.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is a quality product, as with other Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first tried this because of the texture of the lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same formula I remember for the past 40 years</li>
            <li> My eyes are often irritated due to seasonal allergies and</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so not sure how it will work yet</li>
            <li> It beats all the other night creams.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay was a woman who helped empower other women.</li>
            <li> Well, the sun is coming up..time for me to do something other than write reviews for whoever I am writing these reviews for...........</li>
            <li> Little do they know I inherited my mom&#x27;s extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had trouble sleeping through the night because of my dry feet until I started using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to come in a pink and black tube ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is dry year round</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with dry, cracked winter skin on my heels and feet, and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> I know this is a product for women,  but my barber (a woman) gave me a little tube because my forehead and scalp was very dry in this winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and seriously have not found any other moisturizer to compete with for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Personally, I do not like it, but if you are looking at this product and want an extremely thick greasy gel for your face, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I was a expecting it to be the same emollient that I had previously used that came in a round, small 2.5 oz container.  </li>
            <li> I have some (slight) rosacea and get small dry patches.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays moist and less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> All I know is she already asked me to order another tube, this one is half gone.</li>
            <li> She feels refresh and less wrinkles in just few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells a little</li>
            <li> My mouth still peels a little bit</li>
            <li> Its like thick pink vaseline,</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and by the next day I was completely broken out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m oily in a few places</li>
            <li> I use this as a hand cream at night because it is heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I been using this for a few months on my husband feet</li>
            <li> ( I am 47 with few wrinkles.)</li>
            <li> One tube has lasted me about one year give or take a few days</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Try to keep some for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product at night before bed, as it is a little greasy.</li>
            <li> have small hands (I wear XS exam gloves or little girl gloves)</li>
            <li> y/ o gets very dry skin during the cOld weather and we have tried a lot of different lotions.</li>
            <li> It takes very little, as it spreads as it warms on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that with how thick and the vaselineish texture of the cream that I was going to break out... instead what little bumps I did have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> She suggested using a small amount, spreading in that area before dressing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The cream is supper thick and heavily fragranced.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash my face twice and do a micro derma abrasion just to remove all the excessive oil.  </li>
            <li> IN THE PAST, I HAD USED MAKEUP</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> But it becomes a hassle in my small town to see who was selling Mary Kay at any given time.  </li>
            <li> One tube usually lasts a year.</li>
            <li> Altough i was not pleased to see that the picture in the discription was not what i had recieved.</li>
            <li> I have become a diabetic in the past five years and my skin shows it.</li>
            <li> I mean.. it idnt come from another Country for crying out load.</li>
            <li> As with the rest of my body, it gets incredibly dry in the winter when it&#x27;s very cold outside!</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find sometimes.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how thick it was</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick and greasy</li>

            <li> I thought the time o\it took for shipping was quite excessive!</li>
            <li> and I mean it...today.</li>
            <li> no more flaking for me!</li>

            <li> Serious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously a life changer.</li>
            <li> but it in a hard box to ship not a happy camper</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t bother me and it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to knock off one star.  </li>

            <li> Not sure of product is very thick and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;!  </li>

            <li> This stuff is seriously miracle cream!</li>
            <li> It is thick, hard to spread, very greasy (gets on my pillow), but worst of all, it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> I DONT LIKE SEEING FALSE ADVERTISING!!</li>
            <li> It also had an unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> My dog has problems with her ears from being on steroids, so I am also using it to see if it helps the skin to regenerate faster after a bad infection.  </li>
            <li> , I realize that my wrinkles don&#x27;t look as bad as they were a month ago.</li>

            <li> Yes, it is thick and a bit greasy. Its like thick pink vaseline, BUT it is the only thing that can get my hands halfway soft during the winter, as they are chapped, rough and red. I would NOT recommend this for your face, only for your hands and elbows.... works great for that.</li>
            <li> My mother is thrilled to have the emollient.  Misses the jar size.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Rich and soft and a love the very subtle fragrance.  It leaves my skin so soft and definitly is the best option out there for rich night time moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I totally forgot I even ordered this way back when! This Mary Kay product is some GOOD stuff!</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream is the best cream for dry skin that I have ever used. I was introduced to this product at a Mary Kay party over 30 years ago. At the time, I didn&#x27;t need an intensive night cream for my face but the Mary Kay representative encouraged me to try it on my hands and feet. That did it! I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer ever since and I am so pleased that I can order it through Amazon. I happily recommend this product.</li>
            <li> MK is a great product and getting it at this price you cannot go wrong, thank you :-)</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom and she loves it and has been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This item did not arrive as advertised in the photo. The product came in a jar instead of as pictured in a tube.</li>
            <li> Not too long ago my neck revealed my true age....which I denied... after using Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream on my neck, upward strokes only, I will deny my true age and people believe me. I could tell others my age is 31 and they would take one look at my neck and say \\&quot;Yep, she sure is...too bad the rest of her looks nearly 60!\\&quot; So that is why I give Mary Kay emollient Night Cream 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The order was received very shortly after I ordered, and was packaged very well with no damage at all.  I would definitely buy from this vendor again - very easy and professional.</li>
            <li> The Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream is great for very dry skin. In the winter, to prevent my skin from cracking, sometimes I will use it on my hands at night and sleep with socks over them. I also use it in the summer if I get sunburnt. It&#x27;s perfect because it addeds the necessary moisture back into your skin so it doesn&#x27;t peel as it fades away.</li>
            <li> l loved them both, thank 5 stars</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin on your hands feet or even your face, the Extra Emolient night cream is your answer.  This is especially useful for diabetics.  I had trouble sleeping through the night because of my dry feet until I started using this stuff.  I also put it on the back of my hands before I go out.  It gives a significantly more useful look to my hands. I have used it for over ten years and am still very happy with the  results.</li>
            <li> I love this Night Cream. It has hydrated my face the best out of all products I&#x27;ve tried. My face is much smoother and just after one night of using the cream, my face felt drastically smoother. I also have very dry skin from the weather changing so much and I rub it on my body and have the softest skin. It also helps with excema. This is the only product to ever help me with it. This is truly a product great for everything.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream! I have dry skin in the winter &amp; this product is so good!</li>
            <li> I was first given this product years ago when I had a severe sunburn that was also on my face... I continued to use it.  I&#x27;m approaching 37 and have always loved the beach and outdoors...this product is the reason I don&#x27;t have crows feet still.</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorite products of all time. Apply it at night and your skin will look amazing the next day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as an eye cream, and it works great as that. Although it is mostly vaseline (I think?), it is effective and relatively cheap for the purpose. I have not been able to find any other eye cream that&#x27;s that thick, ever since they discontinued the Almay eye cream, which I used to love. So this is it for me.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference after just one use and I like the packaging, easy to take when traveling.  Great night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Very thick but that&#x27;s what I love about it - it&#x27;s not just an average cream that soaks right in. Makes your hands silky smooth. And I do like the scent. You only need a tiny bit so I expect this tube to last a very long time (my previous tube lasted more than a year of pretty frequent use). So it&#x27;s a great buy for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry hands, feet, and for your face and lips.  Very nice smell. I use it every night and I&#x27;m 44 years old. People guess my age at 27 to 30....so something is working! LOL</li>
            <li> The product is great an still available from a Mary Kay consultant. This particular item is at least 10 years old!</li>
            <li> my box was crush and i will have to order from some one else you should but it in a hard box to ship not a happy camper</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and really love the results.It can be hard to find sometimes.Just what I wanted.I have said all I can say about that.</li>
            <li> I just picked up a new tube of this from my local MK rep, and it was $11 plus tax, total $11.77.  So if you have one close by, get this from your local rep, its much cheaper and there&#x27;s no shipping.  Even though it is worth the extra money, why pay it if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years.  The best night cream as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> My mom has used it for like 30 years, she is 78 now and she credits this product as being the reason she has NO WRINKLES ON HER FACE AT ALL.  She made me use it for one ridiculously dry elbow I have - and it was like a miracle - totally healed in just a few days.  My dog has problems with her ears from being on steroids, so I am also using it to see if it helps the skin to regenerate faster after a bad infection.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the smell is VERY STRONG (perfume-ish) and my husband can&#x27;t be anywhere near it as it gives him an instant headache.  And it does get to me too.  I&#x27;d give anything if they were to make an unscented version!  Why does Mary Kay have to perfume things like this????</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth the next day.</li>
            <li> This is the very best night cream for very dry skin. It is non irritating. Significant improvement is seen in just a few applications. As a nurse I also use it on my hands, which take a lot of abuse from constant washing, with great results.</li>
            <li> I feel as I found the best deal on the internet.  Love the price and a product I have use since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days?? As an a actual current  beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products. I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally. I even hold phone consultations to talk about their skin needs and check up with them weekly over the phone or email, so sometimes I never meet my clients person to person. So really what is the real difference? Our job is to help educate and help women with feeling more beautiful about themselves no matter where they are located or what their \\&quot; Budget\\&quot; is. Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide. Just don&#x27;t get caught! &#x3D;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know if something is current just go to our website. I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said... I DONT LIKE SEEING FALSE ADVERTISING!! BE SURE TO SHOW THE PRODUCTS THEY ARE GETTING! It is supposed to come in a pink and black tube ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coty Geiser&lt;br /&gt; So you know this review is from a real consultant .... [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for extremely dry skin. My 3 y/ o gets very dry skin during the cOld weather and we have tried a lot of different lotions. So far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing but difficult to spread, and very greasy.  It&#x27;s like super thick Vaseline.  It has a floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s Extra Emollient Night Cream on my dry feet one night, and I was very turned off by the product. It was greasy and oily, and did not sink into my skin at all. It also had an unpleasant odor. Yuck. I&#x27;ll definitely not try this product again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since the 80&#x27;s and it is the best product ever!  I use it on my neck, face, elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> Great Cream! Makes my hands, elbows, and feet extra soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this for years from a Mary Kay consultant but what I ordered on Amazon is not the same... It has a strong odor and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it use to. I&#x27;ll never order it again (unless from a trusted source).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, paying twice the price.  It is a wonderful night cream, also helps with dry nail beds and cuticles.  I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin, or wrinkling issues around the eyes or on their face in general - keeps it all at bay.</li>
            <li> I love the Mary Kay Emollient Night Cream and as usual was not disappointed. I like the good service and fast&lt;br /&gt;delivery service.</li>
            <li> It has a Vaseline like feeling and is great for feet, elbows, and hands. Excellent for dry skin. The scent reminds me of flowers. The product works, but the shipping took longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products and have been using them for almost the last year. I was not familiar with the \\&quot;Extra Emollient Night Cream\\&quot; but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My fault for not looking into exactly what this stuff was. When I read the word \\&quot;cream\\&quot; I expected a creamy lotion type product. This is a thick gel-like pink substance that is very greasy. It does say it is for extremely dry skin, but I had no idea it would be more like a gel than a cream. I put it on my face last night and felt like I had just rubbed Crisco on it. Personally, I do not like it, but if you are looking at this product and want an extremely thick greasy gel for your face, it may work for you. As for me, I do not like it (and this is the first Mary Kay product I&#x27;ve used that I did not like).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years under my foundation and at night and I&#x27;ve always had nice compliments about my complexion</li>
            <li> I love this product, reasonably priced and makes my skin feel fresh by morning.  Only issue is that it is a bit greasy</li>
            <li> Moisterizes very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This night cream is amazing.  Within 3 days I saw instant improvement with my dry skin.  I also apply it to my neck area and that too is better moisturized and over all looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for several years and find that it is terrific for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I found it on Amazon...my Mary Kay rep had retired and I&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t sure I could find it again.</li>
            <li> This product works good for dry skin, especially if you spend a lot of time outside in the cold.  Like ice fishing.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely superb stuff... that I&#x27;ve used for the past 40 years... and will continue to do so.  It&#x27;s marvelous and &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; such a number of skin issues... check it out, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Although the product was great.. I thought the time o\it took for shipping was quite excessive! I mean.. it idnt come from another Country for crying out load. It arrived on the very last day possible to make the deadline - If I had realized that it would take that long I would have gladly payed an extra dollar to order it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This product works for me and is an excellent cream for winter. It moisturizes at night on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My favorite nightly face ointment!! This is the only moisturizer I have used for over 5 years!! Worth every penny. I have never had softer skin without any breakouts. Super fast shipping as well!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many, many years.  It keeps my face moist during the night and has a pleasant smell to it.  Would recommend this product.  It is a quality product, as with other Mary Kay products. I wish they would go back to the jar instead of the tube as you have to cut it open to get all the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li> My wife cant live without this. She has seborriac dermatitus and roseca and this is the only product that helps both at the same time.</li>
            <li> Years ago a girlfriend told me about this product.  I was going through peri-menopause and was very dry &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  She suggested using a small amount, spreading in that area before dressing in the morning.  Voila!  Much more comfortable all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it this way ever since, going on 12 years.  My gynecologist was happy to hear about this, too, and has begun recommending it to her clients.</li>
            <li> Along with Mary Kay moisture mask, this is my must have product for very dry skin. I am never without it and have used this for years.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for dealing with dry skin.  I tend to get really dry skin on my hands and feet, especially in the winter.  You put this cream on at bedtime and it works wonderfully.  Helps prevent dry skin from getting to that extreme point where you have to worry about cracking and soreness.</li>
            <li> It is the only cream that makes my face soft all night and day.  Best thing that ever happened for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It is a miracle cream.  It really works to relieve dryness &amp; prevent wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff .&lt;br /&gt;Smells a little</li>
            <li> Fast service, product is exactly as described for a fair price and well packaged for shipment. Much better than waiting for sister who sells the same product to figure out when she can get it in.</li>
            <li> I was so glad i purchased this product. I always wanted this product it makes my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li> This cream is almost as thic as vaseline, not what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I have been using it for almost 2 years now and it has improved the skin on my face so much.  My skin is no longer ashy or dry, it looks hydrated and feels soft.  I was skeptical when I first tried this because of the texture of the lotion but a little goes a long way and I use it at night and sleep with it on.  I put a little bit extra around my under eyes and corners of my eyes and it has helped hydrate that area so that my crows feet are almost non existent.  I have had people comment on this.  I would recommend this product.  I am 46, have medium color skin, which used to be oily and is not combination but a bit drier than when I was younger, if that helps you to make a decision.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these--one for me and one for my mom.  I am embarrassed to even give my mom&#x27;s to her because this &amp;#34;emollient&amp;#34; &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t even like a cream.  It is thick, hard to spread, very greasy (gets on my pillow), but worst of all, it smells terrible.  I would never buy this again and do NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> I gave this cream to my mother and she like it. She feels refresh and less wrinkles in just few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My aunt has been using this for years now so I decided to try it since I have really dry skin. Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried makes my skin greasy and yet I still have dry patches so I&#x27;m willing to try anything. When I put it on at first it was really greasy and it felt really gross. I didn&#x27;t feel like washing it off because I was really tired. When I woke up my skin was flawless  hence the reason they call it night cream you have to give it time to soak in. Love it and I&#x27;m planning on getting a bottle of my own</li>
            <li> This review is on the product itself – not the actual amazon seller. This stuff is seriously miracle cream! Every time I order a shipment of Mary Kay, I order a bottle of the emollient cream. I don’t use it on my face because I’m prone to break-outs but I will dab a little on my lips, and it really softens them up. I use this cream to hydrate my hands, feet, elbows, knee caps, and everywhere dry skin tends to form. It works 100 times better then lotion for me and my skin is left feeling soft and silky. I usually use this product at night before bed, as it is a little greasy. I love putting this stuff on my feet and into fuzzy socks overnight, my feet never felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> I got this because I have always been a fan of Mary Kay and you can&#x27;t beat this price! After a few weeks, my pores are far less visible, my skin is incredibly soft and fine lines are dramatically reduced. Great stuff! I use it in the morning and evening. I apply it over warm water in the am, so it&#x27;s not too heavy to apply make up over. This stuff is THICK! It has an older lady perfume smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant. After all, it is marketed to older women. (I am 35) Just an itty bitty dab will do ya! This stuff lasts a while! Also, it has made my hands feel like silk!</li>
            <li> I love this product, use for over 20yrs.  recommand to other people and encourage to use it for dry skin.</li>
            <li> First I only buy products from my consultant who happens to be my Sister.  It is the only way to get your 100% satisfaction guarantee and to make sure that products being sold have not expired.  This cream is still sold by Mary Kay.  I currently received it as a sample with my order.  I used it as directed with my other time wise products.  The cream is supper thick and heavily fragranced.  It reminds me of Vasaline or the old pink satin hands mask (in fact it smells the same and is pink just like it used to be).  I put it on my face and by the next day I was completely broken out.  I had to wash my face twice and do a micro derma abrasion just to remove all the excessive oil.  Unless you have supper dry scaly skin skip this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product--somewhat greasy when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Best thing in the world for older skin.  I can&#x27;t be without it!  good place to buy it; My five tubes arrived in 2 days.  Yay, thank you.</li>
            <li> People, if you haven&#x27;t heard of the magic that is this product, let me enlighten you. I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 50 years. My mother and my grandmother used it, and they both had beautiful skin that never looked their age. My skin looks pretty good, too. It&#x27;s the best thing to put on your skin since water. If you live in a dry climate, you&#x27;ll love it. If you live in a humid climate, you&#x27;ll love it. If you ever had a baby with diaper rash, you can&#x27;t live without it. If you have eczema, or psoriasis, you&#x27;ll reach for it every day. If your darling husband gets chaffed from damp drawers after basketball or golf, he&#x27;ll thank you for sharing it with him. I can&#x27;t tell you all the ways this product will make your life better because there isn&#x27;t enough room here to do it. It&#x27;s inexpensive, lasts forever, can be used on virtually every part of your body (because water flows through it and won&#x27;t hold bacteria)...if I&#x27;m being thoughtless and run out, I literally panic until it&#x27;s back in my hands. I gave my last tube to my daughter in law last week and was in a fine sweat until Amazon got me a new one. I wish I had a dollar for every person I&#x27;ve given a tube or jar of this to, and every person I&#x27;ve told to get this product, because I could have retired already. Seriously, there is NOTHING like this product for any amount of money on the market. When I was a girl, there were a lot of rumors about exactly where Mary Kay got the formula for this product--some old leather tanning guy, a healer lady who made her own ointments...doesn&#x27;t matter. Here&#x27;s what I know--get this product, use it for everything, and pat yourself on the back for doing so. You will wonder how you lived without it.</li>
            <li> So glad this is finally in a tube. It&#x27;s the same formula I remember for the past 40 years and you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m oily in a few places but I don&#x27;t care. I love constantly hearing how I don&#x27;t look my age and I just keep slathering this stuff on and loving it. It is the richest moisturizer you can imagine... almost like rubbing grease on your face... but it absorbs and smells nice. If you have any concerns about signs of aging on your face and you haven&#x27;t tried this you need to buy some today and I mean it...today. You have to own this if you have dry skin but even if you have an oily t-zone like me but you&#x27;re concerned about your cheeks and around your eyes and your temples (yep!) then you need to go ahead and use it too. (It&#x27;s worth the money because a few ounces will last forever.) My face is soaking it in right now. Serious. Moisture. I&#x27;m 47 and look 37 and this is in my arsenal, girl!</li>
            <li> After a dog bite that took a chunk out of my right index finger, my doctor suggested that I use Mary Kay Extra Emolient Night Cream on it with a band-aid. After 3 wks, the hole is filled in...thanks to God, of course,  AND the Mary Kay cream, it is healed, with virtually no scarring.&lt;br /&gt;It healed diaper rash on my granddaughter, so I recommend trying it on wounds, etc. I realize that the company can not claim that their cream has a healing component, but I would say that it definitely played a part in beautifyling the outcome as far as cosmetic scarring goes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MARY KAY AND OFTEN USE HER PRODUCTS BUT THIS CREAM WAS&lt;br /&gt;THICK AND MORE LIKE VASELINE.  I AM USING IT AT NIGHT ON MY FEET BEFORE&lt;br /&gt;I PUT ON MY SOX AND GO TO BED.  IT WAS JUST TOO GREASY. I JUST COULD&lt;br /&gt;NOT PUT IT ON MY FACE A SECOND TIME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It&#x27;s amazing stuff! I&#x27;m glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years.  I am very satisfied with it. IN THE PAST, I HAD USED MAKEUP WHICH I WAS ALLERGIC TO.</li>
            <li> I use this as a hand cream at night because it is heavy duty.  I have extremely dry skin in the winter.  Also use it on my feet.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream for about 3 weeks. My face feels softer and, looking the mirror, I realize that my wrinkles don&#x27;t look as bad as they were a month ago. I would recommend that the instructions be read before using the product. I used too much of the cream and applied it to a dry face. I did a lot better on the second night.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Use it on my legs after shaving in shower&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I had been using a sample of this and loved it. It was unscented.  Ordered a full sized bottle and what I received smells like a grandma. Why, Mary Kay, why???</li>
            <li> I use this product on my lips so they don&#x27;t get chapped.  Try it, you will love it.  Only need a little and it last forever!</li>
            <li> This is an extremely good dry skin cream but not hardly as good as it was back when it came in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay has so reduced the volumn of their already expensive products by repackaging, tubes versus jars, etc., that it makes these products no longer a good choice.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin and live in a dry climate this emolient is invaluable.  I use it on my face and arms. It takes very little, as it spreads as it warms on your skin.  Caution: this night cream is not for anyone with oily skin.  This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cream when my skin needs a dose of deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  It&#x27;s really heavy and greasy.  But I don&#x27;t know what I expected for the low price!  I use and love many Mary Kay products.  Vaseline would have worked better.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  Wish I had found this during the winter!  I didn&#x27;t realize how thick it was so I used a little much last night....shared with my husband too after I did my arms.  It felt so good and made my face (and arms) so soft and hydrated.  I thought my dry skin would get less dry as summer got here, but it didn&#x27;t.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for really dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 20 years and still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for almost 30 years.  Every so often I get taken in by some &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream but always return to this product.  It is a bit greasy but nothing clears up dry skin patches as well as this.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for aging skin protects too ........I have used it forever and feel lost without it.</li>
            <li> My eyes are often irritated due to seasonal allergies and the constant watering makes the eyelid and below eye areas dry.  I apply this each night and sometimes in the morning and it takes the dryness away.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and for age 64 do not have alot of wrinkles.  I love the feel of this and the protection it gives me thru the night.  I would highly recommend this - use it beginning in your 20&#x27;s and see remarkable results when you are 60!!</li>
            <li> Same Mary Kay I&#x27;ve used for many years.  I would prefer in the former jar, but the tube is good too.</li>
            <li> We have been using for over 20 years this product&lt;br /&gt;And recommend it highly it is a great note cream</li>
            <li> I been using this for a few months on my husband feet they are so dry they spit this cream keeps his feet so soft now.</li>
            <li> have used this product for 25 yrs i was happy to be able to order from amazon and not wait for a rep.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. This is by far the best face cream I have ever used. It is very rich and thick. For dry skin this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 10 years. It is the best. I use it after the shower and mid day. A little is a lot, so it will last for several years. Could not live without it! ( I am 47 with few wrinkles.) My mom has beautiful skin and this is what she uses too! Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my lips, eyes and forehead for over 30 years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It is excellent for dry skin.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Have been using it for more than just faces since I was in my 20&#x27;s  It became our daughters then our sons diaper treatment when they were born. Was great for helping to prevent diaper rash and treating it if they broke out. My husband, who is a carpenter uses it in his dry cracked hands from handling wood. Of course I use it on my face as well. I hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite cream since I was a little girl.  My Nana used to put it on at night, and now I do the same!  I even use it on areas like my hands and feet when the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS DAY AND NIGHT, MY SKIN HAS BECOME VERY DRY AROUND MY NOSE AND MOUTH AND THIS PRODUCT IS A MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> It looks like hardened Vasoline coming from the tube.  It smells like perfumed Vasoline.  It is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> have used this cream for many years.  best ever for under eyes, lips, bottoms of feet, heels, any dry skin.  my husband likes it also.</li>
            <li> This is a great item and a great transaction.</li>
            <li> received as expected and in excellent condition.  thanks so much</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream.  Would highly recommend for those with dry skin or Rosacea.  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a new tube of emollient. It seemed like about a fourth of the tube was missing.</li>
            <li> I know this is a product for women,  but my barber (a woman) gave me a little tube because my forehead and scalp was very dry in this winter weather.  I had used all the usual moisture creams which helped for a brief time,  but this product seems to have no alcohol and really works.  It appears greasy at first,  but that is only temporary.  Though it is not convenient to really rub it into the scalp,  I put a little on my pocket comb.  And I use it on elbows,  hands, etc.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on Earth - for real.  Has helped this acne-ridden girl tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have used this around my eyes since my early 20&#x27;s.  I am now 63 and don&#x27;t look it!  What better endorsement?</li>
            <li> This product is really nice for those people that have extremely dry skin and plus u only need a dab</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for more than 30 years.  I have used it for a facial night cream, a salve for diaper chapped bottoms on my grandchildren and for rough &amp; dry heals and hands.  I love the product and I hope Mary Kay will never discontinue it. I like the fact I can buy it on Amazon and not be bothered with a beauty consultant.  It is the only Mary Kay product I now use.  I have used all Mary Kay products because I was a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant for many years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a product like it.  It is the best cream for dry, chapped, flaky feet, elbows, knees, and hands.  I hope they never stop making it.  And I love the scent too.</li>
            <li> In the summer I would always have dry, cracked rogh, sore heels due to constantly wearing flip flops.  I got this stuff and would put it on at night just before going to bed and would sleep with socks on. I could tell the difference the first time I used it.  Doing this nightly would keep my heels soft and uncracked.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Seller definitely held up their end. I was slightly disappointed that Mary Kay had slightly changed the scent of the product though; now it is more rose water- perfume-y than clean smelling.</li>
            <li> This a fast, easy, and economical way to purchase Mary Kay Night Cream.  Great price, service, and fast delivery.  I would recommend this product to everyone, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> more like just putting on vaseline, but pink and have a purfume smell.</li>
            <li> Use it morning and night, Love MK</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream is an amazing product.  Seldom do you find a product that it can be said meets all expectations - and exceeds them.  There is nothing negative to be said about it.  Moisturizes this old lady&#x27;s skin overnight, smells great, even helps heal broken skin and pimples, for a reasonable cost because you need use only a small amount.  I appreciate being able to order it thru Amazon and not have to search out a Mary Kay salesperson.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer because of prompt receipt of product but this time it took longer. There was good reason so I understand.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand though why we pay double shipping for 2 small products that will fit in the same box.</li>
            <li> I have been using night cream for years for sunburn relief.  But it becomes a hassle in my small town to see who was selling Mary Kay at any given time.  So I had a thought, look on Amazon.  And there it was!!!  I am so glad that I can continue to keep my night cream well stocked, for both myself and my kids.  It is the BEST stuff ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this night cream for several years.  It stays on until&lt;br /&gt;morning and has a nice fragrance.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old. For the past 2 years the skin around my mouth has become very dry, red, scaly, peeling, sore, and overall unattractive. I tried tons of different lotions, chapsticks, lip treatments, and oils and noting worked. To top it off, 6 months ago I had an allergic reaction to a mascara which damaged the skin around my eyes and ever since the skin has been dry and peeling and swollen and nothing would help. You could imagine how insecure I was about it, I hated anyone getting to close to me. The skin around my eyes had deep wrinkles because of how dry the skin was. &lt;br /&gt;I was about ready to give up hope when last week I remembered that my mom always bought this stuff for my grandma and she swore by it. Luckily my mom had some lying around so I started using it right away. THANK GOD I FOUND THIS! Overnight the skin around my eyes and mouth were noticeably less dry. Within 3 days the skin around my eyes stopped peeling and the skin around my mouth was no longer red, sore, or scaly looking. And after just a week of use my eyes had completely healed - no more wrinkles and they actually look better than they did before! My mouth still peels a little bit but it&#x27;s nothing like it was before and I think it is just the healing process. If I put a this on in the morning I don&#x27;t have to worry about peeling skin for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s seriously a life changer.</li>
            <li> Not sure of product is very thick and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;!  Some what hard to apply and can cause bangs to become oily, it will have to really moisturize my skin to continue use!</li>
            <li> I really really like this product.  It is one of the best that I have used</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product pictured. I received a round jar that says Mary Kay and the right name but inside is a pink waxy substance that is HIGHLY FRAGRANCED. Mary Kay is known for no fragrance in their skin care products and no coloring. I just want my money back now!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this product does not dry out my skin. I only use it once a day before I go to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great for cuticles and any other dry areas. Gent le &amp; healing for my sensitive skin.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several years.  Because of very dry lips and cuticles, I use it mostly for them.</li>
            <li> Transaction happened as it was described!  Perfect - just the way I had anticipated it!</li>
            <li> This is the best night and day lotion for my very sensitive hands.  I have tried several other brands, but always have the best results with Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> If you have a cold, and your nose is raw from using a tissue every other minute, this is without a doubt the best stuff to soothe your aching nose. When i&#x27;m under the weather I use it on my nose before bed. In the morning, it&#x27;s ready for another day of abuse.</li>
            <li> Love this product, can be multi-FUNCTIONAL especially in winter. Works well to use on cuticles, any rough, dry places, pamper hands, too.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Always happy with Mary Kay product - especially this one.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d in good order. thanks</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Had used a sample and wanted to always get more so was very happy to find this. This product is also a great wound healer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream. I use this for hand cream and put this on my lips when they are chapped. It works better than Chap Stick.</li>
            <li> Just as described, happy to have found it online! Will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Great that I didn&#x27;t have to go through a consultant.</li>
            <li> Omg this is the smelliest stuff ever.  It smells like an old lady and its so strong.  Ugh!  I like the products performance but I would never buy it again because of the hideous smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer since high school. I&#x27;m now almost 35 and people are always commenting about my great skin. Little do they know I inherited my mom&#x27;s extreme dry skin. This emollient cream is phenomenal. I recommend it to anyone with dry skin, especially during the winter season. Never have I found another moisturizer that works as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since Mary Kay was brand new back in the 60&#x27;s. My dermatologist is amazed at how good my skin looks. I love the fragrance and the ease of dispensing it from a tube.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this has so many good reviews. Though called a &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; this is literally just pink, highly fragranced vaseline. Literally, the first ingredient is petrolatum, the second is mineral oil -- as in, the cheapest, most pore-cloggin, horrible thing for your face ever. I wish I could return it but I guess this seller doesn&#x27;t take returns?!? Wish I had known that before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years..  63 years old and use it am and pm on my dry skin.  Wonderful.</li>
            <li> this is the best product Mary Kay has!.. I have always used it for my feet, especially the heels and NEVER have cracked heels.  I swear by it.</li>
            <li> Use it for my feet and for my husbands elbows. Works great.</li>
            <li> If you need extra moisture for dry skin, this is good.  But, it does have the same texture as vaseline...if you don&#x27;t mind that and the fragrance is a little strong, it will be good for you.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works really well.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 20 years then stopped. I believe my skin has fewer wrinkles than friends  my age because of using this product day and night, so I decided to try it again, hopefully for another 20 years!!! (I&#x27;m 68)</li>
            <li> This product is the best for dry skin on any part of your body.  I have dry hands and this makes them soft and my hands no longer feel tight or itchie from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gets the job done. One tube usually lasts a year. My skin is dry year round and I rarely have to apply this more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I used this onmyself for many years. I even bought it as a gift for a pregnant friend. It worked wonders on her itching/stretching belly skin!</li>
            <li> The consistency of this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is more like Aquaphor, an oil like gel. Have only used it once so not sure how it will work yet re: outcome. The odd smell though was enough for my dogs to take one whiff &amp; run from me. Lol. Which I won&#x27;t mind if it helps in hydrating my skin. Haven&#x27;t felt a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. I&#x27;ve never used anything better.</li>
            <li> use on my feet to keep callouses at bay</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for sometime and really likes it.  She was getting it from a Mary Kay dealer and paying more than twice as much as here.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream!!! My face feels so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay Extra Emollient Night Cream for 35 years on my face, neck and hands.  I heard back in the day that this is what Mary Kay Ash used every day.  I love it and would not use anything else.  It is my only beauty cream.  I am always told I look younger and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Been using for years.  Will not go a day without this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it. Best ever. Have used it for over 30yrs. My skin stays moist and less wrinkles. Use after washing my face and under make-up.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute favorite of my Dad&#x27;s.  He uses it everyday and he says it really helps him when he shaves.  I love it too.  So if your looking for a night cream, give this one a shot, but be warned, it is very rich and you need a very little bit.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Moisturizes my really dry face without getting oily. I tried to do without it this past winter (and only use the MK tinted moisturizer) and had a dry patch on my forehead I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Definitely going to keep using the night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this night cream along with a couple others and I alternate them.  This night cream is very emolient and a bit greasy but I still love it and I love how it hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have loved &amp;#34;pink night cream&amp;#34; forever it&#x27;s great to be able to find it so cheap. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used and it smells good too. I used it years ago all the time and have tried some really expensive brands, but always come back to this, because it makes my skin look so much better when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and seriously have not found any other moisturizer to compete with for my dry skin. I even just tried using MAC studio moisturizer which is more expensive and still does not give me the moisture I need like this does . It is extremely thick and greasy BUT that&#x27;s what makes the moisture stay long and it even helps my makeup stick to my face as well . Anyways , the amazing reviews are right . This product is worth it to buy if you have extremely dry skin like I do . Now go ahead &amp; click &amp;#34;add to cart!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pretty sure you wouldn&#x27;t regret it .</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I have been using it for years. It beats all the other night creams.</li>
            <li> Ive never used Mary Kay products so I wanted to try this cream at night. It was really greasy for my face and on my hands, also couldn&#x27;t stand the smell!! Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I put it on my eyelids, under eye and top lip every night.  I think it is holding nature at bay.  A spectacular product!!!</li>
            <li> The best hand and foot cream ever! Really thick and it stays on your hands or feet. I am almost finished with the tube and will reorder it soon.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor to use on splits in the vaginal area that happen to older women.  It has worked well and I&#x27;m glad to find out about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay Products for over forty years.  I use this night cream every morning and every night to moisturize my skin, and I get a lot of compliments about my skin.  Also, I use this product on my children to heal any skin scraps or injuries.  It works!</li>
            <li> My night cream came in a different bottle, so I don&#x27;t know if they accidentally switched my product.  It works well though!</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and have used this for years and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. You only need a little and apply it to your freshly washed and somewhat moist face - it also works well on your lips and can be used on your hands. This little tube lasts quite awhile - definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> So good for extremely dry skin. Will leave you feeling refreshed and noticing the difference.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my elbows and knees and legs. Just about everywhere were I have dry skin.Love it!</li>
            <li> This Product is wonderful. I love the way it feels, makes my skin feel soft and silky! I first bought this product 4 years ago and use it every night AND I also apply in the morning after my shower as my face is a bit dry....works like a Charm!</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and crack during the winter months.  I have used this product before and wanted to get more.  I am very pleased with this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product.  I use it on the bottom of my feet.  Product is awesome. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i used this for a many years and especially in the winter for my lips.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I cant tell the differnce, but she can. She uses it every evening like a bedtime ritual. All I know is she already asked me to order another tube, this one is half gone.</li>
            <li> I have use this for over  30 years! It is not only a good night cream but it heals everything from burns to cuts, scars, dry cracked feet, chapped lips, dry nose... I met a man one time that saw the Mary Kay sticker on my car( I sold Mary Kay then) he said &amp;#34;oh my God I love that pink &amp;#34;stuff &amp;#34; it healed my badly burn leg from my motorcycle pipe when nothing the doctors gave me would, it&#x27;s magic! Thank you Mary Kay Ash💖</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It keeps the wrinkles away by keeping my skin moist. The price was also reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years. I&#x27;m 83 year old and have very few wrinkles. Many people can&#x27;t believe how old I am, including my doctor.  (Virginia)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years!</li>
            <li> Gives good moisture to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and am so happy they still have it for me.  I continue to get compliments on looking younger than I am.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I use on my feet living here in the desert. It keeps them soft and callous free with regular use.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> Have used extra emollient night cream for many, many years...it works and that is what counts. I love the quality of Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay  Night Cream for so many years!  It used to come in jars, and was a reddish-pink color.  It lasted so long, so it was economical as well as very satisfying.  My friends (and my daughter) say that I have clear skin, and wondered how I kept it that way.&lt;br /&gt;Now the tubes are very convenient for traveling, so I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> i have used this product on and off over the years..  i plan on using it for many years to come</li>
            <li> Product had been firm, not as \\&quot;spreadable\\&quot; in past, still excellent product...will buy again to keep hands from chapping due to type of employment...also good to put on feet with socks at night!</li>
            <li> As you can see the picture shows 2 boxes.  You only get 1.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to chapstick, and this stuff works great as a lip moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not filmy, or too greasy.  Been using this stuff for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is as effective as anything five times the price.  I previously used a similar Elizabeth Arden product.  I like this better.  Perfect to smear all over any exposed area when you are skiing or are in dry, cold wind.  Pleasant odor--not cloying.</li>
            <li> I was a expecting it to be the same emollient that I had previously used that came in a round, small 2.5 oz container.  This was in a tube and although the name is the same, it smells and looks the same, it is not the same. It is much thicker and takes three times the amount as the other I used to be able to purchase. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I love this product i grew up with my Grandmother using it. I love the smell just for that reason. It also is very great in the winter time if you get severe dry skin on you face and hands. Altough i was not pleased to see that the picture in the discription was not what i had recieved. What I recieved was a tub, the kind you get body butters and such in. It is not as convienent as a tube in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this cream! It does wonders for my skin! I am constantly washing my hands all day long, and this cream helps with the dry and cracking skin I get around my nail beds.</li>
            <li> First let me clarify by saying, I would like to technically rate this product a 4.5 because of the smell.  It kind of smells like &amp;#34;pennies&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; as my boyfriend would say.  But it doesn&#x27;t bother me and it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to knock off one star.  But that&#x27;s it for a &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; issue...&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the good stuff!  I am a health care worker and this product saves my hands.  I wash my hands at least 50 times a shift and when I get home they were very dry and cracked and sometimes painful.  I began using this product at night about a year ago and recently began to use it in the mornings as well.  I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin through-out the day even with the continuous washings.  I have even started using it on my feet, but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell a significant long term difference (only about a week and in winter and not EVERY DAY...the TRUE test will be in summer when I break out my sandals!), but the short term is VERY nice!&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands (I wear XS exam gloves or little girl gloves) and I use about a nickel size amount each time.  One tube has lasted me about one year give or take a few days and that&#x27;s just my hands.  It will probably go faster now that I am using it on my feet, but it&#x27;s worth it.  If anyone has ever used Aquaphor the consistency is very similar but this absorbs faster in my opinion and even if you wash your hands right after applying it, they still stay soft.  Of course, I would recommend allowing your hands to completely absorb it before washing them if you can.  While it leave a small greasy residue directly after applying (and that is based on the amount you apply and how long you rub it in) it quickly absorbs into the skin leaving your hands very soft!</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay products !! They make my skin feel so good and look good. I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very dry skin so use it as a night face cream.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Best thing for very dry skin that I have ever found!</li>
            <li> It heals the dryness we have on our feet too.  Just a few days of wearing socks at night with this cream has healed the flip flop feet that most of us get each season.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a couple days ago... and the results are amazing.. and instant!  This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I have some (slight) rosacea and get small dry patches.  The first night using this, I woke up to softer, clearer, more even skin tone.  It&#x27;s nothing short of amazing I will be using this EVERY night for as long as they sell it.  It actually DOES what every other skin cream CLAIMS to do.  I was worried that with how thick and the vaselineish texture of the cream that I was going to break out... instead what little bumps I did have disappeared.  Thanks Mary Kay and please never discontinue!  You owe it to yourself to try this product.</li>
            <li> It works well on very dry skin, however I&#x27;m just not crazy about the scent.  And I noticed that it makes it  very greasy and shinny looking so I only use it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 35 years and consider it excellent. I am 84 years old and have no wrinkles on my cheeks or forehead. It has also helped my neck.  I religiously use it every night before retiring.</li>
            <li> I found a tub of this I&#x27;d shoved in the back of a drawer years ago because I thought it was too heavy for my face. I was having trouble with dry, cracked winter skin on my heels and feet, and nothing was working. Out of desperation I dug this out of the drawer, rubbed it on my heels, put on some socks and went to bed. The next morning they felt and looked so much better! With repeated use my feet are well on the way to being beach ready for vacation in a few weeks. It works on hands, too - our grandmothers had it right. Slather this on your hands at night and sleep with a pair of cotton gloves - you&#x27;ll wake up with your hands so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the formulation is the same (about the consistency of petroleum jelly), try this on your feet, hands, elbows, knees, etc.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon - I&#x27;m almost out and I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in winter!!</li>
            <li> I have extra flaky dry skin . This is the only product that keeps my skin soft,supple and flakeless during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay was a woman who helped empower other women. She enjoyed the color of pale pink. I am more of a bold pink myself ----raspberry or wild plum, to be specific. She had wonderful skin and was an amazing entrepreneur. Still like her eye shadow the best. Also, this night cream. I put this night cream on my feet and put thick and comfy socks on over it and have a smooth night of comfy sleep and my feet are moisturized for the night. Well, the sun is coming up..time for me to do something other than write reviews for whoever I am writing these reviews for...........see ya later alligator. After while.....croc............</li>
            <li> My wife has used the product for several years and she is totally satisfied with it and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I have used MK Extra Emollient Night Cream for years.  It is very good for soothing and healing dry skin.  I use it on my daughter who has very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms which are sun damaged from living in the south all my life.  It has helped them a great deal and I am very pleased with the results.  Try to keep some for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s a must have before-bed part of my skin care regiment. I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> used this a long time and help with dry skin especially in the winter months. best of mary kay. recommend this highly</li>
            <li> use this everyday on my face, lips, cuts feels so good</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps keeps my skin well moisturized and wrinkle free!</li>
            <li> Used this years ago and stopped because I didn&#x27;t want to keep going to parties. So glad I found this on Amazon! I have become a diabetic in the past five years and my skin shows it. My forehead had become a very dry patch, flaking daily. I&#x27;m back to using this night cream for three weeks now and my face is looking fresh and young again....no more flaking for me! I love this emollient night cream. Yes, you should buy it. So much easier to put on in this type of container than in the old jars.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry heels. Just rub on, cover with socks overnight and feet look amazing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Product was perfect! Replenishes and soothes the skin. Makes it feel soft and gives some of the radiance back! A very little goes a long way. This will last a while.</li>
            <li> This is great in the winter.</li>
            <li> Softens dry skin. I have been using it for years. Price is very reasonable for a great product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product- especially in the winter for my dry hands and feet. Would recommend it to anyone who washes their hands in excess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was going to be, but I do thoroughly enjoy this product, especially to use on my hands and feet.  As with the rest of my body, it gets incredibly dry in the winter when it&#x27;s very cold outside! I love that it&#x27;s not cold like lotion is to the touch! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 40 years, it works great for me as I have dry skin. I tried using something else once and had to go back to the extra emollient night cream. If you have dry skin this is for you.</li>
