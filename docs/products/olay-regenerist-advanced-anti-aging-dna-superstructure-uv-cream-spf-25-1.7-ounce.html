    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best thing I found for wrinkles and problem skin (no it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping my skin will still look great!</li>
            <li>(ladies, we ALL need the Spf) and it is really excellent.</li>
            <li>The Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li>If I could give this 10 stars I would because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am very happy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great alternative to sunblock lotions.  </li>
            <li>The texture of this lotion is superb on your skin, and it has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I will admit that I am a great fan of Olay skin products.  </li>
            <li>Moistures well and the protection is great.  </li>
            <li>The serum is a great feeling on your skin and smells</li>
            <li>Because &#x27;happy&#x27; has 5 words, thus 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s an amazing bargain!  </li>
            <li>The best aspect of this lotion is that it is an easy to use moisturizer and sun block.   </li>
            <li>As all Olay products are, this seems to be a good quality creme.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>But have always had good results with Olay products and this one</li>
            <li>I tried the product for a good 3 weeks before reviewing it.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using both for over 3 months now and still have a good supply.</li>
            <li>It has a good SPF 25 for coverage, but you can also use this moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how good it</li>
            <li>packaging is very good and lends itself to easy</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light product that is very effective!  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have very many</li>
            <li>Great texture of the cream...might be better in winters.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i have been using this moisturizer for about 8 months and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>(okay, let&#x27;s say it--wrinkles!)</li>
            <li>I liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency, it goes on well.  </li>
            <li>This product is nice to apply.</li>
            <li>but then I used it....and the creamy, soft, smooth, and perfect consistency texture of this moisturizer loves my skin - does great under make-up and with SPF 25</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant and I like putting it on.</li>
            <li>Also, there is a very strong perfume scent to the product</li>
            <li>This is pleasant to use, goes on easily, spreads easily, spf 25 helps protect your face from the suns harmful rays.</li>
            <li>It feels very light</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance, which I didn&#x27;t notice seconds after applying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF of 25 is a good solution for mild protection.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate some brands, but this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>I have reviewed it here on Amazon and love the product and use it often.</li>
            <li>that if I am buying an anti-aging product, it isn&#x27;t for my chin or forehead--it&#x27;s for my eye area, which is where most women show signs of age</li>
            <li>And yes, it has SPF 25, I do applaud Olay for upping the SPF in this product over most of their others which have</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>but I do know that olay products have some of the highest ratings as well as the best prices for anti-aging products and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li>It has a nice and smooth feel to it,</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The scent is OK</li>
            <li>Do I love it.    </li>
            <li>What is Ammonium Polyacrylate anyway??? :-)</li>
            <li>By April, I&#x27;m sure I will be buying another pump.</li>
            <li>This is a product you will use more than once.</li>
            <li>, I feel better about having protection although if I will be in the sun a lot, I would wear more ....</li>
            <li>For now this is my primary moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, which tends to negate the effects of most of the sunblock products that I have tried.      </li>
            <li>I love the Olay Regenerist line</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fewer or lighter wrinkles, more elasticity, or better skin tone.</li>
            <li>However, the tall sleek design is great because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room in my medicine cabinet as a jar would.</li>
            <li>so I turn to anti aging products more as preventative as well as to help me with the lines I&#x27;m already noticing.  </li>
            <li>this product was just okay.  </li>
            <li>Still, I will say that I really enjoyed the feel and texture of the Regenerist cream.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the product really is quite wonderful</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I thought I took pretty good care of my face just by exfoliating every day, but now that I am using the Regenerist line, I notice that my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have the higher SPF rating for daytime.</li>
            <li>It can be strong and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, is smooth, and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>It certainly is moisturizing and a good sunblock.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and very fair skinned with combination dry/oily facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it really does protect you on those bright sunny days.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous, and protecting your skin from the sun is the most important thing you can do to fight wrinkles.    </li>
            <li>An advanced skin care research team has developed a great line of skin care solutions for all needs.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine for that. . .</li>
            <li>taking off one star because it&#x27;s pricey for what it is: a good quality sunscreen suitable for facial use.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and evenly, which is important because I want the sunscreen even across my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I gave the product a little over a month to try to get the best sense of results.  </li>
            <li>I use this product with the Olay Regenerist Face Wash, and Eye Cream, within a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>goes on smoothly, no funky sunscreen scent, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure that this is worth the increased price</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak about free radicals or collagen structure since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, protects well and does not have an overpowering odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this a great product that delivers.</li>
            <li>Gentle, effective -at</li>
            <li>Also because it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and feels good.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice face</li>
            <li>The Spf is a nice high number and it goes well under your foundation.</li>
            <li>long as she is happy.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to give you an idea of my skin type, because I think this has a big impact on how effective the product is.  </li>
            <li>And this is formulated in a pleasantly mild smelling, light cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could very well be thanks to that \\&quot;DNA superstructure\\&quot;, or maybe it&#x27;s just a darn good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It has the right consistency and so it smoothes on easily.    </li>
            <li>Age 53 and lifelong sun lover makes my skin look great and keeps those harmful rays from aging my skin.  </li>
            <li>Freshly scented and light to the touch, the cream glides on your face with ease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stayed moisturized, haven&#x27;t had a burn, it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and hopefully it&#x27;s having a good affect on my skin for the future.</li>
            <li>I absolutely and positively LOVE this Olay Regenerist cream.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good sun block product that will prevent sun damage, without having to apply it constantly.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it would be perfect for snow skiers, but in my opinion it is just to thick and greasy</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin smooth and supple-feeling.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to sell it as a scientific breakthrough DNA manipulating super fountain-of-youth cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried out the proX regimen and it was great except that the moisturiser for the proX has a spf 30 moisturiser that left a really oily look to my face.</li>
            <li>Also, I found that this didn&#x27;t adequately combat my skin&#x27;s dryness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>While this wasn&#x27;t necessarily what I was looking for, I have been very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply makeup on afterwords without much hassle.</li>
            <li>I felt like my skin became immediately softer and smoother looking after a single application, and I just loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize well, and while it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from getting a tan (my first in probably a dozen years!)</li>
            <li>The cream is not too greasy or shiny, and sinks in quickly, which is good.</li>
            <li>Ultimately making this product more ideal for colder days (winter and fall) and less practical for summer and spring.    </li>
            <li>Like the rest of the Olay Regenerist line, this Advanced Anit-Aging Dna Uv Cream really delivers.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is nothing short of AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for about a month and am pleased with the reults so far.</li>
            <li>So while this product works okay and is reasonably priced, it really isn&#x27;t a bargain.  </li>
            <li>is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that my skin looked firmer, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference to the fine lines that bother me (particularly around my mouth and eyes).  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, and it&#x27;s exactly what it said it was.  </li>
            <li>Yeah I know doing the chemical sunblock before a moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser measures out just the right amount to apply to face and neck.  </li>
            <li>but if your face is overly sensitive to perfumes then maybe you had better get a sample of this to try first.</li>
            <li>The scent is very good, with a slight hint of that familiar SPF smell when you first apply which I actually think smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Philosophy and Bare Minerals are my two favorite lines for makeup and face products.</li>
            <li>I generally prefer a higher spf, as well as better ppd for my face.  </li>
            <li>Now this Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Dna Superstucture Uv Cream Spf 25, (wow, is that a name or what!)</li>
            <li>Because of this I don&#x27;t see myself using this product consistently because I have found other lotions that do a better job of firming my skin while making my face feel hydrated or smooth.    </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, although I certainly don&#x27;t expect my fairly young-looking skin to transform magically back to skin like a 20 year old.</li>
            <li>I used it more as a daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews about Olay products, may people say they use suspect and possibly toxic ingredients in their products.</li>
            <li>and i still haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>As an avid gardener and boater, I like the spf factor.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s one of the better products in the category.</li>
            <li>First time ordering creams.  </li>
            <li>Received in time and exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased the Olay UV cream, I didn&#x27;t expect what I received.</li>
            <li>My skin is protected from short-term sun exposure, feels moisturized and nourished, and my foundation application seems to go on smoother than when I don&#x27;t use this first.</li>
            <li>but it has a higher spf.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes quite well, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it for well over a couple of months and just ordered a second one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After 2 months, my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel any different (except that it&#x27;s more tan).</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is very important to me as my skin is extremely pale and my cheeks and nose tend to burn exceptionally easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s been incredibly gradual, with absolutely no burning; and my face doesn&#x27;t look dry or haggard.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this one provides any additional \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; benefits in particular, but the sunblock feature is worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>However because it feels good to use it, I will definitely continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li>The only reason I started using these products is from the reviews I read on Amazon and how most people really like the product.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this cream, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a heavy oily feeling.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing qualities of this product are good, although I&#x27;m not sure about its \\&quot;anti-aging DNA superstructure qualities.\\</li>
            <li>The price is right, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>At any rate I liked the way it felt and will probably buy more at the store when my sample runs out, and will alternate its use with my regular, daily application of Oil of Olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li>took off one (or even one-half) star because there were some very minor packing things that I think could have been done better.</li>
            <li>considering I have super sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot say whether it works in precisely that way or not, since aging is hard to gauge!  </li>
            <li>I do have very oily skin though, so probably people with dry skin would love it.</li>
            <li>Just a quick tutorial physical sunblocks contain zinc and can be applied after moisturizer, whereas many sunblocks are actually chemical (like helioplex) and must be applied before a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There is nothing, of course, that does as much for your skin as sun protection.</li>
            <li>Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free</li>
            <li>an SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has some parabens in it as preservatives, but I don&#x27;t worry much about those.  </li>
            <li>it really upsets me is</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It seems to really moisturize my skin and</li>
            <li>These products don&#x27;t tend to do much repair work, so don&#x27;t expect some miracle fountain of youth formula here, but as a sunscreen</li>
            <li>It soaks in fast and gets out of the way to put on make up.  </li>
            <li>I spend much of the fall through spring in southwest Florida on the beach.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and yes, I don&#x27;t think you really need all those ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is gently scented so it does not interfere with perfume or cologne.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have learned to really appreciate products that offer SPF protection and this is a product I would certanly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>My wife wants it.  </li>
            <li>The cream goes on nice and thick and is easily absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>If money is an issue and you aren&#x27;t worried about putting these chemicals on your skin, you will probably like this product, but I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy something more natural, or at least less toxic, that works just as well or better.</li>
            <li>I use many other products in the Regenerist line, so</li>
            <li>It also smells great, I usually can&#x27;t use scented products but for some reason this scent doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems using these products, no breakouts or reactions (not that I have sensitive skin anyway) and they are easy to use and my face feels different.</li>
            <li>:) i use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>This is the first anti aging product I have used so far.   </li>
            <li>I love the pump which inhibits bacteria growth, but the pump is not very precise.</li>
            <li>Since I live in Minnesota and don&#x27;t spend too much time outdoors, the UV cream is my daytime moisturizer in the summer.</li>
            <li>I also live in a very warm/humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is no longer an spf 25, so this is an older product.  </li>
            <li>Will be back in the future for better deals.  </li>
            <li>It does have that greasy feel sunscreens always seem to have, but it soaks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue that takes forever to rub</li>
            <li>I just ordered nearly the whole Olay Regenerist Line really.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Paula Begoun&#x27;s \\&quot;Don&#x27;t go to makeup counter without me\\&quot; and this Olay moisturizer already came highly recommended</li>
            <li>I was aware of the product on my face, but it didn&#x27;t bother me, since this has been my same experience with most other high price sunscreen products.   </li>
            <li>I know Olay products are a little more affordable.</li>
            <li>The Regenerist cream is alleged to stem the skin&#x27;s aging process, presumably primarily via its UV protectant properties.      </li>
            <li>I think the Olay will get even more use in winter when the air gets really dried out.</li>
            <li>Normally I buy it at Target or Walgreens...</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice thick texture that I feel protects the skin and lasts.</li>
            <li>The Advanced Anti Aging DNA Super Structure Cream is just too thick for me.  </li>
            <li>I can report after using this product for a few months of working outdoors in the midday sun several days a week, that the sunscreen is both effective and sensitive-skin-safe</li>
            <li>It is very much like a facial sunblock, including how it feels and smells.</li>
            <li>and my skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have become accustomed to applying my moisturizer first than my sunblock (a physical not chemical).</li>
            <li>Olay products have usually worked well for me, so although I don&#x27;t love this one, I wouldn&#x27;t discourage someone from trying it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, was before spending the day outside working with friends.  </li>
            <li>although when I first apply it to my face it has a little bit of a drag to it, it seems OK if I don&#x27;t touch my face for awhile after application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old and have nice skin with very few wrinkles, and am often mistaken for being 7-10 years younger.  </li>
            <li>I had my 73 year old mother try it as well.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and didn&#x27;t agree with this product and I am also prone to by all natural items or organic.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and bought both the serum and the lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While all 3 lotions contain sun protection and direct the user to \\&quot;apply liberally to face and neck,\\&quot; they all also contain a warning that says to</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes well, so my skin feels hydrated and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>However, I do like using this product - it goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have any lingering smell.</li>
            <li>I have allergies as well as sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several weeks now and really appreciate the effect it has had.  </li>
            <li>but I am a 29 year old woman.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My face and neck skin is soft, but has wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t turn me off of Olay products - although I&#x27;ve tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV</li>
            <li>I felt very itchy all over, especially around the creases of my nose, between my eyebrows, and along my hairline.  </li>
            <li>and I have higly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now keep in mind because its a moisturizer its more cream-like in texture (thicker) and when applied on hot days (like everyday during the summer) can produce a heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>cream, while a little does go a long way, seems to just sit on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all.  </li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist DNA is strong and clears cases of dry skin in days, not weeks or months like other</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m a little more sensitive to fragrances in my skincare products than the average person.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and works as well on my face as any broad spectrum sunscreen does on my body.</li>
            <li>no no due to it contaminating the cream.</li>
            <li>B001F51TDG Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer, SPF 30, 2.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin and this moisturizes well enough for the summer, but</li>
            <li>I saw no change, either for better or worse, during the time I used this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly due to it having some silicone added, soaks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy, spreads well, and has a very faint and pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>That, however, may very well be due to staying out of the sun, using Oil of Olay, not using soap on my face, etc.,</li>
            <li>so I doubt that I can give any credit to this particular product, especially since I haven&#x27;t used it for very long!  </li>
            <li>This does neither, and I&#x27;ve used it in high heat and humidity, with plenty of sweat running down my face.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The best thing I found for wrinkles and problem skin (no it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping my skin will still look great!</li>
            <li> (ladies, we ALL need the Spf) and it is really excellent.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am very happy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a great alternative to sunblock lotions.  </li>
            <li> The texture of this lotion is superb on your skin, and it has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a great fan of Olay skin products.  </li>
            <li> Moistures well and the protection is great.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a great feeling on your skin and smells</li>
            <li> Because &#x27;happy&#x27; has 5 words, thus 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s an amazing bargain!  </li>
            <li> The best aspect of this lotion is that it is an easy to use moisturizer and sun block.   </li>
            <li> As all Olay products are, this seems to be a good quality creme.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> But have always had good results with Olay products and this one</li>
            <li> I tried the product for a good 3 weeks before reviewing it.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both for over 3 months now and still have a good supply.</li>
            <li> It has a good SPF 25 for coverage, but you can also use this moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how good it</li>
            <li> packaging is very good and lends itself to easy</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light product that is very effective!  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have very many</li>
            <li> Great texture of the cream...might be better in winters.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i have been using this moisturizer for about 8 months and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> (okay, let&#x27;s say it--wrinkles!)</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency, it goes on well.  </li>
            <li> This product is nice to apply.</li>
            <li> but then I used it....and the creamy, soft, smooth, and perfect consistency texture of this moisturizer loves my skin - does great under make-up and with SPF 25</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant and I like putting it on.</li>
            <li> Also, there is a very strong perfume scent to the product</li>
            <li> This is pleasant to use, goes on easily, spreads easily, spf 25 helps protect your face from the suns harmful rays.</li>
            <li> It feels very light</li>
            <li> It has a very light fragrance, which I didn&#x27;t notice seconds after applying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF of 25 is a good solution for mild protection.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate some brands, but this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed it here on Amazon and love the product and use it often.</li>
            <li> that if I am buying an anti-aging product, it isn&#x27;t for my chin or forehead--it&#x27;s for my eye area, which is where most women show signs of age</li>
            <li> And yes, it has SPF 25, I do applaud Olay for upping the SPF in this product over most of their others which have</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> but I do know that olay products have some of the highest ratings as well as the best prices for anti-aging products and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice and smooth feel to it,</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The scent is OK</li>
            <li> Do I love it.    </li>
            <li> What is Ammonium Polyacrylate anyway??? :-)</li>
            <li> By April, I&#x27;m sure I will be buying another pump.</li>
            <li> This is a product you will use more than once.</li>
            <li> , I feel better about having protection although if I will be in the sun a lot, I would wear more ....</li>
            <li> For now this is my primary moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, which tends to negate the effects of most of the sunblock products that I have tried.      </li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fewer or lighter wrinkles, more elasticity, or better skin tone.</li>
            <li> However, the tall sleek design is great because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room in my medicine cabinet as a jar would.</li>
            <li> so I turn to anti aging products more as preventative as well as to help me with the lines I&#x27;m already noticing.  </li>
            <li> this product was just okay.  </li>
            <li> Still, I will say that I really enjoyed the feel and texture of the Regenerist cream.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and the product really is quite wonderful</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I took pretty good care of my face just by exfoliating every day, but now that I am using the Regenerist line, I notice that my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have the higher SPF rating for daytime.</li>
            <li> It can be strong and lasts for most of the day.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is smooth, and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> It certainly is moisturizing and a good sunblock.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and very fair skinned with combination dry/oily facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it really does protect you on those bright sunny days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous, and protecting your skin from the sun is the most important thing you can do to fight wrinkles.    </li>
            <li> An advanced skin care research team has developed a great line of skin care solutions for all needs.  </li>
            <li> and it works fine for that. . .</li>
            <li> taking off one star because it&#x27;s pricey for what it is: a good quality sunscreen suitable for facial use.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and evenly, which is important because I want the sunscreen even across my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I gave the product a little over a month to try to get the best sense of results.  </li>
            <li> I use this product with the Olay Regenerist Face Wash, and Eye Cream, within a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, no funky sunscreen scent, and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that this is worth the increased price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak about free radicals or collagen structure since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, protects well and does not have an overpowering odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this a great product that delivers.</li>
            <li> Gentle, effective -at</li>
            <li> Also because it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and feels good.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice face</li>
            <li> The Spf is a nice high number and it goes well under your foundation.</li>
            <li> long as she is happy.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to give you an idea of my skin type, because I think this has a big impact on how effective the product is.  </li>
            <li> And this is formulated in a pleasantly mild smelling, light cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could very well be thanks to that \\&quot;DNA superstructure\\&quot;, or maybe it&#x27;s just a darn good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It has the right consistency and so it smoothes on easily.    </li>
            <li> Age 53 and lifelong sun lover makes my skin look great and keeps those harmful rays from aging my skin.  </li>
            <li> Freshly scented and light to the touch, the cream glides on your face with ease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stayed moisturized, haven&#x27;t had a burn, it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and hopefully it&#x27;s having a good affect on my skin for the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely and positively LOVE this Olay Regenerist cream.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good sun block product that will prevent sun damage, without having to apply it constantly.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it would be perfect for snow skiers, but in my opinion it is just to thick and greasy</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin smooth and supple-feeling.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to sell it as a scientific breakthrough DNA manipulating super fountain-of-youth cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried out the proX regimen and it was great except that the moisturiser for the proX has a spf 30 moisturiser that left a really oily look to my face.</li>
            <li> Also, I found that this didn&#x27;t adequately combat my skin&#x27;s dryness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> While this wasn&#x27;t necessarily what I was looking for, I have been very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply makeup on afterwords without much hassle.</li>
            <li> I felt like my skin became immediately softer and smoother looking after a single application, and I just loved the way it felt.  </li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize well, and while it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from getting a tan (my first in probably a dozen years!)</li>
            <li> The cream is not too greasy or shiny, and sinks in quickly, which is good.</li>
            <li> Ultimately making this product more ideal for colder days (winter and fall) and less practical for summer and spring.    </li>
            <li> Like the rest of the Olay Regenerist line, this Advanced Anit-Aging Dna Uv Cream really delivers.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is nothing short of AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for about a month and am pleased with the reults so far.</li>
            <li> So while this product works okay and is reasonably priced, it really isn&#x27;t a bargain.  </li>
            <li> is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that my skin looked firmer, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference to the fine lines that bother me (particularly around my mouth and eyes).  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, and it&#x27;s exactly what it said it was.  </li>
            <li> Yeah I know doing the chemical sunblock before a moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser measures out just the right amount to apply to face and neck.  </li>
            <li> but if your face is overly sensitive to perfumes then maybe you had better get a sample of this to try first.</li>
            <li> The scent is very good, with a slight hint of that familiar SPF smell when you first apply which I actually think smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Philosophy and Bare Minerals are my two favorite lines for makeup and face products.</li>
            <li> I generally prefer a higher spf, as well as better ppd for my face.  </li>
            <li> Now this Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Dna Superstucture Uv Cream Spf 25, (wow, is that a name or what!)</li>
            <li> Because of this I don&#x27;t see myself using this product consistently because I have found other lotions that do a better job of firming my skin while making my face feel hydrated or smooth.    </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, although I certainly don&#x27;t expect my fairly young-looking skin to transform magically back to skin like a 20 year old.</li>
            <li> I used it more as a daily sunscreen/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews about Olay products, may people say they use suspect and possibly toxic ingredients in their products.</li>
            <li> and i still haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> As an avid gardener and boater, I like the spf factor.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s one of the better products in the category.</li>
            <li> First time ordering creams.  </li>
            <li> Received in time and exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased the Olay UV cream, I didn&#x27;t expect what I received.</li>
            <li> My skin is protected from short-term sun exposure, feels moisturized and nourished, and my foundation application seems to go on smoother than when I don&#x27;t use this first.</li>
            <li> but it has a higher spf.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes quite well, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed it for well over a couple of months and just ordered a second one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After 2 months, my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel any different (except that it&#x27;s more tan).</li>
            <li> Sunscreen is very important to me as my skin is extremely pale and my cheeks and nose tend to burn exceptionally easily.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been incredibly gradual, with absolutely no burning; and my face doesn&#x27;t look dry or haggard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this one provides any additional \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; benefits in particular, but the sunblock feature is worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> However because it feels good to use it, I will definitely continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li> The only reason I started using these products is from the reviews I read on Amazon and how most people really like the product.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this cream, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a heavy oily feeling.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing qualities of this product are good, although I&#x27;m not sure about its \\&quot;anti-aging DNA superstructure qualities.\\</li>
            <li> The price is right, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> At any rate I liked the way it felt and will probably buy more at the store when my sample runs out, and will alternate its use with my regular, daily application of Oil of Olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> took off one (or even one-half) star because there were some very minor packing things that I think could have been done better.</li>
            <li> considering I have super sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> I honestly cannot say whether it works in precisely that way or not, since aging is hard to gauge!  </li>
            <li> I do have very oily skin though, so probably people with dry skin would love it.</li>
            <li> Just a quick tutorial physical sunblocks contain zinc and can be applied after moisturizer, whereas many sunblocks are actually chemical (like helioplex) and must be applied before a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There is nothing, of course, that does as much for your skin as sun protection.</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free</li>
            <li> an SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has some parabens in it as preservatives, but I don&#x27;t worry much about those.  </li>
            <li> it really upsets me is</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It seems to really moisturize my skin and</li>
            <li> These products don&#x27;t tend to do much repair work, so don&#x27;t expect some miracle fountain of youth formula here, but as a sunscreen</li>
            <li> It soaks in fast and gets out of the way to put on make up.  </li>
            <li> I spend much of the fall through spring in southwest Florida on the beach.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and yes, I don&#x27;t think you really need all those ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is gently scented so it does not interfere with perfume or cologne.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have learned to really appreciate products that offer SPF protection and this is a product I would certanly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are gentle and they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> My wife wants it.  </li>
            <li> The cream goes on nice and thick and is easily absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> If money is an issue and you aren&#x27;t worried about putting these chemicals on your skin, you will probably like this product, but I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy something more natural, or at least less toxic, that works just as well or better.</li>
            <li> I use many other products in the Regenerist line, so</li>
            <li> It also smells great, I usually can&#x27;t use scented products but for some reason this scent doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems using these products, no breakouts or reactions (not that I have sensitive skin anyway) and they are easy to use and my face feels different.</li>
            <li> :) i use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> This is the first anti aging product I have used so far.   </li>
            <li> I love the pump which inhibits bacteria growth, but the pump is not very precise.</li>
            <li> Since I live in Minnesota and don&#x27;t spend too much time outdoors, the UV cream is my daytime moisturizer in the summer.</li>
            <li> I also live in a very warm/humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is no longer an spf 25, so this is an older product.  </li>
            <li> Will be back in the future for better deals.  </li>
            <li> It does have that greasy feel sunscreens always seem to have, but it soaks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue that takes forever to rub</li>
            <li> I just ordered nearly the whole Olay Regenerist Line really.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Paula Begoun&#x27;s \\&quot;Don&#x27;t go to makeup counter without me\\&quot; and this Olay moisturizer already came highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was aware of the product on my face, but it didn&#x27;t bother me, since this has been my same experience with most other high price sunscreen products.   </li>
            <li> I know Olay products are a little more affordable.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist cream is alleged to stem the skin&#x27;s aging process, presumably primarily via its UV protectant properties.      </li>
            <li> I think the Olay will get even more use in winter when the air gets really dried out.</li>
            <li> Normally I buy it at Target or Walgreens...</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice thick texture that I feel protects the skin and lasts.</li>
            <li> The Advanced Anti Aging DNA Super Structure Cream is just too thick for me.  </li>
            <li> I can report after using this product for a few months of working outdoors in the midday sun several days a week, that the sunscreen is both effective and sensitive-skin-safe</li>
            <li> It is very much like a facial sunblock, including how it feels and smells.</li>
            <li> and my skin is also very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have become accustomed to applying my moisturizer first than my sunblock (a physical not chemical).</li>
            <li> Olay products have usually worked well for me, so although I don&#x27;t love this one, I wouldn&#x27;t discourage someone from trying it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, was before spending the day outside working with friends.  </li>
            <li> although when I first apply it to my face it has a little bit of a drag to it, it seems OK if I don&#x27;t touch my face for awhile after application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and have nice skin with very few wrinkles, and am often mistaken for being 7-10 years younger.  </li>
            <li> I had my 73 year old mother try it as well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and didn&#x27;t agree with this product and I am also prone to by all natural items or organic.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and bought both the serum and the lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While all 3 lotions contain sun protection and direct the user to \\&quot;apply liberally to face and neck,\\&quot; they all also contain a warning that says to</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes well, so my skin feels hydrated and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> However, I do like using this product - it goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have any lingering smell.</li>
            <li> I have allergies as well as sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several weeks now and really appreciate the effect it has had.  </li>
            <li> but I am a 29 year old woman.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My face and neck skin is soft, but has wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t turn me off of Olay products - although I&#x27;ve tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV</li>
            <li> I felt very itchy all over, especially around the creases of my nose, between my eyebrows, and along my hairline.  </li>
            <li> and I have higly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now keep in mind because its a moisturizer its more cream-like in texture (thicker) and when applied on hot days (like everyday during the summer) can produce a heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> cream, while a little does go a long way, seems to just sit on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all.  </li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist DNA is strong and clears cases of dry skin in days, not weeks or months like other</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a little more sensitive to fragrances in my skincare products than the average person.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and works as well on my face as any broad spectrum sunscreen does on my body.</li>
            <li> no no due to it contaminating the cream.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin and this moisturizes well enough for the summer, but</li>
            <li> I saw no change, either for better or worse, during the time I used this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly due to it having some silicone added, soaks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on creamy, spreads well, and has a very faint and pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> That, however, may very well be due to staying out of the sun, using Oil of Olay, not using soap on my face, etc.,</li>
            <li> so I doubt that I can give any credit to this particular product, especially since I haven&#x27;t used it for very long!  </li>
            <li> This does neither, and I&#x27;ve used it in high heat and humidity, with plenty of sweat running down my face.</li>
            <li> I actually can see that it has had a positive effect on small lines and wrinkles, some are gone and others are quite diminished.  </li>
            <li> The Regenerist line works extremely well for me, without causing my almost 60 year old skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> never thought I&#x27;d go back to the standard regular lines - since I had using Avalon Organics for so long</li>
            <li> I have not found any difference in the appearance of my facial skin, no worse and no better.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Olay, especially its flagship Oil of Olay beauty fluid product, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try when it came up for review.  </li>
            <li> As far as skin regeneration, there may be a little less fine lines on my forehead, it&#x27;s hard to say.   </li>
            <li> I saw some benefits, but it just wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Ounce-for-ounce, it&#x27;s about double the price of other facial sunscreen brands like neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I used Olay products for years and trusted the brand name for a long time.</li>
            <li> The Regenerist product actually has an SPF of 25 and the other 2 are SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> That means I actually use it, unlike my other \\&quot;miracles in a jar.\\&quot;     Go for it.</li>
            <li> a few hrs later, I forgot I actually had it on!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I usually buy natural products.</li>
            <li> I get it much less for sale in the stores, especially a 2 pack at Costco.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, yet acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> so I suspect I&#x27;m going to go to use it and just have an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> But I would rather put something on my skin that will not harm it in the long run, rather than save a little money.</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist products use methylparaben and other ingredients that the Environmental Working Group, on its site the Cosmetic Safety Database, has identified as toxic.  </li>
            <li> - there are plenty of other ways to test without having to dab this in the rabbits&#x27; eyes.</li>
            <li> a lot I&#x27;d use the Biore and other days the Olay.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin seems a little tighter and less dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not notice a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> You can get it for less than $23.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is a little on the perfumey side and would prefer something with either less scent or unscented.</li>
            <li> So hearing that scares me a little.</li>
            <li> but it helps a little</li>
            <li> As it turns out I can not use the serum because it breaks my skin out and made it itch like crazy, but the lotion, (which I have been using for 3 weeks now), works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is a step up from sunscreen and sunblock lotions, which can feel really heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell or feel</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I perspired heavily, and even after all that, I didn&#x27;t sustain any sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I find it heavy and greasy, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> had to stop using this product after a few attempts.</li>
            <li> so it tends to sting from lotions that are too harsh.    </li>
            <li> What I was hoping for was a skin cream that would provide protection from the sun without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> The name speaks for itself, it&#x27;s a moisturizer that helps restore firmness and also includes spf 25 to prevent everyday sun damage.</li>
            <li> Even when I use just the small amount dispensed by the pump, it takes a while to rub it in, and then if I am out in the sun, sweating makes the stuff run down my face.</li>
            <li> It is probably not ideal for the youngest population; it could be too heavy for teenage</li>
            <li> The last time I looked it was much less expensive on Amazon...</li>
            <li> My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is the bottle it is packed in makes it impossible to tell if I&#x27;m getting low on product</li>
            <li> (it makes me sneeze), and I found that not only did I have that same scent on my face, it was nearly impossible to wash off my hands after using the cream, so I end up smelling the stuff that makes me sneeze throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is usually allergic to everything</li>
            <li> Not sure about the anti-aging factor</li>
            <li> Usually 10 minutes outdoors, and</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens usually irritate my face (breakouts and burning) and burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for the past 5 months.  </li>
            <li> It somehow manages to be thick and luxurious-feeling, yet does not feel greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell about the anti-aging properties</li>
            <li> For example, it is hard to get a half-pump, if thats all you needed.</li>
            <li> Hard to put make-up on after.</li>
            <li> With this moisturizer I get a non-greasy but thick moisturizer with my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> --I let the cream dry a bit on my skin before applying make-up a couple of times, and the results were disastrous for some reason--made the make-up go on very unevenly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little scary.</li>
            <li> One pump lasted through this past summer and into the beginning of fall, so it didn&#x27;t turn out to be an expensive investment.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t slimy or sticky or irritating.   </li>
            <li> but the recommendations and research behind Olay convinced me otherwise.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out worse than it already was.  </li>
            <li> The products are expensive but Olay always have coupons in the newspaper and rebates via their company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot go wrong using this skin care line.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit..and really do not have bad skin...</li>
            <li> but at night..or in the Cold weather.    </li>
            <li> Now the bad.</li>
            <li> Just too bad it does not have an SPF.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I really hate the scent.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked this lotion. I used it more as a daily sunscreen/moisturizer. It feels very light and I think it is a step up from sunscreen and sunblock lotions, which can feel really heavy on the face. I had no problems with it cloggin my pores and a few hrs later, I forgot I actually had it on! It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell or feel so it&#x27;s a great alternative to sunblock lotions.  Now the bad. After reading many reviews about Olay products, may people say they use suspect and possibly toxic ingredients in their products. That&#x27;s a little scary. Honestly, I usually buy natural products. Philosophy and Bare Minerals are my two favorite lines for makeup and face products. So hearing that scares me a little. I know Olay products are a little more affordable. But I would rather put something on my skin that will not harm it in the long run, rather than save a little money. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> Like the rest of the Olay Regenerist line, this Advanced Anit-Aging Dna Uv Cream really delivers. Freshly scented and light to the touch, the cream glides on your face with ease.  I had my 73 year old mother try it as well.  She is usually allergic to everything and this didn&#x27;t make her break out at all. The Spf is a nice high number and it goes well under your foundation. The price is right, highly recommended. Made my skin glow a bit after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer and sunblock in one. I have become accustomed to applying my moisturizer first than my sunblock (a physical not chemical). Just a quick tutorial physical sunblocks contain zinc and can be applied after moisturizer, whereas many sunblocks are actually chemical (like helioplex) and must be applied before a moisturizer. Yeah I know doing the chemical sunblock before a moisturizer just doesn&#x27;t seem right. But I digress.     The Olay regenerist encompasses both moisturizer and sunblock. So its a one application and then you go. Now keep in mind because its a moisturizer its more cream-like in texture (thicker) and when applied on hot days (like everyday during the summer) can produce a heavy feeling.  Ultimately making this product more ideal for colder days (winter and fall) and less practical for summer and spring.    There is a scent. So for those of you who do not like scented moisturizers, stay away. It can be strong and lasts for most of the day. Would have preferred a scentless version.    Ultimately does it do what it claims yes and maybe. It certainly is moisturizing and a good sunblock. Does it defend your DNA? - that I wouldn&#x27;t know unless I had an electronic microscope.    In summary its a solid product I would recommend for the Colder seasons as a combo moisturizer - sunblock.</li>
            <li> As all Olay products are, this seems to be a good quality creme.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and although I like the moisturizing it provides, I have not noticed any noticiable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> i have been using this moisturizer for about 8 months and LOVE it! and i still haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle :) i use it everyday and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your whole face. goes on smoothly, no funky sunscreen scent, and my skin looks great! i get compliments all of the time. i&#x27;m 21 but i&#x27;m told i could pass for 16 for how my skin looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for about a month and am pleased with the reults so far. It&#x27;s good to have the higher SPF rating for daytime. There is nothing, of course, that does as much for your skin as sun protection. The moisturizing qualities of this product are good, although I&#x27;m not sure about its \\&quot;anti-aging DNA superstructure qualities.\\&quot; I&#x27;m a bit of a skeptic about miraculous turnarounds for aging skin. One note of caution--I let the cream dry a bit on my skin before applying make-up a couple of times, and the results were disastrous for some reason--made the make-up go on very unevenly. I&#x27;m not so sure that this is worth the increased price--I&#x27;ve been a fan for years of the basic SPF 30 Olay lotion under make-up.  [[ASIN:B001F51TDG Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer, SPF 30, 2.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] But judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> We all age, it&#x27;s a fact. There are a billion things out there that say they can help. The best thing I found for wrinkles and problem skin (no it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them but it helps a little and I like the way it makes my skin feel) I also don&#x27;t have very many but I have used salycic acid. My skin is sensitive and didn&#x27;t agree with this product and I am also prone to by all natural items or organic. I&#x27;ve used a lot of things as I&#x27;ve been in my 30s and even costmetic grade peels. If you can&#x27;t afford it, try the salycic acid. I have reviewed it here on Amazon and love the product and use it often.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and bought both the serum and the lotion.  As it turns out I can not use the serum because it breaks my skin out and made it itch like crazy, but the lotion, (which I have been using for 3 weeks now), works very well.  I have combination skin and am almost 40.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:38228511]]The accompanying video compares and contrasts three different Olay face creams:&lt;br /&gt;Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging: daily UV moisturizer + SPF 15, fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;Olay Definity: Correcting protective lotion with SPF 15&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist: DNA superstructure UV cream SPF 25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all 3 lotions contain sun protection and direct the user to \\&quot;apply liberally to face and neck,\\&quot; they all also contain a warning that says to \\&quot;AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES.\\&quot;  Well, I can&#x27;t speak for the folks at Olay, but the last time I looked, my eyes were ON my face; not to mention the fact that if I am buying an anti-aging product, it isn&#x27;t for my chin or forehead--it&#x27;s for my eye area, which is where most women show signs of age (okay, let&#x27;s say it--wrinkles!) first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I made an error in the video in describing all three lotions as having an SPF of 15.  The Regenerist product actually has an SPF of 25 and the other 2 are SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;2.  In the video, I incorrectly noted that 2 of the 3 were sold as anti-aging products when in fact I realized afterwards that all 3 are anti-aging products.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The size of all 3 products reviewed was the 1.7 fluid ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> The best aspect of this lotion is that it is an easy to use moisturizer and sun block.   It has the right consistency and so it smoothes on easily.    It also moisturizes well, so my skin feels hydrated and soft after using it.  It isn&#x27;t slimy or sticky or irritating.   As far as skin regeneration, there may be a little less fine lines on my forehead, it&#x27;s hard to say.   However because it feels good to use it, I will definitely continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li> The spf 25 was a big plus for me to try this, and it is now the only daily moisturizer I use.  Try it and you&#x27;ll be a fan too!  I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tolerate some brands, but this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist products use methylparaben and other ingredients that the Environmental Working Group, on its site the Cosmetic Safety Database, has identified as toxic.  So while this product works okay and is reasonably priced, it really isn&#x27;t a bargain.  If money is an issue and you aren&#x27;t worried about putting these chemicals on your skin, you will probably like this product, but I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy something more natural, or at least less toxic, that works just as well or better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily for around 2 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin, although I certainly don&#x27;t expect my fairly young-looking skin to transform magically back to skin like a 20 year old. I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin and this moisturizes well enough for the summer, but I doubt if it will be enough to keep me hydrated when the furnace kicks on.  It goes on smoothly due to it having some silicone added, soaks in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really hate the scent.  Maybe I&#x27;m a little more sensitive to fragrances in my skincare products than the average person.  The scent of this is herbal/medicinal, and it lingers way longer than I like it to.  And yes, it has SPF 25, I do applaud Olay for upping the SPF in this product over most of their others which have an SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has some parabens in it as preservatives, but I don&#x27;t worry much about those.  I&#x27;ve been using skincare with parabens for 20 or so years, and they haven&#x27;t hurt me yet.  What I don&#x27;t like and it really upsets me is Olay still tests on animals when there is no reason to do this - there are plenty of other ways to test without having to dab this in the rabbits&#x27; eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks and am not seeing results yet. However, I do like using this product - it goes on smoothly, isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t have any lingering smell. It feels good on my skin. As an avid gardener and boater, I like the spf factor. Will I continue to use it? Sure. If only because my skin does feel silky.</li>
            <li> I have allergies as well as sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use just any product. But have always had good results with Olay products and this one is my favorite by far. The cream goes on nice and thick and is easily absorbed by your skin. It also smells great, I usually can&#x27;t use scented products but for some reason this scent doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all which is a big plus. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks now so it&#x27;s hard to tell about the anti-aging properties but I do know that olay products have some of the highest ratings as well as the best prices for anti-aging products and that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It seems to really moisturize my skin and the SPF is just what I am looking for with a moisturizer.  Viscous and absorbent - just a dab does it.  I think it is overpriced for an OTC product supposedly for the masses.</li>
            <li> These products don&#x27;t tend to do much repair work, so don&#x27;t expect some miracle fountain of youth formula here, but as a sunscreen it&#x27;s fabulous, and protecting your skin from the sun is the most important thing you can do to fight wrinkles.    It goes on creamy, spreads well, and has a very faint and pleasant odor.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  It soaks in fast and gets out of the way to put on make up.  Overall, it&#x27;s one of the better products in the category.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything from using this.  I generally prefer a higher spf, as well as better ppd for my face.  Olay products have usually worked well for me, so although I don&#x27;t love this one, I wouldn&#x27;t discourage someone from trying it.  One person&#x27;s experience may not be like another&#x27;s.  The cream is not too greasy or shiny, and sinks in quickly, which is good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several weeks now and really appreciate the effect it has had.  It has a nice and smooth feel to it, although when I first apply it to my face it has a little bit of a drag to it, it seems OK if I don&#x27;t touch my face for awhile after application.  The scent is nice but I will be looking for unscented when I re-order, I prefer no scent in my face products.  The texture of my skin seems a little tighter and less dry feeling.  I actually can see that it has had a positive effect on small lines and wrinkles, some are gone and others are quite diminished.  I would recommend this product.   -- Update -- I just wanted to mention I am still using and benfitting from this product (1/22/10).  I still like it for the results, but don&#x27;t care for the scent and the slightly gritty feeling it seems to have on my face.</li>
            <li> I spend much of the fall through spring in southwest Florida on the beach.  I used this as my moisturizer and sunscreen.  It lasts all day and works as well on my face as any broad spectrum sunscreen does on my body. Age 53 and lifelong sun lover makes my skin look great and keeps those harmful rays from aging my skin.  BTW...grossly over priced on here as of this writing.  The last time I looked it was much less expensive on Amazon...so quite a price difference.  You can get it for less than $23.  I get it much less for sale in the stores, especially a 2 pack at Costco.  It is no longer an spf 25, so this is an older product.  It is now spf 30.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Olay Regenerist Face Wash, and Eye Cream, within a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin.  The lines that were under my eyes, started to improve in a short time period.  The products are expensive but Olay always have coupons in the newspaper and rebates via their company&#x27;s website.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First time ordering creams.  Glad I did. Received in time and exactly what I needed.  Will be back in the future for better deals.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is pleasant to use, goes on easily, spreads easily, spf 25 helps protect your face from the suns harmful rays. I have not found any difference in the appearance of my facial skin, no worse and no better. The scent is OK but I think it is a little on the perfumey side and would prefer something with either less scent or unscented. I have had no skin irritations or problems from this but if your face is overly sensitive to perfumes then maybe you had better get a sample of this to try first.</li>
            <li> This is the first anti aging product I have used so far.   I have just touched 30ties....I hate to admit..and really do not have bad skin...but after having a baby the stress has started showing on my face.  I tried the product for a good 3 weeks before reviewing it.     Pros-    Sunblock with spf 25    Non contaminating dispenser.    Great texture of the cream...might be better in winters.    Pro collagenic..Added a visible glow to my face despite my sleepless nights.    Even toned look on my skin.    My face did not erupt...considering I have super sensitive skin.    Cons-    Oily- I would rather use it at night.    Almost leaves a white layer on application which melts into ur skin..I guess thats  the sunblock in it..        Will i continue to use it...Yes..but at night..or in the Cold weather.    Does it work    Yes!!     Do I love it.    Yes!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this cream.  It has a nice consistency, it goes on well.  It has a very light fragrance, which I didn&#x27;t notice seconds after applying.  Overall, it&#x27;s a very nice face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is any product that talks about manipulating DNA.  On the package it has written \\&quot;DNA superstructure UV cream\\&quot;.  \\&quot;Hydrates to help rebuild cellular surface structure\\&quot;.  PLEASE!  This is just a moisture cream.  Don&#x27;t try to sell it as a scientific breakthrough DNA manipulating super fountain-of-youth cream.  It&#x27;s just a moisture cream. . . and it works fine for that. . . Oh, and yes, I don&#x27;t think you really need all those ingredients.  What is Ammonium Polyacrylate anyway??? :-)</li>
            <li> When I first purchased the Olay UV cream, I didn&#x27;t expect what I received. It is very much like a facial sunblock, including how it feels and smells. While this wasn&#x27;t necessarily what I was looking for, I have been very pleased with the result. My skin is protected from short-term sun exposure, feels moisturized and nourished, and my foundation application seems to go on smoother than when I don&#x27;t use this first. Since I live in Minnesota and don&#x27;t spend too much time outdoors, the UV cream is my daytime moisturizer in the summer. One pump lasted through this past summer and into the beginning of fall, so it didn&#x27;t turn out to be an expensive investment. By April, I&#x27;m sure I will be buying another pump.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light product that is very effective!  It is gently scented so it does not interfere with perfume or cologne.  It is absorbed quickly and leaves skin smooth and supple-feeling.  I really like it.  Not sure about the anti-aging factor but I do recommend it&#x27;s immediate impact.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak about free radicals or collagen structure since I started using this. I&#x27;m not a scientist but I am a 29 year old woman. Sunscreen is very important to me as my skin is extremely pale and my cheeks and nose tend to burn exceptionally easily. With this moisturizer I get a non-greasy but thick moisturizer with my sunscreen. A little dab goes a long way.    Just before I got this Olay product I had started to use Biore Skin Preservation Dual Fusion. It&#x27;s formula is a bit thinner but it has a higher spf. So the summer days when I knew I&#x27;d be out in the sun a lot I&#x27;d use the Biore and other days the Olay.I&#x27;ve stayed moisturized, haven&#x27;t had a burn, it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and hopefully it&#x27;s having a good affect on my skin for the future. I&#x27;ve been using both for over 3 months now and still have a good supply. I think the Olay will get even more use in winter when the air gets really dried out. Here&#x27;s hoping my skin will still look great!</li>
            <li> The texture of this lotion is superb on your skin, and it has a nice smell.  It moisturizes quite well, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth to the touch.  It is not greasy at all.  It has a good SPF 25 for coverage, but you can also use this moisturizer at night.  The  SPF in moisturizers is activated only when you are in the sun.  This is a product you will use more than once.</li>
            <li> And that is basically my reason for liking it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried out the proX regimen and it was great except that the moisturiser for the proX has a spf 30 moisturiser that left a really oily look to my face. It worked - but it looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been combining the ProX treatment with the regenerist cream for the spf 25 (ladies, we ALL need the Spf) and it is really excellent. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave a shine, protects well and does not have an overpowering odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is a pump is a plus to me since I know sticking your fingers in the jar is a no no due to it contaminating the cream. Since the bottle is not transparent I won&#x27;t go nuts when the pump can&#x27;t get the last eighth of an inch out (hint, Clinique, hint)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely and positively LOVE this Olay Regenerist cream. I have been reading Paula Begoun&#x27;s \\&quot;Don&#x27;t go to makeup counter without me\\&quot; and this Olay moisturizer already came highly recommended but then I used it....and the creamy, soft, smooth, and perfect consistency texture of this moisturizer loves my skin - does great under make-up and with SPF 25, I feel better about having protection although if I will be in the sun a lot, I would wear more .... I have enjoyed it for well over a couple of months and just ordered a second one.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I&#x27;d go back to the standard regular lines - since I had using Avalon Organics for so long but the recommendations and research behind Olay convinced me otherwise. For now this is my primary moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a great fan of Olay skin products.  The Regenerist line works extremely well for me, without causing my almost 60 year old skin to break out.  I am always looking for a good sun block product that will prevent sun damage, without having to apply it constantly.  I sweat a lot, which tends to negate the effects of most of the sunblock products that I have tried.      Now this Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Dna Superstucture Uv Cream Spf 25, (wow, is that a name or what!) is my favorite so far.  The pump dispenser measures out just the right amount to apply to face and neck.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not notice a heavy scent.  I was aware of the product on my face, but it didn&#x27;t bother me, since this has been my same experience with most other high price sunscreen products.   The first time I used it, was before spending the day outside working with friends.  After a few hours, I perspired heavily, and even after all that, I didn&#x27;t sustain any sunburn.  Usually 10 minutes outdoors, and I am starting to turn red.      I use many other products in the Regenerist line, so I can&#x27;t say that this one provides any additional \\&quot;anti aging\\&quot; benefits in particular, but the sunblock feature is worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Regenerist line so I was very excited to try this product. I find it heavy and greasy, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I do have very oily skin though, so probably people with dry skin would love it.</li>
            <li> I can report after using this product for a few months of working outdoors in the midday sun several days a week, that the sunscreen is both effective and sensitive-skin-safe product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens usually irritate my face (breakouts and burning) and burn my eyes. This does neither, and I&#x27;ve used it in high heat and humidity, with plenty of sweat running down my face. It seems to moisturize well, and while it hasn&#x27;t prevented me from getting a tan (my first in probably a dozen years!), it&#x27;s been incredibly gradual, with absolutely no burning; and my face doesn&#x27;t look dry or haggard. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face, neck, arms, and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump container minimizes waste, which I really like. It does have that greasy feel sunscreens always seem to have, but it soaks in fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that white residue that takes forever to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking off one star because it&#x27;s pricey for what it is: a good quality sunscreen suitable for facial use. The \\&quot;regenerative\\&quot; properties seem to me too be hooey. After 2 months, my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel any different (except that it&#x27;s more tan). I don&#x27;t have fewer or lighter wrinkles, more elasticity, or better skin tone. I haven&#x27;t burst into a youthful, dewy glow or anything. Ounce-for-ounce, it&#x27;s about double the price of other facial sunscreen brands like neutrogena.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice. It goes on easily, is smooth, and has a nice light scent. It spreads easily and evenly, which is important because I want the sunscreen even across my face and neck.  It moisturizes my skin without getting oily at the end of the day. I have combination skin. I do, however, remove it about 1/2 way through the day with a baby wipe, and reapply because it is only an SPF of 25 and that isn&#x27;t enough to last all day in any product. My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is the bottle it is packed in makes it impossible to tell if I&#x27;m getting low on product so I suspect I&#x27;m going to go to use it and just have an empty bottle. Which I don&#x27;t look forward to because I like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for the past 5 months.  Normally I buy it at Target or Walgreens... even with a coupon it&#x27;s still $20.  I paid $14.50 for it here, that&#x27;s an amazing bargain!  It shipped quickly, and it&#x27;s exactly what it said it was.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin.  My skin broke out worse than it already was.  I had to throw this in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product is nice to apply. My face and neck skin is soft, but has wrinkles. I saw no change, either for better or worse, during the time I used this product.</li>
            <li> I have learned to really appreciate products that offer SPF protection and this is a product I would certanly recommend. The cream has a nice thick texture that I feel protects the skin and lasts. The scent is very good, with a slight hint of that familiar SPF smell when you first apply which I actually think smells fresh. I have found that it really does protect you on those bright sunny days. It is probably not ideal for the youngest population; it could be too heavy for teenage skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one (or even one-half) star because there were some very minor packing things that I think could have been done better. I love the pump which inhibits bacteria growth, but the pump is not very precise. For example, it is hard to get a half-pump, if thats all you needed. However, the tall sleek design is great because it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room in my medicine cabinet as a jar would. Overall, I would say this a great product that delivers.</li>
            <li> I used Olay products for years and trusted the brand name for a long time. This product doesn&#x27;t turn me off of Olay products - although I&#x27;ve tried to switch my health and beauty products to ones that have ingredients I can actually pronounce - but I really did not like the Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not so creamy. It&#x27;s quite heavy and difficult to smooth on to my skin. Even when I use just the small amount dispensed by the pump, it takes a while to rub it in, and then if I am out in the sun, sweating makes the stuff run down my face. Also, there is a very strong perfume scent to the product (it makes me sneeze), and I found that not only did I have that same scent on my face, it was nearly impossible to wash off my hands after using the cream, so I end up smelling the stuff that makes me sneeze throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this product after a few attempts. It just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin or lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Before I give my review I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to give you an idea of my skin type, because I think this has a big impact on how effective the product is.  I&#x27;m in my mid twenties so I turn to anti aging products more as preventative as well as to help me with the lines I&#x27;m already noticing.  I have very dry, yet acne prone skin and my skin is also very sensitive so it tends to sting from lotions that are too harsh.    Overall, this suited my skin well.  It didn&#x27;t sting or burn or aggrevate my acne.  I gave the product a little over a month to try to get the best sense of results.  I did notice that my skin looked firmer, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference to the fine lines that bother me (particularly around my mouth and eyes).  Also, I found that this didn&#x27;t adequately combat my skin&#x27;s dryness.  I felt very itchy all over, especially around the creases of my nose, between my eyebrows, and along my hairline.  Because of this I don&#x27;t see myself using this product consistently because I have found other lotions that do a better job of firming my skin while making my face feel hydrated or smooth.    Overal this product was just okay.  I saw some benefits, but it just wasn&#x27;t hydrating enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Moistures well and the protection is great.  I use it daily and I have higly sensitive skin.  It has given me no acne problems, or sun issues.  My skin is soft and feels good.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday too. I just ordered nearly the whole Olay Regenerist Line really. I like these products. I thought I took pretty good care of my face just by exfoliating every day, but now that I am using the Regenerist line, I notice that my face feels so much better. The only reason I started using these products is from the reviews I read on Amazon and how most people really like the product. I am a fan now too. I have had no problems using these products, no breakouts or reactions (not that I have sensitive skin anyway) and they are easy to use and my face feels different. I hope that I continue to see results.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I look younger when I look in the mirror, but I didnt expect that. What I was hoping for was a skin cream that would provide protection from the sun without feeling heavy or greasy. This is it. The scent is light and pleasant and I like putting it on. That means I actually use it, unlike my other \\&quot;miracles in a jar.\\&quot;     Go for it. The price is right and the product really is quite wonderful</li>
            <li> Gentle, effective -at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF of 25 is a good solution for mild protection.  And this is formulated in a pleasantly mild smelling, light cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very good and lends itself to easy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay products are terrific. An advanced skin care research team has developed a great line of skin care solutions for all needs.  They are gentle and they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong using this skin care line. It is a winner all around!</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Olay, especially its flagship Oil of Olay beauty fluid product, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try when it came up for review.  The Regenerist cream is alleged to stem the skin&#x27;s aging process, presumably primarily via its UV protectant properties.      I honestly cannot say whether it works in precisely that way or not, since aging is hard to gauge!  I&#x27;m 40 years old and have nice skin with very few wrinkles, and am often mistaken for being 7-10 years younger.  That, however, may very well be due to staying out of the sun, using Oil of Olay, not using soap on my face, etc., so I doubt that I can give any credit to this particular product, especially since I haven&#x27;t used it for very long!  Still, I will say that I really enjoyed the feel and texture of the Regenerist cream.  It somehow manages to be thick and luxurious-feeling, yet does not feel greasy or heavy.  I felt like my skin became immediately softer and smoother looking after a single application, and I just loved the way it felt.  It could very well be thanks to that \\&quot;DNA superstructure\\&quot;, or maybe it&#x27;s just a darn good moisturizer.  At any rate I liked the way it felt and will probably buy more at the store when my sample runs out, and will alternate its use with my regular, daily application of Oil of Olay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist DNA Superstructure UV Cream is wonderful. The name speaks for itself, it&#x27;s a moisturizer that helps restore firmness and also includes spf 25 to prevent everyday sun damage. Olay Regenerist DNA is strong and clears cases of dry skin in days, not weeks or months like other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this cream, it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a heavy oily feeling. Also because it&#x27;s so light it&#x27;s easy to apply makeup on afterwords without much hassle. If I could give this 10 stars I would because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Advanced Anti Aging DNA Super Structure Cream is just too thick for me.  I am in my 30s and very fair skinned with combination dry/oily facial skin.  I also live in a very warm/humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream, while a little does go a long way, seems to just sit on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb at all.  Maybe it would be perfect for snow skiers, but in my opinion it is just to thick and greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is nothing short of AMAZING.  Just too bad it does not have an SPF.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Regenetrist Serum which I get on a \\&quot;Save and Subscribe\\&quot; from Amazon. The serum is a great feeling on your skin and smells great.*******REVISION: 1 month later. I buy all Olay products. Don&#x27;t buy this. If it gets in your eyes, it burns and your eyes water for some time. Hard to put make-up on after.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It&#x27;s a good, effective moisturizer. It can be worn under makeup. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  I have no idea how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.  My wife wants it.  So I got it.&lt;br /&gt;As long as she is happy.  I am very happy.  Because &#x27;happy&#x27; has 5 words, thus 5 stars.</li>
    </ol>
