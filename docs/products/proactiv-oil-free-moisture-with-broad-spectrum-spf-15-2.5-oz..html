            <li>love</li>
            <li>it does not clog your pores and keeps your skin hydrated during the day as well as not making your skin too oily like most moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>Most body sunscreens are greasy, (including Proactiv Solution Daily Protection Plus Sunscreen SPF 30), but this one seems to work perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I really like Proactive Solution products and this is a great size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for under makeup, or on no-makeup days at home, it is versatile, light weight, totally has no grease feeling what-so-ever.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot buying from here, and I am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>not as great as other reviews made this out to be, decent at best</li>
            <li>Moisturizer still does a fine job of keeping my oily face moisturized without making it more oily.  </li>
            <li>It goes on great and it makes my skin so soft .</li>
            <li>I break out easily with almost any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just wish I could find a sunscreen this good for face that is more natural.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and leaves skin feeling as if it didn&#x27;t have anything on it...</li>
            <li>This item was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I go through this stuff quickly!</li>
            <li>this product was a great substitute for the time being since I could not afford my lancome daily moisturizer that I always get.</li>
            <li>works great as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li>All in all this is a good choice if you are looking for an oil-free moisturizer that offers some sun protection.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I seem to be able to use without breaking my face out!!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion,  thanks!</li>
            <li>this is better than I expected very easy to apply, non grease at all, and it is  very light too.  </li>
            <li>At first I liked this moisturizer, but then I noticed that it was making me really oily in about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Then use a toner (I use witch hazel because it is more gentle, must try)</li>
            <li>It holds true to what it say it does.</li>
            <li>and I truly hesitate to write a great review for it because I am afraid it will make it to where it will be sold out on Amazon when I go to order it or that a great review would make it a high-demand product and make the price go up...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen and I love the larger size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Is so light and makes my skin soft after using all the acne meds.  </li>
            <li>You definitely get more for your money</li>
            <li>I have been using the Proactiv green tea moisturizer and had good results.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very lightweight, absorbs easily and does a great job of hydrating my skin when it&#x27;s been dried out by topical acne treatments.</li>
            <li>He refuses to use anything else and can tell if I try to put some other kind of moisturizer in the bottle.</li>
            <li>other sunscreens sit on my face and feel slimy or oily but this is the first one I have actually love.</li>
            <li>I like this product and it fits what I was looking for very well.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really have any odor, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that this is a contributing factor, although who really knows?</li>
            <li>Real Proactiv not a knock off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the whole Proactiv regimen.  </li>
            <li>VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND AIRY.</li>
            <li>Please disregard - Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pay the full amount next time and be done with it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I have tried the green tea and love it.</li>
            <li>AND i still use my new toner, and I don&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li>I have oily to normal skin, and I&#x27;m 35 years old.</li>
            <li>But I still love their green tea moisturizer as my nighttime moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I appreciated that I could get this single tube without buying a whole kit.</li>
            <li>The large size last a while too.</li>
            <li>So I just tossed the SPF in an old box.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near the claimed &amp;#34;super size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use a normal deep cleanser from the grocery store, witch hazel for toner, and this stuff for face lotion.</li>
            <li>my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something not to heavy that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry in spots and very oily in spots and this is the only lotion that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used proactive for a long time, but they are switching over to only carrying the new proactive products at my local mall, and they don&#x27;t work as well for my skin.</li>

            <li> my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something not to heavy that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry in spots and very oily in spots and this is the only lotion that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive for a long time, but they are switching over to only carrying the new proactive products at my local mall, and they don&#x27;t work as well for my skin.</li>
            <li> BUT I PERSONALLY DON&#x27;T LIKE TO SMELL IT ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin that tends to get oily through the day and this left little to no residue on my face.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I really liked the feel of it</li>
            <li> Long expiration date.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horridly expensive but his sensitive facial skin breaks out so fast with everything else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other proactiv products, only this.</li>
            <li> My friend think its good,really good,after used , not too dry.</li>
            <li> but like I said, not worth the time and hassle to get 4 dollars back.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin feel soft without any slick feeling.</li>
            <li> However, I happened to find this version that is sold in a much larger tube for less.</li>
            <li> Thinking I will use it on other dry parts of my body that need moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, because the &#x27;problem&#x27; product was within the same order, the negative feedback I left regarding that problem shows up on Terri&#x27;s comments.  </li>
            <li> - THEN I put the SPF on, even on my eye lids using my palms carefully.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it works, however after using this product I had the worst breakout of my adult life</li>
            <li> I hightly recommend using this lotion even if you don&#x27;t like other proactiv products.  </li>
            <li> it make other products pill.  </li>
            <li> so I tried other brands and</li>
            <li> It is  just a little bite too shine</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this a few months ago</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not too heavy, greasy, or overly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I ordered the green tea moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I break out from all those other expensive, fancy creams.</li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> for me it was not good.....</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive products, but none have compared to this one!!</li>
            <li> It works but you have to keep on using their products or your skin will get worse.</li>
            <li> But I was tired of my order not going through on the proactiv website, and I was almost out of this product and needed it now....</li>
            <li> Sorry proactive...</li>
            <li> Wrong size was sent...</li>
            <li> This product was erroneously included in a negatove review for ProActiv Micro-Crystal Kit.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, when I received the item it had a expiration date 5 months away from the date I purchased.</li>
            <li> I use this on my kiddo who&#x27;s having a horrible acne outbreak.  </li>
            <li> I despise Proactiv and their awful customer service department, but cannot part with this moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> Great daytime mousurizer, for my oily skin, has a built in spf.</li>
            <li> It works but you have to keep on using their products or your skin will get worse.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it fits what I was looking for very well. I have oily to normal skin, and I&#x27;m 35 years old. Was looking for something not to heavy that absorbs quickly. So when I decided to purchase it, I found that this company sold it way cheaper then others.  To my disappointment, when I received the item it had a expiration date 5 months away from the date I purchased. To me that&#x27;s ridiculous. This product could last me 2 years. So next time I&#x27;ll spend the extra 7 bucks to get a fresher SPF moisturizer. Sometimes you get what you pay for. I wrote the company and they reimbursed me 4 dollars. That was nice of them but like I said, not worth the time and hassle to get 4 dollars back. I&#x27;ll pay the full amount next time and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion,  thanks!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very lightweight, absorbs easily and does a great job of hydrating my skin when it&#x27;s been dried out by topical acne treatments. It also doesn&#x27;t really have any odor, which I appreciate. I still do have breakouts occasionally but I don&#x27;t think that this is a contributing factor, although who really knows? All in all this is a good choice if you are looking for an oil-free moisturizer that offers some sun protection.</li>
            <li> At first I liked this moisturizer, but then I noticed that it was making me really oily in about 3 hours. It&#x27;s possible that it did this because I started using a different toner, but it still gets three stars only because I switched moisturizers to the murad mattifier with SPF AND i still use my new toner, and I don&#x27;t get oily. Sorry proactive... But I still love their green tea moisturizer as my nighttime moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Quick ship and fresh product. Real Proactiv not a knock off. Long expiration date.  I was concerned ordering but will definitely re-order as needed.</li>
            <li> I use this on my kiddo who&#x27;s having a horrible acne outbreak.  He does the Proactiv protocol and then the last thing he applies is this moisturizer.  It is rich and keeps him from itching (the proactive solution really makes him, so moisturizer is a must!)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion. I hightly recommend using this lotion even if you don&#x27;t like other proactiv products.  My skin is very dry in spots and very oily in spots and this is the only lotion that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause acne. If you don&#x27;t know this already: ALWAYS wear spf on your face!  SFF is the best wrinkle preventor available!!! Also, buying it from Amazon is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I break out easily with almost any moisturizer. The only ones that seem to work are Proactiv. I have tried the green tea and love it. However, I happened to find this version that is sold in a much larger tube for less. I gave it a shot and also works wonderfully.  Believe me, I&#x27;m someone whose face hates after shave, any lotions, etc.  I get rashes, breakouts, etc.  This product does not cause those problems. No idea why, but love it!</li>
            <li> BEST Facial Lotion EVER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Has NEVER made my face break out. I have tried several expensive products, but none have compared to this one!! I was so happy to find this on Amazon and I truly hesitate to write a great review for it because I am afraid it will make it to where it will be sold out on Amazon when I go to order it or that a great review would make it a high-demand product and make the price go up...</li>
            <li> This is the only product from Proactive that I use. I have rosacea and this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate it. I appreciated that I could get this single tube without buying a whole kit.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for almost a year now. He refuses to use anything else and can tell if I try to put some other kind of moisturizer in the bottle. It&#x27;s horridly expensive but his sensitive facial skin breaks out so fast with everything else. This is a great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay when I want to be consistent when I break out.  I&#x27;ll use the whole Proactiv regimen.  Unfortunately you cannot use your favorite makeup with proactive moisturizer..  it make other products pill.  I also don&#x27;t find that it moisturizes well for my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to order proactive and never use the SPF because of fear I&#x27;d break out. So I just tossed the SPF in an old box. But recently, I revived it and tried it in a pinch. OH my, this stuff is great! I had no idea. Now I use it everyday. You MUST clean your face VERY well first (I use a power face cleaner, and I even clean the power cleaner first with dish-soap then alcohol first) - Then use a toner (I use witch hazel because it is more gentle, must try) - THEN I put the SPF on, even on my eye lids using my palms carefully. It&#x27;s perfect for under makeup, or on no-makeup days at home, it is versatile, light weight, totally has no grease feeling what-so-ever. I occasionally put it on my hands and arms. It is the only proactive product I use now, and acne is under control. I use a normal deep cleanser from the grocery store, witch hazel for toner, and this stuff for face lotion. I love it. I just wish I could find a sunscreen this good for face that is more natural. But for now, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have already reviewed this item I will not review again, each item that I purchase comes up with three or more times for me to review I don&#x27;t like wasting my time like that.</li>
            <li> this is better than I expected very easy to apply, non grease at all, and it is  very light too.  It is  just a little bite too shine</li>
            <li> Love Proactive products!!  They&#x27;re the only thing that has ever worked for me!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for over 10 years and I can honestly say it works, however after using this product I had the worst breakout of my adult life and once I stopped using the cream I purchased from this seller my skin went back to normal. I purchased the same cream from another seller and have had no issues. Delivery was quick but the product wasn&#x27;t any good</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen and I love the larger size.  I would definitely recommend this product and I will purchase it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> THIS FORMULA WORKS GREAT. VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND AIRY. HOWEVER IT DOES SMELL A LOT LIKE SUNSCREEN. IT DOES HAVE SPF 15, WHICH IS GREAT. BUT I PERSONALLY DON&#x27;T LIKE TO SMELL IT ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I seem to be able to use without breaking my face out!! I use it in conjunction with my Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging/Acne Cleanser.  Together they have done wonders for my skin!!!</li>
            <li> Love this priduct. Not oily and very gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> I despise Proactiv and their awful customer service department, but cannot part with this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s the only thing that does not cause my skin to break out and it&#x27;s SPF has saved my fair skin from sunburn when I&#x27;m caught outside unexpectedly in the sun.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great, not greasy</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition and is what I was expecting. I&#x27;ve used proactive for a long time, but they are switching over to only carrying the new proactive products at my local mall, and they don&#x27;t work as well for my skin. Happy to have found a good source online to get the products I need.</li>
            <li> been using this for years having a larger size available to me is very convenient delivered to my home is even better</li>
            <li> Wrong size was sent... Nowhere near the claimed &amp;#34;super size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer that works great under makeup or alone! I have loved this stuff for years!</li>
            <li> Very Light and does not cause face to break out</li>
            <li> This product was erroneously included in a negatove review for ProActiv Micro-Crystal Kit.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE AWARE that this product - Super Size Oil-free Moisture SPF15 - 2.5 ox. sold by Terri Dozee shipped immediately, arrived in perfect condition.  I give her a 5-star review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, because the &#x27;problem&#x27; product was within the same order, the negative feedback I left regarding that problem shows up on Terri&#x27;s comments.  Please disregard - Thanks.</li>
            <li> Where my cream? I will no longer do you have to order! This is a terrible irresponsibility! Give me back my payment!</li>
            <li> works great (not intended for use at the lake in bright sunlight)</li>
            <li> Having had acne all my life, a moisturizer was out of the question...until this product.  I use it twice a day and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel moisturized but not oily.  My skin looks good and I don&#x27;t get breakouts.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> awesome sunscreen! I have clear skin that tends to get oily through the day and this left little to no residue on my face. other sunscreens sit on my face and feel slimy or oily but this is the first one I have actually love.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this a few months ago so I tried other brands and nothing else is like it. I don&#x27;t use any other proactiv products, only this. When I wear it, I feel like my skin is protected and it gives plenty of moisture. I&#x27;ll be using this for a while.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. It is easy to apply and leaves skin feeling as if it didn&#x27;t have anything on it... truly amazing, considering all the skin products I&#x27;ve tried with SPF.</li>
            <li> for me it was not good.....made my face break out.  Too bad, because I really liked the feel of it going on.....not greasy at all.  Thinking I will use it on other dry parts of my body that need moisture.</li>
            <li> This item was perfectly fine. The item was as advertised.  It was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> love it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactiv green tea moisturizer and had good results. As anyone with acne prone skin , once you find something that works, you&#x27;re reluctant to change. Well, I&#x27;m very glad I took a chance and tried the oil free moisturizer. It&#x27;s fantastic ! It goes on great and it makes my skin so soft . I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has problem skin, you&#x27;ll love it !</li>
            <li> My wife has used Proactiv Solution products for quite some time and because she&#x27;s happy with the product, she continues to buy more.  I can&#x27;t speak to it myself, but I&#x27;ve heard no grumblings from the misses!</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs quickly. I have tried everything else and I break out from all those other expensive, fancy creams. Not with this one - I can use it every day and not have to worry about breakouts. Plus it&#x27;s not that expensive. In fact I think all the proactiv products are really good and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> not as great as other reviews made this out to be, decent at best</li>
            <li> It holds true to what it say it does. It&#x27;s non gressy and my skin looked better! love it will defintly keep using it!</li>
            <li> this product was a great substitute for the time being since I could not afford my lancome daily moisturizer that I always get. it does not clog your pores and keeps your skin hydrated during the day as well as not making your skin too oily like most moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether proactiv being sold on Amazon would be authentic... But I was tired of my order not going through on the proactiv website, and I was almost out of this product and needed it now....I figured it was worth a shot buying from here, and I am so glad that I did! From now on,</li>
            <li> works great as a daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I really like this, it&#x27;s not too heavy, greasy, or overly fragranced.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It leaves your skin feeling great. It is not greasy and quick drying. The large size last a while too.</li>
            <li> Again, exactly what I needed and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer still does a fine job of keeping my oily face moisturized without making it more oily.  However, formula seems to have changed over the years.</li>
            <li> Purchased with prime and was here right on time. Easiest way to shop and it&#x27;s at your door in two days. I love Prime!</li>
            <li> My friend think its good,really good,after used , not too dry. Maybe will buy again! We are all like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I use it on my face, neck, chest and hands because it has sunscreen. Most body sunscreens are greasy, (including Proactiv Solution Daily Protection Plus Sunscreen SPF 30), but this one seems to work perfect.</li>
            <li> I THOUGH I ordered the green tea moisturizer.  But no complaints here.  Is so light and makes my skin soft after using all the acne meds.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I love it</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  The price was EXCELLENT!!!</li>
            <li> I really like Proactive Solution products and this is a great size.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s light, not greasy, and smooths into your face quickly and completely. I also love that is has SPF15!  Would highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> You definitely get more for your money</li>
            <li> One of the ONLY non-comedogenic moisturizers on the market. Believe me - I checked. It is well worth the money. It smells good, tingles when you apply it and it makes your skin feel soft without any slick feeling. It absorbs fast. I go through this stuff quickly! I have acne-prone, oily skin at the age of 48. I wish I had discovered this years ago!</li>
            <li> I really do not like this moisturizer. It ALWAYS feathers and balls up on my skin. I can never use this, especially under makeup</li>
