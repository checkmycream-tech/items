            <li>&amp;#34;It is amazing, the product arrived damaged, arrived spilled....</li>
            <li>Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li>All are great and unique fragrances, but all lack longevity.  </li>
            <li>The best one is still the Classic Swiss Army fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, it has a good fragrance, but is uncomfortably strong for me.</li>
            <li>Greetings I am writing to tell you that I am very comfortable with the product, packed all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Love this smell on my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>It made the perfect Valentine present for my husband.</li>
            <li>It can be worn any time of year and is appropriate for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because its price was reduced in more than 45%.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent</li>
            <li>I think I like the Altitude better</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>GREAT thanks. .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love all of the Swiss Army fragrances, but this one and the Forest scent turn this momma bear into a kitten.</li>
            <li>Of the three, the original fragrance probably offers the best longevity.  </li>
            <li>Excellent smell, gives a passionate feeling, I recommend it 100%; besides that lasts a long time perfect smell for special occasions</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Great smell but doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or two.</li>
            <li>He is pretty particular when it comes to colognes &amp; he absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>From experience it seems like a composition that is very &#x27;noticeable&#x27;, and strong, good for a short period of time, rather than a mild, pleasant, &#x27;background&#x27;, lingering kind of a fragrance that I was looking for, to wear day-to-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon offers a great deal on the larger bottle of this fragrance (plus free shipping..!!).  </li>
            <li>I have three of the Swiss Army fragrances (Altitude, Mountain Water, and Original).  </li>
            <li>Life is full of defining moments - will you define the moment or will the moment define you..??</li>
            <li>The scent of the perfume is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nicely designed (I am very fond of the color blue..) and is very easy on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Just as you would imagine, the fragrance is a clean and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Very masculine, yet very light.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li>Not a bad sent price should be reduced a tad and it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>Especially when you work as a nurse in ICU:) You know what I am talking about!</li>
            <li>and it definitely looks nice in my cologne collection in the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I love some of the other scents from Swiss Army, but this one is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I would grade it at &#x27;above average&#x27; at best but not what I was looking for, so 3 stars.</li>
            <li>My favorite... best price impossible</li>
            <li>When I first saw the reviews of the product, it looked a decent perfume to me - value for money, that I would use for day to day type of use rather than special occasions...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as some much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to others that want a sent that is not overpowering but fresh.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a Polo Black.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of it on my husband.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>thanks for everything</li>
            <li>, my father happend the same, i really love swiss army mountain water, its fresh and long all the day even days after you smell it!</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product</li>
            <li>It is a good scent (although not great..).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long and isn&#x27;t as clean and crisp as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>original sealed took longer than expected to be delivered.</li>
            <li>As it turns out I could have been more careful, there is another product that is a lighter shade of blue that says \\&quot;...for Her\\&quot; on the box.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is awesome, a little floral, a little peppery.</li>
            <li>It smells similar to Cool Water, but more subtle and &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s reality, it seems the original this perfume, in that I&#x27;m giving my opinion later, you do not use it when removing them, but to use the smell goes very fast, or is expired or imitation is not recommend to buy them ...</li>
            <li>A refreshing change from my usual Swiss Army cologne.</li>
            <li>However, I want to be perfectly clear here.</li>
            <li>While I have not received any unsolicited favorable comments, i.e. the Wow Factor,</li>
            <li>It is unique at one moment and similar at other times to Aqua Di, Cool Water, and Versace Pour Homme at other times.  </li>
            <li>Swiss Army Mountain Water has changed me in a terribly profound way.</li>
            <li>No less.</li>
            <li>this perfume is very softly but sensual at mean time i like very much and recomend to use it to you</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this smell on my boyfriend.  Smells just like a lumberjack as I say!</li>
            <li> Well, the title says it all. This is an incredible fragrance. Very masculine, yet very light. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> A refreshing change from my usual Swiss Army cologne. Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> It smells very good! Especially when you work as a nurse in ICU:) You know what I am talking about! Very refreshing and lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> The colony smells divine and my husband is happy</li>
            <li> the product met my expectations</li>
            <li> My favorite... best price impossible</li>
            <li> It made the perfect Valentine present for my husband. He loves the smell and so do I. Shipped out in perfect timing.</li>
            <li> Good perfume for a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love the sent and it is a great price. I would highly recommend to others that want a sent that is not overpowering but fresh.</li>
            <li> The product is mislabeled; the description is \\&quot;Swiss Army Eau de Toilette for Women by Swiss Army.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It was purchased for my daughter and it is a man&#x27;s scent.  The box does not say for Him or her.  As it turns out I could have been more careful, there is another product that is a lighter shade of blue that says \\&quot;...for Her\\&quot; on the box.</li>
            <li> I have three of the Swiss Army fragrances (Altitude, Mountain Water, and Original).  All are great and unique fragrances, but all lack longevity.  Of the three, the original fragrance probably offers the best longevity.  Just as you would imagine, the fragrance is a clean and fresh scent.  It is unique at one moment and similar at other times to Aqua Di, Cool Water, and Versace Pour Homme at other times.  In my opinion (that and a $1.25 will buy a cup of coffee), I detect a citrus basenote that finishes with a wood(sy) and fruit scent.  It is a good scent (although not great..).  While I have not received any unsolicited favorable comments, i.e. the Wow Factor, Sweetie (a.k.a. my girlfriend) enjoys the fragrance just following the initial application.  Just as an FYI - she gives the \\&quot;nose test\\&quot; every day prior to leaving for work - a thumbs up for Mountain Water..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offers a great deal on the larger bottle of this fragrance (plus free shipping..!!).  The product was received timely and was well packaged.  The bottle is nicely designed (I am very fond of the color blue..) and is very easy on the eyes.  It can be worn any time of year and is appropriate for any occasion.  Due to the \\&quot;blueness\\&quot; of the bottle, I am giving Mountain Water 4.3 stars out of 5.  Life is full of defining moments - will you define the moment or will the moment define you..??</li>
            <li> Great smell, great price, great size. Highly recommended!! I bought it because its price was reduced in more than 45%. Great business!</li>
            <li> Excellent smell, gives a passionate feeling, I recommend it 100%; besides that lasts a long time perfect smell for special occasions</li>
            <li> Great smell but doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or two.</li>

            <li> i smell it ones on a mall and i love it, my father happend the same, i really love swiss army mountain water, its fresh and long all the day even days after you smell it!</li>
            <li> Good smell, for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.  I really like the smell of it on my husband.  It is just as good as some much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Not a bad sent price should be reduced a tad and it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this one and using it together with Boss deodorant stick. Refreshing scent as long it&#x27;s applied twice a day.</li>
            <li> For years I have partook in various lotions and commercially marketed man-fumes. However, I want to be perfectly clear here. Swiss Army Mountain Water has changed me in a terribly profound way. Until SAM Dubya, I was content pleasing only myself, and I abhorred creating nicknames.  I wore smells solely for me.  Little smellebrations without guest lists.  It was the perfect marriage of aesthetics and economy. A tiny bottle of Stetson could last a decade...as I would apply the hint of a dab of a dash only to the inside of each nostril.  No more. No less. Others did not help pay, so I sought not their benefit. I read the Little Red Hen.  I digress. Alas, That is over now. Swiss Army Mountain Water has me wanting to waft. Yes, I now seek to waft. Damn you, SWAM Water. I award you one star for forcing me to care again.</li>
            <li> muy buena colonia la compre para un regalo y le encanto recomiendo al vendedor responsable y recibida el dia indicado muchas gracias espero continúen así,</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It is amazing, the product arrived damaged, arrived spilled....&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this perfume is very softly but sensual at mean time i like very much and recomend to use it to you</li>
            <li> I have this and the Altitude cologne. I think I like the Altitude better but I have been using citrus smelling colognes for a while now. What I like about this is the looks of the bottle and it definitely looks nice in my cologne collection in the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift item for family members</li>
            <li> Great Cologne! Love it! Item as described!! Easy transaction!!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, nice fragance. A real classic from Victorinox.</li>
            <li> I really like it but I don&#x27;t love it.  The best one is still the Classic Swiss Army fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it......she wanted it for Christmas.....after 25 years of marriage you run out of ideas....so I asked her what she wanted</li>
            <li> I love it! Smells really good! This is some good stuff and is definitely great for a gift for your husbands ladies... Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent product .. arrived on the exact date ... is 100% original and excellent quality ... the product is as described by the image ... and I loved it .. thanks for everything, I recommend it to all amazon buyer community ...</li>
            <li> It is a high quality product</li>
            <li> I love some of the other scents from Swiss Army, but this one is not my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long and isn&#x27;t as clean and crisp as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> GREAT thanks. . loved that it was original sealed took longer than expected to be delivered.</li>
            <li> The scent of the perfume is nice and soft. I chose to change my perfume essences. I like. Yes, I recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love all of the Swiss Army fragrances, but this one and the Forest scent turn this momma bear into a kitten.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is awesome, a little floral, a little peppery. Kind of like a Polo Black.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He is pretty particular when it comes to colognes &amp; he absolutely loved it! It smells similar to Cool Water, but more subtle and &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; if that makes any sense &amp; for the price you just cant beat it</li>
            <li> is an imitation, not recommend,,, odor disappears in seconds ----- ---- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- -</li>
            <li> very good the w&amp;aacute;ter cologne i like it</li>
            <li> Greetings I am writing to tell you that I am very comfortable with the product, packed all my expectations. thank you</li>
            <li> Bien, buen olor y calidad, bien enpacada y sellada, si es origina, me llego a tiempo, todo en orden, listo</li>
            <li> When I first saw the reviews of the product, it looked a decent perfume to me - value for money, that I would use for day to day type of use rather than special occasions... However, it has a good fragrance, but is uncomfortably strong for me. From experience it seems like a composition that is very &#x27;noticeable&#x27;, and strong, good for a short period of time, rather than a mild, pleasant, &#x27;background&#x27;, lingering kind of a fragrance that I was looking for, to wear day-to-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Perfumes are quite subjective so it would be unfair to brand the product and generalize. I would grade it at &#x27;above average&#x27; at best but not what I was looking for, so 3 stars.</li>
