            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect scent to put on right after you get out of the bath and crawl into bed!</li>

            <li>Because the fragrance is so wonderful, I will certainly be purchasing this cream again.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, even after washing my hands all day I can still smell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing power is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is so nice.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells of warm, vanilla sugar.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best body lotion on the market!  </li>
            <li>Nice product......</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best cream ever!</li>
            <li>received lots of compliments on how nice I smell</li>
            <li>but this fragrance reminds me of a very nice and light version of BBW Van.</li>
            <li>lol I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself when I&#x27;ve used any Fresh Cream items!</li>
            <li>I love all the Amazing Grace products by Philosophy</li>
            <li>I always think that they are eating something luscious, it&#x27;s truly delicious but light, never artificial like so many vanilla scented lotions.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly too!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product line!</li>
            <li>How many times have you been able to honestly state that fact?</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Smells light and yummy!</li>
            <li>; would be a better name for this product......</li>
            <li>Love the price and the convenience of delivery too.</li>
            <li>I had fallen in love with myself.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all of the philosophy lotions and creams, so when I saw this on amazon, I had to have it!</li>
            <li>fast deliver--smells great</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly to me and even better, it quenches my skins&#x27; thirst.</li>
            <li>I love the eau de parfum</li>
            <li>my favorite body cream/lotion and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite line from Philosophy.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for caring it  ....and fast delivery too!!!!</li>
            <li>I feel so female when I use this, love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very clean fragrance..</li>
            <li>But I think there are much more quality body lotions that are more moisturizing, chemical free, and better priced.</li>
            <li>This smells really nice on and is sweet smelling but not over powering.</li>
            <li>This is just a warm, sweet, creamy scent</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs well and the rich fragrance lingers!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts and the lotion feels wonderful on dry hands.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves to use it for himself though because he hates strong smells</li>
            <li>It comes in a HUGE tube for what it is</li>
            <li>I love Fresh Cream from Philosophy, and now I can take this with me on trips.</li>
            <li>Love Fresh Cream items and this extends the scent after showering with the gel.</li>
            <li>Light scent, with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Fresh and fabulous scent!</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Delicious scent that moisturizes without ever feeling heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, the men at work tell me that I smell good enough to eat</li>
            <li>Noel which I wear very rarely I can mix it with my Phil.</li>
            <li>THIS FRAGRANCE OF THIS CREAM IS VERY FRESH, I ALSO USE TH PERFUME.</li>
            <li>more sweet than fresh, name is misleading........</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it seems to be pretty moisturizing, though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this lotion if you&#x27;re on a diet.</li>
            <li>A product that smells delicious while actually being an outstanding moisturizer for your entire body!!</li>
            <li>scent is a bit sweet, use lightly.......</li>
            <li>I love it THAT much!</li>
            <li>For now, THIS IS the right ONE!</li>
            <li>If you do not like sweet products on your skin</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my hands feel but the smell is too sweet and it bothers me.</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on my new &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Sephora and brand new.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes me feel warm and cozy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the soft scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I am sure that I would add it to my collection.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the soft feel of the lotion&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and it&#x27;s great for my hands.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, like a really clean fragrance without being overly sweet or heavy.</li>
            <li>This and the body wash keep my skin soft and sweet!</li>
            <li>I love whipping cream and sugar pastries but on my skin, was a different story.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought this cream</li>
            <li>and it really does moisturize!  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>and of course, no one likes the same products or the same scents but to me, this has a nice mild scent that does fade after while which means it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, really softens your skin and smells good enough to eat (don&#x27;t actually do that).</li>
            <li>loved it , smell like soft whipped cream, the scent lasts a very long time i would highly recomend it</li>
            <li>I love the lotion and how it hydrates, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>This Fresh Cream line of Philosophy products is my new obsession</li>
            <li>;-) I highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li>Really like this scent I do not like to smell like Vanilla</li>
            <li>BUT IT&#x27;S MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li>so I was refunded fast.</li>
            <li>I also do not find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I did find it rather moisturizing and the scent was subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>After all of the big reviews I was excited to make this purchase.</li>
            <li>My new FAV!</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat, and I get compliments everyday from wearing the body spritz in this scent...</li>
            <li>but it also left it feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li>, I cannot stop buying all the different Fresh Cream products....</li>
            <li>Just a added note: This is the fourth bottle of Fresh Cream lotion I have bought.</li>
            <li>I have gone through lots of different brand of lotions and creams trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, if you want something that smells good(and by good, I mean fantastic!)</li>
            <li>I have bought several tubes of this so far and will continue to buy it as long as I love it.</li>
            <li>Its also makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of an SPF smell at first but that fades and then you are left smelling like frosting.</li>
            <li>, I was not left  with peeling skin for the first time in my life, it saved me.</li>
            <li>So not wasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and ready to buy my third</li>
            <li>I bought this item more out of curiosity than anything else having watched late night QVC shows.</li>
            <li>This is by far</li>
            <li>unlike most scented lotions that leave your skin dry and tight, this one is luxurious in its moisture.</li>
            <li>It has a cheap vanilla scent--or a stale marshmallow--nothing like a sweet cream.</li>
            <li>It simply smells divine and it&#x27;s not just pure vanilla but a sweet milky caramel with that delicate scent of whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Great formula product from Philosophy as always, but BAD SMELL</li>
            <li>My arm was soft and felt wonderful and smelled dreadful!  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and delicate not overpowering, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and</li>

            <li> This was the first time I bought this cream</li>
            <li> and it really does moisturize!  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> and of course, no one likes the same products or the same scents but to me, this has a nice mild scent that does fade after while which means it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, really softens your skin and smells good enough to eat (don&#x27;t actually do that).</li>
            <li> loved it , smell like soft whipped cream, the scent lasts a very long time i would highly recomend it</li>
            <li> I love the lotion and how it hydrates, and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This Fresh Cream line of Philosophy products is my new obsession</li>
            <li> ;-) I highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really like this scent I do not like to smell like Vanilla</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S MUCH CHEAPER</li>
            <li> so I was refunded fast.</li>
            <li> I also do not find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I did find it rather moisturizing and the scent was subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> After all of the big reviews I was excited to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> My new FAV!</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat, and I get compliments everyday from wearing the body spritz in this scent...</li>
            <li> but it also left it feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li> , I cannot stop buying all the different Fresh Cream products....</li>
            <li> Just a added note: This is the fourth bottle of Fresh Cream lotion I have bought.</li>
            <li> I have gone through lots of different brand of lotions and creams trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, if you want something that smells good(and by good, I mean fantastic!)</li>
            <li> I have bought several tubes of this so far and will continue to buy it as long as I love it.</li>
            <li> Its also makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of an SPF smell at first but that fades and then you are left smelling like frosting.</li>
            <li> , I was not left  with peeling skin for the first time in my life, it saved me.</li>
            <li> So not wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and ready to buy my third</li>
            <li> I bought this item more out of curiosity than anything else having watched late night QVC shows.</li>
            <li> This is by far</li>
            <li> unlike most scented lotions that leave your skin dry and tight, this one is luxurious in its moisture.</li>
            <li> It has a cheap vanilla scent--or a stale marshmallow--nothing like a sweet cream.</li>
            <li> It simply smells divine and it&#x27;s not just pure vanilla but a sweet milky caramel with that delicate scent of whipped cream.</li>
            <li> Great formula product from Philosophy as always, but BAD SMELL</li>
            <li> My arm was soft and felt wonderful and smelled dreadful!  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and delicate not overpowering, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I will buy as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy, and the fragrance lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> one with extreme dry skin and have used every lotion under the sun, finally!!</li>
            <li> and I use Cream every single day</li>
            <li> I got a bad sun burn this summer while hiking through a very sunny park this July and this cream was the only thing that not only soothed my burned skin ( lobster red)</li>
            <li> maybe a bitter scent?  </li>
            <li> Soft subtle ROTTEN smell.</li>
            <li> Lotion was not good, old or something</li>
            <li> At some point, I realized that I cared not about other lovers...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just way to sweet smelling and makes me feel sick when I smell it, I just can&#x27;t wear it let alone smell it.</li>
            <li> I just received this lotion a few days ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit, this just arrived less than 5 minutes ago, and I am practically drooling over the scent!</li>
            <li> Smell is not strong at all and smells just like butter or cream.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I USUALLY BUY THIS FROM QVC.</li>
            <li> and this gets me from the shower and into my clothes without any hard rubbing in or greasy spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I&#x27;ve been dying to try this lotion for a while now and had high hopes</li>
            <li> It is not too thick, or too runny.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent and us vedy moisturing.</li>
            <li> this is coming from someone obsessed with skin care, I&#x27;ve been a moisturizing vigilante ever since I turned twelve, well</li>
            <li> I saw a review in which someone said it stinks,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ugly elbows or hands</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this scent I do not like to smell like Vanilla but this fragrance reminds me of a very nice and light version of BBW Van. Noel which I wear very rarely I can mix it with my Phil. Snow Angel and I&#x27;ll smell like Snow cream Lol This will be my Feminine pearly day fragrance ...Thank you Amazon for caring it  ....and fast delivery too!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but when I received it, it was sweeter smelling than I thought.  All I can say is I felt like I smelled like a walking cupcake with frosting.</li>
            <li> Great formula product from Philosophy as always, but BAD SMELL :/ I&#x27;m so disappointed because I&#x27;ve been dying to try this lotion for a while now and had high hopes but it&#x27;s just way to sweet smelling and makes me feel sick when I smell it, I just can&#x27;t wear it let alone smell it. If you do not like sweet products on your skin I do not recommend buying this. I love whipping cream and sugar pastries but on my skin, was a different story. Not for me, returning my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Fresh Cream from Philosophy, and now I can take this with me on trips.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it seems to be pretty moisturizing, though, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this lotion if you&#x27;re on a diet. Walking around smelling like a cupcake happens to make you crave lots of sweets. LOL</li>
            <li> Smell is not strong at all and smells just like butter or cream. My boyfriend loves to use it for himself though because he hates strong smells So not wasted.</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love.&lt;br /&gt;Did I say I loved...I&#x27;m hooked and ready to buy my third one.&lt;br /&gt;As one with extreme dry skin and have used every lotion under the sun, finally!! A product that smells delicious while actually being an outstanding moisturizer for your entire body!! How many times have you been able to honestly state that fact? Now you can! The scent is by no means over powering it&#x27;s a subtle clean scent and unlike most scented lotions that leave your skin dry and tight, this one is luxurious in its moisture. A must have!</li>
            <li> I love all the Amazing Grace products by Philosophy</li>
            <li> favorite moisterizer ever!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, the men at work tell me that I smell good enough to eat</li>
            <li> I bought this item more out of curiosity than anything else having watched late night QVC shows. I did find it rather moisturizing and the scent was subtle and pleasant. But I think there are much more quality body lotions that are more moisturizing, chemical free, and better priced. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my organic brands.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so nice. The smell is amazing, even after washing my hands all day I can still smell it. My skin just soaks it up!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells of warm, vanilla sugar.  The fragrance lasts and the lotion feels wonderful on dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have this in my monthly subscribe and save order so it is delivered to my house every month. It&#x27;s the perfect scent to put on right after you get out of the bath and crawl into bed! I get compliments all the time because it smells so good</li>
            <li> Smells light and yummy! Very clean fragrance..</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best body lotion on the market!  It&#x27;s moisturizing power is amazing.  It is not too thick, or too runny.  The scent is delicious!  I wanted to eat my own arm after I used it!</li>
            <li> Nice product......scent is a bit sweet, use lightly.......more sweet than fresh, name is misleading........&amp;#34;sugar cream&amp;#34; would be a better name for this product......</li>
            <li> Love Fresh Cream items and this extends the scent after showering with the gel. I also have the souffle but am going to use it in the winter when a heavier moisturizer is needed. This is nearly perfect. It would be perfect if it were a tad lighter.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells heavenly!  Have received many compliments on my new &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent.  Love the price and the convenience of delivery too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the soft scent of this lotion. It was delivered very quickly too! Great customer care!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, really softens your skin and smells good enough to eat (don&#x27;t actually do that). ;-) I highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> At some point, I realized that I cared not about other lovers...I had fallen in love with myself. Amen. Can I get an Amen?</li>
            <li> OMG! Truly the BEST scent on the market! I love the lotion and how it hydrates, and it lasts a long time! My new FAV!</li>
            <li> loved it , smell like soft whipped cream, the scent lasts a very long time i would highly recomend it</li>
            <li> Have purchased 3 tubs. It has a subtle scent and us vedy moisturing. Absolutely love this cream! By far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best cream ever! It smells like cotton candy, and the fragrance lasts a long, long time. Because the fragrance is so wonderful, I will certainly be purchasing this cream again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all of the philosophy lotions and creams, so when I saw this on amazon, I had to have it! Very good price. Light scent, with a hint of vanilla. Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY BUY THIS FROM QVC. BUT IT&#x27;S MUCH CHEAPER AT AMAZON. THIS FRAGRANCE OF THIS CREAM IS VERY FRESH, I ALSO USE TH PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! Fresh and fabulous scent!</li>
            <li> fast deliver--smells great</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hands feel but the smell is too sweet and it bothers me.</li>
            <li> I am a big Philosophy fan.  I just received this lotion a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am sure that I would add it to my collection.</li>
            <li> I feel so female when I use this, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smelled off when I opened tube.  Tried it on my arm. Soft subtle ROTTEN smell. My arm was soft and felt wonderful and smelled dreadful!  Had already thrown receipts away so washed up and tossed tube in trash.  No place for a 0 star rating or I would have used it.</li>
            <li> This smells so delicious and is so creamy on my skin. The scent is light and delicate not overpowering, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Good consistency.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought this cream and I LOVE it.  It smells great and it really does moisturize!  Even if you put this on in the morning you will still smell it at night.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  My favorite bed scent in the body creme!</li>
            <li> This smells really nice on and is sweet smelling but not over powering. Its also makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The smell and the moisture is so good I even use it on my face</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but not quite what I expected.  There&#x27;s a hint of something in there that keeps it from being just perfect....maybe a bitter scent?  I will use this up, but will not order again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product line!</li>
            <li> Lotion was not good, old or something so I was refunded fast. Thank You</li>
            <li> Smells sugary and GREAT, and keeps skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, this just arrived less than 5 minutes ago, and I am practically drooling over the scent! I am about to shower, so I&#x27;m trying to restrain myself from slathering this all over my body until afterwards! You think I&#x27;m exaggerating...I am not! This Fresh Cream line of Philosophy products is my new obsession, I cannot stop buying all the different Fresh Cream products....an intervention may soon be in order. Seriously though, if you want something that smells good(and by good, I mean fantastic!), but isn&#x27;t too much...try this stuff. It smells good enough to eat, and I get compliments everyday from wearing the body spritz in this scent...from both men and women. My son loves to use the shampoo/showergel/bubble bath combo, it isn&#x27;t strictly a feminine scent. Not that he would wear the perfume in this line, but my point is...it&#x27;s beauty transcends gender! lol I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself when I&#x27;ve used any Fresh Cream items!</li>
            <li> Best Philosophy fragrance ever!  I live in a very dry climate and it&#x27;s great for my hands.  This is my second purchase and I will buy as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> My daughter had some of this marvelous Fresh Cream which she let me try and I LOVE it! It smells heavenly to me and even better, it quenches my skins&#x27; thirst. Philosophy is great stuff anyway. I haven&#x27;t used anything I don&#x27;t like. It comes in a HUGE tube for what it is and I use Cream every single day so I&#x27;m happy about that! I saw a review in which someone said it stinks, and of course, no one likes the same products or the same scents but to me, this has a nice mild scent that does fade after while which means it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume. Just a added note: This is the fourth bottle of Fresh Cream lotion I have bought. I love it THAT much! I don&#x27;t have ugly elbows or hands and I&#x27;m 61,thanks to this! I have gone through lots of different brand of lotions and creams trying to find the right one. For now, THIS IS the right ONE! I also have one with sunscreen in it for summer. You need to keep sunscreen on your body if you get into the sun to keep from getting skin cancer! It is NO laughing matter! UPDATE: I have bought several tubes of this so far and will continue to buy it as long as I love it. When I wear it, I get compliments from people on how good I smell, one person saying that I smelled &amp;#34;YUMMY&amp;#34;. LOL!  I noticed a man leaning towards me in the UPS store one day! Haha! This is just a warm, sweet, creamy scent and I love the way it makes me feel warm and cozy.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance!  The cream absorbs well and the rich fragrance lingers!  I love it!  Silky and seductive!</li>
            <li> Better price than Sephora and brand new. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the eau de parfum but I only LIKE the lotion. It has a bit of an SPF smell at first but that fades and then you are left smelling like frosting. I applied to my legs after a shower and got in bed. The next morning, my husband told me that it gave him a headache and he almost had to sleep in another room. So now I only use sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  Delicious scent that moisturizes without ever feeling heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite body cream/lotion and this is coming from someone obsessed with skin care, I&#x27;ve been a moisturizing vigilante ever since I turned twelve, well twenty one years later I finally found my skin care soul mate. This cream is spectacular, and I&#x27;m not even talking scent wise, the consistency, the quality, the moisture, it&#x27;s exquisite. I got a bad sun burn this summer while hiking through a very sunny park this July and this cream was the only thing that not only soothed my burned skin ( lobster red) but it also left it feeling soft and smooth, I was not left  with peeling skin for the first time in my life, it saved me. And it&#x27;s so rich and creamy, it spreads beautifully but is not greasy at all, I&#x27;m always in a rush in the morning and this gets me from the shower and into my clothes without any hard rubbing in or greasy spots yet it&#x27;s deeply nourishing. I&#x27;m on my 12th tube of this stuff and I can&#x27;t seem to want to order anything else...maybe ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent, well it&#x27;s delicious, a bit of a creme brulee, ice cream cone and candy corn, when I smell it on people around me ( who always steal it lol)  I always think that they are eating something luscious, it&#x27;s truly delicious but light, never artificial like so many vanilla scented lotions. It simply smells divine and it&#x27;s not just pure vanilla but a sweet milky caramel with that delicate scent of whipped cream. I love this stuff. Best body lotion/cream that I have ever used and trust me, I&#x27;m a connoisseur and an addict :P it&#x27;s a hybrid of lotion and cream but it moisturizes like nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kasia S.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for office mates.  Smells fresh, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the soft feel of the lotion&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to others&lt;br /&gt;Have received lots of compliments on how nice I smell&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite line from Philosophy. I think this is my 10th bottle. It smells amazing, like a really clean fragrance without being overly sweet or heavy. I receive compliments all the time. This and the body wash keep my skin soft and sweet!</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on schedule</li>
            <li> After all of the big reviews I was excited to make this purchase. Now that I&#x27;ve been wearing it I&#x27;ve decided I do not like it. It has a cheap vanilla scent--or a stale marshmallow--nothing like a sweet cream. If this were in a $5 bottle at Target I wouldn&#x27;t buy it. I also do not find it very moisturizing. Bummer. I&#x27;ll just stick with philosophy&#x27;s facial products.</li>
