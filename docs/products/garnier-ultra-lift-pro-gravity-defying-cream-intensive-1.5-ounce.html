            <li>It is a perfect option for those not being able to afford - or not wanting to have - face lifts.</li>
            <li>Just Great on my skin, notice improvements, and makeup glides great on top of skin.  </li>
            <li>Kept it, though, because it&#x27;s a good cream for the price.  </li>
            <li>but I just gave it a good stirring and then put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>but it is certainly a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is good for a night cream.  </li>
            <li>and you should be good.</li>
            <li>i loved this cream, it feels so good, doesnÂ´t feel oily or greasy</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I guess it makes a good body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have not use it yet,but it seems good</li>
            <li>Good for hands if nothing else.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IS A GOOD PRODUCT , AND THA IS WHY A BOUGHT</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>this cream is great works well on my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>The scent is clean, very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li>I love this cream because it does a great job without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I think it is wonderful and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly and smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream!</li>
            <li>The cream is magic!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for quite a while and love it!</li>
            <li>Is my favorite!</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try it!</li>
            <li>That along with this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I think for the price, this is a super-rich and effective night cream.</li>
            <li>I was about to spend $120 on a cream I liked and tried from  birch box.</li>
            <li>and there were no visible signs of lifting the skin as advertised - unless the lift is microscopic - and if so who cares - I want lift that I can see - so then I tried Walmart&#x27;s own brand for $5.00</li>
            <li>very nice feel, not greasy, no annoying smell.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review products, but just had to pass this along to others looking for that perfect product...</li>
            <li>Product was delivered in good shape and the price was excellent, a definite savings from the store.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and perfumy.  </li>
            <li>Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream has been one of the best I have found so far</li>
            <li>I love the way this cream feels and it would be really nice if Garnier continued making it.&lt;br /&gt;However, this cream has been discontinued and if you check the LOT online, you&#x27;ll see that it is indeed expired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product, good texture and works on fine lines.</li>
            <li>Very light and makes your face have a dewy glow.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it appears to even clog pores, so watch out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it seems to make my skin softer and hold moisture better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for me as a night cream, because it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer for use under make-up.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, this stuff is my favorite treat for my face.  </li>
            <li>I DO LOVE THIS FACE CREAM.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use a day cream because, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t like going to work with a greasy looking face.</li>
            <li>It felt more like a cleanser, not a lotion.</li>
            <li>This was the biggest disapointment you can imagine, when I opened the jar, most of the cream was gone, there was nothing there but</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>These cream is silky and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Probably because I am allergic to most products.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>This is a much better deal than buying it from the drug store.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better</li>
            <li>- now I am sure there still will be no visible lifting with this product</li>
            <li>This does a better job of moisturizing and saves money to boot.</li>
            <li>I also mix almond oil with body lotions for better hydration.</li>
            <li>For the price (under $10) a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping more for a moisturizer feel to it.</li>
            <li>one more time so see if I could tolerate it without the pre-existing symptoms.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love it myself....</li>
            <li>Its ok but would not buy again</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I also notice more firmness in the jowel/jaw area which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best buys out there that actually works!</li>
            <li>Using the cream makes me feel better</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>and I can feel confident in this product.</li>
            <li>It is an okay under makeup moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say that I notice any difference</li>
            <li>and my people can tell when I Skype them that my face looks better.  </li>
            <li>It it light, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant fragrance, and seems to be firming my skin and reducing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>i guess it does work better in some areas than others but cant complain its pretty good.</li>
            <li>great cream high in vitamin c</li>
            <li>She loved it so much she insisted I buy her more.  </li>
            <li>Like other Garnier face creams, it smells really good and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li>Garnier has really come out with a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily it&#x27;s easy to return.</li>
            <li>Too strong for my face, although I have used as a touch up on the eye lid area.</li>
            <li>Even after all of that, the scent still lingered strongly and continued to make my symptoms worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was some kind of frost damage,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 Californian and have skin that goes through huge changes when the weather changes.</li>
            <li>Smooth cream, no need for additional moisturizer this winter</li>
            <li>It was not creamy nor did it go on the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on light without a clumpy feeling.</li>
            <li>This smells and feels absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It goes on ver smoothly, non greasy and gives you an instand glow.</li>
            <li>but I am not seeing it as such a &#x27;GREAT&#x27; thing that I am going to want to use all the time.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find that Amazon still has it through it&#x27;s sellers, so I bought several jars of it!  </li>
            <li>and I apply it lightly.  </li>
            <li>This looks like a good price from Amazon, but check your local stores to be sure.</li>
            <li>I loved the old stuff...</li>
            <li>It is soft and makes my skin feel good.  </li>
            <li>best i have used is bare minerals moisturizer and will continue to use and not try anything new again</li>
            <li>As long as I use it in the morning and at night every day, the wrinkles in my neck and chin are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I like Garnier products in general and this was a good price</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried it and it was ok.  </li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift originally.  </li>
            <li>The cream felt really good on my skin -- just the right amount of moisture and it absorbed very well.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing glamorous or special about this Ultra-Lift Pro Cream.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, I gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to her either, just another moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure, I worked in advertising--mostly food and wine--for decades.  </li>
            <li>The Garnier Ultra-lift cream itself is good, but I will never order facial cream this way.</li>
            <li>so I get the full effect of the lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bummer, because I really wanted to love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received item and it was full of water.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and right away noticed that it has a strong but not unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Just as good or better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I washed my face and put on the cream and my face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>great product especially when used at night really softens my skin and tightens out my neck.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to work any better than your normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Plus it really does give your jaw line a lift!!</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a try - as a skin cream it seems fine - however I used up a whole bottle</li>
            <li>still ended up buying a couple more, and after receiving them, they seem the same and still good to go, ... but that would be my last order, unless they start making them again.</li>
            <li>I expected the scent to wear off, but instead it became more and more noticeable to me.  </li>
            <li>I also applied an unscented lotion twice to try to dilute the scent that was absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Most of it was old and unusable.</li>
            <li>So far I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that most of these remaining bottles must be older stock because they come with the cream separated so there is \\&quot;water\\&quot; at the top</li>
            <li>Other Garnier products are not as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is much more effective than I anticipated, and certainly cheaper than anything I used previously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and found the Ultra-Lift to be OK, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I got a confirmation and a &amp;#34;shipped&amp;#34; notice right away.</li>
            <li>and it is priced right here.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skins right away.</li>
            <li>Someone else commented that the smell is very strong, and that they&#x27;d washed their face several times, but could still smell it.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles are nice and smooth and my cheeks are sagging less.</li>
            <li>this is a great lotion and you do see results but my only concern is sometimes i leave my face a bit red and a bit oily</li>
            <li>far this product seems fine for me.  </li>
            <li>FIRST TIME TRYING</li>
            <li>/&gt;Garnier, you wouldn&#x27;t be doing it if it didn&#x27;t work--making the container look like it holds more than it actually does--but most manufactures do the same.  </li>
            <li>it gave my face a healthy glow and actually worked in firming to some degree.  </li>
            <li>I love the exfoliants they use, it helps to open my pores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have tried many different skin care lines, from the drugstore brands to on-line or department store products.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin overall better condition.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin when I first used the product.  </li>
            <li>It is economical and makes my skin feel really hydrated without the greasy look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I also have to admit that I have not faithfully used this product every day - I often miss weekends - and I have been mostly using it only once a day when I do use it.  </li>
            <li>Caused break-outs after the first use.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Garnier!</li>
            <li>The product delivers exactly as it states.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered it twice, love it, everybody is being commenting on how I look younger....</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any improvement in my neck, but my face is really responding very fast.</li>
            <li>more water, very little separated cream, and an extremely strong rancid odor.    </li>
            <li>Younger women can get a great jump start on preventing wrinkles and sagging as you can actually feel a slight tightening effect post application and women with a bit more age and wisdom will no doubt see diminished wrinkles with prolonged use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that long but love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I have not had this long enough to do a good review</li>
            <li>This site was clear, concise and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The fine lines have all but disappeared under my eyes and the deeper lines that I have had for decades were noticeably smaller after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>She says this really does the job.</li>
            <li>Seems to moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES</li>
            <li>but if you put too much you can see the grit start to ball up</li>
            <li>Worth a try if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I tried this was because I received free samples for a seven day trial.   </li>
            <li>; water spilled out when I opened it; and there was a very rancid odor.  </li>
            <li>but then what would the cosmetic surgeons do if there really was a miracle product out there.  </li>
            <li>so I would really need a miracle product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead I really like Olay ProX firming cream.</li>
            <li>and you skin really does feel noticeably softer and smoother</li>
            <li>not a bad product would recommend to friend a lttle more greasy the what I usually purchase wont purchase again</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which breaks out in blackheads if a product is too oily -- but this product has been fabulous -- no break outs and no dry skin!  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other brands, it was not greasy and did not make my face break out.</li>
            <li>I paid for new cream!</li>
            <li>Was really disappointed as I read so many good reviews and really wanted to try the product.</li>
            <li>My wife has used it for years and reccomends it highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>and I no longer have the breakouts, plus the cream lasts a little longer. :-)  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have to return anything</li>
            <li>But for now, I have to say that if you are someone with chemical sensitivities or similar problems, or even if you simply don&#x27;t like strong scents, then skip this product and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found some of the original, and God knows how old or how long it&#x27;s been sitting somewhere, but I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age, but I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones either.</li>
            <li>but I just received a new jar yesterday</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones.</li>
            <li>Really seems to work, the cream does not &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; on your skin, it sinks right in and keeps your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen the results that the other viewers have seen, but I am not disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li>;) 1-2x/day of regular use can make one jar lasts over a month.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>but...&lt;br /&gt;one of my jars was half filled with water, which curdled the cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because the product I bought was old but my first experience with this product appears to have tiny granules in it that you can not see but feel when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and think this is fine for me if used in a small quantity.</li>
            <li>This is by far my FAVORITE anti wrinkle cream, and it is hard to find in stores...</li>
            <li>Woman swore on ponds cold creme  LOL</li>
            <li>at 65 years old I am always searching for something to help my aging skin.</li>
            <li>The result is she went back to this product because she could really see the difference.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>I only look 78 thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>The picture here is NOT the old ultra lift pro.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>No oiliness or greasiness, just soft, supple skin, with no dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li>It absorbs immediately and leaves your skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 51 and have a bit of sagging at my jowls . . .</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to see how my skin retained moisture after using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the cream once so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if this is just the way it separates, but I would NOT buy this product again.</li>
            <li>This product did moisturize my skin although I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it lifted it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>( temperatures are now much warmer) and it was the same separated product that arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found which works and, at the same time, is absorbed so well that I don&#x27;t have that greasy appearance on my face all day.</li>
            <li>and I think that is the whole purpose behind cosmetics and many skin care items, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thick; so I make sure my face is damp before I apply</li>
            <li>jar half full</li>
            <li>The results are more subtle than miraculous, but it&#x27;ll do.  </li>
            <li>I saw one of the reviews saying that even her fine lines were disappearing, but to me, nothing is happening but letting my check bones a little red.</li>
            <li>normally buy only all-natural body care products because I don&#x27;t want to be putting a bunch of chemicals on my body.  </li>
            <li>I did feel my skin was soft and firm the next morning after using this cream, and I feel the price is reasonable and the quality comparable to some in the higher price range.</li>
            <li>The photo represented on the site when I purchased this one was different, so I thought the company had something new.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from other sellers and had very satisfactory results!  </li>
            <li>My skin seriously look different - better - within a week or two of using it, as does my jaw line and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, creamy state and has stayed that way, at least for now.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive the same product as before.  </li>
            <li>The cream was gritty as if it was old.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all the really expensive ones, and this one is just as effective and luxurious.</li>
            <li>The Garnier products in the green containers have such a pleasant fresh scent, but this one just stinks.</li>
            <li>but because I wanted to submit a noticeable warning for the few people who might have chemical sensitivities or other problems with strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only used it once and so far but have used similar products</li>
            <li>will try the cream again when my cold is completely gone, and hopefully will be able to tolerate the scent without it irritating my sinuses and throat when I&#x27;m healthy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long this will last, but I am surprised and amazed at the change.</li>
            <li>I do have dry skin and went back to using the natural skin creams..</li>
            <li>Too much packaging oo little product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> No outbreaks, my face feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect option for those not being able to afford - or not wanting to have - face lifts.</li>
            <li> Just Great on my skin, notice improvements, and makeup glides great on top of skin.  </li>
            <li> Kept it, though, because it&#x27;s a good cream for the price.  </li>
            <li> but I just gave it a good stirring and then put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> but it is certainly a good value for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is good for a night cream.  </li>
            <li> and you should be good.</li>
            <li> i loved this cream, it feels so good, doesnÂ´t feel oily or greasy</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I guess it makes a good body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have not use it yet,but it seems good</li>
            <li> Good for hands if nothing else.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IS A GOOD PRODUCT , AND THA IS WHY A BOUGHT</li>
            <li> GOOD</li>
            <li> this cream is great works well on my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> The scent is clean, very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it does a great job without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I think it is wonderful and smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly and smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream!</li>
            <li> The cream is magic!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for quite a while and love it!</li>
            <li> Is my favorite!</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try it!</li>
            <li> That along with this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I think for the price, this is a super-rich and effective night cream.</li>
            <li> I was about to spend $120 on a cream I liked and tried from  birch box.</li>
            <li> and there were no visible signs of lifting the skin as advertised - unless the lift is microscopic - and if so who cares - I want lift that I can see - so then I tried Walmart&#x27;s own brand for $5.00</li>
            <li> very nice feel, not greasy, no annoying smell.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products, but just had to pass this along to others looking for that perfect product...</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in good shape and the price was excellent, a definite savings from the store.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and perfumy.  </li>
            <li> Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream has been one of the best I have found so far</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels and it would be really nice if Garnier continued making it.&lt;br /&gt;However, this cream has been discontinued and if you check the LOT online, you&#x27;ll see that it is indeed expired.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this product, good texture and works on fine lines.</li>
            <li> Very light and makes your face have a dewy glow.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it appears to even clog pores, so watch out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it seems to make my skin softer and hold moisture better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for me as a night cream, because it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer for use under make-up.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff is my favorite treat for my face.  </li>
            <li> I DO LOVE THIS FACE CREAM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a day cream because, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t like going to work with a greasy looking face.</li>
            <li> It felt more like a cleanser, not a lotion.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest disapointment you can imagine, when I opened the jar, most of the cream was gone, there was nothing there but</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> These cream is silky and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Probably because I am allergic to most products.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a much better deal than buying it from the drug store.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better</li>
            <li> - now I am sure there still will be no visible lifting with this product</li>
            <li> This does a better job of moisturizing and saves money to boot.</li>
            <li> I also mix almond oil with body lotions for better hydration.</li>
            <li> For the price (under $10) a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping more for a moisturizer feel to it.</li>
            <li> one more time so see if I could tolerate it without the pre-existing symptoms.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love it myself....</li>
            <li> Its ok but would not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I also notice more firmness in the jowel/jaw area which is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It is one of the best buys out there that actually works!</li>
            <li> Using the cream makes me feel better</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> and I can feel confident in this product.</li>
            <li> It is an okay under makeup moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say that I notice any difference</li>
            <li> and my people can tell when I Skype them that my face looks better.  </li>
            <li> It it light, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant fragrance, and seems to be firming my skin and reducing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> i guess it does work better in some areas than others but cant complain its pretty good.</li>
            <li> great cream high in vitamin c</li>
            <li> She loved it so much she insisted I buy her more.  </li>
            <li> Like other Garnier face creams, it smells really good and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> Garnier has really come out with a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily it&#x27;s easy to return.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my face, although I have used as a touch up on the eye lid area.</li>
            <li> Even after all of that, the scent still lingered strongly and continued to make my symptoms worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was some kind of frost damage,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 Californian and have skin that goes through huge changes when the weather changes.</li>
            <li> Smooth cream, no need for additional moisturizer this winter</li>
            <li> It was not creamy nor did it go on the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> It goes on light without a clumpy feeling.</li>
            <li> This smells and feels absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It goes on ver smoothly, non greasy and gives you an instand glow.</li>
            <li> but I am not seeing it as such a &#x27;GREAT&#x27; thing that I am going to want to use all the time.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find that Amazon still has it through it&#x27;s sellers, so I bought several jars of it!  </li>
            <li> and I apply it lightly.  </li>
            <li> This looks like a good price from Amazon, but check your local stores to be sure.</li>
            <li> I loved the old stuff...</li>
            <li> It is soft and makes my skin feel good.  </li>
            <li> best i have used is bare minerals moisturizer and will continue to use and not try anything new again</li>
            <li> As long as I use it in the morning and at night every day, the wrinkles in my neck and chin are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I like Garnier products in general and this was a good price</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried it and it was ok.  </li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift originally.  </li>
            <li> The cream felt really good on my skin -- just the right amount of moisture and it absorbed very well.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing glamorous or special about this Ultra-Lift Pro Cream.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to her either, just another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I worked in advertising--mostly food and wine--for decades.  </li>
            <li> The Garnier Ultra-lift cream itself is good, but I will never order facial cream this way.</li>
            <li> so I get the full effect of the lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bummer, because I really wanted to love this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received item and it was full of water.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and right away noticed that it has a strong but not unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Just as good or better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I washed my face and put on the cream and my face feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> great product especially when used at night really softens my skin and tightens out my neck.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to work any better than your normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Plus it really does give your jaw line a lift!!</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a try - as a skin cream it seems fine - however I used up a whole bottle</li>
            <li> still ended up buying a couple more, and after receiving them, they seem the same and still good to go, ... but that would be my last order, unless they start making them again.</li>
            <li> I expected the scent to wear off, but instead it became more and more noticeable to me.  </li>
            <li> I also applied an unscented lotion twice to try to dilute the scent that was absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Most of it was old and unusable.</li>
            <li> So far I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that most of these remaining bottles must be older stock because they come with the cream separated so there is \\&quot;water\\&quot; at the top</li>
            <li> Other Garnier products are not as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is much more effective than I anticipated, and certainly cheaper than anything I used previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and found the Ultra-Lift to be OK, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I got a confirmation and a &amp;#34;shipped&amp;#34; notice right away.</li>
            <li> and it is priced right here.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skins right away.</li>
            <li> Someone else commented that the smell is very strong, and that they&#x27;d washed their face several times, but could still smell it.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are nice and smooth and my cheeks are sagging less.</li>
            <li> this is a great lotion and you do see results but my only concern is sometimes i leave my face a bit red and a bit oily</li>
            <li> far this product seems fine for me.  </li>
            <li> FIRST TIME TRYING</li>
            <li> /&gt;Garnier, you wouldn&#x27;t be doing it if it didn&#x27;t work--making the container look like it holds more than it actually does--but most manufactures do the same.  </li>
            <li> it gave my face a healthy glow and actually worked in firming to some degree.  </li>
            <li> I love the exfoliants they use, it helps to open my pores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have tried many different skin care lines, from the drugstore brands to on-line or department store products.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin overall better condition.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin when I first used the product.  </li>
            <li> It is economical and makes my skin feel really hydrated without the greasy look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I also have to admit that I have not faithfully used this product every day - I often miss weekends - and I have been mostly using it only once a day when I do use it.  </li>
            <li> Caused break-outs after the first use.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Garnier!</li>
            <li> The product delivers exactly as it states.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered it twice, love it, everybody is being commenting on how I look younger....</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement in my neck, but my face is really responding very fast.</li>
            <li> more water, very little separated cream, and an extremely strong rancid odor.    </li>
            <li> Younger women can get a great jump start on preventing wrinkles and sagging as you can actually feel a slight tightening effect post application and women with a bit more age and wisdom will no doubt see diminished wrinkles with prolonged use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long but love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to do a good review</li>
            <li> This site was clear, concise and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The fine lines have all but disappeared under my eyes and the deeper lines that I have had for decades were noticeably smaller after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> She says this really does the job.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES</li>
            <li> but if you put too much you can see the grit start to ball up</li>
            <li> Worth a try if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried this was because I received free samples for a seven day trial.   </li>
            <li> ; water spilled out when I opened it; and there was a very rancid odor.  </li>
            <li> but then what would the cosmetic surgeons do if there really was a miracle product out there.  </li>
            <li> so I would really need a miracle product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead I really like Olay ProX firming cream.</li>
            <li> and you skin really does feel noticeably softer and smoother</li>
            <li> not a bad product would recommend to friend a lttle more greasy the what I usually purchase wont purchase again</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which breaks out in blackheads if a product is too oily -- but this product has been fabulous -- no break outs and no dry skin!  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other brands, it was not greasy and did not make my face break out.</li>
            <li> I paid for new cream!</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed as I read so many good reviews and really wanted to try the product.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years and reccomends it highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have the breakouts, plus the cream lasts a little longer. :-)  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have to return anything</li>
            <li> But for now, I have to say that if you are someone with chemical sensitivities or similar problems, or even if you simply don&#x27;t like strong scents, then skip this product and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found some of the original, and God knows how old or how long it&#x27;s been sitting somewhere, but I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age, but I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones either.</li>
            <li> but I just received a new jar yesterday</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones.</li>
            <li> Really seems to work, the cream does not &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; on your skin, it sinks right in and keeps your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen the results that the other viewers have seen, but I am not disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> ;) 1-2x/day of regular use can make one jar lasts over a month.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> but...&lt;br /&gt;one of my jars was half filled with water, which curdled the cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because the product I bought was old but my first experience with this product appears to have tiny granules in it that you can not see but feel when you put it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and think this is fine for me if used in a small quantity.</li>
            <li> This is by far my FAVORITE anti wrinkle cream, and it is hard to find in stores...</li>
            <li> Woman swore on ponds cold creme  LOL</li>
            <li> at 65 years old I am always searching for something to help my aging skin.</li>
            <li> The result is she went back to this product because she could really see the difference.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> I only look 78 thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> The picture here is NOT the old ultra lift pro.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> No oiliness or greasiness, just soft, supple skin, with no dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li> It absorbs immediately and leaves your skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 51 and have a bit of sagging at my jowls . . .</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to see how my skin retained moisture after using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the cream once so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if this is just the way it separates, but I would NOT buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product did moisturize my skin although I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it lifted it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old.  </li>
            <li> ( temperatures are now much warmer) and it was the same separated product that arrived.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found which works and, at the same time, is absorbed so well that I don&#x27;t have that greasy appearance on my face all day.</li>
            <li> and I think that is the whole purpose behind cosmetics and many skin care items, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick; so I make sure my face is damp before I apply</li>
            <li> jar half full</li>
            <li> The results are more subtle than miraculous, but it&#x27;ll do.  </li>
            <li> I saw one of the reviews saying that even her fine lines were disappearing, but to me, nothing is happening but letting my check bones a little red.</li>
            <li> normally buy only all-natural body care products because I don&#x27;t want to be putting a bunch of chemicals on my body.  </li>
            <li> I did feel my skin was soft and firm the next morning after using this cream, and I feel the price is reasonable and the quality comparable to some in the higher price range.</li>
            <li> The photo represented on the site when I purchased this one was different, so I thought the company had something new.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from other sellers and had very satisfactory results!  </li>
            <li> My skin seriously look different - better - within a week or two of using it, as does my jaw line and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, creamy state and has stayed that way, at least for now.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive the same product as before.  </li>
            <li> The cream was gritty as if it was old.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the really expensive ones, and this one is just as effective and luxurious.</li>
            <li> The Garnier products in the green containers have such a pleasant fresh scent, but this one just stinks.</li>
            <li> but because I wanted to submit a noticeable warning for the few people who might have chemical sensitivities or other problems with strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and so far but have used similar products</li>
            <li> will try the cream again when my cold is completely gone, and hopefully will be able to tolerate the scent without it irritating my sinuses and throat when I&#x27;m healthy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this will last, but I am surprised and amazed at the change.</li>
            <li> I do have dry skin and went back to using the natural skin creams..</li>
            <li> Too much packaging oo little product</li>
            <li> Also, the fragrance really hangs on for a long time -- much longer than a typical cream that would smell for a little while and then fade away -- so if you wear perfume or cologne then the scent of this skin cream would \\&quot;compete\\&quot; with it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably at least good to use it to slow that process down, anyway.  </li>
            <li> a large amount of liquid and very little cream</li>
            <li> with 1-2 times daily use, actually lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this over the counter cream would work very well.  </li>
            <li> If anyone doesn&#x27;t agree after what I wrote they just have not used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, over the course of the evening, I washed my face 3 times with soap and water, and went over it 3 times with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad, hoping to remove the scent.  </li>
            <li> Goes on sort of thick, appears greasy at first, after about 3 to 5 minutes soaks in/dries.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using less makeup now because I look sooo natural and prettier.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this on the shelves at my local stores anymore, so not sure if it has been discontinued completely or just in my area or what.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream so far used a few times</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shelf date or stored improperly for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can still find this cream, I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I cut back to every other day</li>
            <li> You can tell it is microfiber because it sticks to your fingers when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> Some days my face would feel dry by afternoon</li>
            <li> if I could give minus stars, this would rate MINUS TEN!!!</li>
            <li> dumped the water out, and mixed it up, and it is now the same consistency as the other jar, I probably shouldn&#x27;t use it, as it seems to have been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to go through the trouble of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually bought this Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream at a local CVS Pharmacy for my mother, who was not satisfied with what she was using and mentioned wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> I have half a jar left and will get another.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried it for a week and a half and seen no difference.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it only a little over 20 days</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge for a little extra &amp;#34;Zing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous products for firming/moisturizing my face and neck area and this one is right up there with Olay Regenerist&#x27;s Microsculpting Cream, but less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it should not be used on sensitive or broken skin.</li>
            <li> I have gone back and fourth between this and other face creams and decided to stick to this one!!!!</li>
            <li> A little of this cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick, but does not leave a heavy residue on the skin, much to my surprise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and searching for other products to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I did notice some tightening after two weeks but still use LancÃ´me for day due to the SPF protection it offer.</li>
            <li> woman swears on other produts,&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> do recommend using the cream every other day.  </li>
            <li> Only issues I have is it is a little too heavily perfumed and can irritate if you get it too close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> If you do, be VERY careful opening the jar...</li>
            <li> It seems to remove dead skins cells and then after I dry my face</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how dusty the container was, as though it had been sitting on a shelf for a long time, but the cream isn&#x27;t dried out or anything</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued and I have tried to buy up as much as I can.  </li>
            <li> I had a cold, which made my throat and sinuses even more sensitive, and the scent was dramatically worsening my cold symptoms.  </li>
            <li> Feels thick and gritty on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product as represented in this photo previously.  </li>
            <li> Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> but when i put it on i notice less saggy skin</li>
            <li> I also noticed a slight burning feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has helped my wrinkles disappear or not, but I feel like there are less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel hydrated and somewhat tight.</li>
            <li> Often the cost of a product has little to do with quality or effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> so just a little</li>
            <li> After having it on for a while, I noticed my nasal passages and throat were irritated, my throat felt a little sore and I kept coughing.  </li>
            <li> (The replacement by Garnier [a green bottle that says ULTRA-LIFT ANTI-WRINKLE NIGHT CREAM] does not to work as well for me.)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Ultra Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> No effect for me, beyond being a somewhat heavy moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few months before I bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When I began using it, I used it everyday</li>
            <li> Will reserve judgement until a few weeks have passed.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few weeks ago and when I opened it up it was separated and had an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
            <li> There is no strong odor and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> With smiling, at least the wrinkles your face gets are going up rather than down!</li>
            <li> What it usually has to do with is what the company spends on advertising, on the packaging, and on servicing its debt.  </li>
            <li> The jars were open, one of the three creams that came in a package looked stale and changed texture.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how to upload it.</li>
            <li> That was odd!!</li>
            <li> the smell is hardly there.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting results for at least a week (if any)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Despite what the manufacturer claims, it can clog the pores -- at least it did mine</li>
            <li> I thought it might had happened due to our very cold temperatures outside and caused the cream to freeze</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star not because it&#x27;s a bad product</li>
            <li> This cream was either a fake, past</li>
            <li> The first product was horrible...</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i dont have to wear blush no more !!</li>
            <li> The seller sent a replacement that was even WORSE...</li>
            <li> Non Greasy and Non Irritating.  </li>
            <li> When tried to mix it just decreased the amount of cream in the jar.</li>
            <li> I was not happy and returned for refund</li>
            <li> is!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using VERY EXPENSIVE products, but this one beats them all, hands down!</li>
            <li> I use other Garnier products and have not been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time buying from Get It Wholesale!!!!    </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m skeptical and often amused and bemused at manufactures&#x27; claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may just be all in my head, like a placebo effect, but I like it and feel weird when I forget and miss a day.</li>
            <li> While I had it on my face, I was unable to smell anything else at all.</li>
            <li> so it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my cold was gone, Itried the cream</li>
            <li> BUT THEY SENT ME A REALLY BAD ONE.</li>
            <li> , they were bad.  </li>
            <li> Was this just a bad jar or a  bad supplier?</li>
            <li> The cream is out of date and has gode bad.</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed that they have discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I have not found a comparable cream. :(</li>
            <li> Hate this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the odor was terrible</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AWFUL</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a lot of improvement, but gravity wasn&#x27;t beating me up miserably -- yet --</li>
            <li> This is disgusting!</li>
            <li> This product got here and was just DISGUSTING!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not a bad product would recommend to friend a lttle more greasy the what I usually purchase wont purchase again</li>
            <li> great Product- had to use befpore reviewed</li>
            <li> at 65 years old I am always searching for something to help my aging skin. Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream has been one of the best I have found so far</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing glamorous or special about this Ultra-Lift Pro Cream. After 3 months of use, it doesn&#x27;t appear to work any better than your normal moisturizer. What&#x27;s more, it appears to even clog pores, so watch out. I give it only two stars because it doesn&#x27;t appear to do what it claims to.</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it does a great job without being greasy. Unfortunately it has been discontinued and I have tried to buy up as much as I can.  It does NOT have retinal and is,safe to use,around the eyes.  Other Garnier products are not as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream at a local CVS Pharmacy for my mother, who was not satisfied with what she was using and mentioned wanted to try something else. I saw an ad for this in a magazine and decided to get it for her. Well, she couldn&#x27;t be happier. She used it for a couple of weeks, then stopped using it for about a week to use something else that my sister, who was visiting, gave her to use. The result is she went back to this product because she could really see the difference. She says this really does the job. In fact, I will be trying it myself. This looks like a good price from Amazon, but check your local stores to be sure. The final verdict on Garnier Ultra-Lift Pro Cream is Thumbs Up!</li>
            <li> Awesome the best creams out there</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME TRYING BUT SO FAR I  LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Garnier has discontinued this product (Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity-Defying Cream) and I wanted to get several bottles before the supply was depleted. As long as I use it in the morning and at night every day, the wrinkles in my neck and chin are greatly reduced. My only issue is that most of these remaining bottles must be older stock because they come with the cream separated so there is \\&quot;water\\&quot; at the top and the cream looks \\&quot;curdled.\\&quot;  I actually mixed it up for about 3 minutes and it came back to it&#x27;s smooth, creamy state and has stayed that way, at least for now. There is no strong odor and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. (The replacement by Garnier [a green bottle that says ULTRA-LIFT ANTI-WRINKLE NIGHT CREAM] does not to work as well for me.)</li>
            <li> I only look 78 thanks to this product. My wrinkles are nice and smooth and my cheeks are sagging less.</li>
            <li> Used for ever.  Bummed that they discont&#x27;d it.  I&#x27;ve been using it and searching for other products to replace it.  Did find Body Berry&#x27;s Neck firming &amp; tightening cream which I&#x27;m very happy with.</li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure, I worked in advertising--mostly food and wine--for decades.  So, I didn&#x27;t just fall off the turnip truck.  (Turnip farmers I apologize.)  Often the cost of a product has little to do with quality or effectiveness.  What it usually has to do with is what the company spends on advertising, on the packaging, and on servicing its debt.  So, I&#x27;m skeptical and often amused and bemused at manufactures&#x27; claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far this product seems fine for me.  It&#x27;s a bit thick; so I make sure my face is damp before I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier, you wouldn&#x27;t be doing it if it didn&#x27;t work--making the container look like it holds more than it actually does--but most manufactures do the same.  I&#x27;m bemused by the name, ...Ultra-Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream....  Does the cream defy gravity or what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it seems to make my skin softer and hold moisture better.  Will get back to you if something defies gravity.</li>
            <li> I have been using this neck cream for the last year. I use it everyday and I think it does a wonderful job of keeping my neck moisturized. It is affordable too.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize very well. Only issues I have is it is a little too heavily perfumed and can irritate if you get it too close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product smells really great. I have been using it for months. The only problem is that it should not be used on sensitive or broken skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen the results that the other viewers have seen, but I am not disappointed in this product.  It does make my skin feel hydrated and somewhat tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product as represented in this photo previously.  It&#x27;s better for me as a night cream, because it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I prefer for use under make-up.  The photo represented on the site when I purchased this one was different, so I thought the company had something new.  I was surprised to receive the same product as before.  Kept it, though, because it&#x27;s a good cream for the price.  The scent is clean, very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it at my local store one day because they ran out.  Yeah, this stuff is my favorite treat for my face.  My skin seriously look different - better - within a week or two of using it, as does my jaw line and under my eyes.  I use it for day and night cream.</li>
            <li> It softened my skin was very good how it made my face feel.  I think I had ordered this in 2012.  But I stopped using it because it contained a chemical called parabens.</li>
            <li> The jars were open, one of the three creams that came in a package looked stale and changed texture. The Garnier Ultra-lift cream itself is good, but I will never order facial cream this way.</li>
            <li> Cheaper price than if you get it from your local stores. No adverse skin reactions. Smooth cream, no need for additional moisturizer this winter ;) 1-2x/day of regular use can make one jar lasts over a month. But hey, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The picture here is NOT the old ultra lift pro.  I loved the old stuff...it gave my face a healthy glow and actually worked in firming to some degree.  I found some of the original, and God knows how old or how long it&#x27;s been sitting somewhere, but I decided to try it.  If you do, be VERY careful opening the jar...the contents might have separated ... but I just gave it a good stirring and then put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed this product before.  The package was ripped when it arrived.  The jar had no plastic around it and when the cover was removed, there was no protective (plastic) cap on the cream.  I can&#x27;t comment on the actual product because I was hesitant to use it.</li>
            <li> to greasy and made my skin break out...and i am way over 50.  never had a reaction like this with any product and i think i have used everything out there.  best i have used is bare minerals moisturizer and will continue to use and not try anything new again</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels and it would be really nice if Garnier continued making it.&lt;br /&gt;However, this cream has been discontinued and if you check the LOT online, you&#x27;ll see that it is indeed expired.&lt;br /&gt;I still ended up buying a couple more, and after receiving them, they seem the same and still good to go, ... but that would be my last order, unless they start making them again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. I DO LOVE THIS FACE CREAM. IT REALLY DOES THE JOB. BUT THEY SENT ME A REALLY BAD ONE. JUST SEE THE PICTURE. NO WORDS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> I think for the price, this is a super-rich and effective night cream. I have tried all the really expensive ones, and this one is just as effective and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I spend a fortune on LancÃ´me products and this won&#x27;t replace it but it is certainly a good value for the price.  I did notice some tightening after two weeks but still use LancÃ´me for day due to the SPF protection it offer. This is good for a night cream.  Save some $$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use a day cream because, quite frankly, I don&#x27;t like going to work with a greasy looking face. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found which works and, at the same time, is absorbed so well that I don&#x27;t have that greasy appearance on my face all day. Like other Garnier face creams, it smells really good and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very gritty and couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my face.  It felt more like a cleanser, not a lotion.</li>
            <li> When I received the cream it seemed to be leaking water. When I opened the package it was separated, clumpy and sitting in a pool of oil. I need to return it however that is incovenient, just don&#x27;t have the time to go to UPS. Was really disappointed as I read so many good reviews and really wanted to try the product. Guess I will try to purchase it from a local store. I normally don&#x27;t have to return anything so it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 jars. This is by far my FAVORITE anti wrinkle cream, and it is hard to find in stores... but...&lt;br /&gt;one of my jars was half filled with water, which curdled the cream. At first I thought it was some kind of frost damage,&lt;br /&gt;I dumped the water out, and mixed it up, and it is now the same consistency as the other jar, I probably shouldn&#x27;t use it, as it seems to have been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to go through the trouble of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just want to warn people of what can happen ordering online.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest disapointment you can imagine, when I opened the jar, most of the cream was gone, there was nothing there but a large amount of liquid and very little cream, I tried to mix it, thinking it would help, not so and the odor was terrible, I would never buy this product again.I would not recomend anyone trying this product. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL</li>
            <li> I like this cream so far used a few times but i do see what people say about the gritty feeling .This has some sort of powder or crystals in it but its not like you can see it.Once you put the cream on you wont notice but if you put too much you can see the grit start to ball up so just a little and you should be good.I have sensitive and acne prone skin and i didnt break out and the smell is hardly there.I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Garner ultra lift feels great on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it that long but love the feel of it. My face feels younger.</li>
            <li> The cream was gritty as if it was old.  It was not creamy nor did it go on the skin smoothly.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years and reccomends it highly. She is 77 y.o. and is constantly getting compliments on how well she looks.</li>
            <li> 100percent like this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it only a little over 20 days and I notice that even under my eyes, the wrinkles are disappearing.  I use a microfiber cloth to wash my face with.  You can tell it is microfiber because it sticks to your fingers when it is dry.  You can buy them just about anywhere.  I wash my face with dove soap and water with the cloth.  Rinse of course.  It seems to remove dead skins cells and then after I dry my face I apply the Garnier to my skin.  That along with this product is amazing.  It has done wonders to my face and my wrinkles are fading away.  I see a lot of products on tv for your skin on infomercials and thought maybe I would have to try one of those but the way this works I doubt I will want to.  It helps to give a lift and I notice that my cheeks are even lifted.  This only for just 20 days.  I have half a jar left and will get another.  I think it is wonderful and smells pretty good.  Very light and makes your face have a dewy glow.  If anyone doesn&#x27;t agree after what I wrote they just have not used it long enough.  Though I did buy it at a pharmacy.  Buying it here is about the same as what I paid for it even with shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using Garnier Ultra Lift Pro Gravity Defying Cream for a few months now.  I think there is definitely a difference in my appearance.  My skin is smoother and tighter than it was before.</li>
            <li> i loved this cream, it feels so good, doesnÂ´t feel oily or greasy, i feel my skin tighter and smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it. i totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> These cream is silky and refreshing. I love the exfoliants they use, it helps to open my pores so I get the full effect of the lotion.</li>
            <li> this cream is great works well on my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I use everyday. I&#x27;ll use under my makeup and sometimes at night after a wash my face. It goes on light without a clumpy feeling. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No effect for me, beyond being a somewhat heavy moisturizing cream.  I&#x27;ll use it up because it&#x27;s on my bathroom counter, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream! I was about to spend $120 on a cream I liked and tried from  birch box. I&#x27;m a 26 Californian and have skin that goes through huge changes when the weather changes. The cream is magic!</li>
            <li> I like Garnier products in general and this was a good price so I went for it.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a lot of improvement, but gravity wasn&#x27;t beating me up miserably -- yet -- so it&#x27;s probably at least good to use it to slow that process down, anyway.  I was surprised at how dusty the container was, as though it had been sitting on a shelf for a long time, but the cream isn&#x27;t dried out or anything and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> This smells and feels absolutely fantastic.  It&#x27;s perfect.  No oiliness or greasiness, just soft, supple skin, with no dryness or flaking.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference. I saw one of the reviews saying that even her fine lines were disappearing, but to me, nothing is happening but letting my check bones a little red. It is also oily, so it gave me acne after 12 days wearing it.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day. Morning and night and I do feel like it refreshens my face and makes it feel cleaner. It may just be all in my head, like a placebo effect, but I like it and feel weird when I forget and miss a day.</li>
            <li> This lotion came in this afternoon and I was very excited to try it! I opened up the box and took the lid off just to have liquid pour out onto my carpet and arm. The lotion look like it has been separated. It&#x27;s clumpy and has like an oil mixed in. I took a photo but I&#x27;m not sure how to upload it. If I figure it out, then I will! This is disgusting!</li>
            <li> Very grainy, not smooth.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to do a good review however I use Garnier products, it is my experience that they do not disappoint !!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and after trying many very expensive skin treatment products, I am finding Garnier products do as good a job as the really pricey ones. Skin that holds moisture looks less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> This cream was either a fake, past it&#x27;s shelf date or stored improperly for a long time.  It took me a week of using the cream before I realized that the texture and smell were not just different, they were bad.  I tossed it.  Was this just a bad jar or a  bad supplier?</li>
            <li> Good product but it did cause a rash. Probably because I am allergic to most products. Worth a try if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just Great on my skin, notice improvements, and makeup glides great on top of skin.  I find myself using less makeup now because I look sooo natural and prettier. Yes I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have tried many different skin care lines, from the drugstore brands to on-line or department store products. The only reason I tried this was because I received free samples for a seven day trial.   WOW! The fine lines have all but disappeared under my eyes and the deeper lines that I have had for decades were noticeably smaller after a couple of weeks. Unlike many other brands, it was not greasy and did not make my face break out. It absorbs immediately and leaves your skin soft and not oily. It is much more effective than I anticipated, and certainly cheaper than anything I used previously.</li>
            <li> Everybody noticed visible results after using this cream.</li>
            <li> very nice feel, not greasy, no annoying smell. with 1-2 times daily use, actually lasted a long time. recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have been using it for years. This site was clear, concise and easy to use. I got a confirmation and a &amp;#34;shipped&amp;#34; notice right away. This seller is  bookmarked by me.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin overall better condition.</li>
            <li> This is a much better deal than buying it from the drug store.  I like this cream and it is priced right here.</li>
            <li> The first product was horrible... jar half full; water spilled out when I opened it; and there was a very rancid odor.  The seller sent a replacement that was even WORSE... more water, very little separated cream, and an extremely strong rancid odor.    I have purchased this product from other sellers and had very satisfactory results!  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time buying from Get It Wholesale!!!!    I gave only one star... if I could give minus stars, this would rate MINUS TEN!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I am SO disappointed that they have discontinued it. I don&#x27;t know what I will do when I can&#x27;t get it on Amazon anymore. I keep it in the fridge for a little extra &amp;#34;Zing&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age, but I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones either. My skin tends to be oily, and this cream is perfect for me. I have not found a comparable cream. :(</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. I noticed a difference in my skin when I first used the product.  It is economical and makes my skin feel really hydrated without the greasy look &amp; feel.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time yesterday. Was not expecting results for at least a week (if any)...But to my amazement; After only applying it twice(morning and evening yesterday),I woke to a firmer, smoother face. I don&#x27;t know how long this will last, but I am surprised and amazed at the change. It has firmed my jaw line and cheeks!! Wow! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens to my neckline. I have not noticed any improvement in my neck, but my face is really responding very fast. I normally don&#x27;t review products, but just had to pass this along to others looking for that perfect product...Here it is!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using VERY EXPENSIVE products, but this one beats them all, hands down! If I had known I would have taken before and after pix.</li>
            <li> this is a great lotion and you do see results but my only concern is sometimes i leave my face a bit red and a bit oily but when i put it on i notice less saggy skin i guess it does work better in some areas than others but cant complain its pretty good.</li>
            <li> Considering this isn&#x27;t a $100 face cream or exclusively sold at department stores and boutiques you can&#x27;t pronounce it&#x27;s WONDERFUL. Younger women can get a great jump start on preventing wrinkles and sagging as you can actually feel a slight tightening effect post application and women with a bit more age and wisdom will no doubt see diminished wrinkles with prolonged use. It&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs quickly and smells very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for quite a while and love it! It goes on ver smoothly, non greasy and gives you an instand glow. My skin looks dewy and softer every time I use it. I used to pay 15+ at Target for this...so I am very happy about the Amazon price. I have gone back and fourth between this and other face creams and decided to stick to this one!!!! The best!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 51 and have a bit of sagging at my jowls . . . not overly pronounced yet.  This product makes my skin appear a bit firmer.  Someone else commented that the smell is very strong, and that they&#x27;d washed their face several times, but could still smell it.  That isn&#x27;t my experience, and it doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  I also have to admit that I have not faithfully used this product every day - I often miss weekends - and I have been mostly using it only once a day when I do use it.  The results are more subtle than miraculous, but it&#x27;ll do.  Who knows?  Perhaps it will help prevent further sagging for awhile.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried it and it was ok.  I can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference in my skin and didn&#x27;t like the way my makeup went on over it..  It didn&#x27;t impress me enough to buy again.  I do have dry skin and went back to using the natural skin creams..</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale so I decided to give it a try - as a skin cream it seems fine - however I used up a whole bottle and there were no visible signs of lifting the skin as advertised - unless the lift is microscopic - and if so who cares - I want lift that I can see - so then I tried Walmart&#x27;s own brand for $5.00 and I like it better - now I am sure there still will be no visible lifting with this product either - but then what would the cosmetic surgeons do if there really was a miracle product out there.  In all fairness I am 67 so I would really need a miracle product.  Anyway I mix this with Now Almond Oil on Amazon for about $10.00 for 16 oz. This does a better job of moisturizing and saves money to boot. I also mix almond oil with body lotions for better hydration.</li>
            <li> Caused break-outs after the first use. I guess it makes a good body moisturizer. Waste of money. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on sort of thick, appears greasy at first, after about 3 to 5 minutes soaks in/dries.  I&#x27;m a man and and don&#x27;t have a lot of facial cream experience, yet this one does help reduce wrinkle appearance, I think.  For the price (under $10) a worthwhile product.</li>
            <li> Good product, works!  Just as good or better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried! Is my favorite! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift originally.  I was really surprised to see how my skin retained moisture after using.  It goes on a little thick, but does not leave a heavy residue on the skin, much to my surprise.  I have very sensitive skin which breaks out in blackheads if a product is too oily -- but this product has been fabulous -- no break outs and no dry skin!  Thanks, Garnier!</li>
            <li> I have not use it yet,but it seems good</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever used.  Non Greasy and Non Irritating.  Plus it really does give your jaw line a lift!!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I gave it to my mom. Nothing special to her either, just another moisturizer. Good for hands if nothing else.</li>
            <li> Too much packaging oo little product</li>
            <li> The product  was rotten and seller gave money back to me. ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few months before I bought on Amazon.  It works as well as it says it does.  I noticed a difference in my skins right away.</li>
            <li> Love this product, good texture and works on fine lines. Product was delivered in good shape and the price was excellent, a definite savings from the store.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this over the counter cream would work very well.  It is the best cream I have ever used for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for giving a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; to the skin. I use it only on my neck now. Very thick. Don&#x27;t need a lot. Too strong for my face, although I have used as a touch up on the eye lid area. I was hoping more for a moisturizer feel to it.</li>
            <li> Feels thick and gritty on my face. Hate this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I really like Olay ProX firming cream. It&#x27;s much more smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> Bless your aging skin with this product!  It is a perfect option for those not being able to afford - or not wanting to have - face lifts.</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star not because it&#x27;s a bad product but because I wanted to submit a noticeable warning for the few people who might have chemical sensitivities or other problems with strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy only all-natural body care products because I don&#x27;t want to be putting a bunch of chemicals on my body.  In this case, I went ahead because my wrinkles have been bothering me and I wanted to try this promising-looking product with excellent reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the cream once so far.  I put it on my face and right away noticed that it has a strong but not unpleasant scent.  The cream felt really good on my skin -- just the right amount of moisture and it absorbed very well.  I could actually say *too* well, because here&#x27;s what happened next.  I expected the scent to wear off, but instead it became more and more noticeable to me.  I had a cold, which made my throat and sinuses even more sensitive, and the scent was dramatically worsening my cold symptoms.  I decided to wash off the cream.  Long story short, over the course of the evening, I washed my face 3 times with soap and water, and went over it 3 times with an alcohol-soaked cotton pad, hoping to remove the scent.  I also applied an unscented lotion twice to try to dilute the scent that was absorbed into my skin.  Even after all of that, the scent still lingered strongly and continued to make my symptoms worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer, because I really wanted to love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the cream again when my cold is completely gone, and hopefully will be able to tolerate the scent without it irritating my sinuses and throat when I&#x27;m healthy.  Based on how that goes, I might modify my review.  But for now, I have to say that if you are someone with chemical sensitivities or similar problems, or even if you simply don&#x27;t like strong scents, then skip this product and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my cold was gone, Itried the cream one more time so see if I could tolerate it without the pre-existing symptoms.  After having it on for a while, I noticed my nasal passages and throat were irritated, my throat felt a little sore and I kept coughing.  I also noticed a slight burning feeling on my face.  I would not recommend this product to anyone with chemical sensitivities or who is bothered by strrong synthetic fragrances.  Also, the fragrance really hangs on for a long time -- much longer than a typical cream that would smell for a little while and then fade away -- so if you wear perfume or cologne then the scent of this skin cream would \\&quot;compete\\&quot; with it.  While I had it on my face, I was unable to smell anything else at all.</li>
            <li> I like this okay but I am not seeing it as such a &#x27;GREAT&#x27; thing that I am going to want to use all the time.</li>
            <li> As I said Gardiner has great products.I recommend this is if y outlook are looking for great skin it makes you face feel silky.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IS A GOOD PRODUCT , AND THA IS WHY A BOUGHT IT HOPE IT GOOD</li>
            <li> I love it myself.... But...........&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONES SKIN IS DIFFRENT...&lt;br /&gt;LIKE MEDICATIONS, EVERYONE CANT TAKE THE SAME MEDICATION RIGHT?&lt;br /&gt;ANYHOW,&lt;br /&gt;sorry  For caps.&lt;br /&gt;What will work for one person,  may not work for others!!&lt;br /&gt;To me,&lt;br /&gt;It gives my cheesks a glow&lt;br /&gt;i dont have to wear blush no more !!&lt;br /&gt;It tightens a wee bit.&lt;br /&gt;but u have t wear it EVERY day &amp; don&#x27;t give up !!!&lt;br /&gt;But Again.........&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone can tolerate this,&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone likes it........&lt;br /&gt;Were all different........&lt;br /&gt;Some  Woman swore on ponds cold creme  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Some woman swears on other produts,&lt;br /&gt;Its all what ever your Skin likes !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because the product I bought was old but my first experience with this product appears to have tiny granules in it that you can not see but feel when you put it on your skin.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous products for firming/moisturizing my face and neck area and this one is right up there with Olay Regenerist&#x27;s Microsculpting Cream, but less expensive.  It it light, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant fragrance, and seems to be firming my skin and reducing wrinkles.  Two thumbs up for me!</li>
            <li> This product got here and was just DISGUSTING!!!  The liquid inside had separated and what was left was a gross wad of lotion floating in some type of grease.  I don&#x27;t know if the product was old or if this is just the way it separates, but I would NOT buy this product again. I just threw it in the trash!</li>
            <li> Most of it was old and unusable.</li>
            <li> Received item and it was full of water. When tried to mix it just decreased the amount of cream in the jar. I was not happy and returned for refund</li>
            <li> I used this cream for 2 months to see if I&#x27;d like a drugstore brand &amp; chose this one.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of different moisturizers and found the Ultra-Lift to be OK, but nothing special.  Some days my face would feel dry by afternoon &amp; I&#x27;d apply it a second time -- not convenient for me.</li>
            <li> Wanted to keep the skin around my eyes from drying during the winter but didn&#x27;t care for lotions or oils which only irritated my eyes, the Garnier Ultra lift did the job and it keeps the wrinkles away too.</li>
            <li> Its ok but would not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  The product delivers exactly as it states.  Great product, great manufacturer. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product did moisturize my skin although I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say it lifted it.  I cannot recommend this product until they change the offensive scent.  It is very strong and perfumy.  The Garnier products in the green containers have such a pleasant fresh scent, but this one just stinks.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this on the shelves at my local stores anymore, so not sure if it has been discontinued completely or just in my area or what.  I was so happy to find that Amazon still has it through it&#x27;s sellers, so I bought several jars of it!  Really seems to work, the cream does not &amp;#34;lay&amp;#34; on your skin, it sinks right in and keeps your skin very soft.  I also notice more firmness in the jowel/jaw area which is fantastic!  As long as I can still find this cream, I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> A little of this cream goes a long way. I was concerned that it would be too greasy, but for night time use, it is not. I have normal to oily skin and think this is fine for me if used in a small quantity. I did feel my skin was soft and firm the next morning after using this cream, and I feel the price is reasonable and the quality comparable to some in the higher price range. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> great cream high in vitamin c</li>
            <li> I bought a jar of this cream for my wife at the supermarket.  She loved it so much she insisted I buy her more.  It is one of the best buys out there that actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 6 months.  I&#x27;m 60 years old.  I don&#x27;t know if it has helped my wrinkles disappear or not, but I feel like there are less wrinkles.  Using the cream makes me feel better and I think that is the whole purpose behind cosmetics and many skin care items, isn&#x27;t it? A psychological effect rather than an actual physical one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend using the cream every other day.  Despite what the manufacturer claims, it can clog the pores -- at least it did mine and I apply it lightly.  When I began using it, I used it everyday then noticed my skin breaking out with tiny white heads here and there.  I cut back to every other day and I no longer have the breakouts, plus the cream lasts a little longer. :-)  I also recommend exercising,drinking lots of water, and smiling.  That helps the face too!  With smiling, at least the wrinkles your face gets are going up rather than down!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence of lift but perhaps I am being hasty.  I have only tried it for a week and a half and seen no difference.  It is soft and makes my skin feel good.  Will reserve judgement until a few weeks have passed.</li>
            <li> great product especially when used at night really softens my skin and tightens out my neck. Garnier has really come out with a good product.</li>
            <li> I love it and I ordered it twice, love it, everybody is being commenting on how I look younger....Love it...</li>
            <li> I washed my face and put on the cream and my face feels fresh and clean. So far I love the way it makes my face feel. I have only used it once and so far but have used similar products and I can feel confident in this product. I use other Garnier products and have not been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> The contained was opened before. I paid for new cream! That was odd!!</li>
            <li> It is an okay under makeup moisturizer, but I can&#x27;t say that I notice any difference I the &amp;#34;ultra-lift claim&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order from this seller. The cream is out of date and has gode bad. I bought one a few weeks ago and when I opened it up it was separated and had an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell to it. I thought it might had happened due to our very cold temperatures outside and caused the cream to freeze but I just received a new jar yesterday ( temperatures are now much warmer) and it was the same separated product that arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily it&#x27;s easy to return.</li>
            <li> This product smells, great.  When I apply it I can feel the thickness of the cream and you skin really does feel noticeably softer and smoother and my people can tell when I Skype them that my face looks better.  I can&#x27;t explain it but its working.  I use this product 3 timesa day rather then just 2 beucase I&#x27;m in Afghanistan.  No outbreaks, my face feels and looks great.</li>
