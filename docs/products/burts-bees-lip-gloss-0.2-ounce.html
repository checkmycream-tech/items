    <ol>
            <li>The thing I like best about this lip gloss is the color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost nude as the photo shows but also with a very nice shimmer.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product and intend on looking for more colors.roduct, and decide for yourself if it will work for you.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product and intend on looking for more colors.</li>
            <li>I spend a fair amount of money on toiletries and Burt&#x27;s is a product that gives a good return on my money.  </li>
            <li>The tube is sturdy with a good seal.</li>
            <li>While \\&quot;Autumn Haze\\&quot; is a good color, she prefers \\&quot;Ocean</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the color of this gloss.</li>
            <li>There is a nice hint of color and it stays put for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>color of this product is nice.</li>
            <li>While I had it on, I felt like it did a nice job of highlighting my lips without screaming that I was wearing lip</li>
            <li>/&gt;While wearing it, I kept noticing a warm vanilla scent, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out where it was coming from.</li>
            <li>For those reasons I would not purchase this on my own.</li>
            <li>Sunrise\\&quot; but that&#x27;s a matter of your own color palette.  </li>
            <li>a comparison, I have a couple of the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms, and I like the feel of those better than this product, but I still think this is a nice product.</li>
            <li>am so happy to say that for me, it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is it beautiful, but Burt&#x27;s Bees is good for your lips.  </li>
            <li>This is a light, natural looking gloss that is perfect for a neutral look.  </li>
            <li>It lasts about 2-3 hours or until you eat which is better</li>
            <li>then most lip glosses.</li>
            <li>but I would compare its quality more to a lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love [[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm ]]</li>
            <li>do like the color, and the tube is cute, but I can safely say that I will not be buying Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss ...</li>
            <li>Although I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I think there are better lip glosses out there.</li>
            <li>have been using the Buxom Lips and love the texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product is okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This is an okay product but not one I&#x27;ll be rushing out to buy before I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this gloss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Bert&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm</li>
            <li>I liked this when I originally put it on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel of the product was pretty good too.</li>
            <li>It looked more like a shimmering nude color when I put on, with bits of golden sparkle, and I liked all that.</li>
            <li>Really great, natural looking shine.</li>
            <li>Still, even without making other comparisons, she is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Smell/taste is fine, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s a great substitute for lipstick.</li>
            <li>gloss is a bit sticky--it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling smooth but rather stuck together.</li>
            <li>However, the more I use it, the more I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I would put this one somewhere in the middle of the pack, and that&#x27;s pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Lip Gloss is nice enough, but I will stick with my Buxom Lip Gloss(I love the tingle).</li>
            <li>This was a plus for me, as lip color sometimes has a very strange, chemical smell to it, so it was nice to wear something that smells more like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too greasy no vivid lip color for every day but good protection and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous (a little darker than what appears in the photo) and works wonderfully on its own, or mixed with another color (I often use this one in conjunction with darker or starker lip colors to neutralize, since my lips are a few shades darker than this</li>
            <li>gloss.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chronically dry or flaky lips, but this product solves that problem better than many of the chapsticks and balms that I&#x27;ve tried (and this includes some of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the autumn haze shade which went really well with my fair skin and red hair.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t checked out any of the other colors yet and tried this one color, as it was available to me through the Amazon Vine Program, in that I am able to choose a couple of items ranging from food to books per month, and this item was free to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not run and it seems to dispense just the right amount.</li>
            <li>She reports that this is an ideal lip gloss and sites as a strength exactly what some others have sited as its primary weakness--it is very subtle.  </li>
            <li>Although the photo and the Autumn Haze name hint at a golden tone, this lip gloss actually has more of a pinkish hue to it.</li>
            <li>To me, natural products are ones that I can pronounce and easily identify.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s not slick, it goes on smoothly with its sponge-like applicator.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will be fine in the summer, but it&#x27;s not so great in the winter and could be painful on chapped lips.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this gloss</li>
            <li>because it is now my first choice.  </li>
            <li>, I felt like I needed to reapply, and my lips were drier than they were when I first put the gloss</li>
            <li>Bees products have been a hit or miss for me in the past, but this is a definite win!</li>
            <li>The brush had an angled tip making application easy (although it does take several applications to get</li>
            <li>This is an okay lip gloss, but when my lips are chapped and dry I am looking for something to resolve the issue.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long--within 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I got this lip gloss as I really like the brand as a whole.  </li>
            <li>And it really seemed to help my chapped lips that happen every winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, natural look and feel; and while some lip-glosses may actually zap moisture from your lips, that is not the case with this gloss.</li>
            <li>The color is lovely but given my other qualms this gloss seems pricey at almost twelve dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also at about half the price of this lipgloss I think it&#x27;s a better deal.)</li>
            <li>The color&#x27;s nice (I think, at least), but she says the product itself is very sticky when it comes out of the container.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much color to it - although I can definitely see the beige-ish tone when I put it on - and it had a nice shiny appearance.  </li>
            <li>The Autumn Haze color was light, almost nude, with a little shimmer; a nice everyday</li>
            <li>The gloss is much thicker than some I&#x27;ve used--perhaps because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear lip gloss</li>
            <li>so maybe this is normal.</li>
            <li>This is an ok lip gloss, not bad but not great</li>
            <li>It also goes on very thin--in order to have the color show up (a color I really like, by the way), you have to put several coats on.</li>
            <li>main concern with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss is its 100% natural contention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container and applicator are pretty standard.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not a slick gloss as one might be accustomed to.  </li>
            <li>: It is a bit sticky or tacky at first and does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but as I mentioned, I have really liked the quality of many of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have bought and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about lip color in particular, as I generally don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even put it on and deliberately was very careful not to lick my lips, and it still disappeared quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very neutral color, but not just sheer or nude.</li>
            <li>It does make my lips feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>in NO WAY affects my review of any product; I just tell it like it is, and what my experience with the product has been, to try to help all of us on tighter budgets to not waste money on junk.  </li>
            <li>Those may be natural, but they&#x27;re a mouthful</li>
            <li>It is in that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>product is definitely a decent size, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>She also really likes the natural ingredients in Burt&#x27;s Bees products generally and that is an advantage here over other brands.  </li>
            <li>This lips gloss goes on very thick, needing more than one application to cover your lips.  </li>
            <li>I do like that it didn&#x27;t really add much color to my lips but leaves them a little big glossy.</li>
            <li>The finish is barely shiny with the faintest shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Its consistency is medium, maybe somewhere close to that of Bare Escentuals Buxom</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much other Amazon customers have helped ME make a decision on an item, good or bad, and I really feel that there is a lot of integrity in the reviews by an Amazon customer.  </li>

            <li> This is a light, natural looking gloss that is perfect for a neutral look.  There is a nice hint of color and it stays put for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I spend a fair amount of money on toiletries and Burt&#x27;s is a product that gives a good return on my money.  Not too greasy no vivid lip color for every day but good protection and moisturizing.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I got the autumn haze shade which went really well with my fair skin and red hair. It&#x27;s slightly darker then a nude shade with a little extra gloss and shimmer. It has no particular taste or fragrance. It lasts about 2-3 hours or until you eat which is better then most lip glosses. The price may seem a little high for a gloss but I would compare its quality more to a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the color of this gloss. It&#x27;s almost nude as the photo shows but also with a very nice shimmer. The effect in my lips is subtle which I prefer and I like the sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container and applicator are pretty standard. The gloss is much thicker than some I&#x27;ve used--perhaps because it is all natural. Also for just a second I got the scent of the gloss (a waxy smell) while I applied it. The scent diminished after. Because it is thick it does take a couple of coats to get an even coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on my lips but the waxy smell whenever I purse my lips and the thick texture are a turn off. The color is lovely but given my other qualms this gloss seems pricey at almost twelve dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I also just bought Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balm. It&#x27;s essentially colored Chapstick and the texture and color are a lot better--darker and smoother but without a shimmer. Also at about half the price of this lipgloss I think it&#x27;s a better deal.)</li>
            <li> When I first tried this gloss I was a bit disappointed, only because I was hoping it would be similar to most other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products which have a bit of a eucalyptus tingly sort of feel.  This gloss does not.  Also, it&#x27;s not a slick gloss as one might be accustomed to.  However, the more I use it, the more I really like it.  The finish is barely shiny with the faintest shimmer.  It has a lovely, natural look and feel; and while some lip-glosses may actually zap moisture from your lips, that is not the case with this gloss. This has come to be the gloss I&#x27;ll fish around for in my purse until I find it (I&#x27;m a lip moisturizer junkie and have several floating in there at any given time) because it is now my first choice.  Really great, natural looking shine. I love it!</li>
            <li> The thing I like best about this lip gloss is the color.  Autumn Haze is a subtle, neutral shade that enhances your natural lip color but never overpowers.  But those who prefer to make a bolder statement are in luck too because this gloss comes in 11 other shades ranging from the neutrals like Autumn Haze to pinks, reds and plums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it beautiful, but Burt&#x27;s Bees is good for your lips.  The list of ingredients includes sunflower oil, castor seed oil, beeswax, olive fruit oil and jojoba esters, all of which are designed to combine with other nutrients to keep your lips soft and well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not slick, it goes on smoothly with its sponge-like applicator.  It does feel slightly waxy (perhaps from the addition of beeswax in the formula) but I don&#x27;t mind that, in fact, I rather like it.  There&#x27;s no detectable taste or scent and I find it stays on about as long as other lip glosses I&#x27;ve tried.  In short, it&#x27;s a great substitute for lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love [[ASIN:B002DPUXZM Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm ]]--so much that I have one tube in each room of my house and at least one in every handbag. I&#x27;m pretty much addicted to the stuff. I&#x27;d never tried any Burt&#x27;s Bees product besides the lip balm before, so I jumped at the chance to try this lip gloss. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of the lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloss is a bit sticky--it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling smooth but rather stuck together. It also goes on very thin--in order to have the color show up (a color I really like, by the way), you have to put several coats on. And it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long--within 30 minutes, I felt like I needed to reapply, and my lips were drier than they were when I first put the gloss on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the color, and the tube is cute, but I can safely say that I will not be buying Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss ... I&#x27;ll just stick to the lip balm!</li>
            <li> I got this for the woman in my life, and she&#x27;s not very fond of it. The color&#x27;s nice (I think, at least), but she says the product itself is very sticky when it comes out of the container. [Honestly, poking around in it, the tube almost looks dried out; it&#x27;s possible we got a bad batch.] The applicator is oddly shaped compared to her other glosses, as well. Finally, she reports that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, as she felt the need to apply it several times over one evening out.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I originally put it on. There&#x27;s not much color to it - although I can definitely see the beige-ish tone when I put it on - and it had a nice shiny appearance.  However, it just doesn&#x27;t last that long. I even put it on and deliberately was very careful not to lick my lips, and it still disappeared quickly. It also seems to be slightly stickier than other glosses.  Although I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I think there are better lip glosses out there.</li>
            <li> I admit it: I am a lip gloss addict.I have tons of glosses, usually in this color family. I would put this one somewhere in the middle of the pack, and that&#x27;s pretty good for the price! Its consistency is medium, maybe somewhere close to that of Bare Escentuals Buxom (but without the plumping/menthol feel). Thinner than Nars (but what isn&#x27;t?) and thicker than some of the Cliniques I have, which are admittedly older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very neutral color, but not just sheer or nude. It&#x27;s got a little bit of a spiced hue on my very pale lips. I think it is similar to Buxom Lola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying power isn&#x27;t too bad. It lasted for a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the king of lip glosses...that goes hands down to Nars...but if you don&#x27;t want to pay $18-$24 for lip gloss, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Pros: I like the subtle color and the thick creamy texture. It does not run and it seems to dispense just the right amount. Smell/taste is fine, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is a bit sticky or tacky at first and does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Buxom Lips and love the texture. It also seems to last a bit longer than the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss.&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Lip Gloss is nice enough, but I will stick with my Buxom Lip Gloss(I love the tingle).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use a lot of makeup, so I&#x27;m picky about the cosmetics products I do use. I&#x27;m picky about lip color in particular, as I generally don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color of this product is nice. It&#x27;s a neutral shade that gave my lips just a hint of color, and it doesn&#x27;t have a high, wet shine like some other lip glosses--both pluses for me. While I had it on, I felt like it did a nice job of highlighting my lips without screaming that I was wearing lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the product was pretty good too. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing of a feel as lip balm, and it&#x27;s a little stickier, but it didn&#x27;t have the heavy, drying, sticky feel of some other lip glosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While wearing it, I kept noticing a warm vanilla scent, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out where it was coming from. I finally realized that it was the smell of the lip gloss itself! This was a plus for me, as lip color sometimes has a very strange, chemical smell to it, so it was nice to wear something that smells more like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a comparison, I have a couple of the Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms, and I like the feel of those better than this product, but I still think this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> The color is subtle so if you&#x27;re looking for something to make your lips stand out, this isn&#x27;t it.  It does make my lips feel soft and moisturized.  This lips gloss goes on very thick, needing more than one application to cover your lips.  In fact, it feels a little too thick as I would prefer a smoother, thinner application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is okay but the price of 8.99 would keep me from buying this.</li>
            <li> I did not like this Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss. After applying it, my lips felt strange and a bit sticky. I don&#x27;t normally wear lip gloss so maybe this is normal. I do like that it didn&#x27;t really add much color to my lips but leaves them a little big glossy. The applicator tip has a slanted end so it can only be applied one way to your lips. I also do not care for the scent which seems to be a bit woodsy smelling to me. The lip gloss does not last very long and feels heavy. For those reasons I would not purchase this on my own.</li>
            <li> This is an ok lip gloss, not bad but not great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- The Autumn Haze color was light, almost nude, with a little shimmer; a nice everyday shade.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush had an angled tip making application easy (although it does take several applications to get coverage).&lt;br /&gt;- The tube is sturdy with a good seal. I carried it my purse with no leaking or oozing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- The texture is sticky and thick feeling. It was really annoying at first, but after a few minutes thick feeling went away, but the stickiness remained.&lt;br /&gt;- The taste. It has no flavor, just a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> I got this lip gloss as I really like the brand as a whole.  I especially like the baby products and travel kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sick of lip gloss tasting awful, not staying on for a decent period of time, and the heavy, sticky gooey ones that are high priced dept store products that don&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but as I mentioned, I have really liked the quality of many of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have bought and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to say that for me, it was exactly what I needed. And it really seemed to help my chapped lips that happen every winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t checked out any of the other colors yet and tried this one color, as it was available to me through the Amazon Vine Program, in that I am able to choose a couple of items ranging from food to books per month, and this item was free to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in NO WAY affects my review of any product; I just tell it like it is, and what my experience with the product has been, to try to help all of us on tighter budgets to not waste money on junk.  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much other Amazon customers have helped ME make a decision on an item, good or bad, and I really feel that there is a lot of integrity in the reviews by an Amazon customer.  I buy tons of other products that are NOT free, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with an item I bought based on several customer reviews.  AND..it is really important to read these in my opinion, as I had a problem with an item I did not read about, thinking it was a no brainer, and I really wish I had read the reviews as there was an issue and it was mentioned in some customer reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus about this Burt&#x27;s Bee Lip Gloss was that it was not full of fragrance, which for some reason started bothering me several years ago, and I&#x27;m really wary about a product that may have a floral perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I hope this helps someone make a decision on this product, and decide for yourself if it will work for you. I was very happy with this product and intend on looking for more colors.roduct, and decide for yourself if it will work for you. I was very happy with this product and intend on looking for more colors.</li>
            <li> Although the photo and the Autumn Haze name hint at a golden tone, this lip gloss actually has more of a pinkish hue to it. As a result, it didn&#x27;t add a lot of color to my lips. It looked more like a shimmering nude color when I put on, with bits of golden sparkle, and I liked all that. However, despite it being labeled a gloss, it didn&#x27;t give my lips the moisture I&#x27;m accustomed to with my other glosses. They felt rather dry, even when smacking and rubbing them together. I&#x27;m sure that will be fine in the summer, but it&#x27;s not so great in the winter and could be painful on chapped lips. Unfortunately, I did not get much shine or any of the nourishing oils this product claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Gloss is its 100% natural contention. To me, natural products are ones that I can pronounce and easily identify. The ingredient list on the Autumn Haze variation includes oleic/linoleic/linolenic polyglycerides and ammonium glycyrrhizate tocopherol. And it may also contain tin dioxide, titanium dioxide, and the list goes on. Those may be natural, but they&#x27;re a mouthful and I have no idea where they all come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is an okay product but not one I&#x27;ll be rushing out to buy before I run out.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  She reports that this is an ideal lip gloss and sites as a strength exactly what some others have sited as its primary weakness--it is very subtle.  She also really likes the natural ingredients in Burt&#x27;s Bees products generally and that is an advantage here over other brands.  While \\&quot;Autumn Haze\\&quot; is a good color, she prefers \\&quot;Ocean Sunrise\\&quot; but that&#x27;s a matter of your own color palette.  One small disclaimer: my wife is not a makeup person in general and so she has much less experience with other brands than I suspect other reviewers have on this site.  Still, even without making other comparisons, she is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an okay lip gloss, but when my lips are chapped and dry I am looking for something to resolve the issue.  I tried to use this product several times for that and it did not work.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees products have been a hit or miss for me in the past, but this is a definite win! The color is gorgeous (a little darker than what appears in the photo) and works wonderfully on its own, or mixed with another color (I often use this one in conjunction with darker or starker lip colors to neutralize, since my lips are a few shades darker than this gloss.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chronically dry or flaky lips, but this product solves that problem better than many of the chapsticks and balms that I&#x27;ve tried (and this includes some of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is definitely a decent size, and lasts a long time. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, especially if you&#x27;re looking for something that can double as a gloss and balm.</li>
            <li> I love Bert&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm so I was hoping that their Lip Gloss would be similar. It is in that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients but it&#x27;s for the purpose of lip color not moisturizing. The color was muted so that my lips didn&#x27;t look much different but they felt different than wearing lip balm.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan but my 18yo daughter grabbed it when I said it wasn&#x27;t to my liking.</li>
