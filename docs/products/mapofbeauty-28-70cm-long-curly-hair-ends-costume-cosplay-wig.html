            <li>Im really happy with this wig</li>
            <li>Great price for what i feel like is a quality wig.</li>
            <li>Wig is also a good 3 inches shorter in person.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t look good to me, so I clipped the fringe into a style that suited me</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this one.</li>

            <li>The color is very adorable though but looks like plastic/doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>So cute!</li>
            <li>Pleased!</li>
            <li>Very accurate to image.</li>

            <li>I love this wig because 1)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure going to order from here again.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig.</li>
            <li>It has way better coloring in person.</li>
            <li>although I can see the cap in some places I feel with a cute hair accessory this would not be an issue.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>And above all the wig was perfect for my Fluttrshy costume.  </li>
            <li>The pink is perfectly pastel and just as photographed.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the way it fit.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easy.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice, and i just love it so much overall!</li>
            <li>I love it so much! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I do wish you had more natural colors as well, I can&#x27;t wait to get more wigs from here !</li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it for my fluttershy cosplay.</li>
            <li>I love it very much pretty color</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Arrived MUCH sooner than i expected it to, very nice surprise!</li>
            <li>i really want to give it a 4 or 5 since i love the color and the way the wig look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not layered or full</li>
            <li>It is hardly full of hair as well.</li>
            <li>Full, good quality wig for the low price!</li>
            <li>It actually came in a week earlier than predicted, which was an awesome surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not all shiny and super synthetic looking like I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I get this instead of a straight wig because this wig doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>really amazing costumer service they took the extra mile when they really didnt need to</li>
            <li>although i like them very much</li>
            <li>The minute I saw it, I was scared it was going to look super thin, but it fits me perfect; it&#x27;s a lot better than my other wigs that I&#x27;ve paid way too much on.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the details I was expecting something completely different</li>
            <li>The wig length is exactly what I thought and the colour is spot on for my pony tails I already had.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the package fit in my mailbox, well done.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super comfortable to put on too; and the wig cap comes in a small baggie, it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, it really looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>Very silky to the touch, but not plasticy or visibly shiny.</li>
            <li>The curls are very bouncy and add a lot of dimension.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside (which really isn&#x27;t a deterrent for me) is that the fringe isn&#x27;t cut already.</li>
            <li>This wig ended up being a lot better than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I think it will do very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this wig much, it looked like something you get at a dollar store for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy with lots of hair on it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it in pink and it is soft and full and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily</li>
            <li>The wig is also soft, with the right amount of thickness.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the net is a bit visible in the front part, but that is easy to fix with pins, some hairspray, or if your costume involves a hat (which mine does!).</li>
            <li>it looks pretty natural on my head,</li>
            <li>The cap of the wig is a mesh cap, I normally like lace caps, but I don&#x27;t mind really since I have to sew the pieces on.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Not thick at all.</li>
            <li>What would be a super cute wig is ruined by the fact that I can see the netting very clearly because it is so thin.</li>
            <li>Wig came quickly, exactly as pictured right down to the color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cotton candy pink than the bubblegum pink in the picture.</li>
            <li>things happen with the blue wig but more hair was falling off the blue wig than the pink one.</li>
            <li>Wow they went all out guys...</li>
            <li>I suggest looking at wigs in person at a store by far</li>
            <li>Pretty bubble gum pink color as well.</li>
            <li>Four stars because the color of the wig came out a little more coral pink than a bright pink like the picture and the wig is a bit flat and thin.</li>
            <li>i myself love them but their very delicate and need to taking care of with caution.</li>
            <li>Its a much darker pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not actually very long as you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to future owners to be careful or order from somewhere else.</li>

            <li> and I saw some negative reviews first</li>
            <li> i order two wigs a pink and blue, the pink one the started to fall off since the sowing on the cap was lose, i try resowing it so far it solve things</li>
            <li> Super thin, you can see the inside of the wig while wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is not realistic enough.</li>
            <li> The wig defiantly isn&#x27;t as long as pictured..</li>
            <li> It hangs very long in the front, so I assumed it was meant to be pushed to the side.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality... a lot less shiny (fake looking) than wigs i bought in the past!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but i must be careful when using and fixing them.</li>
            <li> The shipping also took some time (From China to South Carolina), but that is to be expected with overseas shopping.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a pink wig for my Princess Bubblgum cosplay.</li>
            <li> Just careful brushing this wig</li>
            <li> pink plastic hair strands glued onto a mis-shapen ball of mesh and actually retained a bad odor which is really just gross.</li>
            <li> like other wigs have done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is not very shiny at all!</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit shiny, but a bit of baby powder will help tone it down.</li>
            <li> I give it a five because I bought two of the same colour wig, so I can make it very thick.</li>
            <li> The netting was visible on this wig and it is made small</li>
            <li> But hard to stay on.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little weird.</li>
            <li> also you can see the wig cap through the wig that&#x27;s not good now I have too wear a hat</li>
            <li> Thick and head resistant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a wig from them before and had a terrible experience because it was so thin and no tracks hardly at all, but this one was decent even if you just buy one.</li>
            <li> its not too thin of a wig, it could be fuller</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on this, I took my chances even after reading a few bad reviews but this wig was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed..</li>
            <li> WRONG COLOR!!!</li>

            <li> What would be a super cute wig is ruined by the fact that I can see the netting very clearly because it is so thin.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Color is not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed.. The wig defiantly isn&#x27;t as long as pictured.. Make sure you read the details I was expecting something completely different then what arrived at my door today..</li>
            <li> Super thin, you can see the inside of the wig while wearing it. Not thick at all. WRONG COLOR!!! The wig looks nothing like the color in the photos. Its a much darker pink. Wig is also a good 3 inches shorter in person. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> i really want to give it a 4 or 5 since i love the color and the way the wig look. i order two wigs a pink and blue, the pink one the started to fall off since the sowing on the cap was lose, i try resowing it so far it solve things but when i brush it bit of the hair to falls off.&lt;br /&gt;similar things happen with the blue wig but more hair was falling off the blue wig than the pink one. although i like them very much but i must be careful when using and fixing them. highly recommend to future owners to be careful or order from somewhere else. i myself love them but their very delicate and need to taking care of with caution.</li>
            <li> So cute! The pink is perfectly pastel and just as photographed. Very silky to the touch, but not plasticy or visibly shiny. The curls are very bouncy and add a lot of dimension. All-in-all, it really looks like real hair! The only downside is that the net is a bit visible in the front part, but that is easy to fix with pins, some hairspray, or if your costume involves a hat (which mine does!). The shipping also took some time (From China to South Carolina), but that is to be expected with overseas shopping. It actually came in a week earlier than predicted, which was an awesome surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely re-purchase this wig if any of my future cosplays require this style.</li>
            <li> This is my cheapest, yet most worn wig. I love this wig because 1) it&#x27;s a beautiful color 2) fits perfectly 3) doesn&#x27;t make your head look alien-huge like other wigs have done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside (which really isn&#x27;t a deterrent for me) is that the fringe isn&#x27;t cut already. It hangs very long in the front, so I assumed it was meant to be pushed to the side. That didn&#x27;t look good to me, so I clipped the fringe into a style that suited me and I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I do wish you had more natural colors as well, I can&#x27;t wait to get more wigs from here !</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this one. I ordered it in pink and it is soft and full and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily</li>
            <li> This is a perfect wig for my fluttershy and pinkie pie cosplays</li>
            <li> Arrived MUCH sooner than i expected it to, very nice surprise! The quality of the wig is very nice also, and it is the perfect amount of curl. its not too thin of a wig, it could be fuller but im not complaining at all. The color is very nice, and i just love it so much overall! definitely going to buy from this seller again! 10/10 great purchase!</li>
            <li> Wig came quickly, exactly as pictured right down to the color! Thick and head resistant!</li>

            <li> This wig ended up being a lot better than I expected. I was in need of a pink wig for my Princess Bubblgum cosplay.

It&#x27;s super comfortable to put on too; and the wig cap comes in a small baggie, it&#x27;s so cute.

I&#x27;m sure going to order from here again.  Just careful brushing this wig or you&#x27;ll pull out the strands of hair. It&#x27;s a wig, remember that.</li>

I say was because it got thrown out immediately...it came looking like course pink plastic hair strands glued onto a mis-shapen ball of mesh and actually retained a bad odor which is really just gross. Don&#x27;t do it. I suggest looking at wigs in person at a store by far</li>
            <li> I love it very much pretty color</li>
            <li> I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> The hair feels nicer than my actual hair!! Im really happy with this wig it looks pretty natural on my head, although I can see the cap in some places I feel with a cute hair accessory this would not be an issue. Over all very happy for the price and I might even get another.</li>
            <li> Full, good quality wig for the low price! Took 3 weeks to arrive as it came from Hong Kong but it was worth the wait! Pretty bubble gum pink color as well. Pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous!! The same as the picture. Looks like human hair. Not all shiny and super synthetic looking like I was expecting. Great price for what i feel like is a quality wig. Nice and heavy with lots of hair on it. Doesn&#x27;t seem to tangle easy. I will definitely buy from this seller for my wigs every time from now on! VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> I give it a five because I bought two of the same colour wig, so I can make it very thick. The wig length is exactly what I thought and the colour is spot on for my pony tails I already had. I will be using this wig for my Godoka cosplay and I think it will do very well. I reccomend getting two and then putting them together for the best results! The picture I&#x27;m showing is before I put them together. The wig is not very shiny at all! The cap of the wig is a mesh cap, I normally like lace caps, but I don&#x27;t mind really since I have to sew the pieces on. Overall I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;d bought a wig from them before and had a terrible experience because it was so thin and no tracks hardly at all, but this one was decent even if you just buy one.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived on time and as scheduled. I was pleasantly surprised that the package fit in my mailbox, well done. And above all the wig was perfect for my Fluttrshy costume.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use for a Princess Bubblegum costume from the adventure time show. The bangs are a little weird. Not like the picture. But overall it worked out.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality... a lot less shiny (fake looking) than wigs i bought in the past!</li>
            <li> The netting was visible on this wig and it is made small</li>
            <li> Product is as pictured. Plus gave two extra wig caps. But hard to stay on. Probably don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> Very accurate to image. The wig is also soft, with the right amount of thickness. 9/10 would recommend. ☺</li>
            <li> Four stars because the color of the wig came out a little more coral pink than a bright pink like the picture and the wig is a bit flat and thin. It&#x27;s also a bit shiny, but a bit of baby powder will help tone it down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this wig much, it looked like something you get at a dollar store for Halloween. It is not realistic enough. It is hardly full of hair as well. It&#x27;s not actually very long as you&#x27;d imagine. The color is very adorable though but looks like plastic/doll&#x27;s hair. Not worth the purchase.</li>
