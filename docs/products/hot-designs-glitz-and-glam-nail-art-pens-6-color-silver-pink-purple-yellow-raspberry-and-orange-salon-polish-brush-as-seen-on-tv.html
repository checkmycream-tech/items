            <li>kind of a rip off because what you see on TV is not what you are able to do...</li>
            <li>My grand daughter was painting and designing her nails for weeks.</li>
            <li>My niece enjoyed this.</li>
            <li>Went to get more</li>

            <li>I love these and like to use them.</li>
            <li>Would buy again / more.</li>
            <li>Also, I found that having someone else paint your nails worked much better.</li>
            <li>And that is why I love reviewing them, to debunk the hype.  </li>
            <li>lots and lots of fun!!</li>
            <li>They love painting theirs and all their friends nails with the easy designs and hint book</li>
            <li>Not as great in person - the pens seem like they&#x27;d be great when you purchase online but have very little utility in person on arrival.</li>
            <li>great for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>works great, bought it for a gift for a 10 year old and she loves it, product was as described</li>
            <li>I thought they were really cool!</li>
            <li>I copy for my knees they are bright vibrant colors</li>
            <li>Not as easy to apply as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>its not AS easy to use to make designs as a pen striper would be.</li>
            <li>Came out easy .</li>
            <li>I found that the polish came out easily, and was easy to maneuver as well.</li>
            <li>Doing the designs were fun and easy!</li>
            <li>But the pen works fine.</li>
            <li>But the pen worked fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me to do with my little girl, the paint comes out a bit thicker then I would think and moving it around isn&#x27;t as easy as what they describe.</li>
            <li>The polish is cheap and does not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>think my girly gandgirls will really enjoy with their moms.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free to write a review, and was not paid or told what to write.</li>
            <li>Would not go on smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many positive reviews!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product e in retail store.</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I can tell you that she was so excited to receive it, but when she used it she ended up in tears.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s purpose my daughter was excited to receive this on her birthday.</li>
            <li>It obviously fulfills a great creative need for young adolescents.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love jt</li>
            <li>Make sure thata after you put some on with the brush, that you wait till it looks ready.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a booklet of design ideas, which was very helpful for getting started and had some cute suggestions.  </li>
            <li>Other than being misleading about the quality they are great.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and were sent on their way for Christmas</li>
            <li>I am required to note that I received this product free, in exchange for writing this unbiased review (I did not receive monetary compensation for writing a positive review)  </li>
            <li>And as a Dad, they&#x27;re great for some bonding with your little lady.</li>
            <li>These are pretty cool and my daughter enjoys using them.</li>
            <li>pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This could be a really exciting product.  </li>
            <li>These are lots of fun for the kids.</li>
            <li>Cute gift for a young girl</li>
            <li>I found that I would need to shake the pens very well in order to get them to mix properly, but this is detailed on top of the instructions.  </li>
            <li>They were nice colors though and they lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, easy tool to help with your nail art, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>colors included are very bright, with the exception of the dark blue and silver.  </li>
            <li>The pen broke after the first use.</li>
            <li>Would buy again most definitely.</li>
            <li>came out pretty bad&amp;#34; - I shall try to create the designs on them myself and see if their opinions improve.</li>
            <li>She also shared with one of her classmates and continues to use the hot designs.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!  </li>
            <li>I am having to purchase them regularly as I have six daughters and they love them and we use them weekly.</li>
            <li>Responsibly priced too!</li>
            <li>Exactly as posted.</li>
            <li>This would also be a really cute gift to a teen or pre-teen.</li>
            <li>Practice on the paper ones first; it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>And though I&#x27;m pretty ok at it and the tiny one loves the color added to the ends of her digits, I think it&#x27;s a pain.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I envisioned  when I ordered this item &amp;#34;nail art pens&amp;#34; and it was received promptly.</li>
            <li>We love combining them with the diamonds (gems) that amazon sells and use them in creating more designs, such as a putting on gem in the center of your nail and then drawing petals to create flowers.</li>
            <li>She cried that whole day</li>
            <li>The pens push out too much and the paint globs too much.</li>
            <li>Daughter really wanted this for her birthday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at the price for what you&#x27;re getting, I think it&#x27;s a reasonable purchase to try out.  </li>
            <li>For the nail pens that were not broken, they worked as desired.</li>
            <li>It actually helps her to design her nails and pretty easy for an 11 year old.</li>
            <li>The other pens I tried either wouldn&#x27;t stop pushing polish out on its own or the polish came out mostly clear, even after shaking.</li>
            <li>Make sure you squeeze then pen to get the polish to flow, do not press down on the tip.</li>
            <li>The paint was so think and gloppy, it doesn&#x27;t matter how steady my hand is.</li>
            <li>Another word of caution is to ensure the tops are tightly screwed on between use, and not to pinch the container when screwing the top on or the polish will leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ingredients are highly toxic.</li>
            <li>And when it dried I was able to scrap it off with my fingernails</li>
            <li>The thick and fine points on either end of the pens are great for her tiny nails, as well as for drawing small scenes on them.  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by a rep for AllStar Marketing and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, As Seen on TV products rarely work, or at least don&#x27;t work close to as well as</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been drawing on my own nails for years, with excellent quality pens, and these are an unfortunate disappointment.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve first received the kit I&#x27;ve notice that the kit was smaller</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty but the polish its not liquid enough, it doesnt look soft when you put it on.</li>
            <li>:) Impossible to find in stores or even on TV any more.</li>
            <li>I had brought this for my 8 year old daughter hoping that she can do it herself.</li>
            <li>then what was advertised, and that the whole design was different.</li>
            <li>She is constantly making designs and she really loves it</li>
            <li>I used this kit to do my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>In this case, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>And, like the Chip Clip of old, this is one of those \\&quot;Why</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for all ages, for that young girl just getting into her teenage years to an older gal living through her wonder years.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to use it, just a waste of money...</li>
            <li>Truly only one is needed, as long as you clean up properly between use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I found these difficult to use, but my daughter used this with her daughter and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The colors are really fun, and are not watered down at all</li>
            <li>And when it comes right down to it, the Hot Design Nail Art pens are the same exact thing - paint pens filled with nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a little someone that popped up in my life a few years back, I&#x27;ve had to learn how to paint nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few other brands of nail art pens, and this seems to be one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>A little clunky but still a lot of fun with the instructions booklet</li>
            <li>It takes a little time and patience to get used to it in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a fun activity.</li>
            <li>The kit did come with a small book that showed you how to design your nails with 12 different styles, but with the colors I&#x27;ve received I was only able to do 3 different design.</li>
            <li>And since it is nail polish, apparently I can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li>Polish is too thick to give a smooth application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little less than an OK product.</li>
            <li>The tips get clogged easily and it is impossible to clear them out, and it peels right off your nails.</li>
            <li>My seven years old grand daughter asked me to order the hot designs as advertised on TV but was greatly disappointed when the package arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right product for me</li>

            <li> I am required to note that I received this product free, in exchange for writing this unbiased review (I did not receive monetary compensation for writing a positive review)  </li>
            <li> And as a Dad, they&#x27;re great for some bonding with your little lady.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool and my daughter enjoys using them.</li>
            <li> pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This could be a really exciting product.  </li>
            <li> These are lots of fun for the kids.</li>
            <li> Cute gift for a young girl</li>
            <li> I found that I would need to shake the pens very well in order to get them to mix properly, but this is detailed on top of the instructions.  </li>
            <li> They were nice colors though and they lasted pretty long.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, easy tool to help with your nail art, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> colors included are very bright, with the exception of the dark blue and silver.  </li>
            <li> The pen broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> Would buy again most definitely.</li>
            <li> came out pretty bad&amp;#34; - I shall try to create the designs on them myself and see if their opinions improve.</li>
            <li> She also shared with one of her classmates and continues to use the hot designs.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!  </li>
            <li> I am having to purchase them regularly as I have six daughters and they love them and we use them weekly.</li>
            <li> Responsibly priced too!</li>
            <li> Exactly as posted.</li>
            <li> This would also be a really cute gift to a teen or pre-teen.</li>
            <li> Practice on the paper ones first; it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> And though I&#x27;m pretty ok at it and the tiny one loves the color added to the ends of her digits, I think it&#x27;s a pain.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I envisioned  when I ordered this item &amp;#34;nail art pens&amp;#34; and it was received promptly.</li>
            <li> We love combining them with the diamonds (gems) that amazon sells and use them in creating more designs, such as a putting on gem in the center of your nail and then drawing petals to create flowers.</li>
            <li> She cried that whole day</li>
            <li> The pens push out too much and the paint globs too much.</li>
            <li> Daughter really wanted this for her birthday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking at the price for what you&#x27;re getting, I think it&#x27;s a reasonable purchase to try out.  </li>
            <li> For the nail pens that were not broken, they worked as desired.</li>
            <li> It actually helps her to design her nails and pretty easy for an 11 year old.</li>
            <li> The other pens I tried either wouldn&#x27;t stop pushing polish out on its own or the polish came out mostly clear, even after shaking.</li>
            <li> Make sure you squeeze then pen to get the polish to flow, do not press down on the tip.</li>
            <li> The paint was so think and gloppy, it doesn&#x27;t matter how steady my hand is.</li>
            <li> Another word of caution is to ensure the tops are tightly screwed on between use, and not to pinch the container when screwing the top on or the polish will leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ingredients are highly toxic.</li>
            <li> And when it dried I was able to scrap it off with my fingernails</li>
            <li> The thick and fine points on either end of the pens are great for her tiny nails, as well as for drawing small scenes on them.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by a rep for AllStar Marketing and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, As Seen on TV products rarely work, or at least don&#x27;t work close to as well as</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drawing on my own nails for years, with excellent quality pens, and these are an unfortunate disappointment.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve first received the kit I&#x27;ve notice that the kit was smaller</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the polish its not liquid enough, it doesnt look soft when you put it on.</li>
            <li> :) Impossible to find in stores or even on TV any more.</li>
            <li> I had brought this for my 8 year old daughter hoping that she can do it herself.</li>
            <li> then what was advertised, and that the whole design was different.</li>
            <li> She is constantly making designs and she really loves it</li>
            <li> I used this kit to do my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li> In this case, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> And, like the Chip Clip of old, this is one of those \\&quot;Why</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for all ages, for that young girl just getting into her teenage years to an older gal living through her wonder years.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to use it, just a waste of money...</li>
            <li> Truly only one is needed, as long as you clean up properly between use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I found these difficult to use, but my daughter used this with her daughter and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The colors are really fun, and are not watered down at all</li>
            <li> And when it comes right down to it, the Hot Design Nail Art pens are the same exact thing - paint pens filled with nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a little someone that popped up in my life a few years back, I&#x27;ve had to learn how to paint nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other brands of nail art pens, and this seems to be one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> A little clunky but still a lot of fun with the instructions booklet</li>
            <li> It takes a little time and patience to get used to it in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a fun activity.</li>
            <li> The kit did come with a small book that showed you how to design your nails with 12 different styles, but with the colors I&#x27;ve received I was only able to do 3 different design.</li>
            <li> And since it is nail polish, apparently I can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li> Polish is too thick to give a smooth application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less than an OK product.</li>
            <li> The tips get clogged easily and it is impossible to clear them out, and it peels right off your nails.</li>
            <li> My seven years old grand daughter asked me to order the hot designs as advertised on TV but was greatly disappointed when the package arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right product for me</li>
            <li> For that purpose, the precision tip was very helpful as sculpting designs on small nails is</li>
            <li> We removed and retried it three different times, allowing loads of time for the polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the pen ends even after careful use get gummed up inside making the next use frustrating if not impossible.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my little miss, as I had another adult try them out for themselves, and she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, any designs I draw on the top coat of polish appears to come off rather easily, while the base resists coming off for a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> At least one of the pens did not work, no matter how much I squeezed.</li>
            <li> This product is very fun, and complicated.</li>
            <li> She is 9 and usually she hardly come to me if she can read the instructions and if they are pretty simple, she will left me alone.  </li>
            <li> She said some of the polishes were dry and unusable.</li>
            <li> Some nail polishes were dry...</li>
            <li> They dry out after one use..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not new also,  </li>
            <li> Well, there is nothing hard about how to use Nail Art Pens, but she came over because she got frustrated with a few colors clogged, in particular the yellow which is one of her favorite colors.  </li>
            <li> This product was a big mess with the nail polish</li>
            <li> Not the number of pens or the colors I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought 2 kits of each would last me a few months.</li>
            <li> When the tip is clogged and she tries to press the barrel, the color comes out on the side and messes up her fingers.  </li>
            <li> just as expected.</li>
            <li> this is a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> My nine year old states, &amp;#34;you have to squeeze the black pen really hard in order to make designs, the nail polish was dry and lumpy...and very hard to get off&amp;#34; - My seven year old states, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My only advice is don&#x27;t press to hard against the nail because you will ruin the spout.</li>
            <li> Now, there are a couple of pins (very tiny pins) attached to the literature for unclogging the pens, but we found out they hardly work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and not that bad.</li>
            <li> Although painting the whole nail was sorta difficult.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is about the same as retail on this one, but at least they HAD one and didn&#x27;t OVERcharge.</li>
            <li> Also the polish end you design with is good for drawing designs but the end just to paint the nails with is a terrible polish.</li>
            <li> (If you use a base and top coat)</li>
            <li> she uses it every other week!  </li>
            <li> I thought I will receive other colors which include the green one</li>
            <li> The set I recieved could be purchased in a retail store for less money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mess up on the designs</li>
            <li> but I gave it to my little cousin and</li>
            <li> For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t get about half of the other sides of the pens to produce any nail polish no matter how hard I squeezed it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste my money on 2 kits of each because I use these pens alot.</li>
            <li> What a WASTE of $24.  </li>
            <li> My little one loves it!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the decorative polish to come out and when it did it was lumpy.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter saw this advertised on TV and wanted it so badly that we looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  </li>
            <li> It is way too thick.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was thick and gooey.  </li>
            <li> The polish was extremely thick and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> the Polish was thick and sticky...</li>
            <li> The paint brushes are coming apart, the nail polish is very thick and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> they were very hard to squeeze out</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product brought for my granddaughters and nail polish seemed old.</li>
            <li> DO not listen to negative posts... try it for yourself because if you don&#x27;t like it contact amazon customer service!!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how thick and goopy some of the polishes were.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It made applying them very difficult.</li>
            <li> was just from a bad batch though.</li>
            <li> I hate it as soon as I got this package</li>
            <li> Hated it though.</li>
            <li> These nail pens are terrible!</li>
            <li> IT WAS HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality the nail polish was a sticky as glue it did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> the nail polish was horrible quality</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the polish its not liquid enough, it doesnt look soft when you put it on.</li>
            <li> My daughter will love this!</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool and my daughter enjoys using them. Make sure you squeeze then pen to get the polish to flow, do not press down on the tip. I made that mistake and the tip pushes all the way in. Also the polish end you design with is good for drawing designs but the end just to paint the nails with is a terrible polish. It is way too thick.</li>
            <li> The pen broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved them. Would buy again most definitely.</li>
            <li> my kids loved these pens easy to use and spill proof!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I have a problem with is that when you put it on its a big blob. But the pen works fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many positive reviews! The polish is cheap and does not go on smoothly. At least one of the pens did not work, no matter how much I squeezed. The other pens I tried either wouldn&#x27;t stop pushing polish out on its own or the polish came out mostly clear, even after shaking. I&#x27;ll be looking for better pens!</li>
            <li> lots and lots of fun!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was simply a marker but it is not ... it is liquid so that leaves a perfect finish</li>
            <li> My nine year old states, &amp;#34;you have to squeeze the black pen really hard in order to make designs, the nail polish was dry and lumpy...and very hard to get off&amp;#34; - My seven year old states, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s kind of a rip off because what you see on TV is not what you are able to do...it looks like the commercials are perfect nails and mine came out pretty bad&amp;#34; - I shall try to create the designs on them myself and see if their opinions improve.</li>
            <li> pretty cool. great for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> A little clunky but still a lot of fun with the instructions booklet</li>
            <li> For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t get about half of the other sides of the pens to produce any nail polish no matter how hard I squeezed it. Never used it after that day.</li>
            <li> Not the number of pens or the colors I expected.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my niece who has some kind of addiction to doing nail art. I&#x27;m happy she likes it. It&#x27;s cheap and not that bad. The only complain I have is what my niece told me... She said some of the polishes were dry and unusable. I don&#x27;t know if the item shipped to me was just from a bad batch though.</li>
            <li> The tips get clogged easily and it is impossible to clear them out, and it peels right off your nails.</li>
            <li> works great, bought it for a gift for a 10 year old and she loves it, product was as described</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Granddaughters love it ! They love painting theirs and all their friends nails with the easy designs and hint book</li>
            <li> I copy for my knees they are bright vibrant colors and she will love them!</li>
            <li> Got these for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter was painting and designing her nails for weeks. She also shared with one of her classmates and continues to use the hot designs.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to apply as I was hoping.  I had a hard time getting the decorative polish to come out and when it did it was lumpy.</li>
            <li> Got these at Walmart a year ago. U can create designs but they won&#x27;t be as neat as you think. Lots of air bubbles happen when you squeeze the pen to make the polish come out. It&#x27;s a little less than an OK product. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again..</li>
            <li> My seven years old grand daughter asked me to order the hot designs as advertised on TV but was greatly disappointed when the package arrived. She cried that whole day and she tried calling but no one pick up the phone.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed!  What I recieved did not look like what was pictured.  The box looked different and was a lot smaller.  The set I recieved could be purchased in a retail store for less money.</li>
            <li> I got them at bed bath and beyond. I thought they were really cool! Doing the designs were fun and easy! Although painting the whole nail was sorta difficult. It didnt apply well. They were nice colors though and they lasted pretty long. (If you use a base and top coat)</li>
            <li> My niece enjoyed this.</li>
            <li> my grand daughters loved these work great easy to use the draw pen will buy more colors!and love the example sheet</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product e in retail store. Went to get more but they were sold out so I decided to come here and get them. They were cheaper than the retail store that I purchased at and they are great. I used my own polish to paint the nails and then I used these pens for designs and it worked excellent. I am having to purchase them regularly as I have six daughters and they love them and we use them weekly. We love combining them with the diamonds (gems) that amazon sells and use them in creating more designs, such as a putting on gem in the center of your nail and then drawing petals to create flowers. DO not listen to negative posts... try it for yourself because if you don&#x27;t like it contact amazon customer service!!</li>
            <li> Not for me, but my daughter loves it. It actually helps her to design her nails and pretty easy for an 11 year old.</li>
            <li> Some nail polishes were dry...</li>
            <li> Tips were clogged and not usable.</li>
            <li> perfect gift for my child. she is having a blast with it.</li>
            <li> think my girly gandgirls will really enjoy with their moms.  Came quickly and were sent on their way for Christmas</li>
            <li> My daughter got this kit and asked me to help do her nails.  I was shocked at how thick and goopy some of the polishes were.  It made applying them very difficult.</li>
            <li> These nail pens are terrible! The paint was so think and gloppy, it doesn&#x27;t matter how steady my hand is. I&#x27;ve been drawing on my own nails for years, with excellent quality pens, and these are an unfortunate disappointment.</li>
            <li> My girls were in heaven when i got this for them! they love it! its not AS easy to use to make designs as a pen striper would be. but these are pretty great! my kids were really happy! thank you!</li>
            <li> This is misleading. I thought all 6 pens were included. I ordered 2 packs. But it&#x27;s ok I ordered 2 kits of the basic beauty kit as well. I didn&#x27;t waste my money on 2 kits of each because I use these pens alot. I thought 2 kits of each would last me a few months. I use to paint my nails alot but now I just paint them for 3 holidays. 4th of july Halloween and Christmas. So that is only 3 times a year. Sometimes I mess up on the designs so I have to redo them. Other than being misleading about the quality they are great.</li>
            <li> Girls ages 8 and 10 love!</li>
            <li> Two of the pens broke before we could even use them! When taking the lid off, the tip of the pen snapped off in the cap</li>
            <li> The pens push out too much and the paint globs too much. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the result in using the pens</li>
            <li> When I received my order I discover the items are used already and it&#x27;s not new also,  I thought I will receive other colors which include the green one</li>
            <li> Daughter really wanted this for her birthday. It obviously fulfills a great creative need for young adolescents.  :) Impossible to find in stores or even on TV any more. Amazon&#x27;s price is about the same as retail on this one, but at least they HAD one and didn&#x27;t OVERcharge.</li>
            <li> bought this for my niece for her birthday - she loves them</li>
            <li> not a big deal. or quality.</li>
            <li> Got this for one of my girls nights I host. ( http://www.breathingforher.com/2014/06/a-boy-at-girls-night.html ) everyone loved them. My only advice is don&#x27;t press to hard against the nail because you will ruin the spout.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for a teenager.  She seems to like it as she is always fiddling with her nails.  I&#x27;m starting to despise the smell of polish remover.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love jt</li>
            <li> This product is totally amazing and I will definitely buy it again in different colors</li>
            <li> Great tool for those wanting to create limitless designs at the comfort of their own home. It takes a little time and patience to get used to it in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a fun activity.I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right product for me but I gave it to my little cousin and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample in exchange for an honest review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
            <li> This could be a really exciting product.  My daughter was so excited to get it.  She is 9 and usually she hardly come to me if she can read the instructions and if they are pretty simple, she will left me alone.  Well, there is nothing hard about how to use Nail Art Pens, but she came over because she got frustrated with a few colors clogged, in particular the yellow which is one of her favorite colors.  When the tip is clogged and she tries to press the barrel, the color comes out on the side and messes up her fingers.  Now, there are a couple of pins (very tiny pins) attached to the literature for unclogging the pens, but we found out they hardly work.  We kept on pushing it repeatedly until they all got bent - the pens are still clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample item for this review.</li>
            <li> The paint brushes are coming apart, the nail polish is very thick and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Good buy and great price</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it it did everything about it she uses it every other week!  She does her sister&#x27;s nails as well and they turn out great she is able to make fun and great desgins that she loves!</li>
            <li> Could not use since items showed up severely damaged</li>
            <li> My daughter just love it</li>
            <li> It was just as described. I love it. It works well</li>
            <li> This product is very fun, and complicated. I did not no there was a brudh involved too. Make sure thata after you put some on with the brush, that you wait till it looks ready. Then you can use the piont to draw lines, dots and designes on top.  http://www.essie.com/ is a good website to get more nail products</li>
            <li> Loved this product! It worked wonders on my nail creativity! I recommend this product to every women out there. It&#x27;s for all ages, for that young girl just getting into her teenage years to an older gal living through her wonder years. Responsibly priced too!</li>
            <li> I had brought this for my 8 year old daughter hoping that she can do it herself. When I&#x27;ve first received the kit I&#x27;ve notice that the kit was smaller then what was advertised, and that the whole design was different. After opening I&#x27;ve noticed that it only came with 3 pens, six different colors. The kit did come with a small book that showed you how to design your nails with 12 different styles, but with the colors I&#x27;ve received I was only able to do 3 different design.</li>
            <li> I wish they were easier to use....</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very expensive.  The nail polish was thick and gooey.  I do not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Not as great in person - the pens seem like they&#x27;d be great when you purchase online but have very little utility in person on arrival.</li>
            <li> Received this product for honest review. I used this product on my daughter and it worked great . Came out easy . Made designs simple to do. Polish stayed on. great product.</li>
            <li> I am required to note that I received this product free, in exchange for writing this unbiased review (I did not receive monetary compensation for writing a positive review)  After using this product, I can confirm that it works exceedingly well. I&#x27;ve used a few other brands of nail art pens, and this seems to be one of the better ones. I found that the polish came out easily, and was easy to maneuver as well. The only reason that I gave this product four stars is because some of the colors are not opaque enough to be properly seen over darker colors of nail polish, so I had to put on a couple of layers. But if you&#x27;re looking for a quick, easy tool to help with your nail art, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter saw this advertised on TV and wanted it so badly that we looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  Well, I can tell you that she was so excited to receive it, but when she used it she ended up in tears.  The polish was extremely thick and clumpy.  We removed and retried it three different times, allowing loads of time for the polish to dry.  IT WAS HORRIBLE.  And since it is nail polish, apparently I can&#x27;t return it.  What a WASTE of $24.  I&#x27;ll never buy from this company again.  I would have given it NO stars, but the review doesn&#x27;t allow that.  Hated it though.</li>
            <li> just as expected. make nice designs</li>
            <li> Exactly as posted. My little one loves it!</li>
            <li> awful. the Polish was thick and sticky...also after a while the nailpolish doesn&#x27;t come out of the design part of the pen...i was so excited to use it, just a waste of money...</li>
            <li> My 13-year-old daughter really loved it I  actually going to order her another one. She is constantly making designs and she really loves it</li>
            <li> nice.. but I bought for someone else who likes to decorate their nails.</li>
            <li> Polish is too thick to give a smooth application. Ingredients are highly toxic. Save your money!  My daughter bought it and wishes she could get her money back.</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nail art designs. this was perfect for me to do. I love it.</li>
            <li> My niece fell in love.  She doing anybody nails that will let her.</li>
            <li> I used this kit to do my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s nails.  For that purpose, the precision tip was very helpful as sculpting designs on small nails is difficult!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors included are very bright, with the exception of the dark blue and silver.  I found that I would need to shake the pens very well in order to get them to mix properly, but this is detailed on top of the instructions.  Another word of caution is to ensure the tops are tightly screwed on between use, and not to pinch the container when screwing the top on or the polish will leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was interesting that each side of the colors came with a precision tip.  Truly only one is needed, as long as you clean up properly between use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, this was a great product.  I received this as a product test and am glad I did.  The kit comes with a booklet of design ideas, which was very helpful for getting started and had some cute suggestions.  The colors are really fun, and are not watered down at all so they show up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone looking to get a nail design &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;, or for anyone with kids who like to have fancy nails.  This would also be a really cute gift to a teen or pre-teen.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me to do with my little girl, the paint comes out a bit thicker then I would think and moving it around isn&#x27;t as easy as what they describe.</li>
            <li> I love these and like to use them. The only issue is that the pen ends even after careful use get gummed up inside making the next use frustrating if not impossible. It&#x27;d be good if they found a fix for this. Even the metal thingy doesn&#x27;t always fix it. Very nice product I like it and have many colors. Would buy again / more.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality the nail polish was a sticky as glue it did not work for me at all this is a total waste of your money. The  dotting pens did not work as soon as I got them they were very hard to squeeze out the nail polish was horrible quality I hate it as soon as I got this package</li>
            <li> These are lots of fun for the kids. They do there nails almost daily.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to write a review, and was not paid or told what to write. I found these difficult to use, but my daughter used this with her daughter and was very pleased with it. Practice on the paper ones first; it makes it easier to use. Also, I found that having someone else paint your nails worked much better.</li>
            <li> They dry out after one use.. but it served it&#x27;s purpose my daughter was excited to receive this on her birthday.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product brought for my granddaughters and nail polish seemed old. Would not go on smooth. Keep having to take it off because it looked streaky. Wouldn&#x27;t even give it 1 star</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for AllStar Marketing and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, As Seen on TV products rarely work, or at least don&#x27;t work close to as well as the commercials want you to think.  And that is why I love reviewing them, to debunk the hype.  In this case, I was pleasantly surprised.  And, like the Chip Clip of old, this is one of those \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?\\&quot; items.  I&#x27;ve used paint pens for the last..30 years or so.  Used them on models, as touch up paint for cars, and so on.  And when it comes right down to it, the Hot Design Nail Art pens are the same exact thing - paint pens filled with nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a little someone that popped up in my life a few years back, I&#x27;ve had to learn how to paint nails.  And though I&#x27;m pretty ok at it and the tiny one loves the color added to the ends of her digits, I think it&#x27;s a pain.  With these though, it&#x27;s way easier!  The thick and fine points on either end of the pens are great for her tiny nails, as well as for drawing small scenes on them.  In terms of hardness, I found that the polish stays just as well as the stuff I&#x27;d been applying by brush.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to like to stick to itself.  I mean, any designs I draw on the top coat of polish appears to come off rather easily, while the base resists coming off for a lot longer.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my little miss, as I had another adult try them out for themselves, and she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the price for what you&#x27;re getting, I think it&#x27;s a reasonable purchase to try out.  And as a Dad, they&#x27;re great for some bonding with your little lady.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I envisioned  when I ordered this item &amp;#34;nail art pens&amp;#34; and it was received promptly.</li>
            <li> Great product - lots of fun!</li>
            <li> This product was a big mess with the nail polish it was a big blob just for one coat. But the pen worked fine.And when it dried I was able to scrap it off with my fingernails</li>
            <li> Cute gift for a young girl</li>
            <li> Product arrived damaged, however I did receive a refund. For the nail pens that were not broken, they worked as desired.</li>
