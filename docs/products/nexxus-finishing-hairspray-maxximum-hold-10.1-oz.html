            <li>I checked and sure enough Amazon has the product.</li>
            <li>The product holds ok, but has a different funky smell.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;This is turn resulting in our checking Amazon prices for other grocery/household items we use regularly.</li>
            <li> This is my all time fav hair spray, can not live without it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and was disappointed that I could not buy it locally.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a less expensive one and this one really works well for me!!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s allways difficult to find the right spot to order by using the reward points....</li>
            <li> I have tried other hairsprays and could not tolerate the smell.  </li>
            <li> is quickly as other sprays.  </li>
            <li> other times  </li>
            <li> We how have it shipped every other month automatically.</li>
            <li> or Would Not Want To Use Any Other Spray.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when I received it.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in local stores, so I always have to purchase it online.  </li>
            <li> The hairspray was just a bad fit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even necessary to finish it off like a hairspray, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money - never again.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stiff as a board and feel like you got glue put in your hair.....</li>
            <li> Holds all day and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or too stiff.</li>
            <li> It provides hold without being stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have search locally and have been unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product causes excessive dry hair.</li>
            <li> I buy it online because it is hard to find at the drugstore or at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this hairspray for years, but is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Works well with my texture of hair..always hard to keep it in place..</li>
            <li> I have been using expensive hair sprays in an effort to control my very thin going-grey hair and they all seemed to leave a heavy film on my hair and left it &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad I no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aerosol for the past 3 years, but hated the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; it gave me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find a spray that works!  </li>
            <li> If you order without looking at the descriptions, you may be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> This is my all time fav hair spray, can not live without it.  Gives me the lift I need.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I have fine hair and I bought it in hopes that it would hold my hair when I curl it. I found it to be incredibly sticky and it ends up ruining my style every time. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it because now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in local stores, so I always have to purchase it online.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> I need a little more hold than this product</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty when I received it. Like the product though.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stiff as a board and feel like you got glue put in your hair.....it doesn&#x27;t smell good and one of the reasons i got it was because it popped up when I typed in hairsprays that smell like coconut.....it in no way does!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good price.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because it works as intended and does not have an offensive odor.  I have tried other hairsprays and could not tolerate the smell.  I buy it online because it is hard to find at the drugstore or at Wal-Mart.  The price is good and I will continue to purchase it until I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> The best sculpting spray around. Have used it for 29 years.</li>
            <li> Just what I need...I think its great.</li>
            <li> I only use this spray for my hair. All the other brands don&#x27;t leave my hair as I like it only this one does!</li>
            <li> This has been my hairspray of choice for several years.  It has a firm hold but brushes out very nicely and doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or dirty is quickly as other sprays.  I was so happy to find it online as the local drugstores stopped carrying it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great holding hairspray that is not sticky or like a helmet.  I would definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Hair spray is a great product.  Hair really stays put after spraying it on your hair. Your hair style really stays put. I use it to help style my hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - excellent hold without stiff hair!  Gives my hair a nice texture and weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad I no longer find it in stores. Amazing finish. Holds but doesn&#x27;t flake, isn&#x27;t super hard, smells amazing! My favorite hairspray. Hold my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I am a child of the sixties and still love my hairspray. This is the only product that really holds well for me. I have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> My new favorite hairspray. Holds all day and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or too stiff. Smells fantastic. Whenever I hug someone they tell me my hair smells so good.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  Quick arrival.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for several years.  I like it because it is a pump not an aerosol spray.  It holds well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and isn&#x27;t sticky.  Apparently it is being discontinued.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores where I shop.</li>
            <li> The product was OK...but it&#x27;s allways difficult to find the right spot to order by using the reward points....sometimes it comes up immediately...other times  I have to go all over searching for it..</li>
            <li> Absolutely....my hair is naturally curly and it&#x27;s difficult to find a spray that works!  I have been using this product for over a year, but cannot find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My wife require a strong hold hair spray. Unfortunately this product causes excessive dry hair. I wasted my money - never again. here I sit with two brand new containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I have used Nexxus products for over 30 years Vita Tress Shampoo, Headdress, Diametress shampoo, Therapy etc. and have been pleased. The hairspray was just a bad fit and I had no idea.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product . Good value.</li>
            <li> I always come back to Nexxus. This product in particular cannot be beat. I use it as a styling spray, just one spritz while my hair is wrapped around a round brush, in sections, and my hair is full and soft and shiny, and it lasts all day. It&#x27;s not even necessary to finish it off like a hairspray, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and will purchase this product again through Amazon.com.  Hairspray was as advertised, and provides excellent hold throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aerosol for the past 3 years, but hated the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; it gave me. No matter what you cover your mouth/nose with, the hair spray will always go into your air way... This product does exactly what I want it to do with my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get all over the place. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have to order it on line!Why is it no longer sold in stores? It is the best there is.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray, but it is so hard to find.  I have allergies to smells and this one smells wonderful.  It holds well, also.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Nexxus hair spray for many years as recommended by her hair stylist. We moved last summer and the stores where we now live do not stock Nexxus. I checked and sure enough Amazon has the product. We how have it shipped every other month automatically. The Amazon price is cheaper than it was in stores in our old home town. No state tax here in NC either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is turn resulting in our checking Amazon prices for other grocery/household items we use regularly. We are now up to 6 products we get every month or every-other month.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this product.  I have search locally and have been unable to find it.  I have used this product for many years and was disappointed that I could not buy it locally.</li>
            <li> I have been using expensive hair sprays in an effort to control my very thin going-grey hair and they all seemed to leave a heavy film on my hair and left it &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34;.  I decided to try a less expensive one and this one really works well for me!!!  It holds the style well, through all kinds of weather.  My only criticism is that it still leaves a film on my hair, like the others but so far it is the best I have found and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this hairspray for years, but is hard to find.  We love the pump spray and how natural it makes our hair look.</li>
            <li> Great product, not sticky and holds very well, I would recommend to anyone with full hair, it keeps it in its place !</li>
            <li> My DH uses this to hold his hair thruout the day.  It provides hold without being stiff.  The non aerosol is nice as it helps keep the spray in the hair and not around the room.</li>
            <li> Works well with my texture of hair..always hard to keep it in place..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with the same issues with their hair..</li>
            <li> This is the only non aerosol hairspray that will really hold my fine hair in place all day without being greasy when you brush and restyle.</li>
            <li> Package and product has changed.  My wife has used this product for years, now they go change it!!  The product holds ok, but has a different funky smell.  If you order without looking at the descriptions, you may be disappointed.  Amazon;s page has both bottles shown , but you will get the new one.</li>
            <li> Please, please do not ever stop having this product available....It is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not need to spray a lot on your hair.....to hold....Love It.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Not or Would Not Want To Use Any Other Spray.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for having it here on your site to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a loyal customer of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this spray but company no longer makes it so glad to get it on Amazon</li>
            <li> All I like to use, holds great, yet stays soft to the touch.  Can&#x27;t find it in my area anywhere else.  Glad you have it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This holding spray does nothing for my hair. I have that mixed chicks hair and it should but it does absolutely nothing.</li>
