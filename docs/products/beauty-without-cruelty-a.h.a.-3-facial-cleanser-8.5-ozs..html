            <li>This cleanser is really the best!!!!!</li>

            <li>It provides a good clean without being drying.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is awesome with wonderful natural calming scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, but it reminds me of my husband&#x27;s shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that if people understand exactly what they are getting, they will be happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I just purchased another bottle for myself and my boyfriend :)</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this face wash when I got it in my IPSY bag.</li>
            <li>When I got it and started using it it seemed more watery than the sample I used.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleanser, along with BWC Vitamin C with Coq10.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser -</li>
            <li>and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this brand; however, this product works it way into your eyes and coats contacts.  </li>
            <li>It never burned my eyes so would be better for non-contact wearers.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff--pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>BWC works so much better in comparison.</li>
            <li>But I feel so much better</li>
            <li>Wonderful alpha hydroxy product overall, especiallly for oily skin tones.</li>
            <li>Bonus, no tear-formula is fantastic!</li>
            <li>am adding something more here..</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use and love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>most* is that I follow up with Kiss</li>
            <li>Love that it is vegan and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I am using this as part of Dr. Oz&#x27;s &#x27;Look 7 Years Younger&#x27; skincare regimen and it is perfect for my needs...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is a great, gentle cleanser for day and night.</li>
            <li>I really love it and it helps keep a majority of my acne away.</li>
            <li>My daughter, and even my son, love it.  </li>
            <li>It had very nice, gentle smell and does miracles to your face.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes my skin feel and look very clean.</li>
            <li>I was looking to switch to a cruelty-free cleanser, and was very excited to get a sample of this stuff in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li>I use it as morning/night facewash and the fragrance is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have to buy the full size!</li>
            <li>refreshing and clean result.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this soap in my monthly Birchbox subscription and immediately fell in love and had to have the full size.  </li>
            <li>Foams up nicely and leaves my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for my combo sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much clearer since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The fact that no animals are used in developing and testing is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Great simple cleanser!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I liked some of them but not this much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, does not contain harmful ingredients, and is kind to animals.   </li>
            <li>With modern research technologies in vitro testing is sufficient, more reproducible, more exacting.</li>
            <li>Along with a good diet and this product I have clear skin</li>
            <li>I originally recieved a trial bottle in my ipsy bag and couldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li>It also helps to control excessive oil production throughout the day, although this is best achieved by the use of an oil balancing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and the product is not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>It has been great to use during the winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>amazing for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I stay away from perfumed lotions with harsh chemical and this one was ideal.</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorite face washes.  </li>
            <li>...at least, the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet takes away most of my makeup in one washing.  </li>
            <li>This is a good facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Im in love with it, the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and helps to clear up my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Got it for my son&#x27;s oily skin, it works good, I like it because it is natural, less chemicals in our life, my son likes it because his skin looks good.</li>
            <li>Great chemical exfoliant, which is recommended for people of richer skin tones who as a result of increased melanin, have much more delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many high ended skin care lines.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, a gentle deep cleanser for oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that its all natural and eco friendly.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t imagine using another facial cleaner and don&#x27;t imagine how this agent can be any more effective than it has been on my very acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves my face feeling absolutely clean and soft WITHOUT feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to squeegee the oil slick off my face every four hours because this combination of products has really been the perfect oil-control.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li>And not too mention the best for sensitive skin since they don&#x27;t come with a lot of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>There is no artificial fragrances according to the label.</li>
            <li>A nice facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have Combination/Oily skin and it is great so far this winter as far as keeping my skin clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I always have found more on the washcloth when I clean my face the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li>The BWC face wash foams a bit, is non-drying to my older skin, and clearly removes dry and old skin cells, With a soft circular hand scrubber the results are as good as any and better than most products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, at least for me, the ingredients are mostly all natural (many organic), vegetarian, and are not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to buy again :)</li>
            <li>My favorite facial cleanser for my aging/oily/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>First tried this when I received a sample size from ipsy.</li>
            <li>Been using it for last four (or more ???)</li>
            <li>This cleanser does a good job removing all impurities but it leaves my skin dried out.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in an ipsy bag a few months ago, and loved it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for over a year and love the way it keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>not that I wear that much makeup (just moisturizer with powder over it), but none of the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have taken every bit off in the first go-round.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend and the price is right too.</li>
            <li>The nature of AHAs is they cause sun-sensitivity and dryness which can be really damaging if you don&#x27;t heed the product&#x27;s warning to wear SPF and moisturize well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Recommended highly!</li>
            <li>Really gets the oil off my face.</li>
            <li>This really helps keep an even tone to my skin without causing irritation or oil build up.</li>
            <li>It removes all makeup gently with no odor.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone as its really cruelty</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Dermatologists maintain that AHA keeps your skin fresh and young looking.  </li>
            <li>I use this in combination with a few drops of Rose Hip Oil and Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased from many other sources and have been using for years.</li>
            <li>have tried so many other cleansers.</li>
            <li>I think its works, lathers well, cleans, dont know about the AHA effects, but it seems to clean well enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with not being able to get my skin completely clear and feeling clean/dry after working a long day.</li>
            <li>Last a long time, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is strong enough to get my make-up off completely</li>
            <li>It is non drying and leaves your face super soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>and it is really for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh but is a good exfoliating cleanser that is mild enough for my teen aged daughter and helps control breakouts</li>
            <li>It is paraben free - and makes my skin feel great....not overly dry like others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is not too harsh and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vegan and not tested on animals, plus the formula really helps to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love this product and originally got it in my December ipsy bag, but when I bought it on here &amp; received it, it had leaked out and got onto my other items &amp; didn&#x27;t have any sort of plastic/sealing/packaging on it, the pump was just down into the &#x27;locked&#x27; position.</li>
            <li>I love the way there is no oily or other residue left after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Only issue I had was with packaging, it arrived open despite what it seemed good packaging and wasted.</li>
            <li>It leaked a little in shipping but other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This cleared them up in a week and my skin has remained clear.  </li>
            <li>and my skin has been completely transformed.</li>
            <li>None of them completely cleaned the makeup off my face.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this has been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have always used neutrogena and or dermalogica.</li>
            <li>I a mature woman who still gets break outs.</li>
            <li>Works very well, I use it daily</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>agent completely eliminated my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Its very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I have very problem skin that is prone to some pretty unsightly acne outbreaks that typically leave me with hyperpigmented scars.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean without feeling stripped and tight.  </li>
            <li>You only have to use a very small amount to get a nice lather</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, it&#x27;s even more difficult as I will still get breakouts from certain products.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really clean and fresh without any of the extra added stuff other companies typically throw into these products.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this from Whole Foods, but since I no longer patronize them, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find this amazing facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>If you have Prime, this will cost you less than on the BWC website and most other websites</li>
            <li>It also does moderately well at drying up new pimples when they appear.</li>
            <li>There is no harsh smell, it does not dry out my face, but does control my acne.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is a mild exfoliated that does not leave my skin feeling dried out and burning.  </li>
            <li>but gentle enough on my sensitive skin that it cleared up the acne and didn&#x27;t leave it dry.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my face feel clean and has cleared my small blemishes up.</li>
            <li>That being said, if you have dry skin I would imagine this face wash would dry your face out if you&#x27;re not using the right</li>
            <li>i use quite a bit of make-up but prefer to use only natural &amp; organic products.</li>
            <li>Amazon says it is for normal to dry skin, but I checked before I bought it</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Was sorry that it didn&#x27;t work for me, my skin isn&#x27;t usually terribly sensitive and I was hoping to find something more organic.</li>
            <li>Within a week, the small bumps (not acne) under my eyes, right along my nose were GONE.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while now and its already suiting my sensitive skin with dry patches.</li>
            <li>I have tried a good deal of facial cleaners, from very expensive to moderate priced.</li>
            <li>This gets off everything, cleans deep down but is gentle at the same time!</li>
            <li>it is very subtle and after the first use you won&#x27;t really think about it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has a very light scent, but it reminds me of my husband&#x27;s shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that if people understand exactly what they are getting, they will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I just purchased another bottle for myself and my boyfriend :)</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this face wash when I got it in my IPSY bag.</li>
            <li> When I got it and started using it it seemed more watery than the sample I used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser, along with BWC Vitamin C with Coq10.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser -</li>
            <li> and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this brand; however, this product works it way into your eyes and coats contacts.  </li>
            <li> It never burned my eyes so would be better for non-contact wearers.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff--pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> BWC works so much better in comparison.</li>
            <li> But I feel so much better</li>
            <li> Wonderful alpha hydroxy product overall, especiallly for oily skin tones.</li>
            <li> Bonus, no tear-formula is fantastic!</li>
            <li> am adding something more here..</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use and love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> most* is that I follow up with Kiss</li>
            <li> Love that it is vegan and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I am using this as part of Dr. Oz&#x27;s &#x27;Look 7 Years Younger&#x27; skincare regimen and it is perfect for my needs...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is a great, gentle cleanser for day and night.</li>
            <li> I really love it and it helps keep a majority of my acne away.</li>
            <li> My daughter, and even my son, love it.  </li>
            <li> It had very nice, gentle smell and does miracles to your face.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my skin feel and look very clean.</li>
            <li> I was looking to switch to a cruelty-free cleanser, and was very excited to get a sample of this stuff in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> I use it as morning/night facewash and the fragrance is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have to buy the full size!</li>
            <li> refreshing and clean result.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this soap in my monthly Birchbox subscription and immediately fell in love and had to have the full size.  </li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and leaves my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for my combo sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much clearer since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The fact that no animals are used in developing and testing is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Great simple cleanser!</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I liked some of them but not this much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, does not contain harmful ingredients, and is kind to animals.   </li>
            <li> With modern research technologies in vitro testing is sufficient, more reproducible, more exacting.</li>
            <li> Along with a good diet and this product I have clear skin</li>
            <li> I originally recieved a trial bottle in my ipsy bag and couldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> It also helps to control excessive oil production throughout the day, although this is best achieved by the use of an oil balancing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and the product is not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> It has been great to use during the winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> amazing for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I stay away from perfumed lotions with harsh chemical and this one was ideal.</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorite face washes.  </li>
            <li> ...at least, the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet takes away most of my makeup in one washing.  </li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Im in love with it, the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and helps to clear up my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Got it for my son&#x27;s oily skin, it works good, I like it because it is natural, less chemicals in our life, my son likes it because his skin looks good.</li>
            <li> Great chemical exfoliant, which is recommended for people of richer skin tones who as a result of increased melanin, have much more delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high ended skin care lines.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, a gentle deep cleanser for oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also love that its all natural and eco friendly.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t imagine using another facial cleaner and don&#x27;t imagine how this agent can be any more effective than it has been on my very acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it leaves my face feeling absolutely clean and soft WITHOUT feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to squeegee the oil slick off my face every four hours because this combination of products has really been the perfect oil-control.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> And not too mention the best for sensitive skin since they don&#x27;t come with a lot of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> There is no artificial fragrances according to the label.</li>
            <li> A nice facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have Combination/Oily skin and it is great so far this winter as far as keeping my skin clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I always have found more on the washcloth when I clean my face the 2nd time.  </li>
            <li> The BWC face wash foams a bit, is non-drying to my older skin, and clearly removes dry and old skin cells, With a soft circular hand scrubber the results are as good as any and better than most products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, at least for me, the ingredients are mostly all natural (many organic), vegetarian, and are not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to buy again :)</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser for my aging/oily/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First tried this when I received a sample size from ipsy.</li>
            <li> Been using it for last four (or more ???)</li>
            <li> This cleanser does a good job removing all impurities but it leaves my skin dried out.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in an ipsy bag a few months ago, and loved it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and clean after every use.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year and love the way it keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> not that I wear that much makeup (just moisturizer with powder over it), but none of the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have taken every bit off in the first go-round.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend and the price is right too.</li>
            <li> The nature of AHAs is they cause sun-sensitivity and dryness which can be really damaging if you don&#x27;t heed the product&#x27;s warning to wear SPF and moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> Really gets the oil off my face.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep an even tone to my skin without causing irritation or oil build up.</li>
            <li> It removes all makeup gently with no odor.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone as its really cruelty</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologists maintain that AHA keeps your skin fresh and young looking.  </li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a few drops of Rose Hip Oil and Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from many other sources and have been using for years.</li>
            <li> have tried so many other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I think its works, lathers well, cleans, dont know about the AHA effects, but it seems to clean well enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with not being able to get my skin completely clear and feeling clean/dry after working a long day.</li>
            <li> Last a long time, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is strong enough to get my make-up off completely</li>
            <li> It is non drying and leaves your face super soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> and it is really for normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh but is a good exfoliating cleanser that is mild enough for my teen aged daughter and helps control breakouts</li>
            <li> It is paraben free - and makes my skin feel great....not overly dry like others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is not too harsh and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vegan and not tested on animals, plus the formula really helps to clear up blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this product and originally got it in my December ipsy bag, but when I bought it on here &amp; received it, it had leaked out and got onto my other items &amp; didn&#x27;t have any sort of plastic/sealing/packaging on it, the pump was just down into the &#x27;locked&#x27; position.</li>
            <li> I love the way there is no oily or other residue left after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had was with packaging, it arrived open despite what it seemed good packaging and wasted.</li>
            <li> It leaked a little in shipping but other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This cleared them up in a week and my skin has remained clear.  </li>
            <li> and my skin has been completely transformed.</li>
            <li> None of them completely cleaned the makeup off my face.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this has been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have always used neutrogena and or dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I a mature woman who still gets break outs.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I use it daily</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> agent completely eliminated my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Its very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very problem skin that is prone to some pretty unsightly acne outbreaks that typically leave me with hyperpigmented scars.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean without feeling stripped and tight.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a very small amount to get a nice lather</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, it&#x27;s even more difficult as I will still get breakouts from certain products.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really clean and fresh without any of the extra added stuff other companies typically throw into these products.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Whole Foods, but since I no longer patronize them, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find this amazing facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> If you have Prime, this will cost you less than on the BWC website and most other websites</li>
            <li> It also does moderately well at drying up new pimples when they appear.</li>
            <li> There is no harsh smell, it does not dry out my face, but does control my acne.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is a mild exfoliated that does not leave my skin feeling dried out and burning.  </li>
            <li> but gentle enough on my sensitive skin that it cleared up the acne and didn&#x27;t leave it dry.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel clean and has cleared my small blemishes up.</li>
            <li> That being said, if you have dry skin I would imagine this face wash would dry your face out if you&#x27;re not using the right</li>
            <li> i use quite a bit of make-up but prefer to use only natural &amp; organic products.</li>
            <li> Amazon says it is for normal to dry skin, but I checked before I bought it</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Was sorry that it didn&#x27;t work for me, my skin isn&#x27;t usually terribly sensitive and I was hoping to find something more organic.</li>
            <li> Within a week, the small bumps (not acne) under my eyes, right along my nose were GONE.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and its already suiting my sensitive skin with dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have tried a good deal of facial cleaners, from very expensive to moderate priced.</li>
            <li> This gets off everything, cleans deep down but is gentle at the same time!</li>
            <li> it is very subtle and after the first use you won&#x27;t really think about it.</li>
            <li> so one bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It never left my skin dry, flaky or feeling tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some left my skin too oily, some too dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is actually a little sensitive to some products as well.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with some dry patches and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it - a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It cleans your face really thoroughly has the highest concentration of AHA Complex (3%) without a prescription.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to fragrance and harsh cleaners, and I have had no problem with this.</li>
            <li> Does had a strange smell buy</li>
            <li> Makes my poor&#x27;s so small and my face feel super soft, almost like I just used an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I have had EXTREMELY oily skin my entire life, and have been prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrances, but if you are, this is fragrance-free!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year now and would not go back to any other.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It suds well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> few people I have recommended this to came back to me to say that their wrinkles are still the same.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about the sun, since this does have AHA.</li>
            <li> This is a winner, especially during the harsh upcoming winter months,</li>
            <li> I STUPIDLY went without wearing sunscreen for a good few months until finally I noticed my dark skin was being heavily damaged!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> In short, I&#x27;ve not used anything aside from this product in the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin though if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> When received bottle had leaked and was only half full :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is watered down.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it was a little thicker, it is quite runny which makes it hard to use with a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
            <li> I will review it again to say if it gets rid of uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s such a valuable and hard to find combination, especially in the cold winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all BWC products are made in the US or just the few I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have hardly any pimples at all, and the flaking is down to hardly anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find a cleanser that cleans my skin without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> I have worked in medical research and animal use is gratuitous and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin that flakes in my T zone once it starts to get cold out.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. It leaked a little in shipping but other than that I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This face wash is perfect for my skin, which is oily and acne-prone. I love that it leaves my face feeling absolutely clean and soft WITHOUT feeling stripped. I use this in combination with a few drops of Rose Hip Oil and Vitamin C Serum and my skin has been completely transformed. I no longer have to squeegee the oil slick off my face every four hours because this combination of products has really been the perfect oil-control. It also does moderately well at drying up new pimples when they appear. That being said, if you have dry skin I would imagine this face wash would dry your face out if you&#x27;re not using the right moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the AHA ingredient. The nature of AHAs is they cause sun-sensitivity and dryness which can be really damaging if you don&#x27;t heed the product&#x27;s warning to wear SPF and moisturize well. I STUPIDLY went without wearing sunscreen for a good few months until finally I noticed my dark skin was being heavily damaged! With the help of a Vit C serum my skin is recovering and I decided it wasn&#x27;t this product&#x27;s fault I didn&#x27;t remedy it&#x27;s precautions. Anyways, I just purchased another bottle for myself and my boyfriend :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, a gentle deep cleanser for oily sensitive skin. I noticed a difference in my skin within a short time and so did my aesthetician.</li>
            <li> I love this product and originally got it in my December ipsy bag, but when I bought it on here &amp; received it, it had leaked out and got onto my other items &amp; didn&#x27;t have any sort of plastic/sealing/packaging on it, the pump was just down into the &#x27;locked&#x27; position. It still leaked...that&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It cleans well and leaves your face moisturized.  I have oily skin and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this soap in my monthly Birchbox subscription and immediately fell in love and had to have the full size.  This cleanser is strong enough to get my make-up off completely but gentle enough on my sensitive skin that it cleared up the acne and didn&#x27;t leave it dry.  That&#x27;s such a valuable and hard to find combination, especially in the cold winter months.  I&#x27;ve ordered a second bottle for my shower because I just don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> I had been using the BWC facial cleanser with Vitamin C. It&#x27;s ok.  Then I recently bought this and started using it instead.  Within a week, the small bumps (not acne) under my eyes, right along my nose were GONE.  I&#x27;d been going to a dermatologist for over a year and he said that there was nothing that could be done except drain them occasionally.  This cleared them up in a week and my skin has remained clear.  I&#x27;m now a big fan!</li>
            <li> Love it! I sampled this cleanser in an Ipsy bag and I fell in love! I have to buy the full size! This stuff smells great and helps to clear up my sensitive skin. I will definitely be buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles of this. Love it. It provides a good clean without being drying.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this face wash when I got it in my IPSY bag.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my skin feel and look very clean. Doesn&#x27;t over-dry your skin or leave it overly greasy; it leaves my face perfectly balanced and fresh and clean! Definitely going to buy again :)</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely and leaves my face clean and fresh. Im acne proned and this helps keep my acne away along with my diet.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing! It&#x27;s perfect for people with oily skin and really helps me with my break outs!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Definitely removes dirt and makeup. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I stay away from perfumed lotions with harsh chemical and this one was ideal. It never left my skin dry, flaky or feeling tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it - a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> good price, cleans well.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this and worked great that&#x27;s why I ordered one on amazon. When I got it and started using it it seemed more watery than the sample I used. Didn&#x27;t work as well as my sample</li>
            <li> This stuff is watered down. I&#x27;ve purchased from many other sources and have been using for years. When you pump it - it runs - you need to pump 3-4 times just to get enough to use and rush it to your face. Never again from this source!</li>
            <li> Love that this is cruelty-free!! This is my favorite cleanser, along with BWC Vitamin C with Coq10. Love the smell and works great for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve struggled with not being able to get my skin completely clear and feeling clean/dry after working a long day. This product makes my face feel clean and has cleared my small blemishes up. I was introduced to this product in my monthly IPSY bag.</li>
            <li> I think its works, lathers well, cleans, dont know about the AHA effects, but it seems to clean well enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all BWC products are made in the US or just the few I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many other cleansers. Some left my skin too oily, some too dry. None of them completely cleaned the makeup off my face. I suffer from blackheads from the makeup clogging my pores. I also have combination skin that flakes in my T zone once it starts to get cold out. I have just started my second bottle, and I see a difference. I have hardly any pimples at all, and the flaking is down to hardly anything. This cleanser seems to normalize my skin and get it a lot cleaner. My skin is sensitive to fragrance and harsh cleaners, and I have had no problem with this. There is no artificial fragrances according to the label. It has a very light scent, but it reminds me of my husband&#x27;s shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few people I have recommended this to came back to me to say that their wrinkles are still the same. I feel the need to clarify that this is just a cleanser, not a wrinkle cream. I think the AHA added to it gives some people the impression that it is like getting a peel at the drs office. It doesn&#x27;t claim to do that. I&#x27;m sure that if people understand exactly what they are getting, they will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorite face washes.  Its very gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  I also love that its all natural and eco friendly.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying. Great simple cleanser!</li>
            <li> i use quite a bit of make-up but prefer to use only natural &amp; organic products. This gets off everything, cleans deep down but is gentle at the same time!</li>
            <li> My favorite facial cleanser for my aging/oily/sensitive skin. Seems to be helping with breakouts and skin irritations. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out either. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this facial cleanser. It is not too harsh and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Also a cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li> I love the way there is no oily or other residue left after using this cleanser. I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. Skin feels clean and the product is not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - my face feels great - never drying and keeps it smooth.  I would highly recommend and the price is right too.</li>
            <li> Takes my makeup off well and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals. I would definitely continue using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. Will definitely order and use again!</li>
            <li> best cleanser i ever tried!! amazing for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser as I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts on my acne prone skin; however, I still have a lot of blackheads. I guess I will have to buy a separate product for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love it.It had very nice, gentle smell and does miracles to your face.Only issue I had was with packaging, it arrived open despite what it seemed good packaging and wasted.</li>
            <li> The product came to me damaged and everything was all sticky.  I would have loved to have tried this product but didn&#x27;t want to risk another damaged package.</li>
            <li> I only use this as my evening cleanser.  In the one month that I&#x27;ve used it, I can say that it does a great job.  It smells great, it foams nicely, and it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin.  I have had EXTREMELY oily skin my entire life, and have been prone to breakouts.  It&#x27;s been hard to find a cleanser that cleans my skin without stripping it.  Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, it&#x27;s even more difficult as I will still get breakouts from certain products.  My skin is actually a little sensitive to some products as well.  This cleanser has improved my skin!  The fact that it is cruelty-free is the icing on the cake.  I am transitioning to all cruelty-free beauty products and this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Got it for my son&#x27;s oily skin, it works good, I like it because it is natural, less chemicals in our life, my son likes it because his skin looks good.</li>
            <li> ...at least, the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing and clean result. Almost no fragrance, and what scent there is is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on non-human animals. Cruelty-free. Superb.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have adult acne and this has been a life saver for me.</li>
            <li> Love this brand; however, this product works it way into your eyes and coats contacts.  It never burned my eyes so would be better for non-contact wearers.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not harsh but is a good exfoliating cleanser that is mild enough for my teen aged daughter and helps control breakouts</li>
            <li> I had to send back as it burned my face and made it itch. Was sorry that it didn&#x27;t work for me, my skin isn&#x27;t usually terribly sensitive and I was hoping to find something more organic. Sadly...this doesn&#x27;t work for me, though it might well for you, so I would give it a try, can always return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It&#x27;s vegan and not tested on animals, plus the formula really helps to clear up blemishes. My only wish is that it was a little thicker, it is quite runny which makes it hard to use with a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I have tried a good deal of facial cleaners, from very expensive to moderate priced. The BWC face wash foams a bit, is non-drying to my older skin, and clearly removes dry and old skin cells, With a soft circular hand scrubber the results are as good as any and better than most products I have used over the years. The fact that no animals are used in developing and testing is a huge plus for me. I have worked in medical research and animal use is gratuitous and unnecessary. With modern research technologies in vitro testing is sufficient, more reproducible, more exacting.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser.  Amazon says it is for normal to dry skin, but I checked before I bought it and it is really for normal to oily skin.  Thank goodness, because I have oily skin!  My skin feels clean without feeling stripped and tight.  No breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff--pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> When received bottle had leaked and was only half full :(</li>
            <li> Most amazing face wash I&#x27;ve ever used! I originally recieved a trial bottle in my ipsy bag and couldn&#x27;t be without it once I finished that. My skin is so soft and clean after every use. I&#x27;ll never use Neutrogena again!! BWC works so much better in comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! I have sensitive skin and have always used neutrogena and or dermalogica. But I feel so much better knowing I use a product that isn&#x27;t tested on animals. It suds well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use daily and I&#x27;m going on 3 months with the same bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful alpha hydroxy product overall, especiallly for oily skin tones. I use it as morning/night facewash and the fragrance is light and refreshing. A little goes a long way and it lathers up nicely.  Bonus, no tear-formula is fantastic! Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> I use nothing but this product on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is great and I will always repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was looking to switch to a cruelty-free cleanser, and was very excited to get a sample of this stuff in an ipsy bag. It really is a great product -- I wound up ordering the full size from Amazon as soon as my sample ran out. It cleanses your skin thoroughly without drying you out, and removes excess oils without leaving your skin stripped. I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrances, but if you are, this is fragrance-free! Just be careful about the sun, since this does have AHA. Always apply your sunscreen before going out!</li>
            <li> Really gets the oil off my face.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep an even tone to my skin without causing irritation or oil build up. I have Combination/Oily skin and it is great so far this winter as far as keeping my skin clean and not dried out. I still have oily skin though in some areas but that is not what this product intends to treat. My point is, if you have oily skin, don&#x27;t expect relief from this product alone. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing this product for years now.  It removes all makeup gently with no odor. You only have to use a very small amount to get a nice lather so one bottle will last a long time.  Great for sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> First tried this when I received a sample size from ipsy. Makes my poor&#x27;s so small and my face feel super soft, almost like I just used an exfoliator. Does had a strange smell buy it is very subtle and after the first use you won&#x27;t really think about it. Extremely good value. Comparable to some facial product I&#x27;ve tried that cost $30-$50.</li>
            <li> Im in love with it, the shipping was super fast. I will purchase this product again in thr future.</li>
            <li> I a mature woman who still gets break outs. However, with is facial wash I not longer have that problem. Along with a good diet and this product I have clear skin and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high ended skin care lines. I liked some of them but not this much. This facial cleanser is awesome with wonderful natural calming scent. I have very sensitive skin with some dry patches and uneven skin tone. I have been using this product for a while now and its already suiting my sensitive skin with dry patches. I will review it again to say if it gets rid of uneven skin tone.I recommend it to everyone as its really cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am adding something more here..I have been using this for a while and now I feel like its not doing enough to my face. Product is good but stopped working after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use and love this cleanser.  It is gentle yet takes away most of my makeup in one washing.  The reason I say *most* is that I follow up with Kiss My Face bar soap (Aloe Vera) to remove any last bits of makeup.  I&#x27;ve found that no matter what facial cleanser I use, I have to go over my face twice...not that I wear that much makeup (just moisturizer with powder over it), but none of the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried have taken every bit off in the first go-round.  I always have found more on the washcloth when I clean my face the 2nd time.  That said, this cleanser is wonderful...I have been using it for over a year now and would not go back to any other.  It is paraben free - and makes my skin feel great....not overly dry like others. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser.  I like that there is no animal testing.  I feel it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I use it daily but I am use to aha products. Last a long time, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this cleanser. There is no harsh smell, it does not dry out my face, but does control my acne. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free products are the best! And not too mention the best for sensitive skin since they don&#x27;t come with a lot of harsh chemicals.  I really like this facial cleanser.  It makes my face feel really clean and fresh without any of the extra added stuff other companies typically throw into these products.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does a good job removing all impurities but it leaves my skin dried out. Would not recommend for normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  It has been great to use during the winter because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Love that it is vegan and not tested on animals.  Feels great to be using a product that is good for the environment and your skin!</li>
            <li> Been using it for last four (or more ???) years</li>
            <li> I am using this as part of Dr. Oz&#x27;s &#x27;Look 7 Years Younger&#x27; skincare regimen and it is perfect for my needs...Will be buying this as soon as I get low!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I received a sample in an ipsy bag a few months ago, and loved it. It&#x27;s very good for my combo sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much clearer since I started using it. I still get the occasional pimple, but I feel this stuff helps to get rid of them quicker. Make sure to moisturize/use sun screen with this stuff! This is a great price for the product as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year and love the way it keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> A nice facial cleanser. BWC &#x3D; Really good quality products.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. Feels like it was made for someone who has an oily T zone face.</li>
            <li> Good, but can buy it cheaper</li>
            <li> need to use this 2-3 times to erase make-ups. I dont recommend this</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Whole Foods, but since I no longer patronize them, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find this amazing facial cleanser. Great chemical exfoliant, which is recommended for people of richer skin tones who as a result of increased melanin, have much more delicate skin. This is a winner, especially during the harsh upcoming winter months,</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It cleans every bit of makeup off of your face.  Mascara, concealer, primer etc.  It is non drying and leaves your face super soft and clear.  I am a Philosophy girl, but found Purity to drying with a Clarisonic.  This cleanser is really the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have Prime, this will cost you less than on the BWC website and most other websites I&#x27;ve seen it on.  It is a great, gentle cleanser for day and night.</li>
            <li> I have very problem skin that is prone to some pretty unsightly acne outbreaks that typically leave me with hyperpigmented scars.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of soaps, gels, and cleaners.  In short, I&#x27;ve not used anything aside from this product in the past 10 years.  During that same time, I can probably count the number of pimples (not breakouts!) that I&#x27;ve had on one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This agent completely eliminated my breakouts.  Additionally, it is a mild exfoliated that does not leave my skin feeling dried out and burning.  It also helps to control excessive oil production throughout the day, although this is best achieved by the use of an oil balancing moisturizer.  I rub over my face for 20-30 seconds and voila...done!  Most importantly, at least for me, the ingredients are mostly all natural (many organic), vegetarian, and are not tested on animals.  There are no synthetic chemicals in this cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one container at home and another in my gym locker.  I just can&#x27;t imagine using another facial cleaner and don&#x27;t imagine how this agent can be any more effective than it has been on my very acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this face wash in one of my Ipsy bags. I really love it and it helps keep a majority of my acne away. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 is the packaging I received it in. The face wash had leaked and the plastic wrap was slimey.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite cleanser and always a great deal from this seller!</li>
            <li> With two washed this did a good job of getting my makeup off. It did dry out my skin though if I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  It cleans your face really thoroughly has the highest concentration of AHA Complex (3%) without a prescription.  Dermatologists maintain that AHA keeps your skin fresh and young looking.  Yet this product never leaves the slightest residue on your face.  My daughter, and even my son, love it.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling of residue left on my face after I wash it.  I apply sunscreen and makeup after I wash my face.  It&#x27;s also very inexpensive, does not contain harmful ingredients, and is kind to animals.   Love it, love it, love it!</li>
