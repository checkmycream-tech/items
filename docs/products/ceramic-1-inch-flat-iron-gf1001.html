            <li>I love this iron</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine about a month or more and</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product unless you want many challenges while trying to use it.</li>

            <li>Very happy with this product, The product comes with a cute pink mat and a cancer ribbon bracelet.</li>
            <li>works perfectly like ever other chi</li>
            <li>I bought my CHI Air from Target two summers ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and comes with a protective cover, so it&#x27;s great for travel and could even fit in a large purse.</li>
            <li>but, I examined it from plugs, led light</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get what you pay for, and I had been hesitant to pay for a CHI all of these years but am SO glad that I did because it&#x27;s been well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron!!</li>
            <li>I received my Iron right before leaving for vacation and was excited to use and take with me.  </li>
            <li>I noticed when I first plugged it in that it wasn&#x27;t heating up nor did the light come on when I switched it on.</li>
            <li>The new one is ok but not like I thought it would be for the money and brand.</li>
            <li>I love the company, they are so professional and the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>First of all I got this product in 3 days</li>
            <li>Heats up fast!</li>
            <li>This iron works great for thick hair</li>
            <li>This one does get pretty hot in the handle though.</li>
            <li>Well I am very positive it is the REAL deal.</li>
            <li>it heated up right away and made my hair so straight effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Works amazing and straightens my hair just like any other Chi.</li>
            <li>I love the Chi flat irons and when mine broke I was stuck without one to get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>This is my first CHI and glad I bought it and the shipping was fast and the product works so good on my thick wavy hair, My hair is very long passed my hips and it toke my 20 minutes to do it</li>
            <li>but it is a third of the price and is still working just fine.</li>
            <li>They have simply used cheap wiring.</li>
            <li>I am one to be very rough with straighteners, as I&#x27;ve had to purchase a new one at least once every 6 months to a year, but this one is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I loved the old one and so far this one seems to be exactly the same but pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more to say about it other than I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a straightener that works!</li>
            <li>I tend to use mine on the highest temp setting, but even a medium temperature is hot enough to REALLY straighten my hair, and I have very kinky, wavy</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>had to send the first one back in a week of having it.</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with THIS product but honestly its the styling product that helps more than the actual flat iron</li>
            <li>The flat iron is hot and will do its job if you don&#x27;t mind some annoyances.</li>
            <li>This is my second Chi, my first one I had for 6 years and the only reason I ended up having to get a new one is because my boyfriend stepped on it and broke it!</li>
            <li>This is a replacement of my old Chi, which I&#x27;ve had since 2006.</li>
            <li>Only worked for 2 days and Amazon will not let you return it , now I will try and send it into chi even though I do not think it is real.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>This was far from the truth.</li>
            <li>I only went one day without having my straight iron.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair straight all day long...</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried when I read one of the reviews about how it didn&#x27;t work and maybe a fake.</li>
            <li>this item has been very well taken care of and has not undergone any extreme use</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a extra thin hair as you will not be able to adjust the temperature.</li>

            <li> I do not twist the flat iron like you would a curling iron, so this should not happen.</li>
            <li> The edges of the flat iron plates also catch on your hair and pull the hair out as you are using it.</li>
            <li> The end of the flat iron where it hinges, pinches and is a safety hazard.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the worst tangling I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> i was a little worried after reading that one review saying they thought it was fake, but it seems authentic to me.</li>
            <li> I have to straighten out the very long cord each time I use it.</li>
            <li> The first day we arrived, I took it out to use and a dirty, old earring came out and upon reviewing the iron itself, it appears used.  </li>
            <li> Money not well spent considering the lack of use it received.</li>
            <li> The only reason I needed to replace the old one was because I burned the cord by wrapping it around the iron while still hot (stupid, I know...).</li>
            <li> I have other hair styling appliances that do not tangle.</li>
            <li> This straightener comes with the usual Chi standard.</li>
            <li> that half damp.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive flat iron to only work for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because I&#x27;ve used this less than ten times and paid so much money.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item with all of the positive reviews (and the price), but was VERY disappointed when after two days of use, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Returned and bought one locally at Target, sad</li>
            <li> First, the cord itself starts to curl very shortly after you begin using it and therefore tangles terribly.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase as I had been looking for a Chi for a long time and thought their name meant that the quality of the product would be high.</li>
            <li> Really unsanitary and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the switch is bad, the cord, or what</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with the CHI ---I bought this to use at home</li>
            <li> but this is absolutely ridiculous!!!  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this!!! Great flat iron!!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. Bought this is August. I noticed when I first plugged it in that it wasn&#x27;t heating up nor did the light come on when I switched it on. I switched it on and off a couple of times and it finally came on. It has worked up until now. I tried to use it Saturday morning and it will not come on. I have plugged it in to several different receptacles and also messed with the red switch on the plug and it will not work. This was an expensive flat iron to only work for a couple of months. Now amazon says I can&#x27;t return it because it is passed the return date. I wish I had not kept it and returned it from the beginning. Dissatisfied customer!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this item just one year and have used it maybe a dozen times...  it is now not working...  this item has been very well taken care of and has not undergone any extreme use but it will not turn on.  Not sure if the switch is bad, the cord, or what but this is absolutely ridiculous!!!  Money not well spent considering the lack of use it received.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of my old Chi, which I&#x27;ve had since 2006. The only reason I needed to replace the old one was because I burned the cord by wrapping it around the iron while still hot (stupid, I know...). I loved the old one and so far this one seems to be exactly the same but pink.</li>
            <li> First of all I got this product in 3 days and I was shocked cause it was a Saturday. Now when I bought this item I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was legit but, I examined it from plugs, led light (step up from power switch), stickers, Cord, warning label engraved and 1-800 number on owner&#x27;s manual and everything seems legit. This is my first CHI and glad I bought it and the shipping was fast and the product works so good on my thick wavy hair, My hair is very long passed my hips and it toke my 20 minutes to do it and I that half damp. Very happy with this product, The product comes with a cute pink mat and a cancer ribbon bracelet.</li>
            <li> Love my CHI !!! Absolutely perfect! Heats up fast! Keeps my hair straight all day long...that&#x27;s saying alot being from southern Louisiana with all this humid weather!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this iron it&#x27;s beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly like ever other chi i&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy because it included the thermal mat.</li>
            <li> Only worked for 2 days and Amazon will not let you return it , now I will try and send it into chi even though I do not think it is real.</li>
            <li> I bought my CHI Air from Target two summers ago and it is still going strong. I am one to be very rough with straighteners, as I&#x27;ve had to purchase a new one at least once every 6 months to a year, but this one is wonderful. It&#x27;s very lightweight and comes with a protective cover, so it&#x27;s great for travel and could even fit in a large purse. I tend to use mine on the highest temp setting, but even a medium temperature is hot enough to REALLY straighten my hair, and I have very kinky, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, and I had been hesitant to pay for a CHI all of these years but am SO glad that I did because it&#x27;s been well worth the money. Nothing that you can find at Sally&#x27;s could compare to this. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second Chi, my first one I had for 6 years and the only reason I ended up having to get a new one is because my boyfriend stepped on it and broke it! I was kind of worried when I read one of the reviews about how it didn&#x27;t work and maybe a fake. Well I am very positive it is the REAL deal. Works amazing and straightens my hair just like any other Chi.Takes out ALL the frizz!! It has all the papers to prove its a Chi and looks just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;If you are having problems with it coming on its probably you just need to press the red button where you plug your straightener in at. I&#x27;ve had mine about a month or more and its Great I don&#x27;t know what more to say about it other than I would recommend this to anyone who is in need of a straightener that works! Also it said 2 day shipping and it literally got to me the NEXT day. I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item with all of the positive reviews (and the price), but was VERY disappointed when after two days of use, it stopped working.  Returned and bought one locally at Target, sad but it is a third of the price and is still working just fine.</li>
            <li> After 6 months mine stopped working. I&#x27;m so mad! I am really disappointed because I&#x27;ve used this less than ten times and paid so much money. This makes me never want to purchase anything from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I love the company, they are so professional and the shipping was really fast. This iron works great for thick hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a extra thin hair as you will not be able to adjust the temperature.</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with the CHI ---I bought this to use at home --but it&#x27;s so compact it&#x27;s been put in the camper box...It will go everywhere I go this summer....the handy bag is just that...handy!!!</li>
            <li> good item recomeded my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I received my Iron right before leaving for vacation and was excited to use and take with me.  The first day we arrived, I took it out to use and a dirty, old earring came out and upon reviewing the iron itself, it appears used.  Really unsanitary and disgusting.</li>
            <li> had to send the first one back in a week of having it. The new one is ok but not like I thought it would be for the money and brand.</li>
            <li> chi is always the way to go for hair straighteners. This one does get pretty hot in the handle though.</li>
            <li> Honestly i bought a chi because everyone raves about how great they are.  It&#x27;s no different than my $40 Revlon. There is nothing wrong with THIS product but honestly its the styling product that helps more than the actual flat iron</li>
            <li> The flat iron is hot and will do its job if you don&#x27;t mind some annoyances. First, the cord itself starts to curl very shortly after you begin using it and therefore tangles terribly. I do not twist the flat iron like you would a curling iron, so this should not happen. They have simply used cheap wiring. I have other hair styling appliances that do not tangle. This is by far, the worst tangling I have ever experienced.

The end of the flat iron where it hinges, pinches and is a safety hazard. I was very disappointed with this purchase as I had been looking for a Chi for a long time and thought their name meant that the quality of the product would be high. This was far from the truth. I would not recommend this product unless you want many challenges while trying to use it.</li>
            <li> it heated up right away and made my hair so straight effortlessly. i was a little worried after reading that one review saying they thought it was fake, but it seems authentic to me.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter recommended it. She also has the blow dryer&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is made in the United States of America&lt;br /&gt;I like American products</li>
            <li> This straightener comes with the usual Chi standard. The pouch is a bonus and I love it.</li>
            <li> I recieved it as a gift and its an awesome and cute straightener! I love it. I would definitely recommend it for anyone. (:</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I love the Chi flat irons and when mine broke I was stuck without one to get ready for work.  I ordered this one at 11:00 am one day and got it the next day after paying for overnight shipping.  I only went one day without having my straight iron.  My last Chi lasted for I know 5 years. This is a great product.  It also came with a lovely Breast cancer bracelet.</li>
