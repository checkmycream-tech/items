            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide very good coverage if you have redness or any kind, but it does go on very smooth and the applicator is great.  </li>

            <li>(fair. )</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got fair skin, try it in store before buying online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product forever</li>
            <li>It is a good consistency and</li>
            <li>It looks great on and blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I got the fair.</li>
            <li>Cover girl makes a lot of great products, but their concealer isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you have nice skin and are just looking to even out your skin then this is great because it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite concealers!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>A favorite for my daughter and I both!</li>
            <li>I love the color as I have a fair complexion and this shade works well with it</li>
            <li>I like to use this as kind of a nose highlighter and to brighten my eyes.</li>
            <li>This would be perfect if there were more color choices because it covers really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and thought it would be fine -</li>
            <li>Omg this is what i need its so easy to use!.</li>
            <li>So I use the stick first and blend well with a concealer brush and sponge then go over it with this concealer in the lightest shade closest to my skin tone  which does go on with great coverage and dries &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; ( that just means invisible by you don&#x27;t look like a raccoon</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and is easy to blend out with yoir fingers or a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>The price was better than Walgreens.</li>
            <li>While you can spread it ok, it&#x27;s somewhat watery and</li>
            <li>It does work somewhat better, however, for touching up a blemish, giving one more accuracy because of the wand</li>
            <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even with coupon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I do hope people get this product and will be as satisfied as I am.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim and am so glad I did.....</li>
            <li>However, I can also use it under my regular makeup routine and it still looks awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have been using concealers for many years now.</li>
            <li>so I make sure to blend it in well.</li>
            <li>For the price it is okay</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It looks cakey if I apply too many layers or if I do not use primer.</li>
            <li>It was a bit cakey in texture, and highlighted every line in the most unflattering way (I&#x27;m 40, not 80).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>followed by foundation on top</li>
            <li>but none better.</li>
            <li>but now I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>So it is light---but has a bit more color than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>look much better.  </li>
            <li>This was a match and the product was does a pretty good job covering under my eyes and where I have a sun spot on my cheek.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try the wand style in hopes it would allow me to spread the makeup around more easily.</li>
            <li>I love how easy the application is and how well it blends into my skin.</li>
            <li>9 times out of 10, I have to remove it completely and try again, hoping I can position it perfectly the first time.</li>
            <li>Depending on which BB cream, I might repeat layering on top lightly to try minimize anything &amp;#34;settling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it is easy to get even coverage with the applicator.</li>
            <li>She loves how easy it blends.</li>
            <li>Easy to obtain too.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it because it was a really good price.</li>
            <li>It perfectly covers my dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li>its not the best but its average</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>blends well, the pigment is more natural than the one I had (NO yellow tint), and is a perfect consistency now that it is spring going into summer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Invisible Concealer in light for about a year now.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>The CoverGirl Invisible Concealer ordered was in the Light shade.</li>
            <li>I purchased light color.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and coverage so much</li>
            <li>Meh.&lt;br /&gt;I got this primarily for under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have always used it &amp; I snagged it on here because I go such a great discount.</li>
            <li>Great product covers enough not to Cakey</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this was because it was cheap</li>
            <li>like to use this by dabbing in light feathery strokes under a BB cream or mineral powder.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for cheap!</li>
            <li>Like so many women, I&#x27;m always on the chase for the right concealer.</li>
            <li>i love this so much.</li>
            <li>I have cool toned skin</li>
            <li>I do not like to wear full foundation, but need something for those pesky flaws.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with concealers, but it works better than Clinique foundation.</li>
            <li>I really like it better than the lighter one I had used.  </li>
            <li>Light to moderate coverage, applies ok, doesn&#x27;t blend all that well or easily but doable.</li>
            <li>I normally buy from Target but found a better price on Amazon with their coupon and so bought it through here.</li>
            <li>The light is too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Great coverage for the little imperfections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>Have fun.</li>
            <li>Which sucks as I was trying to replace an older covergirl concealer I had that was perfect</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as I&#x27;d hoped but the price is right</li>
            <li>I ordered another right away.</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and the lightest color this comes in is just still way to dark.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and blendable but this product really doesnt have much coverage</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper and just as good as other concealer that I have used.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>and I love that it comes in different colors.</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>very affordable product!  </li>
            <li>Good for a few hours, but you&#x27;ll have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Good concealer - no worse than elf&#x27;s although the color could be a little lighter</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the amazing skin of a 20 year old, but also am not a fan of the idea of shelling out extra for something with &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34; in the title.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful in application it will settle in my fine lines (I&#x27;m 40</li>
            <li>I was also surprised how quickly it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Really stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I can use this and an all over powder for a fast makeup routine and not look run over for school drop off.  </li>
            <li>I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li>but it comes off really tan in comparison.</li>
            <li>So if u have bags under your eyes, this if for you  its not sticky at all, blends in very well and doesent ware off.</li>
            <li>Like so much Thanks</li>
            <li>I really am.</li>
            <li>the felt tip let&#x27;s you control how much you want to use.  </li>
            <li>I am platinum to light blonde</li>
            <li>Has only light coverage though.</li>
            <li>Much easier than hunting for it in a store.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is easily applied with a small brush and then I smooth it in with a makeup wedge.</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t cover a deep dark circle, it is okay for a light circle.</li>
            <li>As far as concealers go it&#x27;s an affordable way to feel pretty.</li>
            <li>and I find it mostly covers my dark circles and redness WITHOUT looking like I caked on the makeup.</li>
            <li>It is dark more like a tan.  </li>
            <li>decent cover up..good price</li>
            <li>I ordered this mainly for highlighted and contouring my face.  </li>
            <li>can make you look 5 years older.</li>
            <li>out things I am not fond of, like dark circles, without becoming a facade of me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was a slight bit darker than the one I usually get---but it was a better color and blended with my skin even better.</li>
            <li>I got the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one and the light one was way too dark.</li>
            <li>For $2.50 as an add on purchase and $3.99 for the yellow stick thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine for me, but can be pretty wonky depending on your skintone.</li>
            <li>and it does look very natural , stays on and all combined covers my circles without making me look old,</li>
            <li>A lot of product for only a little bit more than $3.</li>
            <li>, it looks natural yet it covers everything.</li>
            <li>The quality seems okay at least.</li>
            <li>which looks natural..</li>
            <li>Could stay on better; it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li>This works okay, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Previously I used Mac studio finish which is far more expensive the kind that comes in a pot and is supposed to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li>I generally use this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the consistency, it feels a little heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m pretty pale, but this just looks soooo dark on me and is a kinda funny, almost orange tone.</li>
            <li>Looked a little funny.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look caked on, and it really gets rid of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It dries a little too fast to blend in and after a several hours I probably could do with another application.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Invisible Concealer in light for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> The CoverGirl Invisible Concealer ordered was in the Light shade.</li>
            <li> I purchased light color.</li>
            <li> I liked the color and coverage so much</li>
            <li> Meh.&lt;br /&gt;I got this primarily for under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have always used it &amp; I snagged it on here because I go such a great discount.</li>
            <li> Great product covers enough not to Cakey</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this was because it was cheap</li>
            <li> like to use this by dabbing in light feathery strokes under a BB cream or mineral powder.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for cheap!</li>
            <li> Like so many women, I&#x27;m always on the chase for the right concealer.</li>
            <li> i love this so much.</li>
            <li> I have cool toned skin</li>
            <li> I do not like to wear full foundation, but need something for those pesky flaws.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with concealers, but it works better than Clinique foundation.</li>
            <li> I really like it better than the lighter one I had used.  </li>
            <li> Light to moderate coverage, applies ok, doesn&#x27;t blend all that well or easily but doable.</li>
            <li> I normally buy from Target but found a better price on Amazon with their coupon and so bought it through here.</li>
            <li> The light is too dark for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Great coverage for the little imperfections.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Have fun.</li>
            <li> Which sucks as I was trying to replace an older covergirl concealer I had that was perfect</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as I&#x27;d hoped but the price is right</li>
            <li> I ordered another right away.</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and the lightest color this comes in is just still way to dark.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blendable but this product really doesnt have much coverage</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper and just as good as other concealer that I have used.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> and I love that it comes in different colors.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> very affordable product!  </li>
            <li> Good for a few hours, but you&#x27;ll have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Good concealer - no worse than elf&#x27;s although the color could be a little lighter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the amazing skin of a 20 year old, but also am not a fan of the idea of shelling out extra for something with &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34; in the title.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful in application it will settle in my fine lines (I&#x27;m 40</li>
            <li> I was also surprised how quickly it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Really stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I can use this and an all over powder for a fast makeup routine and not look run over for school drop off.  </li>
            <li> I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li> but it comes off really tan in comparison.</li>
            <li> So if u have bags under your eyes, this if for you  its not sticky at all, blends in very well and doesent ware off.</li>
            <li> Like so much Thanks</li>
            <li> I really am.</li>
            <li> the felt tip let&#x27;s you control how much you want to use.  </li>
            <li> I am platinum to light blonde</li>
            <li> Has only light coverage though.</li>
            <li> Much easier than hunting for it in a store.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is easily applied with a small brush and then I smooth it in with a makeup wedge.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t cover a deep dark circle, it is okay for a light circle.</li>
            <li> As far as concealers go it&#x27;s an affordable way to feel pretty.</li>
            <li> and I find it mostly covers my dark circles and redness WITHOUT looking like I caked on the makeup.</li>
            <li> It is dark more like a tan.  </li>
            <li> decent cover up..good price</li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly for highlighted and contouring my face.  </li>
            <li> can make you look 5 years older.</li>
            <li> out things I am not fond of, like dark circles, without becoming a facade of me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a slight bit darker than the one I usually get---but it was a better color and blended with my skin even better.</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one and the light one was way too dark.</li>
            <li> For $2.50 as an add on purchase and $3.99 for the yellow stick thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine for me, but can be pretty wonky depending on your skintone.</li>
            <li> and it does look very natural , stays on and all combined covers my circles without making me look old,</li>
            <li> A lot of product for only a little bit more than $3.</li>
            <li> , it looks natural yet it covers everything.</li>
            <li> The quality seems okay at least.</li>
            <li> which looks natural..</li>
            <li> Could stay on better; it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Mac studio finish which is far more expensive the kind that comes in a pot and is supposed to cover dark circles.</li>
            <li> I generally use this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the consistency, it feels a little heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m pretty pale, but this just looks soooo dark on me and is a kinda funny, almost orange tone.</li>
            <li> Looked a little funny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look caked on, and it really gets rid of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It dries a little too fast to blend in and after a several hours I probably could do with another application.</li>
            <li> I simply wanted something to help with minor darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For me, what it&#x27;s come down to is providing soft coverage to take the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was able to put away my thick concealer stick (which I&#x27;ve never liked, but did the job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it looks like I put straight up pale pink foundation on when I use this.</li>
            <li> as soon as you spread it into the area you want, which for me is my undereye area, it dries super fast and it&#x27;s impossible to make any adjustments.</li>
            <li> goes on light and yet very heavy and hard to cover with make up.</li>
            <li> Not hard to apply, covers dark areas and age spots slightly.</li>
            <li> I have ben using this since college (20 plus years) and find it better than any other concealer even the very expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Later in the day though is seems like its drying out and flaking a little</li>
            <li> came darker than expected</li>
            <li> The color is darker than expected and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I used it as spot concealer on my face because I have minor scarring, and some dark spots, and it worked like a champ.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, the shade was dark, and then the formula was thin.</li>
            <li> VERY pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I am always a bit nervous purchasing makeup online because it can be difficult to determine if the color is what I am really looking for.</li>
            <li> i have dark circles under my eyes and it doesnt do anything to help hide them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m around an NW15 skin tone and this product is wayyy too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> Which means with dark circles I look like the Muenster&#x27;s without makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only concealer I found that doesn&#x27;t cake of ridiculously thick but still covers what I need.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away--the tone is also unnatural and an odd pinkish hue.</li>
            <li> not brown or heaven forbid, black</li>
            <li> If thats not a good enough recommendation, I dont know what is.</li>
            <li> If you have very dark circles like me try both of these.</li>
            <li> (I have pale skin).</li>
            <li> while since I purchased my last stick concealer and the label had come off so without a color chart provided on Amazon, I had to guess the color to order and ended up choosing the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get concealer, but I figured I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li> and I had a weird orange red blotchy look.</li>
            <li> but instead of natural look, it made me look artificial.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I dab a little under my eye everyday and boom!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was useless in regard to the purpose I initially bought it, but it redeemed itself by allowing me to not have to use my concealer stick</li>
            <li> Usual CoverGirl Quality.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not conceal dark circles at all and was very irritating to the eye area overall.</li>
            <li> Is a little on the thin side- need to reapply once throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Helps hide late nights etc.  </li>
            <li> and you do not got that thick makeup look.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> also like to use this as a base for my lips, applying in a very sheer way it provides something to stick to, gives a fuller look and lets the color blossom.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not.</li>
            <li> was not impressed.</li>
            <li> creepy, i&#x27;m in my thirties but concealer</li>
            <li> but it could just be my bad skin.</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer as a base for my eyeshadow for years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This CoverGirl Concealer is just the perfect shade to blend in easily with your skin. Not hard to apply, covers dark areas and age spots slightly. Perfect for under the eye. I love the color as I have a fair complexion and this shade works well with it , You do not have to apply a lot  and it is easy to get even coverage with the applicator.</li>
            <li> The price was better than Walgreens. I got the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; one and the light one was way too dark. Its hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the CoverGirl stick concealer, probably for over 30 years. Thought I&#x27;d try the wand style in hopes it would allow me to spread the makeup around more easily. Unfortunately, it does not. While you can spread it ok, it&#x27;s somewhat watery and as soon as you spread it into the area you want, which for me is my undereye area, it dries super fast and it&#x27;s impossible to make any adjustments. When you try to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; it, it pulls the skin under the eye and doesn&#x27;t want to come off. 9 times out of 10, I have to remove it completely and try again, hoping I can position it perfectly the first time. It&#x27;s NOT practical for that area at all. It does work somewhat better, however, for touching up a blemish, giving one more accuracy because of the wand size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s been while since I purchased my last stick concealer and the label had come off so without a color chart provided on Amazon, I had to guess the color to order and ended up choosing the wrong shade. I should have ordered &amp;#34;Fair&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34;. Fair is the lightest color they offer, just FYI.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even with coupon. Really stays on all day.</li>
            <li> came darker than expected</li>
            <li> It perfectly covers my dark spots under my eyes. I usually don&#x27;t get concealer, but I figured I&#x27;d try this product. I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s worth the price and you get a good product. I do hope people get this product and will be as satisfied as I am.</li>
            <li> Light to moderate coverage, applies ok, doesn&#x27;t blend all that well or easily but doable. The color is alright and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize. I&#x27;m using it to cover hyper pigmentation and it does an alright job but I probably wont buy it again. It dries a little too fast to blend in and after a several hours I probably could do with another application.</li>
            <li> I was using another drug store brand name stick concealer this winter.  I tried this on a whim and am so glad I did..... blends well, the pigment is more natural than the one I had (NO yellow tint), and is a perfect consistency now that it is spring going into summer.  Works on both under eye circles, blemishes, and boosting contouring.  I can use this and an all over powder for a fast makeup routine and not look run over for school drop off.  ;)  However, I can also use it under my regular makeup routine and it still looks awesome.  Will continue using this one!</li>
            <li> Good product. I am always a bit nervous purchasing makeup online because it can be difficult to determine if the color is what I am really looking for. This was a match and the product was does a pretty good job covering under my eyes and where I have a sun spot on my cheek. Good price as well. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer on red spots on my face. I have been using concealers for many years now. I like this one a lot because it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a big plaster on, it looks natural yet it covers everything.</li>
            <li> Nice color and covers imperfections well! Very nice product!</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer. It was a bit darker than I thought it was going to be. I&#x27;m fair skinned and thought it would be fine - but it comes off really tan in comparison. The product itself is easily applied with a small brush and then I smooth it in with a makeup wedge. As far as concealers go it&#x27;s an affordable way to feel pretty. I will just need to search for a lighter version of it. (: 5 stars for ease of use and longevity.</li>
            <li> decent cover up..good price</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conceal as well as I&#x27;d hoped but the price is right</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and blendable but this product really doesnt have much coverage i have dark circles under my eyes and it doesnt do anything to help hide them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl Invisible Concealer in light for about a year now. This concealer falls somewhere between a liquid and a cream. I generally use this (I like the doe foot applicator) under my eyes after applying my BB cream and I find it mostly covers my dark circles and redness WITHOUT looking like I caked on the makeup. If I&#x27;m not careful in application it will settle in my fine lines (I&#x27;m 40+) so I make sure to blend it in well. I would say, with almost daily use, the tube lasts me about 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> Omg this is what i need its so easy to use!. Fantastic</li>
            <li> i love this so much. It is very good at covering under my eyes. So if u have bags under your eyes, this if for you  its not sticky at all, blends in very well and doesent ware off. A lot of product for only a little bit more than $3. Get it. You woulnt regret.</li>
            <li> The only concealer that I will ever use! perfect coverage! It doesn&#x27;t look caked on, and it really gets rid of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly for highlighted and contouring my face.  It doesn&#x27;t provide very good coverage if you have redness or any kind, but it does go on very smooth and the applicator is great.  If you have nice skin and are just looking to even out your skin then this is great because it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> This is great for my daughter to use to cover blemishes.  She loves how easy it blends.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout but otherwise good coverage</li>
            <li> Excellent lightweight coverage!! Helps hide late nights etc.  I found this to be an excellent cover-up.  It does not look cakey.  It does sometimes need to be reapplied towards the evening depending on what you have done during the day.  This is much cheaper and just as good as other concealer that I have used.</li>
            <li> Go to cover my pimples</li>
            <li> Makes me break out, but a great color!</li>
            <li> Received on time.  Like so much Thanks</li>
            <li> Great coverage for the little imperfections.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t cover a deep dark circle, it is okay for a light circle. For the price it is okay but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the consistency, it feels a little heavy on my skin. But the color is perfect for my fair skin and I loved the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good color for my fair to mediumish skin. I have alot of redness around blemishes and scars leftover from acne and this definitely evens it out. Later in the day though is seems like its drying out and flaking a little but it could just be my bad skin. Overall good product for cheap!</li>
            <li> VERY pink undertones. I have cool toned skin but it looks like I put straight up pale pink foundation on when I use this. Not good.</li>
            <li> The CoverGirl Invisible Concealer ordered was in the Light shade. First off, the shade was dark, and then the formula was thin. Unfortunately, this product did not conceal dark circles at all and was very irritating to the eye area overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased light color. Put it on. I looked in the mirror after and I had a weird orange red blotchy look. It is dark more like a tan.  This is not something to wear alone. I had to fill in the white  parts and covered my face in foundation then powder. You couldn&#x27;t see the blotchy but my face was a lot darker than my neck and chest. Looked a little funny. BAD. I will stick with my alamay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer as a base for my eyeshadow for years. It lasts FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> I have ben using this since college (20 plus years) and find it better than any other concealer even the very expensive ones. If thats not a good enough recommendation, I dont know what is.</li>
            <li> matched my skin tone (fair. )But it didnt cover any redness and didnt cover undereye circles either. Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> The light is too dark for my fair skin. I had to throw it away--the tone is also unnatural and an odd pinkish hue. Not flattering on my skin even when blended out. If you&#x27;ve got fair skin, try it in store before buying online.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Could stay on better; it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> Good concealer - no worse than elf&#x27;s although the color could be a little lighter (I have pale skin).</li>
            <li> This works okay, but it definitely isn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Did not like this concealer at all. I mainly purchased it because it was a really good price. Guess you get what you pay for. The color is darker than expected and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to look a bit younger than I’m but instead of natural look, it made me look artificial.</li>
            <li> Best for very fair skin- I have very fair skin and blends perfectly. Is a little on the thin side- need to reapply once throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product forever and I love that it comes in different colors. Anyways, I dab a little under my eye everyday and boom!! I&#x27;m no longer LOOKING like the sleep deprived mom I really am. It&#x27;s also great for any acne blemishes or you can even use it it cove up red blemishes. It&#x27;s something everyone should always have on them.</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and the lightest color this comes in is just still way to dark. This would be perfect if there were more color choices because it covers really well.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer every day, works great for me.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to write a review every time I get it because I have it on my subscribe and save order.</li>
            <li> I have used this concealer for years and I love it.  It is a good consistency and the felt tip let&#x27;s you control how much you want to use.  I will continue to purchase this as it is the best I have found at the price.</li>
            <li> I was definitely expecting this product to be a lighter colour.  I&#x27;m around an NW15 skin tone and this product is wayyy too dark for me.  The quality seems okay at least.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this concealer. I do not like to wear full foundation, but need something for those pesky flaws. This has great coverage without having to use a lot and you do not got that thick makeup look. I find it best used with a concealer brush to evenly spread where needed. I liked the color and coverage so much I ordered another right away.</li>
            <li> I am platinum to light blonde and this is the only pencil I can find that works with my hair color it&#x27;s a shade or two darker which looks natural..not brown or heaven forbid, black</li>
            <li> Almost no coverage. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I like to use this as kind of a nose highlighter and to brighten my eyes. Has only light coverage though. It looks cakey if I apply too many layers or if I do not use primer.</li>
            <li> It looks great on and blends nicely.</li>
            <li> Yes, I will buy this again !!</li>
            <li> Meh.&lt;br /&gt;I got this primarily for under my eyes. I&#x27;m 40,so I don&#x27;t have the amazing skin of a 20 year old, but also am not a fan of the idea of shelling out extra for something with &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34; in the title. I simply wanted something to help with minor darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed. It was a bit cakey in texture, and highlighted every line in the most unflattering way (I&#x27;m 40, not 80).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I used it as spot concealer on my face because I have minor scarring, and some dark spots, and it worked like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;So I was able to put away my thick concealer stick (which I&#x27;ve never liked, but did the job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it was useless in regard to the purpose I initially bought it, but it redeemed itself by allowing me to not have to use my concealer stick anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware though...it definitely has a rosey undertone. That&#x27;s fine for me, but can be pretty wonky depending on your skintone.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite concealers! I have always used it &amp; I snagged it on here because I go such a great discount.</li>
            <li> Really like this product! I purchased this along with a Maybelline yellow cover stick. Previously I used Mac studio finish which is far more expensive the kind that comes in a pot and is supposed to cover dark circles. That didn&#x27;t work so well, i came out orangey and it created creases it&#x27;s now my eyeshadow primer which works fab for that purpose. So I use the stick first and blend well with a concealer brush and sponge then go over it with this concealer in the lightest shade closest to my skin tone  which does go on with great coverage and dries &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; ( that just means invisible by you don&#x27;t look like a raccoon but it&#x27;s not invisible in coverage) followed by foundation on top and it does look very natural , stays on and all combined covers my circles without making me look old, creepy, i&#x27;m in my thirties but concealer can make you look 5 years older. It&#x27;s the best ever! For $2.50 as an add on purchase and $3.99 for the yellow stick thanks Amazon! If you have very dark circles like me try both of these. Love it! P.S. my skin color is very fair. Which means with dark circles I look like the Muenster&#x27;s without makeup. Have fun.</li>
            <li> very affordable product!  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff daily! I normally buy from Target but found a better price on Amazon with their coupon and so bought it through here. It&#x27;s the only concealer I found that doesn&#x27;t cake of ridiculously thick but still covers what I need. Love it!</li>
            <li> Usual CoverGirl Quality.  I use it under my eyes and dot it where needed.</li>
            <li> its not the best but its average</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with concealers, but it works better than Clinique foundation.</li>
            <li> I love how easy the application is and how well it blends into my skin. The wand is the perfect shape to use as a eye shadow primer. Plus this came in a pack of 2 so I know I don&#x27;t have to reorder until I open my second package!</li>
            <li> A favorite for my daughter and I both! Great Quality Product</li>
            <li> I have used concealer for forty years. I&#x27;ve had more expensive concealer but none better. Easy to obtain too.</li>
            <li> goes on light and yet very heavy and hard to cover with make up.</li>
            <li> Great product covers enough not to Cakey</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this was because it was cheap but now I am in love with it. It works wonders and is a lot cheaper on amazon then in the store. The color actually matches my skin tone. It goes on nice and is easy to blend out with yoir fingers or a beauty blender. This is a definite rebuY!</li>
            <li> I got the fair. I know I&#x27;m pretty pale, but this just looks soooo dark on me and is a kinda funny, almost orange tone. Which sucks as I was trying to replace an older covergirl concealer I had that was perfect</li>
            <li> Like so many women, I&#x27;m always on the chase for the right concealer. For me, what it&#x27;s come down to is providing soft coverage to take the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; out things I am not fond of, like dark circles, without becoming a facade of me.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this by dabbing in light feathery strokes under a BB cream or mineral powder. Depending on which BB cream, I might repeat layering on top lightly to try minimize anything &amp;#34;settling&amp;#34; in.&lt;br /&gt;I also like to use this as a base for my lips, applying in a very sheer way it provides something to stick to, gives a fuller look and lets the color blossom.</li>
            <li> Cover girl makes a lot of great products, but their concealer isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t have staying power. Good for a few hours, but you&#x27;ll have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It was a slight bit darker than the one I usually get---but it was a better color and blended with my skin even better. So it is light---but has a bit more color than I thought it would.  I really like it better than the lighter one I had used.  Now for the different part.  I have like 3 age spots on each hand and that is what I use it for.  I cover the three spots on each hand--blend and my hands look much better.  I think anyone would thing they were much younger hands than the 69+ years I am.  The Concealer blends beautifully.  I was also surprised how quickly it arrived.  Much easier than hunting for it in a store.  I will order again.</li>
