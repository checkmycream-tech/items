            <li>I have serious undereyes circles and these little concealers hide them better than any high end concealers</li>
            <li>For a brown skinned woman like myself I need a dark orange to cover the little dark spots on my face, not the light orange that some of these higher brands sell.</li>
            <li>I had to wait at least 20 minutes for the concealer to cool off a bit &amp; the actually try to use it &amp; see the actual orange color.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this is watery when the other concealers by L.A. Girl have a good, thick, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>The deep orange color really works for people with very dark circles.</li>

            <li> It turns my foundation into a strong weird orange color..</li>
            <li> I use it under my regular concealer &amp; it keeps my dark circles from reappearing, even if my normal concealer fades slightly during the day.</li>
            <li> It covers the dark circles like no other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> like this product because of the price but am not sold on it for long term usage.</li>
            <li> it was just a very water like, clear liquid, I&#x27;m not sure if it had to do with the temperature because Florida&#x27;s been 97 degrees lately</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very drying which is not a good thing for under eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I like that because it actually corrects dark areas.</li>
            <li> Having dark circles under my eyes has been a life long problem that I&#x27;ve tried to cover up for a long time.</li>
            <li> and you really only need a little</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the one I received seemed to be dried out.</li>
            <li> The color is as expected.  </li>
            <li> the woman in the video had some of the same trouble spots as me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does smear so be careful not to use too much&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It comes out quite thin but highly pigmented</li>
            <li> Was extremely dark and opaque and did not provide the coverage I expected.</li>
            <li> The tip can be a little difficult to control the amount of product dispensed but still well worth it.</li>
            <li> It works cover my dark circles</li>
            <li> If you have dark circles or hyper-pigmentation, buy this NOW.</li>
            <li> For example, if I blend well, I can use this and just a powder and have it correct my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I place it ONLY on the dark areas, and not the entire undereye, as I am merely trying to correct the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bright orange, but definitely is orange and not light salmon or pink.</li>
            <li> So my scars are black and I have a greyish tint around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to use too much otherwise you&#x27;ll look crazy.</li>
            <li> It does even it out a little bit</li>
            <li> And when I put this on my face to correct the uneven color and then apply my foundation .</li>
            <li> I am crying with frustration.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover anything if you use a little but looks terrible if you use more.</li>
            <li> I have dark purple veiny dark circles and this turns into a dark shade of red once blended instead of giving me a corrected slightly reddish or orange base for my concealer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an orange concealer &amp; they&#x27;re hard to find in store.</li>
            <li> All in all, not good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry, very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> The four stars is for the horrible brush applicator that feels irritating when you apply it under your eye, especially after you&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Useless junk.</li>
            <li> After I used lighter color to cover the terrible orange, the dark circles appear again.</li>
            <li> that looks like I just had a bad orange  artificial tan..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I really like this concealer because it covers my very very blue under eye circles! All I have to do is put a light concealer on over this and it looks like my eyes are awake and replenished. I really like this although it does dry fast when applying so you have to be quick with it... It sometimes shows through the concealer i put on over it through out the day but I think I just need to buy a thicker concealer to go on over it. All in all great product if you want to mask your blue under eyes! :)</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. It covers the dark circles like no other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer if you have dark circles under your eyes. I apply a little of the orange under my normal concealer, and it really does work. The only thing is that the one I received seemed to be dried out. Not a lot of product would come out, so I&#x27;m wondering if I received an old one.</li>
            <li> This concealer is darker than I expected, but that is a good thing! Often corrective concealers are geared more towards the lighter skin tones, and thus does not completely cover dark spots or circles. This concealer is pure orange! Not peach or salmon, and I like that because it actually corrects dark areas. Only thing I&#x27;m not too fond is the fact that you can&#x27;t really wear this by itself, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, so I like correctors that can stand on their own without you looking orange. This is not meant to be worn alone, and I understand that, but it still works great and does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have serious undereyes circles and these little concealers hide them better than any high end concealers and I have tried a lot.</li>
            <li> It works cover my dark circles</li>
            <li> the orange color alters the color of the foundation you put on top of it...not the concealer for me. I have a caramel color on the rest of my body but my face has alot of hyperpigmentations. And when I put this on my face to correct the uneven color and then apply my foundation . It turns my foundation into a strong weird orange color..that looks like I just had a bad orange  artificial tan..</li>
            <li> The color is as expected.  It comes out quite thin but highly pigmented which is great because it will be less likely to crease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this right after an eye cream, but before any other product.  I squirt a little from the brush tip applicator onto my own brush, and lightly draw it over the purple and blue circles under my eye.  I place it ONLY on the dark areas, and not the entire undereye, as I am merely trying to correct the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the corrector I apply a liquid foundation.  I use a beauty blender but make sure to dab and not rub as you do not want to mix the colors.  Lastly, I apply a light colored concealer in the same fashion that I applied the foundation.</li>
            <li> Excellent for color correcting. Nice consistency. Blendable. If you have dark circles or hyper-pigmentation, buy this NOW.</li>
            <li> This is a deep orange (Oompa Loompa Orange) I tried blending it with another concealer to try and reduce the fake-tan-tinge it has but to no avail. It really didn&#x27;t do much to hide dark circles. It&#x27;s also very drying which is not a good thing for under eye makeup. All in all, not good.</li>
            <li> I think it makes me more oily than I already am but it does its job fairly for the price</li>
            <li> Love it! Be careful very pigmented you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> Works really well and you really only need a little</li>
            <li> This is the best orange corrector I&#x27;ve found. Neutralizes undereye circles. Blends well under concealer.</li>
            <li> I love this product it covers my dark circlescircles.</li>
            <li> Covers dark circles perfectly! Apply this and then your normal concealer and it covers them perfectly! Cannot recommend this product enough. The price makes it even better. :)</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles so after reading the good reviews I bought this. Very disappointed. It&#x27;s very dry, very difficult to apply. Doesn&#x27;t cover anything if you use a little but looks terrible if you use more. After I used lighter color to cover the terrible orange, the dark circles appear again. Useless junk. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I am a dark-skinned girl w/skin the shade of maybe toffee or almond. So my scars are black and I have a greyish tint around my mouth. I&#x27;m not ashamed of my skin and most days I do only powder or tinted moisturizer, but I do enjoy a flawless look when I actually wear foundation. I started with the M A C peach lustre and it was just way too light. A friend recommended this product to me and I could hug her! I watched some YT video before using and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s funny b/c the woman in the video had some of the same trouble spots as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it over my primer and mattifier in all the spots I wanted to test. I then took a concealer brush and blended. NOT to the point where I couldn&#x27;t see it, but blended it to fade. Then I used my UD Naked foundation over it with a stippling brush. I was so impressed! I wore it for hours today. My only regret is not taking a picture</li>
            <li> This is great! Looks and feels amazing. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great concealer for people with dark circle</li>
            <li> Yesssss the best thing that happened to my spots lol....shipping came like an a day cant believe how fast la pro came</li>
            <li> This product in addition to the concealers works so well. The deep orange color really works for people with very dark circles. The tip can be a little difficult to control the amount of product dispensed but still well worth it. Just be careful not to use too much otherwise you&#x27;ll look crazy. Using it with a damp beauty blender seems to work best</li>
            <li> Excellent! It&#x27;s cheap in price but it works just as good as other brands. To be honest it works better. For a brown skinned woman like myself I need a dark orange to cover the little dark spots on my face, not the light orange that some of these higher brands sell. This covers EVERYTHING and more! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an orange concealer &amp; they&#x27;re hard to find in store. This one does the trick. It&#x27;s easy to apply &amp; blends easily. I use it under my regular concealer &amp; it keeps my dark circles from reappearing, even if my normal concealer fades slightly during the day.</li>
            <li> I have dark purple veiny dark circles and this turns into a dark shade of red once blended instead of giving me a corrected slightly reddish or orange base for my concealer. It does even it out a little bit but i could go without it. great price though</li>
            <li> Loving this under eye concealer for dark circles/puffy eyes better then using a red or bright orange lipstick . Works wonders !!!</li>
            <li> Was extremely dark and opaque and did not provide the coverage I expected. If you are are fair skinned, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> The four stars is for the horrible brush applicator that feels irritating when you apply it under your eye, especially after you&#x27;ve used it for awhile. This is a true orange color. It&#x27;s not a bright orange, but definitely is orange and not light salmon or pink. It is not bright orange (like the MAC), but it has a good balance of color. It works great as a color corrector on my dark skin. Depending on your skin tone, this may be too orange for you and you may need a more salmon color. For example, if I blend well, I can use this and just a powder and have it correct my dark circles under my eyes. A tip is that the saturation of the corrector should match the saturation of the area you are correcting. If you have light areas you want to correct, you need a lighter product. I would buy this again and use it with a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great color corrector. Much more pigmented than others so you may want to apply it with a lighter hand. Overall great corrector for dark spots</li>
            <li> This is a good color corrector.  However, this is the first one that I&#x27;ve ever had, so I don&#x27;t have a good comparison.  One issue that I have is that it appears to be watery.  When I squeeze the bottle to get the product, at times I get water drops instead of product.  I shake it up and can hear the product moving around.  Not sure why this is watery when the other concealers by L.A. Girl have a good, thick, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR DARK CIRCLES. Blend with your normal concealer so that you don&#x27;t see the orange</li>
            <li> What the heck is this?  I cannot believe the color looks like a blush you would put on your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;When I put in under my eyes, I looked like a clown.  I am crying with frustration.  I feel I&#x27;ve been duped.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, however when I first opened it it was just a very water like, clear liquid, I&#x27;m not sure if it had to do with the temperature because Florida&#x27;s been 97 degrees lately or it was just the way the product was supposed to be.. I had to wait at least 20 minutes for the concealer to cool off a bit &amp; the actually try to use it &amp; see the actual orange color. I still give it three stars because its working fine I just didn&#x27;t like the process.</li>
            <li> way darker than picture</li>
            <li> This is the perfect salmon colored concealer for us dark circle girls. It helps to cancel out bluish/ purple circles. It&#x27;s a creamy consistency without being too slippery and melting off your face, but I do set it with powder to extend its longevity.</li>
            <li> Having dark circles under my eyes has been a life long problem that I&#x27;ve tried to cover up for a long time. I finally ventured into sephora and asked for help and they suggested an orange concealer for color correction. I didn&#x27;t even know they made orange concealer so I was pretty pumped when I saw the results. After seeing the price tag, I turned to the Internet for a cheaper solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this does not cover as well as the sephora alternative, it covers better than any other concealer I&#x27;ve tried. It blends nicely with my other makeup, but I must not be using enough or blending correctly under my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t completely take away the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because of the price but am not sold on it for long term usage.</li>

            <li> perfect for hiding dark circles ,, great customer service</li>
            <li> Great product for covering dark circles under the eyes. Use this before using a lighter color concealer for highlighting under the eye.</li>
