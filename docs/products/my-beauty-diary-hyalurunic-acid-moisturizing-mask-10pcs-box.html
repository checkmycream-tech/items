            <li>they are nice masks.</li>
            <li>These felt really nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is one of the most effective anti-aging ingredients, should be incorporated in everyones skin routine (plus vit C and retinol).</li>
            <li>My Beauty Diary makes the best masks by far.</li>
            <li>Love love love these things!</li>
            <li>So make sure you get it nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li>A good mask for the price, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super affordable, which is awesome because sheet masks can really pile up in cost.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Korean face masks.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A friend introduced me to these moisturizing masks and the hyalluronic is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is honestly so refreshing in the summer time.  </li>
            <li>I love to use these when moisturizer just won&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work magic</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of them, and my favorites are the Imperial Bird&#x27;s Nest masks because they are the most hydrating.</li>
            <li>You would think that the Hyaluronic Acid would be the most hydrating, but that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the mask.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I love these and reorder every time I run out</li>
            <li>These masks are really hydrating and at a great price for the quality.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I&#x27;m actually planning to buy more!</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is good size and LOADED with serum (package was &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; which scared me at first).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy again?: NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying these masks, i&#x27;d say theyre good if you have nothing else to use and need a good at home facial</li>
            <li>fine lines dissapear and you will be glowing.</li>
            <li>It really softens your skin and yes, it does give you a really nice glow.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling ooh so smoothly.</li>
            <li>These feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Another fantastic Beauty Diary mask.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>and I left the mask on beyond the 20 minutes because it felt so great.  </li>
            <li>I would use these during finals week and my skin would look great even though I&#x27;m totally under-rested.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin feeling very plumped and hydrated and this is a much more affordable option then many I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a sheet mask, but this wasn&#x27;t the right one for me.</li>
            <li>Feel great after using it in dry climate like Colorado.</li>
            <li>truly amazing, much better than the older generations, very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these masks.</li>
            <li>It is also good for daily use in winter.</li>
            <li>Great product for all ages and gentle enough for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>The fit of the masks varies very much between the masks made for Asia and the United States.</li>
            <li>It comes in a very cutely box and this specific mask is for hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love trying new face masks</li>
            <li>Although your dog, cat or significant other may mistake you for a mummy while you&#x27;re treating yourself, but it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>very moisturizing ~~~easily matches with my face~~</li>
            <li>Very hydrating, easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more from this brand!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s filled with more than enough liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>this is definitely a must-buy kind of moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li>They made my skin feel soft and they have a nice, floral scent to them, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this mask, I ordered already three times.it works.makes my skin soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>My age spots are a different story:-)</li>
            <li>Most of moister liquid is left in the bag and feels like just water, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I first saw them in a day spa and wondered what was on everyone&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely soaked w/serum!</li>
            <li>very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>These leave my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>they smell like hot dogs (?)</li>
            <li>My skin improved a lot after the first try.</li>
            <li>I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying.</li>
            <li>First time using today.  </li>
            <li>especially if it&#x27;s the night before a big event like a prom or wedding).&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, a quick fix for normal skin, but not the best choice for sensitive, teenage, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>There are other masks out there that are made with better materials that will show results after the first use.</li>
            <li>This really seems to help.  </li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and I have to say: this mask is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but when I take off this mask it&#x27;s still very moist.</li>
            <li>a much needed pick me up.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again because it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing - results are temporary.</li>
            <li>After much deliberation I bought this My Beauty Diary product.</li>
            <li>Very cooling and moisturizing, and I can tell they plump the lines and add a lot of moisture because when I peel the mask off, any wrinkles I missed in the fabric are indented in my skin, while everything else is plumped.  </li>
            <li>They were very cooling and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I find the ones made for the United States that you can get at Walmart are much wider.</li>
            <li>amazon really needs to evaluate the quality of their suppliers.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much excess serum</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>I like this kind of facial mask and it does deep moisture for my face.</li>
            <li>It was also kind of a pain in the butt to get it properly draped over my face, given the sizing and the cuts where you&#x27;re supposed to drape it--I got it right after a couple of tries, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the residue on my hands from it.</li>
            <li>Super convenient to use as they are individually packaged and really relaxing.  </li>
            <li>serum is runnier than most, it dripped down my chin</li>
            <li>My skin always feels super nourished afterwards and they are definitely moisturizing!</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel noticeably more moisturized after using it and I actually broke out the next day</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone-</li>
            <li>Like too wide unless your face is huge.</li>
            <li>make my skin very moisted and soft</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found a product that works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>And, to add insult to injury, the next day I woke up with two cysts on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note - for those with teenage, acne-prone, or sensitive skin - that the cysts could have been from something else, but I thought it crucial to include it just in case you buy this</li>
            <li>They leave your face pretty shiny, so I would only use them before bed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have no trouble using these.  </li>
            <li>Living in an area where the weather is cold and dry, it is important to keep my skin hydrated and looking good.</li>
            <li>And I found this is very different from the real one.</li>
            <li>It feels very different from the real one.</li>
            <li>Also, the cover of the product is different from real one.</li>
            <li>The texture of the box also feels very different from the real one.</li>
            <li>After use it ,it really works, my skin is getting better,smooth and white.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and plumpy</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so the first time I used it I only left it on for about 15min to see how my skin would handle it.</li>
            <li>at 50 years old my skin looks like im in my late 20&#x27;s lol, by the 3rd application dark spots</li>
            <li>I looked in a magnifying mirror a few hours later and some of the fine lines in my cheeks (I&#x27;m old...) were gone!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that after using this mask, the next day my pores are smaller, my breakouts are less red, and my face is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>how well-fitting the mask is (which I sometimes find to be a problem since masks don&#x27;t always fit my fairly small face) and how hydrating it is.</li>
            <li>I have used a hyaluronic acid serum before moisturizing after the shower to help with my chronically dry skin (I get eczema if I don&#x27;t moisturize religiously), and I really like it, so I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>no results (so far i&#x27;ve used 4 in the last 2 weeks)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I let it sit in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>this mask felt very watered down in terms of quality and product.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s filled with more than enough liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> this is definitely a must-buy kind of moisturizing mask.</li>
            <li> They made my skin feel soft and they have a nice, floral scent to them, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, I ordered already three times.it works.makes my skin soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> My age spots are a different story:-)</li>
            <li> Most of moister liquid is left in the bag and feels like just water, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I first saw them in a day spa and wondered what was on everyone&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely soaked w/serum!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> These leave my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> they smell like hot dogs (?)</li>
            <li> My skin improved a lot after the first try.</li>
            <li> I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying.</li>
            <li> First time using today.  </li>
            <li> especially if it&#x27;s the night before a big event like a prom or wedding).&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, a quick fix for normal skin, but not the best choice for sensitive, teenage, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> There are other masks out there that are made with better materials that will show results after the first use.</li>
            <li> This really seems to help.  </li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I have to say: this mask is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but when I take off this mask it&#x27;s still very moist.</li>
            <li> a much needed pick me up.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again because it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing - results are temporary.</li>
            <li> After much deliberation I bought this My Beauty Diary product.</li>
            <li> Very cooling and moisturizing, and I can tell they plump the lines and add a lot of moisture because when I peel the mask off, any wrinkles I missed in the fabric are indented in my skin, while everything else is plumped.  </li>
            <li> They were very cooling and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I find the ones made for the United States that you can get at Walmart are much wider.</li>
            <li> amazon really needs to evaluate the quality of their suppliers.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much excess serum</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I like this kind of facial mask and it does deep moisture for my face.</li>
            <li> It was also kind of a pain in the butt to get it properly draped over my face, given the sizing and the cuts where you&#x27;re supposed to drape it--I got it right after a couple of tries, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the residue on my hands from it.</li>
            <li> Super convenient to use as they are individually packaged and really relaxing.  </li>
            <li> serum is runnier than most, it dripped down my chin</li>
            <li> My skin always feels super nourished afterwards and they are definitely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel noticeably more moisturized after using it and I actually broke out the next day</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone-</li>
            <li> Like too wide unless your face is huge.</li>
            <li> make my skin very moisted and soft</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found a product that works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> And, to add insult to injury, the next day I woke up with two cysts on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note - for those with teenage, acne-prone, or sensitive skin - that the cysts could have been from something else, but I thought it crucial to include it just in case you buy this</li>
            <li> They leave your face pretty shiny, so I would only use them before bed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have no trouble using these.  </li>
            <li> Living in an area where the weather is cold and dry, it is important to keep my skin hydrated and looking good.</li>
            <li> And I found this is very different from the real one.</li>
            <li> It feels very different from the real one.</li>
            <li> Also, the cover of the product is different from real one.</li>
            <li> The texture of the box also feels very different from the real one.</li>
            <li> After use it ,it really works, my skin is getting better,smooth and white.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and plumpy</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so the first time I used it I only left it on for about 15min to see how my skin would handle it.</li>
            <li> at 50 years old my skin looks like im in my late 20&#x27;s lol, by the 3rd application dark spots</li>
            <li> I looked in a magnifying mirror a few hours later and some of the fine lines in my cheeks (I&#x27;m old...) were gone!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that after using this mask, the next day my pores are smaller, my breakouts are less red, and my face is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> how well-fitting the mask is (which I sometimes find to be a problem since masks don&#x27;t always fit my fairly small face) and how hydrating it is.</li>
            <li> I have used a hyaluronic acid serum before moisturizing after the shower to help with my chronically dry skin (I get eczema if I don&#x27;t moisturize religiously), and I really like it, so I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> no results (so far i&#x27;ve used 4 in the last 2 weeks)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> I let it sit in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> this mask felt very watered down in terms of quality and product.</li>
            <li> the price is a little higher than i expected.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive, acne-prone skin and am very careful with what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> The mask does not contain enough moister liquid, but feel very dry and can&#x27;t be attached on my face.</li>
            <li> They gave a cold, refreshing feeling while you are wearing them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> and this helps a lot with my dry patches and I&#x27;ve never had any sort of reaction.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my chin and around my nose and couldn&#x27;t find anything to take care of that without breaking me out</li>
            <li> you pat in the rest of the serum and let it dry).  </li>
            <li> The package has TONS of serum in it (half a bottle, actually)</li>
            <li> My skin can get very dry over the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on my face for 15-30 min and other masks usually dry up within 15 min,</li>
            <li> There is minimal fragrance, and my sensitive, late 30&#x27;s skin did not have any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> The serum from the mask sort of sit on my skin and didn&#x27;t fully absorb like I had expected.</li>
            <li> Product not as expected, did not turn out to be what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I recommend other masks from Korean brands.</li>
            <li> I personally like do a cleansing mask beforehand, which usually dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> I also find them easier to unfold than other sheet masks I&#x27;ve tried which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I might repurchase, but I want to try other flavors too.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is there weren&#x27;t directions in the box.</li>
            <li> And once it&#x27;s on, you have to stay down for at least ten or fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> Try them you wont be let down.</li>
            <li> I stick them in the fridge and put them on before bed for a half hour while watching tv.  </li>
            <li> (The lines go away after a little while</li>
            <li> So I would recommend not buying those version unless you find the other ones to be too small.</li>
            <li> They contain quite a bit of serum and it drips down my neck, but that area could use it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 60 in a few days and am always looking for skin products that give me some type of glow.  </li>
            <li> i use it everyday after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I usually put these on at night, give myself 30 minutes to relax, unwind and watch a little TV.  </li>
            <li> As usual.  </li>
            <li> There is usually leftover liquid in the package</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the instructions are not in English.  </li>
            <li> They are big,  which makes it difficult to form to your face.</li>
            <li> I found with other Hyalurunic Masks, the mask would have a weird scent, but that isn&#x27;t the case for the My Beauty Diary mask.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the slimy feeling it leaves when you take it off, but I rubbed the excess into my skin and it dried in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the supplier at all.</li>
            <li> Definatly looks weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t seem as helpful.</li>
            <li> And it is not so expensive.</li>
            <li> these are fake.</li>
            <li> idea why someone would make FAKE face masks.....</li>
            <li> i understand the fake designer purses, etc.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened it, I knew it was FAKE!</li>
            <li> i would recommend these to anyone doing any sort of procedure like that, or with a bad sunburn on the face even.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amazon allows fake products to be sold !!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great mask. Feel great after using it in dry climate like Colorado. Plenty of solution on the mask.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, these make you feel so good.  Relaxing, cooling and it made my skin glow.  I didn&#x27;t want to take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 60 in a few days and am always looking for skin products that give me some type of glow.  I&#x27;ve used this product over a two week period, twice per week.  It really softens your skin and yes, it does give you a really nice glow.  My skin can get very dry over the winter months.  This really seems to help.  My age spots are a different story:-)</li>
            <li> A good mask for the price, but nothing special. I recommend other masks from Korean brands.</li>
            <li> serves it purpose well.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Korean face masks. And this one is just as good! I use about one a week and can feel a difference in my skin immediately (and it lasts too!). Living in an area where the weather is cold and dry, it is important to keep my skin hydrated and looking good. These work really well (I have tried lots of masks). I plan on purchasing more once my supply runs out. They&#x27;re that good!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! I love it. It hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling ooh so smoothly.</li>
            <li> These feel fantastic. My skin always feels super nourished afterwards and they are definitely moisturizing!</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect is fantastic.</li>
            <li> As usual.  Another fantastic Beauty Diary mask.  I have and use them ALL and they are ALL very good masks.</li>
            <li> The best mask for your skin. Very moisturizing, skin feels amazing. Hyaluronic acid is one of the most effective anti-aging ingredients, should be incorporated in everyones skin routine (plus vit C and retinol). In the summer time I keep this mask in the refrigerator before I use it, and its the best treat for my face!</li>
            <li> I just bought it several days ago. And I found this is very different from the real one. The mask does not contain enough moister liquid, but feel very dry and can&#x27;t be attached on my face. Most of moister liquid is left in the bag and feels like just water, not sticky at all. It feels very different from the real one. Also, the cover of the product is different from real one. It doesn&#x27;t have the label on the upper-left corner. The texture of the box also feels very different from the real one. I can&#x27;t believe the amazon allows fake products to be sold !!!!! I want to get my money return !!! Don&#x27;t fall into this trap, guys</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I have to say: this mask is fantastic. I personally like do a cleansing mask beforehand, which usually dries out my skin. Then I put this on because it&#x27;s extra-moisturizing and it&#x27;s working out most awesomely :)</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to these moisturizing masks and the hyalluronic is my favorite.  Skin feels great after use and it lasts for days.  The aloe one is also very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of masks, such as Face Shop and Innisfree and this one is one of my favorites. It comes in a very cutely box and this specific mask is for hydrating. Hyalurunic Acid is a very good moisturizer. I found with other Hyalurunic Masks, the mask would have a weird scent, but that isn&#x27;t the case for the My Beauty Diary mask. It has a very nice scent. The mask is doused in an ampoule type liquid and has a film on it and is folded inside. It&#x27;s filled with more than enough liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I leave it on my face for 15-30 min and other masks usually dry up within 15 min, but when I take off this mask it&#x27;s still very moist. There is usually leftover liquid in the package and I use this to pat on my face. I have noticed that after using this mask, the next day my pores are smaller, my breakouts are less red, and my face is very smooth and soft. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this helps a lot with my dry patches and I&#x27;ve never had any sort of reaction. I like to use this 1-2 times a week and it gives my skin a much needed pick me up. I love trying new face masks but I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again because it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> Love love love these things! I first saw them in a day spa and wondered what was on everyone&#x27;s face. Definatly looks weird but it&#x27;s sooo worth it. I use them 2-3 times a week after using a dermaroller. They are absolutely soaked w/serum! The most efficient way to soak up the good stuff. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these masks. Try them you wont be let down.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a blast of moisture, brightening and firming, look no further.  My Beauty Diary&#x27;s  Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Masks are definitely where it&#x27;s at.  Super convenient to use as they are individually packaged and really relaxing.  Although your dog, cat or significant other may mistake you for a mummy while you&#x27;re treating yourself, but it&#x27;s all good.  I found these sheet masks to be a good choice to have in your arsenal and they do what they are supposed to do.  It&#x27;s like a tall glass of water for your skin.  I usually put these on at night, give myself 30 minutes to relax, unwind and watch a little TV.  After I take them off I leave the remaining product on - I don&#x27;t rinse it off.  In the morning ...hmmm... heaven - baby skin.  These masks definitely make the team and I&#x27;ll be using them 1-2 times per week.  Great product for all ages and gentle enough for all skin types.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> A general,&lt;br /&gt;I do not like&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someone else like</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing - results are temporary.</li>
            <li> This is honestly so refreshing in the summer time.  I stick them in the fridge and put them on before bed for a half hour while watching tv.  Makes me feel kinda like Hannibal lecter, but you know.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found a product that works on my dry skin. Product made my skin just glow.  Absolutely&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I love to use these when moisturizer just won&#x27;t do the trick. This leaves your skin feeling very plumped and hydrated and this is a much more affordable option then many I&#x27;ve seen on the market. It won&#x27;t work magic but It&#x27;s still very nice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizing mask.  The package has TONS of serum in it (half a bottle, actually) so I used the extra serum on my neck and decolletage and I left the mask on beyond the 20 minutes because it felt so great.  There is minimal fragrance, and my sensitive, late 30&#x27;s skin did not have any problems with it.  After the sheet came off i massaged the remaining serum into my skin and let it soak in.  My skin was plump and oh so moisturized.  I highly recommend this to anyone- I plan to incorporate this into my routine once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> After much deliberation I bought this My Beauty Diary product. I have somewhat sensitive, acne-prone skin and am very careful with what I put on my skin. After reading the reviews Id thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I put on the mask, and after a somewhat anti-climatic gooey 10 mins, I took the mask off. The serum from the mask sort of sit on my skin and didn&#x27;t fully absorb like I had expected. And, to add insult to injury, the next day I woke up with two cysts on my right cheek. It&#x27;s important to note - for those with teenage, acne-prone, or sensitive skin - that the cysts could have been from something else, but I thought it crucial to include it just in case you buy this and it does the same to your skin (especially if it&#x27;s the night before a big event like a prom or wedding).&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, a quick fix for normal skin, but not the best choice for sensitive, teenage, or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> These work.  Very cooling and moisturizing, and I can tell they plump the lines and add a lot of moisture because when I peel the mask off, any wrinkles I missed in the fabric are indented in my skin, while everything else is plumped.  So make sure you get it nice and smooth!  (The lines go away after a little while and after you massage the rest of the &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; in post-mask.)</li>
            <li> at 50 years old my skin looks like im in my late 20&#x27;s lol, by the 3rd application dark spots fine lines dissapear and you will be glowing. My husband ask when did i stop wearing make up cuz my skin was beautiful. Will def order again</li>
            <li> Used these fore recovery after a C02 laser treatment.  They were very cooling and soothing.  i would recommend these to anyone doing any sort of procedure like that, or with a bad sunburn on the face even.</li>
            <li> After use it ,it really works, my skin is getting better,smooth and white.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for my mom. She love it.</li>
            <li> truly amazing, much better than the older generations, very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have used a hyaluronic acid serum before moisturizing after the shower to help with my chronically dry skin (I get eczema if I don&#x27;t moisturize religiously), and I really like it, so I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t seem as helpful. My skin didn&#x27;t feel noticeably more moisturized after using it and I actually broke out the next day (I have very sensitive skin). The smell wasn&#x27;t overwheming or offensive, and I have a very good sense of smell. I love the idea of a sheet mask, but this wasn&#x27;t the right one for me. It was also kind of a pain in the butt to get it properly draped over my face, given the sizing and the cuts where you&#x27;re supposed to drape it--I got it right after a couple of tries, but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the residue on my hands from it. And once it&#x27;s on, you have to stay down for at least ten or fifteen minutes. Sitting up means it will slide off. I&#x27;m going back to my post-shower serum and for masks I&#x27;ll return to a rotation of Queen Helene Mint Julep for clay and, when I&#x27;m feeling fancy, a mash of bananas, oatmeal, and honey.</li>
            <li> very good product. Like it~~</li>
            <li> great product! very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> My order just came in, the box of mask was already opened and only 9 pieces inside the box (instead of 10 pcs). I am not happy with the supplier at all.</li>
            <li> My Beauty Diary makes the best masks by far. I have tried many of them, and my favorites are the Imperial Bird&#x27;s Nest masks because they are the most hydrating. You would think that the Hyaluronic Acid would be the most hydrating, but that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks are still solid though. They provide a nice amount of moisture and make the skin feel softer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I have to note though. The fit of the masks varies very much between the masks made for Asia and the United States. I find the ones made for the United States that you can get at Walmart are much wider. Like too wide unless your face is huge. So I would recommend not buying those version unless you find the other ones to be too small.</li>
            <li> this is definitely a must-buy kind of moisturizing mask. I use it every time after exfoliation and my skin just looks and feels so moisturized. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it to be honest.</li>
            <li> Always have this one after a clay mask session. Helps to retain and to add moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About to order another one. Good mask for the price</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I am used to use my beauty diary. It does good to me. And it is not so expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this kind of facial mask and it does deep moisture for my face. It is also good for daily use in winter.</li>
            <li> Very good mask and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Love the mask. make my skin very moisted and soft</li>
            <li> I love this product. it work.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing ~~~easily matches with my face~~</li>
            <li> good product for a good price. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> These are great sheet masks.  I have very sensitive skin and have no trouble using these.  They make my skin feel so hydrated when I am finished.  I also find them easier to unfold than other sheet masks I&#x27;ve tried which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Like it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> These leave my face feeling soft and smooth. Only complaint is there weren&#x27;t directions in the box.</li>
            <li> these are fake. they smell like hot dogs (?) disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no idea why someone would make FAKE face masks.....i understand the fake designer purses, etc. but this is skincare. something you put on your face. amazon really needs to evaluate the quality of their suppliers.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! My skin improved a lot after the first try. I love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try these masks once they arrived, especially after hearing about the brand for years. I just ran out of my mask supply that i brought back from my last trip to Asia so it was perfect timing when they arrived. I have combination skin with oily t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- great list of ingredients: no parabens, phenoxyethanol, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- lots of serum&lt;br /&gt;- good packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- mask ripped while being applied&lt;br /&gt;- serum is runnier than most, it dripped down my chin a lot&lt;br /&gt;- no results (so far i&#x27;ve used 4 in the last 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy again?: NO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying these masks, i&#x27;d say theyre good if you have nothing else to use and need a good at home facial but I would not buy them again. There are other masks out there that are made with better materials that will show results after the first use. this mask felt very watered down in terms of quality and product. I&#x27;d recommend Innisfree if you&#x27;re looking for an asian facial mask.</li>
            <li> LOVE this. My skin is very sensitive so the first time I used it I only left it on for about 15min to see how my skin would handle it. It was great! I have dry skin on my chin and around my nose and couldn&#x27;t find anything to take care of that without breaking me out and this did the trick! I only use it once a week (Sunday I turned into my &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; day) and leave it on for about 30min after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> they are nice masks. i use it everyday after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;but the price is a little higher than i expected.</li>
            <li> Product not as expected, did not turn out to be what I am looking for. Will not buy again ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. As soon as I opened it, I knew it was FAKE! The individual package is smaller, the way the mask was folded is different, the smell is different. DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I&#x27;m actually planning to buy more! There isn&#x27;t much excess serum but I use whatever is left on my neck and my arms. The mask leaves me feeling so so so relaxed and hydrated, my face definitely looks plump and hydrated afterwards. I use one every week and gives great results and hydration.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone! I even gave a sheet to my friends who also commented on how well-fitting the mask is (which I sometimes find to be a problem since masks don&#x27;t always fit my fairly small face) and how hydrating it is.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, easy to put on. Leaves skin soft and plumpy</li>
            <li> very good product and great price! I notice brighter skin just at the first time applying. I will definitely buy more from this brand! Happy buying.</li>
            <li> First time using today.  I just started using a hyaluronic serum in the morning under my moisturizer after doing some research, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  Unfortunately, the instructions are not in English.  I saw on another listing that they should be warmed up, so I let it sit in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes.  The mask itself is good size and LOADED with serum (package was &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; which scared me at first).  I let it sit about 30 min. and then, not knowing how to use, I washed the remainder off my face (which you don&#x27;t do...you pat in the rest of the serum and let it dry).  I looked in a magnifying mirror a few hours later and some of the fine lines in my cheeks (I&#x27;m old...) were gone!  Skin did seem a bit brighter, toned and &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These felt really nice on the skin. They gave a cold, refreshing feeling while you are wearing them. They are big,  which makes it difficult to form to your face. I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the slimy feeling it leaves when you take it off, but I rubbed the excess into my skin and it dried in a few minutes. They leave your face pretty shiny, so I would only use them before bed. They made my skin feel soft and they have a nice, floral scent to them, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, I ordered already three times.it works.makes my skin soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I accidently gave it 4 stars but not because I wanted to give it 4 I wanted to give it 5 I love these and reorder every time I run out</li>
            <li> I would use these during finals week and my skin would look great even though I&#x27;m totally under-rested. It&#x27;s super affordable, which is awesome because sheet masks can really pile up in cost.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this one. I get the best results from the royal jelly one, but I wish that one smelled like this one. I might repurchase, but I want to try other flavors too. These masks are really hydrating and at a great price for the quality. I love having a bunch on hand and giving them to friends too!</li>
            <li> I love these masks! They contain quite a bit of serum and it drips down my neck, but that area could use it too! The product comes in individually wrapped packages and each mask is packaged with an additional plastic sheet that helps unfold the mask when applying. The mask stays on without having to readjust. I often wear them while blow drying my hair without any issues.</li>
