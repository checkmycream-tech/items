            <li>Very nice for the price, good and sturdy product.</li>
            <li>The video was not the best, but the machine works fine.  </li>
            <li>Because it was a beautiful full set for a very good price</li>
            <li>I saw the pics and the amazing price and thought it seemed like a great starter kit</li>
            <li>but I did a couple tattoos with it and the colors are not that bright</li>
            <li>all works as it should a good buy</li>
            <li>Just received my order today and everything looked good haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it out yet</li>

            <li>Surprisingly well made and the inks are good too.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>Good inks cost around 8 bucks an ounce, so you can just figure that these are going to suck.</li>

            <li>Thank you, I would say so far we are very happy with them.</li>

            <li>The cross gun is very nicely designed and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>I did not have any issues worth contacting the seller, so I don&#x27;t know how awesome they are at dealing with returns/exchanges, but if they are cool, this is an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TThis is a good product so far i am vary happy with the shipping it was here before i knew it</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
            <li>its been amazing, although the ink isnt as good as I expected but everything else is great</li>
            <li>(they sell one for 24.99 seems ok) and barrels.</li>
            <li>You will have to buy additional supplies for cleaning and better quality tattoos .</li>
            <li>i must say this was an &#x27;okay&#x27; starter kit .</li>
            <li>but I think I did okay</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this</li>
            <li>But they are OK to use.  </li>
            <li>so I think who ever else buys it will be satisfied I give y&#x27;all a 5 star rating I&#x27;d love to buy more kits from them if they had different guns and inks and deals and better stencil liquid dats it!!!!</li>
            <li>did more how to set up</li>
            <li>Its a great starter kit for people who are just learning but your definitely going to have to upgrade your equipment once you start getting good.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>But it works better then</li>
            <li>sure danito does not come out of the tipmore than the widthof a nickelI give it the guns in a pluspower supply is cheapso you might want to get a backupThank</li>
            <li>I love my tattoo kit</li>
            <li>let me tell you, there are some hilarious tattooing</li>
            <li>Hi love</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy more accessories.</li>
            <li>Though I purchased this for a gift for someone else, we tried it out and everything seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>best value in a tattoo kit I could find, will be starting with the practice skin.</li>
            <li>Threw out the ink as the blue ink had exploded and from reviews its not the best ink.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t watched the CD as there are better ones on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I love the tattoo guns and everything.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it makes more room in our art closet.</li>
            <li>spend the xtra $ on better ink 2.</li>
            <li>Get more tattoo skins 3.</li>
            <li>Almost forgot, get more transfer paper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok when you put everything together</li>
            <li>it is a perfect kit for anyone starting to tattoo the vcd</li>
            <li>The rating would be much better if the inks weren&#x27;t so crappy.</li>
            <li>and It was better</li>
            <li>okay .</li>
            <li>and I just love it</li>
            <li>I got this kit fast and it works great.</li>
            <li>but ya love it and love the guns.can&#x27;t beat it for 39.99</li>
            <li>I would literally (and probably will) buy a couple more of these kits just for myself and to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: If you have the money, get a better kit, if you&#x27;re trying to surprise your husband for Christmas on a budget, this works.&lt;br /&gt;Machine- needs a better power source/&amp;#34;guns&amp;#34; work fine&lt;br</li>
            <li>i need more needles nw &amp;more ink and better colors and wish ur glow</li>
            <li>but for a beginners kit ,the rest of it is ok..</li>
            <li>The gun with the cross didn&#x27;t work but everything else was perfect</li>
            <li>an he was satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I have been a customer of Amazon.com for many years, however that will change from here out.</li>
            <li>Both guns work and power supply is OK.</li>
            <li>I love my starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Customer&#x27;s was satisfied.</li>
            <li>love the colors that came with it.</li>
            <li>and compatible with most parts on the market.</li>
            <li>Even Mom&#x27;s is way better than trusting these inks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, this is one of the better bangs for the buck in the 50 dollars and under kits.</li>
            <li>If you want better than this, you&#x27;re going to have to shell out some more ducats.</li>
            <li>need more if you&#x27;re doing more than two tattoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disapointed, but I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even stand to watch it for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll need to get more practice skin,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of em but their ok for the price.</li>
            <li>hes used both guns that came with it and is satisfied with both.....</li>
            <li>Pirate face tattoo has much better kits.</li>
            <li>Came with way more than I thought.</li>
            <li>I got this Kit for my son and he love it.</li>
            <li>Youll need more needles though, the shading ones.</li>
            <li>but im sure theyre</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>i love my kit i have done so many quality tattoos with it and have been able to produce some quality work with it</li>
            <li>The gun is ok.</li>
            <li>(Getting better ink.)</li>
            <li>I am extremely  satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I like how it was all safe in air bags nothing damaged.</li>
            <li>He is now able to practice tattooing.</li>
            <li>One machine did not work but otherwise its a wonderful starting kit!</li>
            <li>No one in a reputable shop would ever buy this garbage.</li>
            <li>and now I know better than to tamper with the tuning without watching youtube videos beforehand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the flipside, i would suggest ordering better ink and more stencils bc</li>
            <li>every thing you need for some good home tattoos, and everything works right out the box (after putting it together)</li>
            <li>thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>Great machine done did several tattoos with it very satisfied.</li>
            <li>but all in all a decent product great for starters</li>
            <li>Decent kit machines run great don&#x27;t like the pedal or the power supply</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good starter kit</li>
            <li>but all in all the machines works pretty good</li>
            <li>Love the design of the guns and easy use.</li>
            <li>So far it works great &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Everything is perfect and a lot more durable than i expected.</li>
            <li>Fired up the gun last night and was very impressed with how smooth and easy everything was to set-up and operate.</li>
            <li>Glad I went with this cheap model.</li>
            <li>Also be sure to purchase products for aftercare because it is just as important as executing the tattoo.</li>
            <li>right now I have no clue if the rest of the order was damaged but everything was in their own baggies so not too worried.</li>
            <li>Other than that great kit!</li>
            <li>and my dream came true!</li>
            <li>I love that it arrived quick and so far everything has been working great.</li>
            <li>i picked it up as soon as i got it and gave myself a tattoo its that easy to pick up and give yourself a tattoo</li>
            <li>The machine itself gets over heated really easily</li>
            <li>Everything works great the machine with the cross needed tuning but most machines do out of the box.</li>
            <li>Everything came with my kit, everything works correctly and completely and it is wonderful thanks.</li>
            <li>I already have dozens of tattoos in and the guns are still going strong</li>
            <li>for two guns and a more than complete kit, its a good deal.</li>
            <li>Worked at first, nicely too, the plug broke and now the gun is having problems itself.</li>
            <li>My first ever came out pretty good :-)</li>
            <li>well you get what you pay for but these are fairly good guns there just as good as any other guns of this value.</li>
            <li>Power supply,Machines and foot pedal work fine ink and needles are garbage</li>
            <li>The ink shows up well an da tattoo gun works fine.</li>
            <li>but my ink was fine.</li>
            <li>Everything came in the package fine.</li>
            <li>No rubber bands, but they are cheap and easy to find</li>
            <li>Use these for practice - on the practice skins, and you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li>Both of the guns work and the ink was fine .</li>
            <li>Perfect little machines.</li>
            <li>Update: the seller gave me replacement for free understanding</li>
            <li>so overall happy with it</li>
            <li>Amazing works real well</li>
            <li>then the cheap conditions</li>
            <li>Would buy again its more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Please sent the free gift of the 100 Pcs needles, and 7 inks.</li>
            <li>Otherwise well worth the price :)</li>
            <li>But the quality of the machines are rather fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap machine.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy the equipment that came.</li>
            <li>Explains why it was so cheap..</li>
            <li>great starter kit, cross gun didn&#x27;t work though</li>
            <li>had it for about two weeks and its still running smooth.</li>
            <li>one of the guns was broke but its great overall.</li>
            <li>The guns are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, despite the frustration of wanting top of the line gear for forty bucks...</li>
            <li>Thank its nice to have this thanks again to for or everything</li>
            <li>Nice kit , really dont show anything on the DVD</li>
            <li>Bought this as a back up for supplies, everything is in great working order.</li>
            <li>Cheap kit...</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good starter kit so far have done 3 tattoos since yesterday</li>
            <li>so far hope it keep up the good work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting started, but good so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this set for practicing and everything came in very organized, the machines are working awesome the only thing that needs improving is the ink</li>
            <li>Super great item thanks very fast shipping AAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++</li>
            <li>However, it was super easy to put together and to work with.</li>
            <li>Ok first of all I ordered this product at 1:30am August 19th</li>
            <li>So excited to get this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to get started...</li>
            <li>I needed to order more supplies after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>He was excited with this set.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t come with rubber bands but other than that it&#x27;s a great cheap set for practicing on fruits and skin</li>
            <li>cuz I really want it 2 if it was but other than that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>I was expecting more hard durable plastic but a good example to compare it to is holding a plastic water gun except the machine has a bit more weight.</li>
            <li>just as simple as that, just great exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the amazing quality of the products AND how complete the set is.</li>
            <li>Everything came so its cool</li>
            <li>good thing it came with a second one.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The kit comes with miniature bottles of ink which seem to hold their color fairly well in the melons that I tattooed cherry blossoms onto with the liner (the cross emblem one).</li>
            <li>Meh, not bad.</li>
            <li>The video is unhelpful in terms of how to set up the machine, which I feel is more important than the method of giving a tattoo, which is pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>It is in a nail polish bottle and a quick test with the nose suggests it to be acetone.</li>
            <li>The ink is ok basic from my research so invest in better ink as I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>it was an amazing kit for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Thank you for quick delivery.</li>
            <li>now it I could buy some artistic skills I&#x27;d be all set</li>
            <li>and I received the product quickly and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>Inks are super teeny, you&#x27;ll deff.</li>
            <li>Great starter kit for anyone who wants to start tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying different ink though, don&#x27;t use the ink it comes with.</li>
            <li>luckily I have extras of those over all</li>
            <li>, New machine doesn&#x27;t work either, I am done buying from them very cheap and will be buying machine elsewhere now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, pay a little more and get something better</li>
            <li>The power source is light and has a &amp;#34;1 or 0&amp;#34; type switch (either on or off); it will probably be the first thing replaced.</li>
            <li>The power source and foot pedal are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>, Everything in it is pretty good overall.</li>
            <li>Very convinient!!</li>
            <li>Very well put together !!</li>
            <li>Besides that description of product is exactly what you get!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what a lot of people are saying: a Great Starter.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is a little flimsy too.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice quality but 2 major flaws..</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way too light and don&#x27;t seem to want to take very well with anyone I&#x27;ve tattooed...</li>
            <li>The inks are really runny and cheap.  </li>
            <li>I am definately satisfied with the complete tattoo kit.</li>
            <li>i also was not able to get the video to work [because of my computer probably, not the VCD], but i was able to look up guides on youtube to put the machine together, which was very entertaining.  </li>
            <li>Thank you.work well and worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money.</li>
            <li>better tattoo paper (it only comes w/1), and better ink once you&#x27;re ready to tattoo people.</li>
            <li>Came with everything but the shader needles and green soap still love it and the guns are nice and the ink says in .</li>
            <li>The power supply looks pretty cheap, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>im having a lot of fun with it</li>
            <li>But other than that of you&#x27;re gonna tattoo potatoes than this is the first ever amazing potato tattoo kit!</li>
            <li>already that I wanted to write this review right after I received the product.</li>
            <li>I have to put out a lot of volts to get the machines to work right.</li>
            <li>the guns work all right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right weight.</li>
            <li>I am using it right now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to get you started in the right direction, and does so nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right bc</li>
            <li>everything was in the right spots, I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I found that it tattoos fruit very nicely right out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not bad but needs more items only came with one gromet and one rubberband</li>
            <li>I suggest buying new ink cause this stuff fades really quickly in the skin!</li>
            <li>and im happy hes happy this really got me off his bad side</li>
            <li>the dark ink was a good price 2</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend buying a more powerful machine (which runs 60 and up) when actually tattooing people.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Got it today so far so good except that the cross gun doesn&#x27;t stay on it</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you do NOT waste your money on this kit.</li>
            <li>My only problems were that the cross gun would constantly turn off but the other gun was perfect the ink is also good.</li>
            <li>The power supply is basic and China Cheap, but it works well, has a smooth rheostat and supplies consistent power... in my experience.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, packaged well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little starter kit for your home tats</li>
            <li>it had to much paint on the contact points but they fixed that problem by sending me a whole new machine which was very just and extremely fair of them</li>
            <li>This kit is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>well I would Recommend this to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li>it came with everything included in the picture, though i have only been able to get one of the guns to work.  </li>
            <li>whether you make home-made ink or buy some better quality ink, this stuff is just way too light and will require a lot of touch ups to get it as dark as you want it.</li>
            <li>This is the first machine that I have ever held in my hand</li>
            <li>When I brought it up higher to 14, it made a line</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything in the picture is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>just thought it was funny)</li>
            <li>i did my first fix up with and like the outcome</li>
            <li>i recommend it to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing or receiving tattoos..</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Before using this protect to tattoo I would definitely recommend watching and researching much more than just the DVD it comes with.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think he had it hooked up correctly at first).</li>
            <li>There was stuff falling apart with in the first day.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The video only worked in the computer, if your going to do alot of tattooing you&#x27;ll need more ink, needles, etc.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to keep perspective.</li>
            <li>Already had to purchase more supplies only after having it for 2 months....</li>
            <li>Nothing like his really expensive set, but he said awesome buy for the money.</li>
            <li>I will be buying from again very soon!</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying different (better) ink instead of using the ink they supply you with.</li>
            <li>I just wish the kit came with the proper cleaning supplies To be able to work in a sterile environment.  </li>
            <li>at first it didn&#x27;t work at aaaaaall.</li>
            <li>(first time tattoo machine owner).</li>
            <li>And it seems to be a pretty sturdy machine.</li>
            <li>the digital power supply is OK too</li>
            <li>I am especially appreciative of the tattoo tiger design printed on fake skin for practicing tattooing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was my first tattoo machine purchase</li>
            <li>Got here quick, the power box is wonky, the cords wont make a good connection to the box there for</li>
            <li>so my 15 year old daughter purchased this without my knowledge and gave herself a tattoo!!!!</li>
            <li>Only after that did I see how cool the guns are (a cool cross, and my favorite.</li>
            <li>Lol the cd just starts with a dude in mid sentence while tattooing I tried to rewind it and it jammed up and dvd player does not work now</li>
            <li>but I assumed there would be some sort of instructions as this is kind of marketed as a beginners kit (fake skin to practice on kind of indicates beginner).</li>
            <li>when tattooing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace everything in the set with better quality parts, don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap thing ....</li>
            <li>love it enjoy using it everyday</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m experienced otherwise I would&#x27;ve wasted money...  still a decent kit for a new artist with no experience, don&#x27;t tattoo if you don&#x27;t have a license please.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i ordered with fast shipping</li>
            <li>but this a good beginner kit , really small</li>
            <li>I wanted it on my right arm, but I&#x27;m a righty, so it&#x27;s a little messy, but I think it turned out great!</li>
            <li>If your going to get this kit, make sure you buy some decent ink such as intenze ink, mom&#x27;s, or skin candy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re weary of not spending too much money on a kit because it will be super cheap and crappy, that&#x27;s completely not the case here.</li>
            <li>Good product one gun was broken but the other one it can with worked like a champ deff a good buy for anyone into tattoos</li>
            <li>Everything was fine other than the ink fades &amp; keeps coming out making it hard to complete the tattoo, otherwise the equipment works great, the ink is just cheap ink</li>
            <li>The order was placed last week it was easy to purchase and processes for payment</li>
            <li>BUT I open the package and it had a really really strong nail polishy odor coming from the box</li>
            <li>The ink is rising out of the skin as it heals so basically she will have a large scar on her leg.</li>
            <li>But they do a fine job so no big deal.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all fine but only 2 complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>(really it could happen to anybody</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>still works real well</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t explain a lot of how to tat</li>
            <li>30min ago I am very impressedI</li>
            <li>Thanks E Onsale</li>
            <li>this was very upsetting</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s my opinion and thanks for reading, hope it helps..</li>
            <li>WAs very well packed.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>Very pleased....very reasonable on pricing</li>
            <li>I recomend it to anyone who wants to start doing tattoos.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it and comes with quite really everything you need beside gloves and tattoo gel</li>
            <li>It arrived SO fast.</li>
            <li>The dvd it includes is very helpful</li>
            <li>The video dvd inside really help out and gives you some helpful tips.</li>
            <li>I could see there being some rejects, but that&#x27;s how it is with any cheap Chinese products.</li>
            <li>Buy real inks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, everything was there as stated.</li>
            <li>But get this since it&#x27;s cheaper than the others and ships fast but just know you&#x27;ll have to learn how to use it yourself or through youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li>thanks Garry</li>
            <li>The dvd shows nothing on care and assembly of the equiptment the dvd is very out dated.</li>
            <li>It was shipped out fast</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>youtube videos to get how to assemble and disassemble the machine, since you won’t be getting much help from the kit you just ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important you need them for the guns to run properly.</li>
            <li>to anyone who wants to get into tattooing...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be writing another review once I have actually used it, but so far I could not be happier.</li>
            <li>only thing I can really find fault with is that the kit did not come with instructions, and that is pretty important if you are new to the craft of tattooing.</li>
            <li>This kit is actually very nice and complete, you&#x27;d hardly find one like this...</li>
            <li>not that greatbut what you can do is draw on the practice skin and then trace your drawingif you are new and doing this for the first time tattooing that is make</li>
            <li>so I was pretty new to the machine.</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept it from a 5 star is the inks, the Japanese ink is very watered down and doesn&#x27;t take very bright.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for my new gun and ink!</li>
            <li>it arrived on time but when they opened the christmas present one of the inks had broke open so it was a real mess and kinda a bummer,but he says the machine itself works real good</li>
            <li>The main power supply shorts out after about two hours of tattooing, and now I either have to keep it on during the whole tattoo or keep pulling out the cords to &amp;</li>
            <li>And the shipping was very fast, surprised me A lot.</li>
            <li>I had my fun with it, and the tattoos actually turned out pretty decent.</li>
            <li>overall its not bad.</li>
            <li>The alternate machine in the kit worked just fine and continues to work (so far).</li>
            <li>Very addicting for new people</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 7 tattoos so far the only thing that&#x27;s happened is one of the machines just died, and the ink is cheap.</li>
            <li>machines are decent.</li>
            <li>So if you buy this then buy a spare decent power supply unit.</li>
            <li>The ink itself does not last and fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>you high five.</li>
            <li>;) overall im somewhat satisfied other</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this for anyone thats just beginning or veterans in the tattoo game everything is of good quality</li>
            <li>Came with no instructions or rubber bands that all the cons but those can be fixed I like the machine very helpful never done a tattoo before</li>
            <li>and he really loves it did about 5 tattoos so far</li>
            <li>I would show u sum pic I have done if u could recieve em&amp;i need more transfer paper a few pieces for rite price</li>
            <li>He have done a few Tattoo on people and they love his artwork.</li>
            <li>They are simple machines that require the operator to know what they are doing in order to set them up right.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a lot for the low right</li>
            <li>It arrived right one time, but I did pay for the same day delivery.</li>
            <li>Bought new ink (starbrite) and some new needles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting on new stuff</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try out the new guns, and all the colors.</li>
            <li>So u might wanna invest in new ink when u get the kit.</li>
            <li>works surprisingly well for the price, only complaint is that it doesnt come w any sort of written instructions as to how to assemble the tattoo guns</li>
            <li>Received Cross tattoo gun broken, and the ink was watery and power supply wasn&#x27;t to great..</li>
            <li>then again i chose 2 day shipping but came in early!.</li>
            <li>a Ink Cup Holder, or a set of brushes to clean the tubes, or even some extra tubes/ handles as it only came with one.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The inks are cheap and watered down</li>
            <li>The guns are light enough you can tattoo for a long time without your hand hurting.</li>
            <li>For the price and overall unexpected higher quality of the product that I received, I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>But it works fine with a little tuning</li>
            <li>Everything was included in the package except there wasn&#x27;t any instructions for setup, and with it being my first gun made it difficult, but overall everything works good.</li>
            <li>the power supply was weak but good enough for a tat I suppose</li>
            <li>The ink was also poor quality, messy, doesn&#x27;t look very good in the tattoo  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t complete if it doesn&#x27;t have both needles required.</li>
            <li>Im a young artist trying to for-fill my dream</li>
            <li>I have done about seven tattoos with it do far</li>
            <li>The DVD was a bit old, but it still was helpful.</li>
            <li>Also, I was rather adamant about getting a kit with an instructional video-BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li>I was laughing out loud trying to follow along.</li>
            <li>The ink works well so far.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews I read about this product.</li>
            <li>that qulity of the gun was overall very well</li>
            <li>Had to tune the one gun that actually worked intensely,</li>
            <li>Shipped a day early for me.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my 21year old son &amp; he has been doing tattoos every since.</li>
            <li>And this artificial skin is good to get a feel of the machine but is nothing compared to real skin.</li>
            <li>4.this tattoo pedal is a click on, click off so just click on and TAKE FOOT OFF , I would hold my foot right above it and sometimes touch it not even knowing and trip out because my gun stoped working mid tattoo.</li>
            <li>accessories are a little light - mainly the fact that I only got 1 grip, and have to use disposable grips to set up both machines at once.</li>
            <li>That might be completely on me, though, because with no instructions I was pretty much tightening and loosening the tuning piece way too frequently and with little thought.</li>
            <li>Other than that enjoy the kit especially for beginners.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I expected and I wish there were more pieces of carbon paper in the kit</li>
            <li>now the only thing i am worried about is it came with this nailpolish bottle for the transfer high efficency</li>
            <li>I would purchase this product again, but I would know that the ink is cheap and small.</li>
            <li>There is a pretty wide variety in the ink colors (even excluding my extras).</li>
            <li>Way higher quality then I expected.</li>
            <li>My white ink was already broken open but everything else is a good start for beginners</li>
            <li>The power supply come with an on/off switch rather than a hold to turn on, which I find to be less useful.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that these cheap inks are not very good.</li>
            <li>I had no other problems besides the ink</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second complaint is the machine to plug the gun into is cheap plastic .</li>
            <li>there was a small crack on the bottle that I only realized when I had it up to the light)</li>
            <li>When I tested the machine it on an orange it barely dented the skin when i set the power supply to 8.</li>
            <li>Not an actual complete kit and the shading guns armature bar came bent.</li>
            <li>Apparently, there is no regulation on who or what age person can purchase this item -</li>
            <li>Would totally recommend for the budding artist.</li>
            <li>I bought this for all that was inside, but mostly the &amp;#34;cross machine&amp;#34;, and it arrived broken.</li>
            <li>My husband had trouble getting the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; to work right away, it kept stopping</li>
            <li>The black does line pretty well, I just don&#x27;t trust the staying power.</li>
            <li>A lot of the problems I was finding with the other kits is that unless you wanted to spend a couple hundred dollars the inks really sucked.</li>
            <li>The foot supply is a little flimsy and it can get flipped upside down fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Other than that, tattoo guns are decent.</li>

            <li> Very nice for the price, good and sturdy product.</li>
            <li> The video was not the best, but the machine works fine.  </li>
            <li> Because it was a beautiful full set for a very good price</li>
            <li> I saw the pics and the amazing price and thought it seemed like a great starter kit</li>
            <li> but I did a couple tattoos with it and the colors are not that bright</li>
            <li> all works as it should a good buy</li>
            <li> Just received my order today and everything looked good haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it out yet</li>

            <li> Shipping was good.</li>
            <li> looks good, haven&#x27;t used it yet,</li>
            <li> No complaints it was what it said good starter machine for anybody</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been saving up wanting a good tattoo kit to learn all the tricks and stuff to get started with a career.</li>
            <li> This is a good kit.</li>
            <li> This is not for professionals by any means, but could be good for doing practice skins to get use to feel and weight of a machine.</li>
            <li> a good set for beginners.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Surprisingly well made and the inks are good too.</li>

            <li> Good inks cost around 8 bucks an ounce, so you can just figure that these are going to suck.</li>
            <li> If you try using a shader to run your lines, you will not have a good time.</li>

            <li> It is very easy set up.</li>
            <li> It slips out of the outlet very easily and could be an issue.  </li>

            <li> Good luck Keep it safe &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> This is a great first kit, there are some items i felt that should have been included to make it an AMAZING Set.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Awesome value, I&#x27;ve gotten alot of use out of it so far, I would buy from this seller again  </li>
            <li> Thank you, I would say so far we are very happy with them.</li>
            <li> All of the important stuff is good.</li>
            <li> Nice but wish there was more stencil paper</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a professional would like to buy this, but for a novice it works great!</li>
            <li> The cross gun is very nicely designed and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I did not have any issues worth contacting the seller, so I don&#x27;t know how awesome they are at dealing with returns/exchanges, but if they are cool, this is an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TThis is a good product so far i am vary happy with the shipping it was here before i knew it</li>
            <li> It was shipped very fast, the quality of everything is great.</li>
            <li> The grip was perfect, the machine is pretty light weight, so it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and portable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> its been amazing, although the ink isnt as good as I expected but everything else is great</li>
            <li> (they sell one for 24.99 seems ok) and barrels.</li>
            <li> You will have to buy additional supplies for cleaning and better quality tattoos .</li>
            <li> i must say this was an &#x27;okay&#x27; starter kit .</li>
            <li> but I think I did okay</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this</li>
            <li> But they are OK to use.  </li>
            <li> so I think who ever else buys it will be satisfied I give y&#x27;all a 5 star rating I&#x27;d love to buy more kits from them if they had different guns and inks and deals and better stencil liquid dats it!!!!</li>
            <li> did more how to set up</li>
            <li> Its a great starter kit for people who are just learning but your definitely going to have to upgrade your equipment once you start getting good.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> But it works better then</li>
            <li> sure danito does not come out of the tipmore than the widthof a nickelI give it the guns in a pluspower supply is cheapso you might want to get a backupThank</li>
            <li> I love my tattoo kit</li>
            <li> let me tell you, there are some hilarious tattooing</li>
            <li> Hi love</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy more accessories.</li>
            <li> Though I purchased this for a gift for someone else, we tried it out and everything seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li> best value in a tattoo kit I could find, will be starting with the practice skin.</li>
            <li> Threw out the ink as the blue ink had exploded and from reviews its not the best ink.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t watched the CD as there are better ones on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I love the tattoo guns and everything.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but it makes more room in our art closet.</li>
            <li> spend the xtra $ on better ink 2.</li>
            <li> Get more tattoo skins 3.</li>
            <li> Almost forgot, get more transfer paper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok when you put everything together</li>
            <li> it is a perfect kit for anyone starting to tattoo the vcd</li>
            <li> The rating would be much better if the inks weren&#x27;t so crappy.</li>
            <li> and It was better</li>
            <li> okay .</li>
            <li> and I just love it</li>
            <li> I got this kit fast and it works great.</li>
            <li> but ya love it and love the guns.can&#x27;t beat it for 39.99</li>
            <li> I would literally (and probably will) buy a couple more of these kits just for myself and to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: If you have the money, get a better kit, if you&#x27;re trying to surprise your husband for Christmas on a budget, this works.&lt;br /&gt;Machine- needs a better power source/&amp;#34;guns&amp;#34; work fine&lt;br</li>
            <li> i need more needles nw &amp;more ink and better colors and wish ur glow</li>
            <li> but for a beginners kit ,the rest of it is ok..</li>
            <li> The gun with the cross didn&#x27;t work but everything else was perfect</li>
            <li> an he was satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Amazon.com for many years, however that will change from here out.</li>
            <li> Both guns work and power supply is OK.</li>
            <li> I love my starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Customer&#x27;s was satisfied.</li>
            <li> love the colors that came with it.</li>
            <li> and compatible with most parts on the market.</li>
            <li> Even Mom&#x27;s is way better than trusting these inks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, this is one of the better bangs for the buck in the 50 dollars and under kits.</li>
            <li> If you want better than this, you&#x27;re going to have to shell out some more ducats.</li>
            <li> need more if you&#x27;re doing more than two tattoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disapointed, but I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even stand to watch it for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll need to get more practice skin,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of em but their ok for the price.</li>
            <li> hes used both guns that came with it and is satisfied with both.....</li>
            <li> Pirate face tattoo has much better kits.</li>
            <li> Came with way more than I thought.</li>
            <li> I got this Kit for my son and he love it.</li>
            <li> Youll need more needles though, the shading ones.</li>
            <li> but im sure theyre</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> i love my kit i have done so many quality tattoos with it and have been able to produce some quality work with it</li>
            <li> The gun is ok.</li>
            <li> (Getting better ink.)</li>
            <li> I am extremely  satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I like how it was all safe in air bags nothing damaged.</li>
            <li> He is now able to practice tattooing.</li>
            <li> One machine did not work but otherwise its a wonderful starting kit!</li>
            <li> No one in a reputable shop would ever buy this garbage.</li>
            <li> and now I know better than to tamper with the tuning without watching youtube videos beforehand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the flipside, i would suggest ordering better ink and more stencils bc</li>
            <li> every thing you need for some good home tattoos, and everything works right out the box (after putting it together)</li>
            <li> thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Great machine done did several tattoos with it very satisfied.</li>
            <li> but all in all a decent product great for starters</li>
            <li> Decent kit machines run great don&#x27;t like the pedal or the power supply</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good starter kit</li>
            <li> but all in all the machines works pretty good</li>
            <li> Love the design of the guns and easy use.</li>
            <li> So far it works great &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect and a lot more durable than i expected.</li>
            <li> Fired up the gun last night and was very impressed with how smooth and easy everything was to set-up and operate.</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this cheap model.</li>
            <li> Also be sure to purchase products for aftercare because it is just as important as executing the tattoo.</li>
            <li> right now I have no clue if the rest of the order was damaged but everything was in their own baggies so not too worried.</li>
            <li> Other than that great kit!</li>
            <li> and my dream came true!</li>
            <li> I love that it arrived quick and so far everything has been working great.</li>
            <li> i picked it up as soon as i got it and gave myself a tattoo its that easy to pick up and give yourself a tattoo</li>
            <li> The machine itself gets over heated really easily</li>
            <li> Everything works great the machine with the cross needed tuning but most machines do out of the box.</li>
            <li> Everything came with my kit, everything works correctly and completely and it is wonderful thanks.</li>
            <li> I already have dozens of tattoos in and the guns are still going strong</li>
            <li> for two guns and a more than complete kit, its a good deal.</li>
            <li> Worked at first, nicely too, the plug broke and now the gun is having problems itself.</li>
            <li> My first ever came out pretty good :-)</li>
            <li> well you get what you pay for but these are fairly good guns there just as good as any other guns of this value.</li>
            <li> Power supply,Machines and foot pedal work fine ink and needles are garbage</li>
            <li> The ink shows up well an da tattoo gun works fine.</li>
            <li> but my ink was fine.</li>
            <li> Everything came in the package fine.</li>
            <li> No rubber bands, but they are cheap and easy to find</li>
            <li> Use these for practice - on the practice skins, and you&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li> Both of the guns work and the ink was fine .</li>
            <li> Perfect little machines.</li>
            <li> Update: the seller gave me replacement for free understanding</li>
            <li> so overall happy with it</li>
            <li> Amazing works real well</li>
            <li> then the cheap conditions</li>
            <li> Would buy again its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> Please sent the free gift of the 100 Pcs needles, and 7 inks.</li>
            <li> Otherwise well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> But the quality of the machines are rather fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cheap machine.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy the equipment that came.</li>
            <li> Explains why it was so cheap..</li>
            <li> great starter kit, cross gun didn&#x27;t work though</li>
            <li> had it for about two weeks and its still running smooth.</li>
            <li> one of the guns was broke but its great overall.</li>
            <li> The guns are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, despite the frustration of wanting top of the line gear for forty bucks...</li>
            <li> Thank its nice to have this thanks again to for or everything</li>
            <li> Nice kit , really dont show anything on the DVD</li>
            <li> Bought this as a back up for supplies, everything is in great working order.</li>
            <li> Cheap kit...</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good starter kit so far have done 3 tattoos since yesterday</li>
            <li> so far hope it keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting started, but good so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for practicing and everything came in very organized, the machines are working awesome the only thing that needs improving is the ink</li>
            <li> Super great item thanks very fast shipping AAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++</li>
            <li> However, it was super easy to put together and to work with.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all I ordered this product at 1:30am August 19th</li>
            <li> So excited to get this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to get started...</li>
            <li> I needed to order more supplies after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> He was excited with this set.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t come with rubber bands but other than that it&#x27;s a great cheap set for practicing on fruits and skin</li>
            <li> cuz I really want it 2 if it was but other than that it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I was expecting more hard durable plastic but a good example to compare it to is holding a plastic water gun except the machine has a bit more weight.</li>
            <li> just as simple as that, just great exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amazing quality of the products AND how complete the set is.</li>
            <li> Everything came so its cool</li>
            <li> good thing it came with a second one.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The kit comes with miniature bottles of ink which seem to hold their color fairly well in the melons that I tattooed cherry blossoms onto with the liner (the cross emblem one).</li>
            <li> Meh, not bad.</li>
            <li> The video is unhelpful in terms of how to set up the machine, which I feel is more important than the method of giving a tattoo, which is pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li> It is in a nail polish bottle and a quick test with the nose suggests it to be acetone.</li>
            <li> The ink is ok basic from my research so invest in better ink as I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> it was an amazing kit for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Thank you for quick delivery.</li>
            <li> now it I could buy some artistic skills I&#x27;d be all set</li>
            <li> and I received the product quickly and undamaged.  </li>
            <li> Inks are super teeny, you&#x27;ll deff.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for anyone who wants to start tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying different ink though, don&#x27;t use the ink it comes with.</li>
            <li> luckily I have extras of those over all</li>
            <li> , New machine doesn&#x27;t work either, I am done buying from them very cheap and will be buying machine elsewhere now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, pay a little more and get something better</li>
            <li> The power source is light and has a &amp;#34;1 or 0&amp;#34; type switch (either on or off); it will probably be the first thing replaced.</li>
            <li> The power source and foot pedal are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> , Everything in it is pretty good overall.</li>
            <li> Very convinient!!</li>
            <li> Very well put together !!</li>
            <li> Besides that description of product is exactly what you get!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what a lot of people are saying: a Great Starter.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is a little flimsy too.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice quality but 2 major flaws..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way too light and don&#x27;t seem to want to take very well with anyone I&#x27;ve tattooed...</li>
            <li> The inks are really runny and cheap.  </li>
            <li> I am definately satisfied with the complete tattoo kit.</li>
            <li> i also was not able to get the video to work [because of my computer probably, not the VCD], but i was able to look up guides on youtube to put the machine together, which was very entertaining.  </li>
            <li> Thank you.work well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money.</li>
            <li> better tattoo paper (it only comes w/1), and better ink once you&#x27;re ready to tattoo people.</li>
            <li> Came with everything but the shader needles and green soap still love it and the guns are nice and the ink says in .</li>
            <li> The power supply looks pretty cheap, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> im having a lot of fun with it</li>
            <li> But other than that of you&#x27;re gonna tattoo potatoes than this is the first ever amazing potato tattoo kit!</li>
            <li> already that I wanted to write this review right after I received the product.</li>
            <li> I have to put out a lot of volts to get the machines to work right.</li>
            <li> the guns work all right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right weight.</li>
            <li> I am using it right now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to get you started in the right direction, and does so nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right bc</li>
            <li> everything was in the right spots, I turned it on.</li>
            <li> I found that it tattoos fruit very nicely right out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not bad but needs more items only came with one gromet and one rubberband</li>
            <li> I suggest buying new ink cause this stuff fades really quickly in the skin!</li>
            <li> and im happy hes happy this really got me off his bad side</li>
            <li> the dark ink was a good price 2</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend buying a more powerful machine (which runs 60 and up) when actually tattooing people.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Got it today so far so good except that the cross gun doesn&#x27;t stay on it</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you do NOT waste your money on this kit.</li>
            <li> My only problems were that the cross gun would constantly turn off but the other gun was perfect the ink is also good.</li>
            <li> The power supply is basic and China Cheap, but it works well, has a smooth rheostat and supplies consistent power... in my experience.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, packaged well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little starter kit for your home tats</li>
            <li> it had to much paint on the contact points but they fixed that problem by sending me a whole new machine which was very just and extremely fair of them</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> well I would Recommend this to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li> it came with everything included in the picture, though i have only been able to get one of the guns to work.  </li>
            <li> whether you make home-made ink or buy some better quality ink, this stuff is just way too light and will require a lot of touch ups to get it as dark as you want it.</li>
            <li> This is the first machine that I have ever held in my hand</li>
            <li> When I brought it up higher to 14, it made a line</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything in the picture is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> just thought it was funny)</li>
            <li> i did my first fix up with and like the outcome</li>
            <li> i recommend it to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing or receiving tattoos..</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Before using this protect to tattoo I would definitely recommend watching and researching much more than just the DVD it comes with.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think he had it hooked up correctly at first).</li>
            <li> There was stuff falling apart with in the first day.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The video only worked in the computer, if your going to do alot of tattooing you&#x27;ll need more ink, needles, etc.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to keep perspective.</li>
            <li> Already had to purchase more supplies only after having it for 2 months....</li>
            <li> Nothing like his really expensive set, but he said awesome buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I will be buying from again very soon!</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying different (better) ink instead of using the ink they supply you with.</li>
            <li> I just wish the kit came with the proper cleaning supplies To be able to work in a sterile environment.  </li>
            <li> at first it didn&#x27;t work at aaaaaall.</li>
            <li> (first time tattoo machine owner).</li>
            <li> And it seems to be a pretty sturdy machine.</li>
            <li> the digital power supply is OK too</li>
            <li> I am especially appreciative of the tattoo tiger design printed on fake skin for practicing tattooing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was my first tattoo machine purchase</li>
            <li> Got here quick, the power box is wonky, the cords wont make a good connection to the box there for</li>
            <li> so my 15 year old daughter purchased this without my knowledge and gave herself a tattoo!!!!</li>
            <li> Only after that did I see how cool the guns are (a cool cross, and my favorite.</li>
            <li> Lol the cd just starts with a dude in mid sentence while tattooing I tried to rewind it and it jammed up and dvd player does not work now</li>
            <li> but I assumed there would be some sort of instructions as this is kind of marketed as a beginners kit (fake skin to practice on kind of indicates beginner).</li>
            <li> when tattooing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace everything in the set with better quality parts, don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap thing ....</li>
            <li> love it enjoy using it everyday</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m experienced otherwise I would&#x27;ve wasted money...  still a decent kit for a new artist with no experience, don&#x27;t tattoo if you don&#x27;t have a license please.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i ordered with fast shipping</li>
            <li> but this a good beginner kit , really small</li>
            <li> I wanted it on my right arm, but I&#x27;m a righty, so it&#x27;s a little messy, but I think it turned out great!</li>
            <li> If your going to get this kit, make sure you buy some decent ink such as intenze ink, mom&#x27;s, or skin candy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re weary of not spending too much money on a kit because it will be super cheap and crappy, that&#x27;s completely not the case here.</li>
            <li> Good product one gun was broken but the other one it can with worked like a champ deff a good buy for anyone into tattoos</li>
            <li> Everything was fine other than the ink fades &amp; keeps coming out making it hard to complete the tattoo, otherwise the equipment works great, the ink is just cheap ink</li>
            <li> The order was placed last week it was easy to purchase and processes for payment</li>
            <li> BUT I open the package and it had a really really strong nail polishy odor coming from the box</li>
            <li> The ink is rising out of the skin as it heals so basically she will have a large scar on her leg.</li>
            <li> But they do a fine job so no big deal.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all fine but only 2 complaints.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li> (really it could happen to anybody</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> still works real well</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t explain a lot of how to tat</li>
            <li> 30min ago I am very impressedI</li>
            <li> Thanks E Onsale</li>
            <li> this was very upsetting</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s my opinion and thanks for reading, hope it helps..</li>
            <li> WAs very well packed.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> Very pleased....very reasonable on pricing</li>
            <li> I recomend it to anyone who wants to start doing tattoos.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it and comes with quite really everything you need beside gloves and tattoo gel</li>
            <li> It arrived SO fast.</li>
            <li> The dvd it includes is very helpful</li>
            <li> The video dvd inside really help out and gives you some helpful tips.</li>
            <li> I could see there being some rejects, but that&#x27;s how it is with any cheap Chinese products.</li>
            <li> Buy real inks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, everything was there as stated.</li>
            <li> But get this since it&#x27;s cheaper than the others and ships fast but just know you&#x27;ll have to learn how to use it yourself or through youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li> thanks Garry</li>
            <li> The dvd shows nothing on care and assembly of the equiptment the dvd is very out dated.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out fast</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> youtube videos to get how to assemble and disassemble the machine, since you won’t be getting much help from the kit you just ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important you need them for the guns to run properly.</li>
            <li> to anyone who wants to get into tattooing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will be writing another review once I have actually used it, but so far I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> only thing I can really find fault with is that the kit did not come with instructions, and that is pretty important if you are new to the craft of tattooing.</li>
            <li> This kit is actually very nice and complete, you&#x27;d hardly find one like this...</li>
            <li> not that greatbut what you can do is draw on the practice skin and then trace your drawingif you are new and doing this for the first time tattooing that is make</li>
            <li> so I was pretty new to the machine.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept it from a 5 star is the inks, the Japanese ink is very watered down and doesn&#x27;t take very bright.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for my new gun and ink!</li>
            <li> it arrived on time but when they opened the christmas present one of the inks had broke open so it was a real mess and kinda a bummer,but he says the machine itself works real good</li>
            <li> The main power supply shorts out after about two hours of tattooing, and now I either have to keep it on during the whole tattoo or keep pulling out the cords to &amp;</li>
            <li> And the shipping was very fast, surprised me A lot.</li>
            <li> I had my fun with it, and the tattoos actually turned out pretty decent.</li>
            <li> overall its not bad.</li>
            <li> The alternate machine in the kit worked just fine and continues to work (so far).</li>
            <li> Very addicting for new people</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 7 tattoos so far the only thing that&#x27;s happened is one of the machines just died, and the ink is cheap.</li>
            <li> machines are decent.</li>
            <li> So if you buy this then buy a spare decent power supply unit.</li>
            <li> The ink itself does not last and fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> you high five.</li>
            <li> ;) overall im somewhat satisfied other</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this for anyone thats just beginning or veterans in the tattoo game everything is of good quality</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions or rubber bands that all the cons but those can be fixed I like the machine very helpful never done a tattoo before</li>
            <li> and he really loves it did about 5 tattoos so far</li>
            <li> I would show u sum pic I have done if u could recieve em&amp;i need more transfer paper a few pieces for rite price</li>
            <li> He have done a few Tattoo on people and they love his artwork.</li>
            <li> They are simple machines that require the operator to know what they are doing in order to set them up right.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot for the low right</li>
            <li> It arrived right one time, but I did pay for the same day delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought new ink (starbrite) and some new needles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting on new stuff</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try out the new guns, and all the colors.</li>
            <li> So u might wanna invest in new ink when u get the kit.</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well for the price, only complaint is that it doesnt come w any sort of written instructions as to how to assemble the tattoo guns</li>
            <li> Received Cross tattoo gun broken, and the ink was watery and power supply wasn&#x27;t to great..</li>
            <li> then again i chose 2 day shipping but came in early!.</li>
            <li> a Ink Cup Holder, or a set of brushes to clean the tubes, or even some extra tubes/ handles as it only came with one.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The inks are cheap and watered down</li>
            <li> The guns are light enough you can tattoo for a long time without your hand hurting.</li>
            <li> For the price and overall unexpected higher quality of the product that I received, I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> But it works fine with a little tuning</li>
            <li> Everything was included in the package except there wasn&#x27;t any instructions for setup, and with it being my first gun made it difficult, but overall everything works good.</li>
            <li> the power supply was weak but good enough for a tat I suppose</li>
            <li> The ink was also poor quality, messy, doesn&#x27;t look very good in the tattoo  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t complete if it doesn&#x27;t have both needles required.</li>
            <li> Im a young artist trying to for-fill my dream</li>
            <li> I have done about seven tattoos with it do far</li>
            <li> The DVD was a bit old, but it still was helpful.</li>
            <li> Also, I was rather adamant about getting a kit with an instructional video-BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li> I was laughing out loud trying to follow along.</li>
            <li> The ink works well so far.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews I read about this product.</li>
            <li> that qulity of the gun was overall very well</li>
            <li> Had to tune the one gun that actually worked intensely,</li>
            <li> Shipped a day early for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my 21year old son &amp; he has been doing tattoos every since.</li>
            <li> And this artificial skin is good to get a feel of the machine but is nothing compared to real skin.</li>
            <li> 4.this tattoo pedal is a click on, click off so just click on and TAKE FOOT OFF , I would hold my foot right above it and sometimes touch it not even knowing and trip out because my gun stoped working mid tattoo.</li>
            <li> accessories are a little light - mainly the fact that I only got 1 grip, and have to use disposable grips to set up both machines at once.</li>
            <li> That might be completely on me, though, because with no instructions I was pretty much tightening and loosening the tuning piece way too frequently and with little thought.</li>
            <li> Other than that enjoy the kit especially for beginners.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected and I wish there were more pieces of carbon paper in the kit</li>
            <li> now the only thing i am worried about is it came with this nailpolish bottle for the transfer high efficency</li>
            <li> I would purchase this product again, but I would know that the ink is cheap and small.</li>
            <li> There is a pretty wide variety in the ink colors (even excluding my extras).</li>
            <li> Way higher quality then I expected.</li>
            <li> My white ink was already broken open but everything else is a good start for beginners</li>
            <li> The power supply come with an on/off switch rather than a hold to turn on, which I find to be less useful.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that these cheap inks are not very good.</li>
            <li> I had no other problems besides the ink</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second complaint is the machine to plug the gun into is cheap plastic .</li>
            <li> there was a small crack on the bottle that I only realized when I had it up to the light)</li>
            <li> When I tested the machine it on an orange it barely dented the skin when i set the power supply to 8.</li>
            <li> Not an actual complete kit and the shading guns armature bar came bent.</li>
            <li> Apparently, there is no regulation on who or what age person can purchase this item -</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend for the budding artist.</li>
            <li> I bought this for all that was inside, but mostly the &amp;#34;cross machine&amp;#34;, and it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> My husband had trouble getting the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; to work right away, it kept stopping</li>
            <li> The black does line pretty well, I just don&#x27;t trust the staying power.</li>
            <li> A lot of the problems I was finding with the other kits is that unless you wanted to spend a couple hundred dollars the inks really sucked.</li>
            <li> The foot supply is a little flimsy and it can get flipped upside down fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Other than that, tattoo guns are decent.</li>
            <li> but after 22mins of running them the analog power supply with Foot Pedal and Clip Cord tapped out and did not work after that , rubber bands were missing from that packing which was included in the description , the ink is good for practicing on fake skin .but</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for beginning artists, and definitely recommend something small and simple no matter how much you&#x27;ve practiced.</li>
            <li> its exactly as explain I have only one complaint</li>
            <li> One of my tattoo machines completely stopped working after only about half an hour of use.</li>
            <li> Try grapefruit if you&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;re ready .  </li>
            <li> It comes with sterilized needles, all packaged in secure containers, a sheet of paper for transferring the design, various pieces to assemble the machine, a fake skin with a tiger design, tiny ink-holder cups, and miniature bottles of inks.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Everything you need to make a solid tattoo ans long as you have the expertise.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have right now is that the &amp;#34;bottle of transfer oil&amp;#34; is empty.</li>
            <li> One star off for the lack of instructions, but four stars given here for the completeness of the kit and the fact that the cross emblem machine lasted that long with me tampering with the tuning every five minutes!</li>
            <li> I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had something wrong in my kit and these guys shipped me out a new piece first thing no questions.</li>
            <li> Gave myself a nice ugly regrettable tattoo</li>
            <li> Minor issue.</li>
            <li> I have already done a tattoo on my knee (a cover up of a heart I did by hand a long time ago)</li>
            <li> The machine had no clear signs as to which thing plugged into which port on the power supply.</li>
            <li> its for ppl who needs to practice other than actually doing tattoos.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get one of the machines to work and the other stopped working shortly after.</li>
            <li> one of my guns work but the other gun dont work  the cross gun and tht</li>
            <li> It arrived in a little white cardboard package with everything in individual plastic-wrapped packets.</li>
            <li> it only works if i hold it upside down??</li>
            <li> the vcd included was very, I mean very informative!</li>
            <li> the ink is very bad but other than that everything else is great</li>
            <li> My order came in a few days earlier than it was expected and that surprised me, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy over the practice skin, but of course there&#x27;s nothing really close to human skin besides pig skin...</li>
            <li> The power supply is a little generic.</li>
            <li> machines were great but the ink is horrible</li>
            <li> You actually have to have enough common sense to use this item.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tattoo kit like 2 weeks ago, n i only used it 4 times plus using it on practice skin, everything worked very well came with everything but after the 4th time doing, something went wrong</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> The stencil transfer was an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> And some of the needles were bent the ink that it comes with SAKURA INK (5HOURS OF TIME WAS SPENT ON THE TATTOO AND</li>
            <li> it is empty?</li>
            <li> then I expected...</li>
            <li> The guns needed a bit of adjusting but that was expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit only a few days ago, and it has already arrived.</li>
            <li> All the parts were sealed carefully and nothing had spilled or torn.</li>
            <li> (Minus shading needles).</li>
            <li> Like expected, the ink is terrible, definitely buy some good quality ink.</li>
            <li> The machines are decent but the ink needles and tubes are poor quality.</li>
            <li> has had it not very long either not very good quality and the dvd</li>
            <li> Everything came in the package as other reviews indicate.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> The ink bottles are small but for a basic kits to start off</li>
            <li> and this was an embarrassment leaving someone with a crappy tattoo due to the malfunctions of the gun and</li>
            <li> Im fairly new to the ink game</li>
            <li> This kit&#x27;s video is CRAP, there&#x27;s more helpful tips/instructionals on YouTube (not to mention it didn&#x27;t even work in anything other than a</li>
            <li> guns broke after a few uses but that may have just been my uncle being rough</li>
            <li> not exactly sure what Im doing right or wrong.</li>
            <li> Guns work well but the colored ink doesn&#x27;t wanna stick at all like it&#x27;s watered down or something</li>
            <li> they put the screw on upside down and the DVD is just a bunch of bs</li>
            <li> The ink that I got with it was dried up and to thick to actually use.</li>
            <li> i was a little upset that one of the machines would not work</li>
            <li> Being a novice, I don’t know if the machine needs to be tuned a lot or a little.</li>
            <li> The little L-shaped wrench fits into the groves on the tattoo machine and that is how you tighten and loosen the length of the tattoo grip/</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Ink went to waste.</li>
            <li> nothing missing.</li>
            <li> No busted parts or missing equipment.</li>
            <li> it was all intact,nothing broken,nothing missing.</li>
            <li> It was missing parts as Well.one of the guns didn&#x27;t wanna work either.</li>
            <li> Junk and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the machines, but the ink is cruddy.</li>
            <li> With the exception of gloves, green soap, and a set of instructions this kit came with everything I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the practice pad is really thick</li>
            <li> The ink sucked, even the black turned into a faint grey.</li>
            <li> A little instruction manual would have been nice instead of a s***ty poorly recorded DVD with terrible music and ugh</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way cheaper than paying  80 or 100 bucks to get a small tattoo</li>
            <li> Bolts too small for gun, grip keeps falling off</li>
            <li> It comes with all you need to get started ,but bottles of ink are small.</li>
            <li> the inks are so small....</li>
            <li> the ink is small</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected, but the CD/DVD that came with was really poor quality.</li>
            <li> The cross machine stopd workin after 6 Months the ink is terrible but machines cost 25 and ink is only 10 each overall</li>
            <li> Its not starting what am I doing wrong</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone in need of a small kit or someone trying to learn the art of tattoo.</li>
            <li> The power box is small but it does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> Really the only thing that went wrong is the stupid oil got on my stuff</li>
            <li> Kids make really bad choices sometimes that they later regret and I am still stunned that she did this, which is exactly why I am shocked that they have no regulation on age when it comes to purchasing items that contain needles and ways to modify your body.</li>
            <li> but the ink sucks.  </li>
            <li> Also, the plug on the power supply is really wonky.  </li>
            <li> Stop working the day after I got it, power supply box sucks</li>
            <li> foot pedal sucks</li>
            <li> Disheartening to say the least.  </li>
            <li> ink sucks as well as transfer paper .</li>
            <li> Enjoy your cancer from those nasty off brand ink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> Gotta get Green soap!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the supplies are worth buying because the instructions are terrible.</li>
            <li> nothing worked properly the ink was hard or bad</li>
            <li> u could say and almost all the needles where no good</li>
            <li> Not good  </li>
            <li> Witch that was no good...</li>
            <li> The only thing that I absolutely do not like about this tattoo kit is the ink is horrible!</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this kit I bought it in February</li>
            <li> Iwas not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disk- Utter Crap</li>
            <li> The man behind the dvd is no help at all.</li>
            <li> Ugh one gun came broken....</li>
            <li> the cd that came with it, is a picture media disk with three empty folders, the transfer solution is paint thinner and or nail polish remover, needles where alll bent inks are crap</li>
            <li> We all know that just because a needle is wrapped in a wrapper that says sterile doesn&#x27;t mean that it is!!</li>
            <li> * .... dont waste your time !!!!</li>
            <li> I did notice the needles were not perfect.</li>
            <li> but i realised what I was doing it wrong</li>
            <li> I bought it to test out my skills on fake skin, and it did the trick for that.  </li>
            <li> was just weird</li>
            <li> , dvd is useless don&#x27;t even watch it,</li>
            <li> CD is useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I opened the box that this was going to be a quality gun.</li>
            <li> The Dvd is useless as the reviews said</li>
            <li> i dont know whats wrong with it</li>
            <li> can anyone tell me what to do or whats wrong??</li>
            <li> The DVD is completely useless though</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work and it appeared fake.</li>
            <li> YOU people are ruining the tattoo industry and allowing these SCRATCHERS to give horrible tattoos and possibly horrendous infections!!</li>
            <li> They are awful as expected.</li>
            <li> One machine was broken, needles looked used, ink was horrible and the transfer oil sucks.</li>
            <li> THE INK DID NOT STAY AT ALL, THE GOLD FADED TO AN UGLY PINKISH COLOR WTF)</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!!</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and everything is in it!  </li>
            <li> power supply was horrible quality and the wall plug-in tongs were lose and would fall out of the plug in, definitely not safe.</li>
            <li> The DVD included is a joke and useless!</li>
            <li> but that is totally my bad for not reading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this item but for 37 bucks</li>
            <li> Ink was bad everything else work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s bad ink and could infect someone.</li>
            <li> so I ordered one of these bad boys and within a week I had this</li>
            <li> was so bad</li>
            <li> Just too bad the power supply doesn&#x27;t work well or at all</li>
            <li> was shocked to hear and all need to know this the needles are being recalled by the fda</li>
            <li> Very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> ALL THIS CRAP WAS RETURNED AND</li>
            <li> the cd is worthless.</li>
            <li> hopefully it&#x27;s not made in China like this crap.</li>
            <li> the power supply is crap...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My son lost his expensive tattoo kit in a house fire - plus we almost lost them!!!  </li>
            <li> The ink is awful, but everything else is what to expect at the price.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> , it was just terrible....</li>
            <li> horrible ink.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked at first, nicely too, the plug broke and now the gun is having problems itself. Update: the seller gave me replacement for free understanding I didn&#x27;t have money to send machine back, New machine doesn&#x27;t work either, I am done buying from them very cheap and will be buying machine elsewhere now.</li>
            <li> I got the kit today but the cross machine didnt work waiting for a replacement and as soon as i get it and it works i will give 5 stars</li>
            <li> My dad is a tattoo artist and want to do what he does so I bought this machine for practice when I received it my liner machine didn&#x27;t work I contacted them and told what they thought it would be it was just paint not letting power go through I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> Great piece! I am definately satisfied with the complete tattoo kit. This kit is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a present for my brother idk if he is using it.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly everything came that&#x27;s in the picture 😎</li>
            <li> This is a great first kit, there are some items i felt that should have been included to make it an AMAZING Set.&lt;br /&gt;Like a Ink Cup Holder, or a set of brushes to clean the tubes, or even some extra tubes/ handles as it only came with one.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all i am happy with the purchase and would order from the seller again!</li>
            <li> Its a great starter kit I qot it to practice for a career and its been amazing, although the ink isnt as good as I expected but everything else is great</li>
            <li> Ok first of all I ordered this product at 1:30am August 19th I got the knock on my door at 12pm August 20th and it was here with standard shipping!!!!!! BUT I open the package and it had a really really strong nail polishy odor coming from the box, I search my stuff and the bottle of stencil oil or whatever leaked over EVERYTHING! I tried playing the dvd/cd thing on my laptop but the oil must have messed it up because my computer just says files corrupted can not play. Since I don&#x27;t have power supply or pedal right now I have no clue if the rest of the order was damaged but everything was in their own baggies so not too worried. I didn&#x27;t realize that the power supply and pedal don&#x27;t come but that is totally my bad for not reading. I have contacted the seller and am waiting on their reply. Over all I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SELLER!!!! Really the only thing that went wrong is the stupid oil got on my stuff (really it could happen to anybody there was a small crack on the bottle that I only realized when I had it up to the light) otherwise this is great stuff just remember you have to buy a power supply and pedal (they sell one for 24.99 seems ok) and barrels. I will def buy from them again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this bargain with a stick! Great value!</li>
            <li> No instructions came with the kit. It was my fault for not reading carefully enough but I assumed there would be some sort of instructions as this is kind of marketed as a beginners kit (fake skin to practice on kind of indicates beginner). Oh well, that&#x27;s what YouTube is for.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even work, faulty equipment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 7 tattoos so far the only thing that&#x27;s happened is one of the machines just died, and the ink is cheap. And this artificial skin is good to get a feel of the machine but is nothing compared to real skin. Try grapefruit if you&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;re ready .  You will have to buy additional supplies for cleaning and better quality tattoos . Good luck Keep it safe &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> machines were great but the ink is horrible it will fade off within a week.so I recommend you looking into purchasing ink from somewhere else</li>
            <li> Great its perfect nice handling and fast shipping ❤💋</li>
            <li> Works great ! My first ever came out pretty good :-)</li>
            <li> I suggest buying new ink cause this stuff fades really quickly in the skin! The video was somewhat helpful. Over all the machines are very good for beginners. (like myself)</li>
            <li> i must say this was an &#x27;okay&#x27; starter kit . the tattoo guns are nice and run . but after 22mins of running them the analog power supply with Foot Pedal and Clip Cord tapped out and did not work after that , rubber bands were missing from that packing which was included in the description , the ink is good for practicing on fake skin .but the items were packed nicely . overall im giving it 2 stars because of the analog power supply with Foot Pedal and Clip Cord crapping out after 22 mins .</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. The inks were great they held great the needles were good, this was a great deal i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions or rubber bands that all the cons but those can be fixed I like the machine very helpful never done a tattoo before but I think I did okay</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on July 25th, and the delivery estimate was August 1 - 16. Well, it arrived on July 29th. Great shipping. Also this must have been a fluke, but I received 20 inks rather than 15. I&#x27;ll take that as a perk. There is a pretty wide variety in the ink colors (even excluding my extras). I am so pleased with this already that I wanted to write this review right after I received the product. I&#x27;m sure I will be writing another review once I have actually used it, but so far I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I got the gun a couple of days ago and I tried it one time worked excellent but I cant seem to keep the power supply cables connected to either guns any help or advise pls.</li>
            <li> I received my package in a timely manner. Everything was as expected. The stencil transfer was an empty bottle. I would not have used it anyway. It is in a nail polish bottle and a quick test with the nose suggests it to be acetone. I tried one of the practice skins. They are awful as expected. God gave us practice skin it is called legs.   Thirty minutes after arrival I had a tattoo. I did notice the needles were not perfect. But they are OK to use.  The power supply LED is in question. I have to put out a lot of volts to get the machines to work right. But they do a fine job so no big deal.    All in all for the money I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome value, I&#x27;ve gotten alot of use out of it so far, I would buy from this seller again  I have been using it for about a month now and the product works well I would Recommend this to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well for the price, only complaint is that it doesnt come w any sort of written instructions as to how to assemble the tattoo guns</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Had all parts. Works great.</li>
            <li> Power supply,Machines and foot pedal work fine ink and needles are garbage</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good starter kit so far have done 3 tattoos since yesterday all works as it should a good buy</li>
            <li> Just received my order today and everything looked good haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it out yet but hope it works . I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this item but for 37 bucks I figure why not try it it&#x27;s way cheaper than paying  80 or 100 bucks to get a small tattoo and if it doesn&#x27;t work I can always return it .</li>
            <li> 0 STARS The tattoo gun keeps stopping in the middle  of the tattoo. And some of the needles were bent the ink that it comes with SAKURA INK (5HOURS OF TIME WAS SPENT ON THE TATTOO AND THE INK DID NOT STAY AT ALL, THE GOLD FADED TO AN UGLY PINKISH COLOR WTF) NOT HAPPY AT ALL THIS CRAP WAS RETURNED AND NO MONEY BACK YET...... BUYERS BEWARE</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this cheap model. Gave myself a nice ugly regrettable tattoo</li>
            <li> Bolts too small for gun, grip keeps falling off</li>
            <li> Ink was bad everything else work how it should but would NOT use the ink</li>
            <li> every thing you need for some good home tattoos, and everything works right out the box (after putting it together)</li>
            <li> The gun worked but the converter box stop have way though  so if u buy this product i suggest u buy a extra converter box</li>
            <li> Contact scree stabilizer scree is plastic and needed replaced on both machines. Otherwise good quality</li>
            <li> If you want to get a great starter kit to get your skills up or to practice or make your money with it what ever you please to do with it, it&#x27;s a great kit I was vary empresses with so I think who ever else buys it will be satisfied I give y&#x27;all a 5 star rating I&#x27;d love to buy more kits from them if they had different guns and inks and deals and better stencil liquid dats it!!!!</li>
            <li> guns broke after a few uses but that may have just been my uncle being rough lol</li>
            <li> It was everything to start off with the basics</li>
            <li> Great for learning. Everything needed to get started</li>
            <li> it arrived on time but when they opened the christmas present one of the inks had broke open so it was a real mess and kinda a bummer,but he says the machine itself works real good so overall happy with it</li>
            <li> Cause it was a gift for Christmas and they loved it very impressed with the way the machine works with ink</li>
            <li> Amazing works real well the dvd however looks like it came from the 90s so I just youtubed how to set it up...still works real well</li>
            <li> Great I have tattooed over 50 ppl and it works great I truly recommend buying this if you were a tattoo artist</li>
            <li> Received Cross tattoo gun broken, and the ink was watery and power supply wasn&#x27;t to great.. Wouldn&#x27;t buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> Excellent tat gun to start your passion for tattooing. I recommend this for anyone wanting to start tattooing.It comes with all you need to get started ,but bottles of ink are small.</li>
            <li> This tattoo set us awesome. It was shipped very fast, the quality of everything is great. It is very easy set up. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, pay a little more and get something better</li>
            <li> Got everything shown in the picture. So far it works great &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Dis kit is a1 its exactly as explain I have only one complaint the inks are so small.... But still an exception tattoo kit....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the DVD really didn&#x27;t explain a lot of how to tat did more how to set up but all the equipment works n the ink is small so u might want to buy another set of ink</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for beginners</li>
            <li> Super great item thanks very fast shipping AAAAAAAAAAAA++++++++</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this kit I bought it in February and it don&#x27;t work it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Ink bottles were busted and ink was everywhere. Ink went to waste. Other than that, tattoo guns are decent. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> well you get what you pay for but these are fairly good guns there just as good as any other guns of this value. the ink of course is not the best..... but all in all a decent product great for starters</li>
            <li> i tried to start doing tattoos, and when i brought this one it wasa comnpletely wack. its for ppl who needs to practice other than actually doing tattoos. so if you want to start doing tatts this is a great thing to start with.</li>
            <li> Bought about a month ago within a week the power supply pooped out on me the guns are starting to the ink will fade. Its a great starter kit for people who are just learning but your definitely going to have to upgrade your equipment once you start getting good. Very addicting for new people ;) overall im somewhat satisfied other then the cheap conditions but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> okay so i made the order thursday overnight/morning like at 5am and just got it in the mail today is friday noon-time! then again i chose 2 day shipping but came in early!. now i opened the box everything it said came in the box nothing missing. i love it! now the only thing i am worried about is it came with this nailpolish bottle for the transfer high efficency it is empty? so i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with that or what that was for. but everything else in box and good. so for the money it is priced good starter kit!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent for the price. It works good. The power supply is a little generic. But it works better then the one my buddy got,</li>
            <li> I got my tattoo kit here today its great but I rate it a 4 Cruz it did not have rubber bands I just touched up one of my tatts about 30min ago I am very impressedI was one of those peoplethat did not want to buy stuff the Internetand I got my package within36 hours from my purchase iks  are good they are a bit watery but goodI would prefer Starbright thoughyou have everything you need besides the rubber bandsthere practice skinis not that greatbut what you can do is draw on the practice skin and then trace your drawingif you are new and doing this for the first time tattooing that is make sure danito does not come out of the tipmore than the widthof a nickelI give it the guns in a pluspower supply is cheapso you might want to get a backupThank You Amazon I love my tattoo kit</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price</li>
            <li> this kit is a good starter kit for people learning to tattoo.  it came with everything included in the picture, though i have only been able to get one of the guns to work.  i also was not able to get the video to work [because of my computer probably, not the VCD], but i was able to look up guides on youtube to put the machine together, which was very entertaining.  let me tell you, there are some hilarious tattooing 101 vieos out there.</li>
            <li> Hi love this kit had a bit of a problem with getting it to work but i realised what I was doing it wrong and now i cant wait to start doing tattoos.  Thanks E Onsale</li>
            <li> i got this product for my dad and he really loves it did about 5 tattoos so far it makes him tuns of money and im happy hes happy this really got me off his bad side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s junk and doesn&#x27;t even work I returned it the same day!</li>
            <li> I loved the tattoo kit, it&#x27;s awesome can&#x27;t wait to start to use it. Everything was there, really impressed. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more accessories. Dig it, im a believer.</li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t any shading needles in the kit...it isn&#x27;t complete if it doesn&#x27;t have both needles required.</li>
            <li> For the price and overall unexpected higher quality of the product that I received, I have to give it five stars. Though I purchased this for a gift for someone else, we tried it out and everything seemed to work ok. Shipping was good. Would buy again its more than worth it.</li>
            <li> looks good, haven&#x27;t used it yet, best value in a tattoo kit I could find, will be starting with the practice skin.</li>
            <li> this entire tattoo kit is junk  wish i never would have bought it.  the cd that came with it, is a picture media disk with three empty folders, the transfer solution is paint thinner and or nail polish remover, needles where alll bent inks are crap dont even hold in the skin, the build is cheep on everything and power unit blew up as soon as i plugged it in.</li>
            <li> It took me about 20mins to set up the gun. But everything is set up correctly. My only problem is it won&#x27;t start :c . What do i do ? ._. !</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and bought this just for the guns and some of the extras. Threw out the ink as the blue ink had exploded and from reviews its not the best ink. Haven&#x27;t watched the CD as there are better ones on YouTube. Bought new ink (starbrite) and some new needles. Still happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> nothing worked properly the ink was hard or bad u could say and almost all the needles where no good they all was tearing skin this was very upsetting</li>
            <li> Cool tattoo set, especially great for the price for beginners</li>
            <li> It came out wonderfully,worth the money !</li>
            <li> No complaints it was what it said good starter machine for anybody i will recommend my friends to this place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been saving up wanting a good tattoo kit to learn all the tricks and stuff to get started with a career. My order came in a few days earlier than it was expected and that surprised me, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy over the practice skin, but of course there&#x27;s nothing really close to human skin besides pig skin...I had no other problems besides the ink, it&#x27;s way too light and don&#x27;t seem to want to take very well with anyone I&#x27;ve tattooed...everything else is great, there&#x27;s always ways to get ink whether you make home-made ink or buy some better quality ink, this stuff is just way too light and will require a lot of touch ups to get it as dark as you want it. There&#x27;s my opinion and thanks for reading, hope it helps..</li>
            <li> This is a good kit. Has everything you need to get started!  Not too expensive and everything is in it!  Very convinient!!</li>
            <li> I love the tattoo guns and everything. Please sent the free gift of the 100 Pcs needles, and 7 inks. I love it.</li>
            <li> I received the item as described except it did not contain any needles as promised does anyone know how to contact supplier to have needles shipped machine and foot pedal are well responsive I will rate five stars only if I receive needles. Otherwise well worth the price :)</li>
            <li> So excited to get this</li>
            <li> This is the first machine that I have ever held in my hand so im not exactly sure what Im doing right or wrong. My kit came with everything except a rubber band so im using one i found lying around in my house. The power supply also goes in and out of power. When I tested the machine it on an orange it barely dented the skin when i set the power supply to 8. When I brought it up higher to 14, it made a line but the ink sputtered everywhere! Please help!</li>
            <li> Excellent equipment, Everything in it is pretty good overall. I recommend this kit for anyone who is wanting to get a start with tattooing...</li>
            <li> i bought this for a friend so he could do my tattoos he was very happy to get this kit it works great and i have my helmet!</li>
            <li> I order this product not knowing that it will work so well. It makes great tattoos. Works well. Came with all the parts an accessories. The ink shows up well an da tattoo gun works fine. I would recommend this set to anyone. Try it. It works great.!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it arrived quick and so far everything has been working great. Thank you, I would say so far we are very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Everything came so its cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say 5 star because everything everybody else is saying is almost correct....&lt;br /&gt;Everything in the picture is exactly what you get. You should buy additional needles, practice skin, and transfer paper or search online for an alternative. I&#x27;m a beginner but remember YOUTUBE IS YOUR FRIEND!!! you should definitely get a license regardless if your in a shop or not. Everything came in the package as other reviews indicate. I did have one gun that didn&#x27;t work when it got here but I&#x27;m a beginner and this is a beginner kit so I felt like the company did it on purpose for the beginner to learn how to fix and tune YOUR gun. They send all tools required. The ink is ok basic from my research so invest in better ink as I&#x27;m doing. You can go to wal mart or target and get a sharps container which is needed!!! Also look into purchasing an autoclave machine. Other than that enjoy the kit especially for beginners.</li>
            <li> Power supply shut off in broke after 10 mins of it xD</li>
            <li> the guns work all right but the ink sucks.  I had to play around with the guns alot to get them to work, but they do work. get your own ink though. the cd is worthless. i would buy it again just for the guns.</li>
            <li> Thank you.work well and worth the price.</li>
            <li> One of my machines didn&#x27;t even work.  The inks are really runny and cheap.  I bought it to test out my skills on fake skin, and it did the trick for that.  I would not trust this machine to actually use on a person.  Also, the plug on the power supply is really wonky.  It slips out of the outlet very easily and could be an issue.  This is not for professionals by any means, but could be good for doing practice skins to get use to feel and weight of a machine.</li>
            <li> I got this product in 2-3 days when it werent supposed to come in ubtil the following week. The guns and power supply is definitely smaller then I was expecting but it makes more room in our art closet. WAs very well packed. We arr very satisfied with this product. You got 5 stars from me</li>
            <li> a good set for beginners. My white ink was already broken open but everything else is a good start for beginners</li>
            <li> For what I paid, its a great deal.... because I am learning, what have I learned so far?&lt;br /&gt;1. spend the xtra $ on better ink 2. Get more tattoo skins 3. Lol the cd just starts with a dude in mid sentence while tattooing I tried to rewind it and it jammed up and dvd player does not work now( gotta be a freak accident I am not blaming the dvd for that just thought it was funny) 4.this tattoo pedal is a click on, click off so just click on and TAKE FOOT OFF , I would hold my foot right above it and sometimes touch it not even knowing and trip out because my gun stoped working mid tattoo. lol. 5. Almost forgot, get more transfer paper.</li>
            <li> Great equipment. Very pleased. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. Love the design of the guns and easy use. Very light weight and portable. Can&#x27;t wait to use it even more!</li>
            <li> Nice starter kit for the money!</li>
            <li> Everything works i did my first fix up with and like the outcome so far hope it keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I got the product a day before .. It&#x27;s ok when you put everything together the ink is very bad but other than that everything else is great (:</li>
            <li> Everything was fine other than the ink fades &amp; keeps coming out making it hard to complete the tattoo, otherwise the equipment works great, the ink is just cheap ink</li>
            <li> Stop working the day after I got it, power supply box sucks foot pedal sucks I&#x27;m waiting on new stuff hopefully it&#x27;s not made in China like this crap.</li>
            <li> it works very well ink isnt all that great but everything else was great i would recommend this to others</li>
            <li> A beginners dream kit at a great price.  Would have given 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t come with rubber bands to hold the needle and the DVD didn&#x27;t play! Other than that great kit!</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit is amazing for me it is a perfect kit for anyone starting to tattoo the vcd showed me a lot that I needed to learn #thumbsup</li>
            <li> The rating would be much better if the inks weren&#x27;t so crappy. But the quality of the machines are rather fantastic.</li>
            <li> its great! just as simple as that, just great exactly what i needed i recommend it to anyone for a first kit</li>
            <li> Iwas not happy with this purchase at all. The only thing in this set that worked for me was the needles.&lt;br /&gt;The power supply was horrible quality and the wall plug-in tongs were lose and would fall out of the plug in, definitely not safe. I couldn&#x27;t even get one of the machines to work and the other stopped working shortly after. The ink was also poor quality, messy, doesn&#x27;t look very good in the tattoo  I did with it either.. and the DVD explaining how to put the things together was just weird it did not explain anything. I do like that this kit showed me what NOT to use when tattooing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace everything in the set with better quality parts, don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap thing ....</li>
            <li> Perfect little machines.</li>
            <li> I recieved exactley what was posted.</li>
            <li> All i got to say is that you get what you pay for simple as that.</li>
            <li> Very pleased....very reasonable on pricing and It was better then I expected...I recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing or receiving tattoos..I&#x27;m so excited to get started...</li>
            <li> Guns work well but the colored ink doesn&#x27;t wanna stick at all like it&#x27;s watered down or something</li>
            <li> The tattoo guns were great. My only problems were that the cross gun would constantly turn off but the other gun was perfect the ink is also good. Tbh its a very good bargain for everything you get. I recomend it to anyone who wants to start doing tattoos. This is a pretty good starter kit</li>
            <li> I contacted several times about one of my guns not working and no one ever contacted me pack to fix my problem</li>
            <li> Cheap machine. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this is a great kit for beginners. It comes with everything you need to start tattooing</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the time to deliver my order and I am very pleased with the contents of my order</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for the beginner. The price was awesome and was even delivered well before the promise date. Fired up the gun last night and was very impressed with how smooth and easy everything was to set-up and operate. Would definitely recommend this product and this seller to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great tattoo gun! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I want this order but i forgot my r in my last name its ashley barker</li>
            <li> Works well my girl is happy. I get laid often now. She thinks it&#x27;s a great gift.thank you high five. She just gave me some tonight.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this Kit about a month ago Im a young artist trying to for-fill my dream everything worked okay . But I found out today that the needles in this kit are on recall that  causes  bacterial infection and can lead to sepsis.. Well I used it on my Brother for his tattoo and he got an infection from it the needles in this pack its lot # CE0197 which are the recalled ones. Watch out!...</li>
            <li> i love it it dose perfect work</li>
            <li> The ink is awful, but everything else is what to expect at the price.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this product again, but I would know that the ink is cheap and small. The quality of the machines ing if makes up for the creator ink, though. I give this product 4 stars..</li>
            <li> This was the best tattoo kit I got from Amazon it came in three days and I just love it the vcd included was very, I mean very informative! I will be referring this product to all of my friends and associates</li>
            <li> I got this kit fast and it works great.I have done about seven tattoos with it do far the ink is ok guns work great power source good I really like it and comes with quite really everything you need beside gloves and tattoo gel but ya love it and love the guns.can&#x27;t beat it for 39.99</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy the equipment that came. Everything is perfect and a lot more durable than i expected. The guns needed a bit of adjusting but that was expected. The only thing that kept it from a 5 star is the inks, the Japanese ink is very watered down and doesn&#x27;t take very bright. I recommend placing another ink order along with this purchase. Over all tho it is a very great buy for the price, arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Before using this protect to tattoo I would definitely recommend watching and researching much more than just the DVD it comes with. Halfway through my tatt one of the machines gave out, but good thing it came with a second one. I would recommend this for beginning artists, and definitely recommend something small and simple no matter how much you&#x27;ve practiced. Also be sure to purchase products for aftercare because it is just as important as executing the tattoo.</li>
            <li> It was a great price and the kit came with alot of things.  The reason for only three stars is that one of the guns did not work when we got in the mail.  Disheartening to say the least.  Everything else is great for a beginning artist.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected, but the CD/DVD that came with was really poor quality.</li>
            <li> Got it weeks before the estimated date, and it all works well. I&#x27;m just getting started, but good so far. The DVD was a bit old, but it still was helpful.</li>
            <li> Awesome value for what you get. And the shipping was very fast, surprised me A lot. The people are nice as well. It&#x27;s a good little starter kit for your home tats (:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it..... I saw the pics and the amazing price and thought it seemed like a great starter kit so I bought it. Only after that did I see how cool the guns are (a cool cross, and my favorite. The anchor.) THEN I read the amazing reviews. I was stoked to get it. It arrived SO fast. I can&#x27;t believe the amazing quality of the products AND how complete the set is. I would literally (and probably will) buy a couple more of these kits just for myself and to give as gifts. Any tattoo artist would appreciate this set. Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal and for the price you get not just one but two tattoo machines and a disc on how to do tattoos very nice!</li>
            <li> This product was great i highly recommend this for anyone thats just beginning or veterans in the tattoo game everything is of good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what a lot of people are saying: a Great Starter.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is a little flimsy too. The power source is light and has a &amp;#34;1 or 0&amp;#34; type switch (either on or off); it will probably be the first thing replaced. My husband had trouble getting the &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; to work right away, it kept stopping (I don&#x27;t think he had it hooked up correctly at first). But he has been tattooing all kinds of fruit and it seems to be serving well as a practice tattoo machine. Also, I was rather adamant about getting a kit with an instructional video-BAD IDEA. This kit&#x27;s video is CRAP, there&#x27;s more helpful tips/instructionals on YouTube (not to mention it didn&#x27;t even work in anything other than a computer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you have the money, get a better kit, if you&#x27;re trying to surprise your husband for Christmas on a budget, this works.&lt;br /&gt;Machine- needs a better power source/&amp;#34;guns&amp;#34; work fine&lt;br /&gt;Disk- Utter Crap&lt;br /&gt;Ink- Untested on humans (he&#x27;s been tattooing grapefruit and the like, sticks well)</li>
            <li> Because it was a beautiful full set for a very good price and I need one but nw i need more needles nw &amp;more ink and better colors and wish ur glow n the dark ink was a good price 2 cuz I really want it 2 if it was but other than that it&#x27;s perfect it&#x27;s just wat I needed I would show u sum pic I have done if u could recieve em&amp;i need more transfer paper a few pieces for rite price plz</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Everything is great thank you. Can&#x27;t wait to try out the new guns, and all the colors. Thank you</li>
            <li> One the guns was messed up and.the ink will not stay in</li>
            <li> Not an actual complete kit and the shading guns armature bar came bent. Explains why it was so cheap..</li>
            <li> The cross machine stopd workin after 6 Months the ink is terrible but machines cost 25 and ink is only 10 each overall im happy with it</li>
            <li> Did anyone have issues getting the guns to work?</li>
            <li> love it, comes with a lot for a good price. The dvd it includes is very helpful</li>
            <li> the power supply is crap...but for a beginners kit ,the rest of it is ok..cant wait to start....hope it stays together..</li>
            <li> great starter kit, cross gun didn&#x27;t work though, dvd is useless don&#x27;t even watch it, no assembly directions so youtube it, transfer paper in unusable condition, transfer liquid doesn&#x27;t work. buy more needles you will need them soon and more transfer paper!! I would probably still buy it again though,</li>
            <li> The gun with the cross didn&#x27;t work but everything else was perfect had it for about two weeks and its still running smooth.</li>
            <li> There was stuff falling apart with in the first day. And the power supply give out with in three days.</li>
            <li> Just got the kit and I&#x27;m bout to get some tatts it was an amazing kit for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> The pedal is kinda crappy and the ink caused an infection and the oil for the transfer paper doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I didnt use it yet but the ink was everywhere when it arrived</li>
            <li> One of my tattoo machines completely stopped working after only about half an hour of use. I know how to properly operate and power a tattoo machine, so this was not the problem. The alternate machine in the kit worked just fine and continues to work (so far).</li>
            <li> one of the guns was broke but its great overall.</li>
            <li> it was perfect everything i seen in the picture&#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> Great kit for beginners. Surprisingly well made and the inks are good too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all fine but only 2 complaints.&lt;br /&gt;The ink was tested out on practice skin and came out horrid and turned puss like and yellow. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s bad ink and could infect someone. But that&#x27;s just the ink I got.&lt;br /&gt;Second complaint is the machine to plug the gun into is cheap plastic . I was expecting more hard durable plastic but a good example to compare it to is holding a plastic water gun except the machine has a bit more weight. Probably weighs a couple ounces not even a pound.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is the machines work and everything is in working order. No busted parts or missing equipment. Even came days prior before estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> This kit is actually very nice and complete, you&#x27;d hardly find one like this... It&#x27;s just the right weight. Very Happy!</li>
            <li> Real nice for the price. I will not be tattooing anyone with this. I&#x27;m using it for practice and to see if I&#x27;ll actually like tattooing. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Well I get it for my son an he was satisfied with it good tattoo kit in my price range</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Amazon.com for many years, however that will change from here out. Apparently, there is no regulation on who or what age person can purchase this item - so my 15 year old daughter purchased this without my knowledge and gave herself a tattoo!!!! The ink is rising out of the skin as it heals so basically she will have a large scar on her leg. Kids make really bad choices sometimes that they later regret and I am still stunned that she did this, which is exactly why I am shocked that they have no regulation on age when it comes to purchasing items that contain needles and ways to modify your body. Unbelievable!!!! Lets just hope the needles are in fact sterile and no infection materializes. We all know that just because a needle is wrapped in a wrapper that says sterile doesn&#x27;t mean that it is!!</li>
            <li> Cross \\&quot;gun\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work.  Other then that everything is prefect.  DOESN&#x27;T come with instructions so if you don&#x27;t know how to work it and put it together then you can look it up on YouTube. I seen where a lot of people had a problem With the ink but my ink was fine. Good starter kit! I did contact amazon about the cross gun and they are taking care of everything and are very nice and understanding about it.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. One machine was broken, needles looked used, ink was horrible and the transfer oil sucks. I would never recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Machines work great!! Way higher quality then I expected. The power source and foot pedal are pretty cheap. The ink is tiny. These are worth the money. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The man behind the dvd is no help at all. I was laughing out loud trying to follow along. Not sure if the supplies are worth buying because the instructions are terrible. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Meh, not bad. The ink doesn&#x27;t stick, the cross gun doesn&#x27;t work, the power supply and foot pedal are very low quality. But other than that of you&#x27;re gonna tattoo potatoes than this is the first ever amazing potato tattoo kit!</li>
            <li> The tattoo machine came with no instructions!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because i wanted to start tattooing and for the price it was perfect, everything came individualy wrapped and worked perfect!</li>
            <li> The machines in this kit are faulty and do not hold the needle in place when in use. The ink works well so far. The video is unhelpful in terms of how to set up the machine, which I feel is more important than the method of giving a tattoo, which is pretty straight forward. The power supply come with an on/off switch rather than a hold to turn on, which I find to be less useful.</li>
            <li> Great kit for the money. I already have dozens of tattoos in and the guns are still going strong</li>
            <li> Somebody please help me !!! Its not starting what am I doing wrong it came with no instructions</li>
            <li> Got for my babysdad and he loves it and said it works great.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price. Both guns work and power supply is OK. Like expected, the ink is terrible, definitely buy some good quality ink. CD is useless. Taught myself to tattoo and did some nice work with this beginner kit.</li>
            <li> Thank you for quick delivery. Product works great. Everything I paid for was in the package.</li>
            <li> great starter kit.I needed to order more supplies after the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> everything that shows in the pic came in this kit and worked great just got this kit last week and have already has done 6 tats</li>
            <li> I love my starter kit.  The tattoo machines work great.  Might have to switch the power supply as I progress in my work.  Cant beat the merchandise that you receive for your money.</li>
            <li> Happy with everything in this starter kit</li>
            <li> the tattoo kit is perfect for the price done had a couple of tattoos done on me and a few friends perfect kit for the beginner i picked it up as soon as i got it and gave myself a tattoo its that easy to pick up and give yourself a tattoo defiently would reccomend it to any one looking for a good tatoo kit.</li>
            <li> It was excellent, exactly what I wanted. I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the negative reviews I read about this product. You actually have to have enough common sense to use this item. Everything works correctly, looks good, and all the items were there like it said on the ad. The video only worked in the computer, if your going to do alot of tattooing you&#x27;ll need more ink, needles, etc. just a good item. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, packaged well, Works great. I am using it right now and it is working great and the colors are great as well. Will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re weary of not spending too much money on a kit because it will be super cheap and crappy, that&#x27;s completely not the case here. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the quality I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had something wrong in my kit and these guys shipped me out a new piece first thing no questions. I will for sure order from again!</li>
            <li> Everything was included in the package except there wasn&#x27;t any instructions for setup, and with it being my first gun made it difficult, but overall everything works good.</li>
            <li> Everything came in the package fine. Tattoo came out great on me. As well as others. Customer&#x27;s was satisfied.</li>
            <li> now it I could buy some artistic skills I&#x27;d be all set</li>
            <li> I searched for a while to find a great starter kit. This came with everything I needed. A lot of the problems I was finding with the other kits is that unless you wanted to spend a couple hundred dollars the inks really sucked. The inks in this kit are great are there is a good variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I opened the box that this was going to be a quality gun. However, it was super easy to put together and to work with. The guns are light enough you can tattoo for a long time without your hand hurting. I will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I got this product before it said I would, I&#x27;m so happy with the results. Thank you so much for my new gun and ink!</li>
            <li> The gun the needles ink power supply everything you need to get started!!!! Need more stencils now OMG!! Gotta get Green soap!!</li>
            <li> The guns are fantastic. The video dvd inside really help out and gives you some helpful tips. Good product to have if youre into tattooing.</li>
            <li> The ink don&#x27;t Stay in The Skin and The Tattoo gun Stops Sometimes. what&#x27;s up with That???</li>
            <li> The order was placed last week it was easy to purchase and processes for payment and I received the product quickly and undamaged.  All items listed came in the box as described.  The video was not the best, but the machine works fine.  The ink bottles are small but for a basic kits to start off it&#x27;s a good buy for the money.  The items were neatly put in the box and had everything I needed to start off.  Trying the gun out now and it works!</li>
            <li> that qulity of the gun was overall very well it does the job the way it should and for the price you cant beat it</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit only a few days ago, and it has already arrived. everything is in the kit like listed. it was all intact,nothing broken,nothing missing. i hooked everything up and it runs great. love the colors that came with it. i would definitely buy from this company over and over again. everything in the kit is perfect. i recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to keep perspective. This is a 40 dollar kit. That being said, it was a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machines are decent. Good strong 10 wrap coils, and like any tat machine, fully adjustable. and compatible with most parts on the market. Don&#x27;t like the guns? soup &#x27;em up with some aftermarket springs, armature bars, or whatever. For the money, they are GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories are a little light - mainly the fact that I only got 1 grip, and have to use disposable grips to set up both machines at once. Minor issue. No rubber bands, but they are cheap and easy to find, I guess that is why they should have included a handful. The power supply is basic and China Cheap, but it works well, has a smooth rheostat and supplies consistent power... in my experience. I could see there being some rejects, but that&#x27;s how it is with any cheap Chinese products. I did not have any issues worth contacting the seller, so I don&#x27;t know how awesome they are at dealing with returns/exchanges, but if they are cool, this is an even better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inks - Everyone knows that these cheap inks are not very good. Not to be trusted. Good inks cost around 8 bucks an ounce, so you can just figure that these are going to suck. The black does line pretty well, I just don&#x27;t trust the staying power. Do yourself a favor, and invest in some Fusion inks, Eternal, Kuro Sumi, etc. Even Mom&#x27;s is way better than trusting these inks. So, don&#x27;t think that you are buying this kit for it&#x27;s awesome inks. Use these for practice - on the practice skins, and you&#x27;ll do fine. Same goes for the power supply. Upgrade when you can. This is not your &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; Kit. It&#x27;s meant to get you started in the right direction, and does so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is one of the better bangs for the buck in the 50 dollars and under kits. All of the important stuff is good. I read a lot of complaints about the inks - see above. Buy real inks. As for those complaining that the machines don&#x27;t work, etc... you will do well for yourself by studying how they work. They are simple machines that require the operator to know what they are doing in order to set them up right. If you try using a shader to run your lines, you will not have a good time. If you can&#x27;t tune your machines, you are like a guitarist that can&#x27;t tune his guitar. These machines are basic, but well built. Totally worth the money, despite the frustration of wanting top of the line gear for forty bucks... Ha! If you want better than this, you&#x27;re going to have to shell out some more ducats.</li>
            <li> Great machine done did several tattoos with it very satisfied.</li>
            <li> not bad but needs more items only came with one gromet and one rubberband</li>
            <li> I bought this set for practicing and everything came in very organized, the machines are working awesome the only thing that needs improving is the ink, that&#x27;s only if you are tattooing on someone.</li>
            <li> should have instructions no instructions was included had to go on u tube and instructions was a rate from 1-10 I give it a 4 . my son lovesss it</li>
            <li> The machine itself gets over heated really easily so it&#x27;s best to use it in 20-30 minute intervals and it doesn&#x27;t come with rubber bands but other than that it&#x27;s a great cheap set for practicing on fruits and skin sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying a more powerful machine (which runs 60 and up) when actually tattooing people.</li>
            <li> It is a great starter for the price. Good quality products and ink , the guns are well balanced and well put together .</li>
            <li> Nice but wish there was more stencil paper</li>
            <li> I bought this for all that was inside, but mostly the &amp;#34;cross machine&amp;#34;, and it arrived broken. The &amp;#34;Anchor&amp;#34; werks great! And everything else it comes with is great. Inks are super teeny, you&#x27;ll deff. need more if you&#x27;re doing more than two tattoos. The main power supply shorts out after about two hours of tattooing, and now I either have to keep it on during the whole tattoo or keep pulling out the cords to &amp;#34;Reset it&amp;#34;. So, so. I&#x27;m not disapointed, but I&#x27;m not 100% pleased.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit. Works great and easy to set up.</li>
            <li> I just received my package hrs ago. Pretty nice quality but 2 major flaws.. I didn&#x27;t realize this kit comes with no  assembly manual and Im fairly new to the ink game so Im clueless. Also,the video was helpless. Can anyone give me brief directions on getting set up??</li>
            <li> The ink that I got with it was dried up and to thick to actually use. But the machines were perfect. I figured it was from the shipping that made the inks that way the only color useable was white.</li>
            <li> Ink isn&#x27;t very good at all. So u might wanna invest in new ink when u get the kit. It was missing parts as Well.one of the guns didn&#x27;t wanna work either.</li>
            <li> very good. excellent seller.</li>
            <li> Came as quoted, product in great condition ,on time....thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, everything was there as stated. Ink although does run in skin. Would consider different ink</li>
            <li> Not good  I had to fix it they put the screw on upside down and the DVD is just a bunch of bs</li>
            <li> I dreamed of having a helicopter tattoo so I ordered one of these bad boys and within a week I had this and my dream came true! I wanted it on my right arm, but I&#x27;m a righty, so it&#x27;s a little messy, but I think it turned out great! Here&#x27;s a picture: [...]</li>
            <li> Good product one gun was broken but the other one it can with worked like a champ deff a good buy for anyone into tattoos</li>
            <li> Great starter kit for anyone who wants to start tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying different ink though, don&#x27;t use the ink it comes with.</li>
            <li> It comes with the basics but no instructions. The DVD it came with was so bad I couldn&#x27;t even stand to watch it for more than 10 minutes. Was it made in the 80&#x27;s???!?!! I guess you could use this to practice but you&#x27;ll need to get more practice skin, better tattoo paper (it only comes w/1), and better ink once you&#x27;re ready to tattoo people. A little instruction manual would have been nice instead of a s***ty poorly recorded DVD with terrible music and ugh, it was just terrible.... But get this since it&#x27;s cheaper than the others and ships fast but just know you&#x27;ll have to learn how to use it yourself or through youtube tutorials.</li>
            <li> The gun is falling apart an has had it not very long either not very good quality and the dvd does not show to give instructions....</li>
            <li> Everything perfect the guns seems light &amp; but it&#x27;s a lot for the low right the INK SUCK IT REJECTS YOUR SKIN DONT USE IT BUT EVERYELSE IS PERFECT NEEDLES ARE WELL PACKAGED.ITS GOOD FOR A BEGGINER</li>
            <li> Everything works great the machine with the cross needed tuning but most machines do out of the box. power supply and peddle work great the inks are alright I haven&#x27;t used all of em but their ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I just got my kit in the mail yesterday and I&#x27;m actually impressed except in a couple of things. When I opened the box I noticed that of the ink bottles had burst so there was purple ink all over the bag containing all of the inks. Another thing, there were no rubber bands! The rubber rings and nibblets were there but no rubber bands.. But overall I like how the machine works and the look of the frames. 4/5 would recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my boyfriend and we Love it!!!!! Already had to purchase more supplies only after having it for 2 months....hes used both guns that came with it and is satisfied with both.....I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pirate face tattoo has much better kits. The machines are decent but the ink needles and tubes are poor quality.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I absolutely do not like about this tattoo kit is the ink is horrible! Don&#x27;t buy this kit for the ink! Love the guns!</li>
            <li> My son lost his expensive tattoo kit in a house fire - plus we almost lost them!!!  He was excited with this set.  Nothing like his really expensive set, but he said awesome buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Awesome product! The couple of tattoos that I have done have turned out completely awesome. I will be buying from again very soon!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. I had my fun with it, and the tattoos actually turned out pretty decent. I would suggest buying different (better) ink instead of using the ink they supply you with.</li>
            <li> I like that a lot I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting another one</li>
            <li> Thank its nice to have this thanks again to for or everything</li>
            <li> TThis is a good product so far i am vary happy with the shipping it was here before i knew it an both guns working order i have been using these guns for weeks now with no problems an have even used them on myself vary happy with the ink as well thanks Garry</li>
            <li> Well I got my kit the day befor they said i would witch is good... but I have ink that the tops was never put on them so I had ink every where and I have a pack off needles open. Witch that was no good... but all in all the machines works pretty good and I called the seller and they refunded my money with no problem</li>
            <li> This was awesome! Came with way more than I thought. Very well put together !! Im so excited cant wait to use it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit after reading the reviews so I knew what to expect once doing my homework. Everything was intact and as described in the listing. The Dvd is useless as the reviews said so I got my hands on every video and book I could to study up. That way when the package came I would know how to set up online and do shading.  I would definitely recommend this product if you do your homework And learn the proper techniques and set up all the equipment. Both of the guns work and the ink was fine . I just wish the kit came with the proper cleaning supplies To be able to work in a sterile environment.  Those things you have to purchase separately.  Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Good tattoo gun. Only came with one gun and it wasn&#x27;t shown in any pictures. A friend of mine actually picked it up from my recommendation. But it&#x27;s a good for the price. Comes with all wires and power supply as shown. Only suggestion I would make would be to pick up some extra supplies for the gun. Needles, guards, ink, ink cups, etc.</li>
            <li> My brother in loaves it</li>
            <li> This Tattoo Kit is nice for beginner or someone that want to give Tattoo a try. I got this Kit for my son and he love it. The ink is very good ink &amp; the Machine Gun is a quality one. He have done a few Tattoo on people and they love his artwork. He hoping to turn this into a business one day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tattoo kit like 2 weeks ago, n i only used it 4 times plus using it on practice skin, everything worked very well came with everything but after the 4th time doing, something went wrong either i have a short in my cords or my machine is not working. i dont know whats wrong with it it only works if i hold it upside down?? can anyone tell me what to do or whats wrong??</li>
            <li> The kit is good for a starter kit but the power supply unit is a piece of turd.  So if you buy this then buy a spare decent power supply unit.</li>
            <li> Great for a starter set if you&#x27;re looking to get into tattooing. Please don&#x27;t tattoo others without a license.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect timing and its great for beginners</li>
            <li> Guns keep going out I don&#x27;t kno why have to wiggle the cords. Ink came busted in the pack</li>
            <li> Tutorial disc is not compatible with any electronic device that I own. Very inconvenient. Probably won&#x27;t recommend to anyone wanting to take up this field.</li>
            <li> Got here quick, the power box is wonky, the cords wont make a good connection to the box there for It will not work. used it once then it stopped working. The metals are rusting one of the inks leaked through into the bag. It was great while it worked, just wish the power box would work. The dvd shows nothing on care and assembly of the equiptment the dvd is very out dated.</li>
            <li> The ink sucked, even the black turned into a faint grey. The guns kept stopping during tattoos. I know what I&#x27;m doing with a gun and this was an embarrassment leaving someone with a crappy tattoo due to the malfunctions of the gun and the ink being not worth.02 cents. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit. Youll need more needles though, the shading ones. Havent tried colors yet but im sure theyre great royal violet looks sweet</li>
            <li> One of the guns didn&#x27;t work, so I ended up selling them</li>
            <li> Came with everything but the shader needles and green soap still love it and the guns are nice and the ink says in . Would totally recommend for the budding artist.</li>
            <li> Decent kit machines run great don&#x27;t like the pedal or the power supply luckily I have extras of those over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> i love my kit i have done so many quality tattoos with it and have been able to produce some quality work with it i was a little upset that one of the machines would not work right bc it had to much paint on the contact points but they fixed that problem by sending me a whole new machine which was very just and extremely fair of them i would recommend them to anyone of my friends who was thinking of buying a tattoo kit for themselves</li>
            <li> It was a good price. The gun is ok. The power supply isn&#x27;t so great tho. The inks are cheap and watered down but you get what you pay for.  It was shipped out fast which is good. I would recommend the kit bt would buy additional inks from somewhere else. The color would not stay</li>
            <li> Got it today so far so good except that the cross gun doesn&#x27;t stay on it turns off and i have to stop and fix it alot.</li>
            <li> Ugh one gun came broken.... horrible ink. (Getting better ink.) Had to tune the one gun that actually worked intensely, at first it didn&#x27;t work at aaaaaall. Luckily I&#x27;m experienced otherwise I would&#x27;ve wasted money...  still a decent kit for a new artist with no experience, don&#x27;t tattoo if you don&#x27;t have a license please. It&#x27;s still a good price but very cheap, no surpise it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li> i bought this and could never get it to work.</li>
            <li> It arrived right one time, but I did pay for the same day delivery. It came in an amazon box with a white box taped up. Everything was packaged, the machines, the ink, the caps, the needles, cords, power supply, etc.. I don&#x27;t have a working DVD player so I had to use the internet to see how to set up a tattoo machine. (first time tattoo machine owner). Once I got it set up and everything was in the right spots, I turned it on. The power supply looks pretty cheap, but it works pretty well. I have already done a tattoo on my knee (a cover up of a heart I did by hand a long time ago) And it seems to be a pretty sturdy machine. The grip was perfect, the machine is pretty light weight, so it&#x27;s easy to handle. The only complaint I have right now is that the &amp;#34;bottle of transfer oil&amp;#34; is empty. Did it come that way on purpose, or was it a mistake. I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t heard back. But, for the price and same day shipping all under 50 bucks, I say it&#x27;s a steal. I love it, and I look forward to more tattoo ventures with these machines! If you have any doubts about it, don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a pretty great kit!</li>
            <li> Everything but rubberbands. Great for a newcomer. Shipped and Delivered in one day.</li>
            <li> Great for the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Shipped a day early for me. For the price it was a good quality kit. The cross gun is very nicely designed and looks beautiful. The practice skins and carbon stencil paper are a helpful addition. Everything you need to make a solid tattoo ans long as you have the expertise. It isn&#x27;t shop quality, but what the hell would you expect I got mine for 30something. for two guns and a more than complete kit, its a good deal. I recommend this to anyone in need of a small kit or someone trying to learn the art of tattoo.</li>
            <li> One of the guns didn&#x27;t work one of the inks were busted and the power supply was weak but good enough for a tat I suppose</li>
            <li> Exactly what i ordered with fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am extremely  satisfied with my purchase.  I ordered it for my 21year old son &amp; he has been doing tattoos every since.</li>
            <li> ink sucks as well as transfer paper . but everything else is to die for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and everything is still in great condition. The power box is small but it does what its supposed to. The machines work great, I use them on every tattoo. The DVD is completely useless though</li>
            <li> Nice kit , really dont show anything on the DVD so you gotta watch youtube alot if you beggining</li>
            <li> Loved everything in it except the power supply. it didn&#x27;t work and it appeared fake. had to buy one separetely</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price, good and sturdy product. I like how it was all safe in air bags nothing damaged.</li>
            <li> Gonna give it a five...very solid kit..machines run well and strong...can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Received and neither of the tattoo machines worked even when properly tuned. Faulty foot pedal. Would have to be totally rebuilt to even work. Junk and a waste of money. Very disappointed. I strongly recommend you do NOT waste your money on this kit. Can&#x27;t even use. Oh, and if you&#x27;re a beginner it doesnt come with any instructions on how to assemble or use the machines. The DVD included is a joke and useless!</li>
            <li> Awesome kit highly recommend</li>
            <li> Bought this as a back up for supplies, everything is in great working order.</li>
            <li> Cheap kit... But it works fine with a little tuning</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item it works well the ink is good and it works nice it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it was alright , kinda didn&#x27;t expect what i got but this a good beginner kit , really small</li>
            <li> The ink machines are good. The ink itself does not last and fades quickly.  the foot peddle is awesome you don&#x27;t have to keep your foot on it. turn o  turn off.  the digital power supply is OK too</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected and I wish there were more pieces of carbon paper in the kit but all in all, the guns run well, great weight and feel in my hand and it&#x27;s perfect for beginners!</li>
            <li> very good kit like the machine but was shocked to hear and all need to know this the needles are being recalled by the fda so check your kits to see if they include the recalled needles and some types of the ink are alo being recalled but only my needles are being recalled</li>
            <li> This was one of the greatest &amp;#34;student&amp;#34; tattoo kits I had ever worked with. As someone new to tattooing, this is the perfect kit. The inks work well also and don&#x27;t fade like some inks.</li>
            <li> overall its not bad. the machines are alright its not like using a 400 $ machine though but i did not expect it to if your just starting out this is a perfect set up for a beginner</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He is now able to practice tattooing.</li>
            <li> I love it ,it is a great set . Only complaint is the practice pad is really thick an does not resemble skin. And ink recommend to use on practice pad  but I did a couple tattoos with it and the colors are not that bright but it stuck and looks good .</li>
            <li> Seems like a really great kit for the price. Just too bad the power supply doesn&#x27;t work well or at all</li>
            <li> love it enjoy using it everyday</li>
            <li> One machine did not work but otherwise its a wonderful starting kit!</li>
            <li> The kit is great. I love the machines, but the ink is cruddy. It doesn&#x27;t stay in the skin well. If your going to get this kit, make sure you buy some decent ink such as intenze ink, mom&#x27;s, or skin candy.</li>
            <li> one of my guns work but the other gun dont work  the cross gun and tht the.mainly why.i got it</li>
            <li> This is absolutely DISGUSTING. YOU people are ruining the tattoo industry and allowing these SCRATCHERS to give horrible tattoos and possibly horrendous infections!! No one in a reputable shop would ever buy this garbage. Enjoy your cancer from those nasty off brand ink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW ITS CALLED A MACHINE NOT A GUN!</li>
            <li> Everything came with my kit, everything works correctly and completely and it is wonderful thanks.</li>
            <li> With the exception of gloves, green soap, and a set of instructions this kit came with everything I could have hoped for. It arrived in a little white cardboard package with everything in individual plastic-wrapped packets. I am especially appreciative of the tattoo tiger design printed on fake skin for practicing tattooing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two machines, a liner and a shader, both aesthetically pleasing with the liner having a cross emblem and the shader having an anchor emblem on it. There is a power supple with cables and a foot pedal for sending power to the machine. The foot supply is a little flimsy and it can get flipped upside down fairly easily. The machine had no clear signs as to which thing plugged into which port on the power supply. On top of the power supply it does say input, output, so I just took a guess and it worked great! Being a novice, I don’t know if the machine needs to be tuned a lot or a little. I found that it tattoos fruit very nicely right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with miniature bottles of ink which seem to hold their color fairly well in the melons that I tattooed cherry blossoms onto with the liner (the cross emblem one). It comes with sterilized needles, all packaged in secure containers, a sheet of paper for transferring the design, various pieces to assemble the machine, a fake skin with a tiger design, tiny ink-holder cups, and miniature bottles of inks.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first tattoo machine purchase so I was pretty new to the machine. A friend had been a tattoo apprentice at a shop so he showed me how to assemble and disassemble the machine, which was incredibly helpful considering there were no instructions included in my kit! The advice I would give is to watch “how to set up and auto tune your tattoo machine” youtube videos to get how to assemble and disassemble the machine, since you won’t be getting much help from the kit you just ordered. The little L-shaped wrench fits into the groves on the tattoo machine and that is how you tighten and loosen the length of the tattoo grip/tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about three oranges and three melons, I did break the cross emblem machine. That might be completely on me, though, because with no instructions I was pretty much tightening and loosening the tuning piece way too frequently and with little thought. The machine eventually stopped vibrating (I could hear the click of the generated power but the motor would not turn over), so I stopped using the cross one after I broke it. I switched to the shader and the shader works great and now I know better than to tamper with the tuning without watching youtube videos beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can really find fault with is that the kit did not come with instructions, and that is pretty important if you are new to the craft of tattooing. Aside from that, everything was in the package that I had anticipated. All the parts were sealed carefully and nothing had spilled or torn. One star off for the lack of instructions, but four stars given here for the completeness of the kit and the fact that the cross emblem machine lasted that long with me tampering with the tuning every five minutes! I don&#x27;t know if a professional would like to buy this, but for a novice it works great!</li>
            <li> Everything was nice and works well. My rubber bands for the guns was left out. It&#x27;s important you need them for the guns to run properly. Besides that description of product is exactly what you get!</li>
            <li> This is a good machine for learning to tattoo. Simple set up and design. It was delivered on time with everything i needed to get started (Minus shading needles). On the flipside, i would suggest ordering better ink and more stencils bc the ink is very basic and you dont get enough stencils. Ive done about 6 on myself and im very happy with the results. to anyone who wants to get into tattooing... Do research and PRACTICE before you work on yourself. there are a lot of things im still learning now that i wish i had known before i started giving them to myself (i put the machine together and went to work with no practice).&lt;br /&gt;all together this is an awesome product and im having a lot of fun with it</li>
            <li> Bulls*** .... dont waste your time !!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all the oil u get 🙊</li>
