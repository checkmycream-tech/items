            <li>It is grainy, fine but does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>very good product, super fine crystals.</li>
            <li>(I read the gifted and non-gifted product reviews), and paid for this out of my own pocket.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m silky smooth, head to toe, and love it!</li>

            <li>The product I had been using for ages was a bit more abrasive and tended to irritate my skin somewhat.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this.  </li>

            <li>I will be using Lavo scrub and masks for many years to come</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a bit more substantial for almost $30.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I love how the exfoliant in it is so fine.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my face and after using it my skin feels extremely soft.  </li>

            <li>my skin feels so good after using it - and it&#x27;s not harsh like most scrubs you find.  </li>
            <li>It is every bit as creamy and effective as what I previously used and I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice jar and really moisturizes and hydrates your skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream is light.</li>
            <li>best results use with a round Loofah pad.</li>
            <li>use!!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to makeup free damp skin and massaged into my face for about a minute.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with baby smooth skin without irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li>My skincare products seem to be absorbed better, too.</li>
            <li>It has superfine crystals and also moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great 2 days later.</li>
            <li>Makes the face feel so smooth as represented.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and felt so good, I didn&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.  </li>

            <li>The white heads that made my nose feel bumpy are completely gone and my nose is flawless.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel beyond amazing + smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>being said, I have to agree completely with the overall assessment that this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It had a much more gentle effect on my skin</li>
            <li>I even tried a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going full body microdermabrasion, every day.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>He was attentive to my issue and made it right 100%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first time I used this, I noticed that my skin was brighter and that it lightened my sun spots and &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; out my fine lines...</li>
            <li>I was hopeful that the crystals in it would make my skin more vibrant.</li>
            <li>A mild microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li>all get easily and painlessly removed by the gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>it does the job, yesterday was my first use!</li>
            <li>so my face doesn&#x27;t get so dry but still feels nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>my skin looks super clean and feels really soft and smooth and to me</li>
            <li>Every product I have tried so far, seems to be a tad better for oily skin though.</li>

            <li>I had to return this as it wasn&#x27;t the right thing for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to get the gunk outta your pores.</li>
            <li>I apply the scrub to my clean, damp face and gently massage product into skin for about 2 minutes.  </li>

            <li>I have also been using the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil and it is fantastic as well!</li>
            <li>professional-quality  cream contains super fine aluminum crystals to polish up your skin and actually make your skin lighter and brighter without the use of chemicals.</li>
            <li>it is so creamy and being both a cream and scrub in one it really can do anything!  </li>
            <li>gentle and did the job!</li>
            <li>My skin did feel soft, supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The smaller of the amount the better for me in my case.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin so soft &amp;amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend to give this a try and it is for sure something I will reorder when I run out of.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and noticed improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe how well this microdermabrasion cream works!</li>
            <li>I have never had these results on any product like this after the first</li>
            <li>This at-home mini facial can help decrease acne scars, blemishes, sun damage, and so much more.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a bit pricey at first</li>
            <li>I used this product once so far and my skin was smooth like butter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the LAVO line of products a lot!</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not harsh &amp;amp; super gritty like so many.  </li>
            <li>I am a young 51 and this product has cleared my large pores significantly, without irritation.</li>
            <li>I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>For the most part my skin is oily, but during the winter I do gt dry spots.</li>
            <li>Large pores are under control.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li>This scrub really seems to work as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and looks so fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li>husband tried this as well, he has oily skin and its helped him, but not as much as it has helped me.</li>
            <li>and I used a whole bunch of products from Philosophy to Orlane.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Youthful Essence facial tool, because it looks like Youthful Essence is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using it gently until you can determine how your skin reacts</li>
            <li>Product really works.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy with the finest grit I have ever seen or used in a microdermabrasion cream.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I also bought the mud mask at the same time, which came wrapped in tissue and was perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>The granules are so small, but effective.  </li>
            <li>I then rinsed it off with warm water and followed with my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has little crystals that I really feel when I use my face brush, I love it.  </li>
            <li>These are my better half’s observations of the cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly can recommend this Product</li>
            <li>Used it last night for the first time and it is an abrasion!  </li>
            <li>Not thrilled about the ingredients, but my face felt smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love using this product to exfoliate my skin, as it helps buff away dead skin cells and it tightens my skin/pores.</li>
            <li>This past year I&#x27;ve done better than before, especially considering all the new products I&#x27;ve been testing- having an article due is a good reminder to actually USE all those  shiny products sitting on your vanity</li>
            <li>One of my New Year&#x27;s resolutions (insofar as I believe in those) is to start taking extra-good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Just used this with my new Lavo giro microdermabrasion cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I just received this today and the bottle didn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it at home exfoliating on a regular basis and you will never have to go again to the spa for a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>I don’t know if you guys have the same problem as me, but each time I buy a scrub, it ends up being too bland, as there aren’t enough granules or they are too soft and don’t do a good</li>
            <li>This mildly abrasive cream is used with a facial Loofah pad daily as a scrub to remove &amp;#34;facial uprisings&amp;#34; that appear.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling soft and silky with a slightly pinkish, healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>but those little guys definitely smooth out my skin.  </li>
            <li>All I had to do was apply a small amount of the cream to my clean face and massage it in a gentle, circular motion for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>thus making the overall experience a little more skin-soothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used to be a big fan of microdermabrasion and diamond peel treatments but they tend to get very pricey.</li>
            <li>I use it with a  Olay Professional handheld face brush.</li>
            <li>found that the crystals were indeed super-fine, sort of like rubbing soft beach sand on your skin at the ocean.</li>
            <li>- literally you only need a pea-size amount to really make it work.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times so far</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin and leaves it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>My concealer actually completely hides them now.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin, I have had no break outs since I started this.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face was as soft and silky as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used once, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have uneven skin tone, sun spots and starting to get fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way with this cream and what I love about it too is the fact that you only need a minute or two to work the product on your skin!</li>
            <li>Seriously this makes my face really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Actually, it seems it even soothes my complexion, leaving it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use it on on face and neck and it has left my skin so soft and silky</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a thick cream with a high concentration of micro crystals that exfoliate the skin very well.</li>

            <li> This works great for acne -</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a great complexion.</li>

            <li> Love this microdermabrasion cream, does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> I LOVE a good exfoliating scrub and this one that LAVO sent me to review for my blog, GlamRiver is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Nope it was as good as using a sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion Cream from LAVO seems like a good way to start the year.</li>
            <li> good--</li>
            <li> Good cream for the price.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I really loved their mud mask</li>
            <li> Feels good scrubby.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that I&#x27;m getting a good value</li>
            <li> This is very fine sand finish that works great to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> did receive this free to sample in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion, however when I run out, I will be buying another!!</li>
            <li> It also does a great job with skin renewal – ergo, fine lines are eradicated with continuous use of this microdermabrasion cream!</li>

            <li> Gives the skin a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The micro-abrasion particles are smoothing and effective.</li>

            <li> i received this product at a reduced price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, my face felt super clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed after the first use, I ordered their deep cleansing oil as well which is also wonderful in removing even the waterproof eye makeup.</li>
            <li> It is grainy, fine but does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> very good product, super fine crystals.</li>
            <li> (I read the gifted and non-gifted product reviews), and paid for this out of my own pocket.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use up so much of it right away.</li>
            <li> A very fine granular mixture that cleans the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> SKin’s Microdermabrasion Cream was designed to resurface and exfoliate your skin to minimize fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> First off LAVO smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not roughed up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m silky smooth, head to toe, and love it!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> Love this product -</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t even seem like I have used mine :)  </li>

            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I do see a difference for the better in my skin.</li>
            <li> Daniel, the president of the company is top notch.</li>
            <li> The product I had been using for ages was a bit more abrasive and tended to irritate my skin somewhat.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> I will be using Lavo scrub and masks for many years to come</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more substantial for almost $30.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I love how the exfoliant in it is so fine.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my face and after using it my skin feels extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> This cream is easy to apply and easy to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and my</li>
            <li> my skin feels so good after using it - and it&#x27;s not harsh like most scrubs you find.  </li>
            <li> It is every bit as creamy and effective as what I previously used and I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice jar and really moisturizes and hydrates your skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream is light.</li>
            <li> best results use with a round Loofah pad.</li>
            <li> use!!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to makeup free damp skin and massaged into my face for about a minute.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with baby smooth skin without irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> My skincare products seem to be absorbed better, too.</li>
            <li> It has superfine crystals and also moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Makes the face feel so smooth as represented.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and felt so good, I didn&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.  </li>
            <li> Do far, so good.</li>
            <li> You use the product on a clean, damp face and you can feel it thoroughly scrubbing your face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to try the LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream/Exfoliating Scrub.</li>
            <li> The white heads that made my nose feel bumpy are completely gone and my nose is flawless.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel beyond amazing + smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> being said, I have to agree completely with the overall assessment that this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It had a much more gentle effect on my skin</li>
            <li> I even tried a full body scrub.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going full body microdermabrasion, every day.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> He was attentive to my issue and made it right 100%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first time I used this, I noticed that my skin was brighter and that it lightened my sun spots and &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; out my fine lines...</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that the crystals in it would make my skin more vibrant.</li>
            <li> A mild microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> all get easily and painlessly removed by the gentle scrub.</li>
            <li> it does the job, yesterday was my first use!</li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t get so dry but still feels nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> my skin looks super clean and feels really soft and smooth and to me</li>
            <li> Every product I have tried so far, seems to be a tad better for oily skin though.</li>
            <li> With this Microdermabrasion Cream, you can effectively remove dead skin cells and reduce your pores, which is fantastic!</li>

            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I thought I should write in a review on this product after seeing that most of the reviews for it (so far) have been from customers who have received the product for free.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> You get a more polished, deep clean feeling.</li>
            <li> the face and leaves it very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I had to return this as it wasn&#x27;t the right thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to get the gunk outta your pores.</li>
            <li> I apply the scrub to my clean, damp face and gently massage product into skin for about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle enough to be safe to use, but they are also quite effective and they leave a nice, silky feeling and remove dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago, its absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m really getting the full benefit of my serums/moisturizer, this way.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> its is a very fine grit, however too find for my skin texture, did not exfoliate well enough.</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and soft, glowing skin!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream/Exfoliating Scrub is very gentle yet it works.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> , it was like applying paint to a new clean canvas.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have also been using the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil and it is fantastic as well!</li>
            <li> professional-quality  cream contains super fine aluminum crystals to polish up your skin and actually make your skin lighter and brighter without the use of chemicals.</li>
            <li> it is so creamy and being both a cream and scrub in one it really can do anything!  </li>
            <li> gentle and did the job!</li>
            <li> My skin did feel soft, supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The smaller of the amount the better for me in my case.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin so soft &amp;amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend to give this a try and it is for sure something I will reorder when I run out of.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and noticed improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how well this microdermabrasion cream works!</li>
            <li> I have never had these results on any product like this after the first</li>
            <li> This at-home mini facial can help decrease acne scars, blemishes, sun damage, and so much more.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit pricey at first</li>
            <li> I used this product once so far and my skin was smooth like butter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the LAVO line of products a lot!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not harsh &amp;amp; super gritty like so many.  </li>
            <li> I am a young 51 and this product has cleared my large pores significantly, without irritation.</li>
            <li> I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> For the most part my skin is oily, but during the winter I do gt dry spots.</li>
            <li> Large pores are under control.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
            <li> This scrub really seems to work as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and looks so fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely horrid.</li>
            <li> husband tried this as well, he has oily skin and its helped him, but not as much as it has helped me.</li>
            <li> and I used a whole bunch of products from Philosophy to Orlane.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Youthful Essence facial tool, because it looks like Youthful Essence is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using it gently until you can determine how your skin reacts</li>
            <li> Product really works.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy with the finest grit I have ever seen or used in a microdermabrasion cream.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I also bought the mud mask at the same time, which came wrapped in tissue and was perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> The granules are so small, but effective.  </li>
            <li> I then rinsed it off with warm water and followed with my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has little crystals that I really feel when I use my face brush, I love it.  </li>
            <li> These are my better half’s observations of the cream.  </li>
            <li> I highly can recommend this Product</li>
            <li> Used it last night for the first time and it is an abrasion!  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled about the ingredients, but my face felt smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to exfoliate my skin, as it helps buff away dead skin cells and it tightens my skin/pores.</li>
            <li> This past year I&#x27;ve done better than before, especially considering all the new products I&#x27;ve been testing- having an article due is a good reminder to actually USE all those  shiny products sitting on your vanity</li>
            <li> One of my New Year&#x27;s resolutions (insofar as I believe in those) is to start taking extra-good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Just used this with my new Lavo giro microdermabrasion cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and the bottle didn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it at home exfoliating on a regular basis and you will never have to go again to the spa for a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> I don’t know if you guys have the same problem as me, but each time I buy a scrub, it ends up being too bland, as there aren’t enough granules or they are too soft and don’t do a good</li>
            <li> This mildly abrasive cream is used with a facial Loofah pad daily as a scrub to remove &amp;#34;facial uprisings&amp;#34; that appear.</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling soft and silky with a slightly pinkish, healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> but those little guys definitely smooth out my skin.  </li>
            <li> All I had to do was apply a small amount of the cream to my clean face and massage it in a gentle, circular motion for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> thus making the overall experience a little more skin-soothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of microdermabrasion and diamond peel treatments but they tend to get very pricey.</li>
            <li> I use it with a  Olay Professional handheld face brush.</li>
            <li> found that the crystals were indeed super-fine, sort of like rubbing soft beach sand on your skin at the ocean.</li>
            <li> - literally you only need a pea-size amount to really make it work.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times so far</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and leaves it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> My concealer actually completely hides them now.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin, I have had no break outs since I started this.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face was as soft and silky as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone, sun spots and starting to get fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this cream and what I love about it too is the fact that you only need a minute or two to work the product on your skin!</li>
            <li> Seriously this makes my face really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Actually, it seems it even soothes my complexion, leaving it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use it on on face and neck and it has left my skin so soft and silky</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thick cream with a high concentration of micro crystals that exfoliate the skin very well.</li>
            <li> It isn’t recommended for those with sensitive or irritated skin, or anyone with Rosacea, pustule acne, open sores, or other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that with continued use (I&#x27;ve only had it for a short while) that it will help with some of those stubborn blackheads that have lived on my nose for as long as I can remember- I will update in several weeks once I have come to a verdict!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a week, for a few weeks now, and it is definitely love… The moisturizers and fruit enzymes leave my normally dry skin feeling very hydrated and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream Exfoliating Scrub is super creamy with little crystals that buff away at dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> It contains very fine crystals similar to what is blasted on your face during a microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> and this is going to last you a long time</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I want to see long term results since I got it recently.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, does the job and is small enough not to dry out.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really soft, my pores less noticeable,  </li>
            <li> I gave it a month long try because I didn&#x27;t want to give up on it.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes of rubbing helped clear away dull, dry, flaky winter skin and left my face feeling tingly, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the dermabrasion, I rinsed and patted my skin almost dry.  </li>
            <li> oily on my forehead and chin, and dry and flaky on my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin so dry</li>
            <li> but you only need to use a small amount of product on your face so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> have a very sensitive skin, yet I can use this product daily without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I used the cream for a few weeks I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get any into your eyes, or if you have any open or raw skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> Although I have to say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the very few scrubs that I’ve tried that it actually leaves my skin well exfoliated.</li>
            <li> then I expected compared with the previous product I had been using.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of microdermabrasion treatments but some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past have been a little harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using other products in the LAVO line and hope they work as well as this pot of scrub!</li>
            <li> I have noticed quite a decline in my acne problem and less pop-ups while using this.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight concern with another product that they sell</li>
            <li> No matter what I do, I end up with dry patches and dull looking face this time of year.</li>
            <li> Bumps, little zits, flakes from peeling skin from nature or sun and blackheads</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping me erase little by little my face lines.</li>
            <li> The container is small, yes- but in all honesty, you need just a very little amount of product to treat the face.</li>
            <li> and I usually make it part of my nightly routine.  </li>
            <li> And it takes SO small of an amount</li>
            <li> I like to use this scrub at least twice a week</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best scrub I have used! A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> I love using this product to exfoliate my skin, as it helps buff away dead skin cells and it tightens my skin/pores. It also does a great job with skin renewal – ergo, fine lines are eradicated with continuous use of this microdermabrasion cream! A little bit goes a long way with this cream and what I love about it too is the fact that you only need a minute or two to work the product on your skin! I used to be a big fan of microdermabrasion and diamond peel treatments but they tend to get very pricey. I am so grateful that I was given a chance to try this product out, as it gives me almost the same benefits as the aforementioned treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Used it last night for the first time and it is an abrasion!  It Says to use it 1 or 2 times a week, so will see how it does.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this product. I felt like it was just like any scrub you buy at the drug store. I was hopeful that the crystals in it would make my skin more vibrant. Nope it was as good as using a sugar scrub. I also got break outs from using it. I gave it a month long try because I didn&#x27;t want to give up on it. It reminds me of clinques exfoliating scrub without the mint. I would not buy this again. I tried it with different amounts of water but it didn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator ever. Seriously this makes my face really soft and smooth. The white heads that made my nose feel bumpy are completely gone and my nose is flawless. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago, its absolutely amazing. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once and my skin feels great. It&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin. I use it with a  Olay Professional handheld face brush.</li>
            <li> I LOVE a good exfoliating scrub and this one that LAVO sent me to review for my blog, GlamRiver is awesome!  The LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream Exfoliating Scrub is super creamy with little crystals that buff away at dead skin cells.  I like to use this scrub at least twice a week and I usually make it part of my nightly routine.  I apply the scrub to my clean, damp face and gently massage product into skin for about 2 minutes.  What am I left with?  Amazingly smooth and soft, glowing skin!  I have also been using the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil and it is fantastic as well!</li>
            <li> One of my New Year&#x27;s resolutions (insofar as I believe in those) is to start taking extra-good care of my skin. This past year I&#x27;ve done better than before, especially considering all the new products I&#x27;ve been testing- having an article due is a good reminder to actually USE all those  shiny products sitting on your vanity table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Microdermabrasion Cream from LAVO seems like a good way to start the year. I like the idea of microdermabrasion treatments but some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past have been a little harsh on my sensitive skin. What I like about this one is that the grainy abrasion particles are suspended in a creamy base which includes calming Aloe Vera and Chamomile Extract- thus making the overall experience a little more skin-soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The professional-quality  cream contains super fine aluminum crystals to polish up your skin and actually make your skin lighter and brighter without the use of chemicals. It also contains moisturizers and fruit enzymes to keep your face hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the crystals were indeed super-fine, sort of like rubbing soft beach sand on your skin at the ocean. Just a few minutes of rubbing helped clear away dull, dry, flaky winter skin and left my face feeling tingly, soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this and see what long-term effects it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and brighter with this product. Every bit as excellent as I hoped it would be!</li>
            <li> This is very fine sand finish that works great to exfoliate.  I have used a product by Susan Lucci, Youthful something and needed a replacement product so I decided to try this based on reviews. It is gentle, does the job and is small enough not to dry out.</li>
            <li> Expensive exfoliation.  Same results using 3$ product. Ugh i hate being ripped off.</li>
            <li> I had to return this as it wasn&#x27;t the right thing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 1 week now and i must admit my face does seems and feels a lot smoother. however i will keep you all updated if any changes comes along.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it is so creamy and being both a cream and scrub in one it really can do anything!  With Aloe, Vitamin E and Chamomile my skin feels so good after using it - and it&#x27;s not harsh like most scrubs you find.  It comes in a nice jar and really moisturizes and hydrates your skin.  This works great for acne - I have noticed quite a decline in my acne problem and less pop-ups while using this.  And it takes SO small of an amount - literally you only need a pea-size amount to really make it work.  This cream does not have a scent to it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about allergic reactions to perfumes when using.  And you only need to use it 4-8 times a month and this is going to last you a long time, it doesn&#x27;t even seem like I have used mine :)  I have very sensitive skin and I have noticed no redness or irritation from this product and it also comes with a money back guarantee.  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the very few scrubs that I’ve tried that it actually leaves my skin well exfoliated. I don’t know if you guys have the same problem as me, but each time I buy a scrub, it ends up being too bland, as there aren’t enough granules or they are too soft and don’t do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick cream with a high concentration of micro crystals that exfoliate the skin very well. They are gentle enough to be safe to use, but they are also quite effective and they leave a nice, silky feeling and remove dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive skin, yet I can use this product daily without irritating the skin. Actually, it seems it even soothes my complexion, leaving it soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial scrub.</li>
            <li> This microdermabrasion is my number one product.&lt;br /&gt;Do it at home exfoliating on a regular basis and you will never have to go again to the spa for a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.  Rosa.</li>
            <li> gentle and did the job!</li>
            <li> LAVO, and YES I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and looks like I am back in my 20&#x27;s, thank you. My esthetician is amazed on the shine and blackheads.... for-get-about-it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Suzanne B, 60+</li>
            <li> very good product, super fine crystals.</li>
            <li> Hi, Im Sherri !  Just used this with my new Lavo giro microdermabrasion cleansing system. I absolutely love it. My skin feels luxurious! I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> its is a very fine grit, however too find for my skin texture, did not exfoliate well enough. My skin did feel soft, supple and smooth.  My only issue was not enough exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I love this.  My skin feels soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably one of the best exfoliating creams out there. It contains very fine crystals similar to what is blasted on your face during a microdermabrasion treatment. The cream is light. I do see a difference for the better in my skin. The container is small, yes- but in all honesty, you need just a very little amount of product to treat the face. The smaller of the amount the better for me in my case. I had a slight concern with another product that they sell and I must say that their customer service can&#x27;t be beat. Daniel, the president of the company is top notch. He was attentive to my issue and made it right 100%.</li>
            <li> I used Lavo with my microdermabrasion machine.  It had a much more gentle effect on my skin then I expected compared with the previous product I had been using. After the dermabrasion, I rinsed and patted my skin almost dry.  My skin was left feeling soft and silky with a slightly pinkish, healthy glow.  The product I had been using for ages was a bit more abrasive and tended to irritate my skin somewhat.  I was truly impressed with this product and intent to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This mildly abrasive cream is used with a facial Loofah pad daily as a scrub to remove &amp;#34;facial uprisings&amp;#34; that appear. Bumps, little zits, flakes from peeling skin from nature or sun and blackheads all get easily and painlessly removed by the gentle scrub. Friends comment that my skin looks good-- and I don&#x27;t have a great complexion. Large pores are under control.&lt;br /&gt;For best results use with a round Loofah pad. Been using this for years and I also think it has diminished wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Love it works great. after 2 weeks I already see an improvement in tone texture and color on my face 😊😊</li>
            <li> Love it.  Not harsh &amp;amp; super gritty like so many.  Leaves the skin so soft &amp;amp; smooth.  Applying moisturizer on after makes it just glide on.  Gives the skin a nice glow.  would recommend</li>
            <li> After only one use my skin looks brighter and smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy this.  I&#x27;ve used it three times so far and it&#x27;s amazing each time.  I love how the exfoliant in it is so fine.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m rubbing marbles on my face but those little guys definitely smooth out my skin.  After I wash with it my skin looks super clean and feels really soft and smooth and to me it even looks clearer anf my pores look smaller which is so awesome bc I have large pores on my nose and cheeks.I definitely would recommend to give this a try and it is for sure something I will reorder when I run out of.  Although I have to say a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s great that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use up so much of it right away.</li>
            <li> I use this wash twice a week and I love it. It cleans my skin and leaves it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I have used the cream twice. It left my skin feeling smooth and clean. A very fine granular mixture that cleans the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed.  &amp;quot;</li>
            <li> I like this cream. It leaves my skin really soft, my pores less noticeable,  and it&#x27;s helping me erase little by little my face lines. It does what it claims. It has little crystals that I really feel when I use my face brush, I love it.  It not harsh to my skin. It leaves my skin with a moisture sensation because of the ingredients. I would recommend it. 4 stars because I want to see long term results since I got it recently.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle worker. I am a young 51 and this product has cleared my large pores significantly, without irritation. I use it twice a week and noticed improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> it does the job, yesterday was my first use!</li>
            <li> Good cream for the price. It is grainy, fine but does a good job at exfoliating. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe how well this microdermabrasion cream works! I have uneven skin tone, sun spots and starting to get fine lines around my eyes and mouth. My skin is combination...oily on my forehead and chin, and dry and flaky on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used this, I noticed that my skin was brighter and that it lightened my sun spots and &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; out my fine lines...I have never had these results on any product like this after the first use!!&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to makeup free damp skin and massaged into my face for about a minute. I then used my konjac sponge after massaging into my face, and rinsed. Be careful not to get any into your eyes, or if you have any open or raw skin. This is also fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this free to sample in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion, however when I run out, I will be buying another!!</li>
            <li> These are my better half’s observations of the cream.  The microdermabrasion cream has a yellow color but no detectable odor.  This cream is easy to apply and easy to rinse off.  The micro scrubs are delicate and doesn’t irritate her skin.  So you can use this often without worrying about skin irritation.  Make the skin and pores feel cleaner.  Helps with her oily skin and makes the skin feel softer and works very good as an exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scrub really seems to work as an exfoliator. Just a little goes a long way and my skin feels so soft and looks so fresh afterwards. I look forward to using other products in the LAVO line and hope they work as well as this pot of scrub!</li>
            <li> Does wonders if used properly. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have to admit i am addicted to Lavo products. I use it couple times a week.My skin is so soft. I have tried different brand much more expensive. This is the very best Exfoliating Product.I highly can recommend this Product</li>
            <li> Great scrub... I can tell my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Love the texture and the smell!</li>
            <li> The lavo microdermabrasion cream is perfect for me. It leaves me with baby smooth skin without irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> Like the product. Wish it was in a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> First off LAVO smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not roughed up. Within a few uses my skin felt softer but I didn&#x27;t really notice the scars dissipating. It wasn&#x27;t until I used the cream for a few weeks I actually notice a difference. Without makeup on my scars seem blurry and with makeup they are non existent. My concealer actually completely hides them now. - See more at: http://www.frugalmomandwife.com/2015/01/lavo-microdermabrasion-creamexfoliating.html</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give this one star. It is absolutely horrid. It made my skin so dry and i got some nasty pimples from it.</li>
            <li> I pair this with ToiletTree&#x27;s face cleansing brush and I love it. I have sensitive and acne prone skin, I have had no break outs since I started this. I use it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;My husband tried this as well, he has oily skin and its helped him, but not as much as it has helped me.</li>
            <li> I am an exfoliation junky and I used a whole bunch of products from Philosophy to Orlane. But nothing seemed to do the job during winter.  No matter what I do, I end up with dry patches and dull looking face this time of year. Came across this while I was searching for deep cleansing product for pores and decided to give it a try. I am amazed how thoroughly it cleans my face. No more blackheads on my nose! My skincare products seem to be absorbed better, too. I was so impressed after the first use, I ordered their deep cleansing oil as well which is also wonderful in removing even the waterproof eye makeup. It is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, my face felt super clean after using it. I have sensitive skin and i had no issues using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review. This does not change my opinion on the product. This review contains my personal thoughts and opinions on the product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!  It took only one use to see the difference.  The granules are so small, but effective.  I used this with my Clari-sonic Mia-2 brush and then moisturized per the directions.  My skin was so soft and felt so good, I didn&#x27;t want to apply any makeup.  My face was as soft and silky as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I wanted that feeling to last!  When I  eventually applied make-up (let&#x27;s face it, I can&#x27;t go outside without it), it was like applying paint to a new clean canvas.  My face still felt great even with makeup.  This one&#x27;s a keeper, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I selected this product based upon the reviews (I read the gifted and non-gifted product reviews), and paid for this out of my own pocket.  I am also over 50.  :-)</li>
            <li> Love, love. love the product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  The micro-abrasion particles are smoothing and effective. They are also reducing the age spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Youthful Essence facial tool, because it looks like Youthful Essence is no longer available.  It is every bit as creamy and effective as what I previously used and I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried LAVO’s Ultra-detoxifying Mud Mask, and was very impressed with how well it worked. Every product I have tried so far, seems to be a tad better for oily skin though. I have combination skin, so to counter this, I only use them on my chin and in my T-Zone. This wasn’t the case with their Microdermabrasion Cream. I was able to use it on my entire face, so I am very happy about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAVO SKin’s Microdermabrasion Cream was designed to resurface and exfoliate your skin to minimize fine lines and wrinkles! It isn’t recommended for those with sensitive or irritated skin, or anyone with Rosacea, pustule acne, open sores, or other skin ailments. With this Microdermabrasion Cream, you can effectively remove dead skin cells and reduce your pores, which is fantastic! This at-home mini facial can help decrease acne scars, blemishes, sun damage, and so much more. It was very pleasant to use, as well. All I had to do was apply a small amount of the cream to my clean face and massage it in a gentle, circular motion for 2 minutes. I then rinsed it off with warm water and followed with my usual moisturizer. I have used this product twice a week, for a few weeks now, and it is definitely love… The moisturizers and fruit enzymes leave my normally dry skin feeling very hydrated and refreshed. It also gives me a nice, natural-looking glow to my complexion. I definitely recommend trying it for yourself. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing cream! It&#x27;s got just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to get the gunk outta your pores. It works well with or without a skin cleansing brush (like my Lillian Fache Spa-X brush set) It has a very faint scent~almost like almonds, but barely.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use the the cleansing microderm. cream with a brush. You get a more polished, deep clean feeling. My skin glows, for a day or two after. :))&lt;br /&gt;  I even tried a full body scrub. It gently removed layers of dead skin, that I didn&#x27;t realize was there. I&#x27;m silky smooth, head to toe, and love it! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going full body microdermabrasion, every day. 1-2x&#x27;s a month, is more than enough.&lt;br /&gt; For my face, I use LAVO&#x27;s cleansing cream 2-3x&#x27;s a week. Afterwards, I apply my HA+Vitamin C serum &amp; moisturizer. It feels like I&#x27;m really getting the full benefit of my serums/moisturizer, this way.&lt;br /&gt;  All in All? This cleanser is a keeper. It makes my skin feel beyond amazing + smooth &amp; soft. I LOVE it, and will be ordering more, when I get low.&lt;br /&gt;  *i received this product at a reduced price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. All opinions expressed are solely my own, based on my personal experience with this product. I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> I just love this.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the face and leaves it very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  Not thrilled about the ingredients, but my face felt smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great item, thank you!</li>
            <li> I just received this today and the bottle didn&#x27;t look new. The scrub was on the sides and on the lid. I don&#x27;t want to use the scrub since it looks like it&#x27;s been opened before. Gross! I also bought the mud mask at the same time, which came wrapped in tissue and was perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this exfoliating face scrub.  It has superfine crystals and also moisturizer so my face doesn&#x27;t get so dry but still feels nice and smooth.  Thank you...</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of LAVO face scrub and decided to try it and I am very pleased with this product. I thought it was a bit pricey at first but you only need to use a small amount of product on your face so this will last a long time. You use the product on a clean, damp face and you can feel it thoroughly scrubbing your face clean and smooth. I like how my face feels afterwards. I thought my skin looked smoother and it seemed to have a glow to it. I would recommend using it gently until you can determine how your skin reacts and then you can gradually use more pressure as you use the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, but I really like this product. Nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I will be using Lavo scrub and masks for many years to come and I have also bought some as gifts for my sisters and my daughter. All have made rave reviews!</li>
            <li> I used this product once so far and my skin was smooth like butter.  My skin looks and feels great 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Product really works.  Makes the face feel so smooth as represented.</li>
            <li> Love this microdermabrasion cream, does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have worked with LAVO. I really loved their mud mask so I was really excited to try the LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream/Exfoliating Scrub. If you have an aversion to scents this is the product for you. It is unscented, and I mean it smells like nothing at all-nothing! It is very creamy with the finest grit I have ever seen or used in a microdermabrasion cream. For the most part my skin is oily, but during the winter I do gt dry spots. Not to even mention the blackheads I have on my nose also. LAVO Microdermabrasion Cream/Exfoliating Scrub is very gentle yet it works. I use it on on face and neck and it has left my skin so soft and silky smooth-like a baby&#x27;s butt! I really like the LAVO line of products a lot! They are easy to use and my oh my do they work!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Do far, so good. Feels good scrubby. Did NOT get the price advertised.</li>
            <li> A mild microdermabrasion.  I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I thought I should write in a review on this product after seeing that most of the reviews for it (so far) have been from customers who have received the product for free.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have to agree completely with the overall assessment that this is an excellent product.  It feels great on my face and after using it my skin feels extremely soft.  I can already start to see my pores getting smaller.  I am hoping that with continued use (I&#x27;ve only had it for a short while) that it will help with some of those stubborn blackheads that have lived on my nose for as long as I can remember- I will update in several weeks once I have come to a verdict!&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was very shocked to see how small of a quantity you actually get (its a 2 oz jar).  I was expecting something a bit more substantial for almost $30.  I know you are only supposed to be using it a couple of times a week and that you don&#x27;t need a ton of it at once, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that I&#x27;m getting a good value here.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.  I do think that you will enjoy it once you get over the sticker shock!!</li>
            <li> I do not see any reductions with my blackheads. I used this product alone and with a microdermabrasion brush and it did nothing for me.</li>
