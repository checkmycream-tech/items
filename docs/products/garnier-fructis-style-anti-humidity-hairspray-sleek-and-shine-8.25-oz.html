            <li>Helps to hold hair in place nicely.</li>
            <li>Would be nice</li>
            <li>It has a nice odor about it that lingers just a while.</li>
            <li>Nice hold, not crunchy and smell is tolerable</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, clean scent!</li>
            <li>is a great lightweight hair spray for controlling frizz and for VERY light hold, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with strong hold, look for something else.</li>
            <li>THIS MADE MY HAIR SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>What i like about this hairspray is that it works for my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Has a very fine mist and looks as if you have not used hair spray.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice light spray that does its job with my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Would buy more</li>
            <li>Works ok for me.</li>
            <li>Hold is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray me and my daughter share it</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Price is better than Walmart - ( my Walmart)</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know the &#x27;real&#x27; words&#x27;), and when the can functions, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair overly shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product  in hopes it would have more holding power</li>
            <li>This is a must have if you live in humid areas (even if you don&#x27;t this is a great product).</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling still soft, but it has great hold.</li>
            <li>Nothing but good things to say about the whole Garnier Line.</li>
            <li>The product is labeled &#x27;Ultra Strong&#x27; (4 on a scale of 5) but is probably closer to a 2.5.</li>
            <li>FINE CRAPPY HAIR.</li>
            <li>I like light spray that doesn&#x27;t build up and that doesn&#x27;t allow frizz to get out of control</li>
            <li>It keeps it tidy even on very windy days.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice shine to my hair, but using to much makes your a hair a bit crunchy.</li>
            <li>I use it lightly, and it holds well</li>
            <li>Great hold... doesnt get gross like some hair spray.</li>
            <li>Light spray that holds my hair even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>Odor light and unoffensive (to me).</li>
            <li>It is great for styling as well, just spray a little on my hands and it makes my hair more workable around my face.</li>
            <li>Holds in place good enough.</li>
            <li>Claim to be &amp;#34;bounce-back-hold is true.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, it works really well and lives up to the description/ reputation, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap but we feel that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t smell nearly as good so back to this stuff.</li>
            <li>This just smells like gloriously fresh, clean hair.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is definitely one of my, if not my most, favorite.  </li>
            <li>brushes out easily but some slight residue might be seen but not bad at all its a good hold i use for the front &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; style for an up-do</li>
            <li>It keeps fly aways down and lets my hair move, and not feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>I had &#x27;borrowed&#x27; a spray or two from a friend enough to buy my own and it is now my &#x27;go to&#x27; hairspray.</li>
            <li>This is not a firm hold spray - more of the &#x27;touchable hold&#x27; variety.</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT and it holds well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff.</li>
            <li>In other words, great for my fine hair with a simple style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a very good product and it came earlier than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight feel on my hair and the smell isn&#x27;t very much at all.  </li>
            <li>Use yellow (strong) as it leaves a more natural look</li>
            <li>if same formulation but more flexible</li>
            <li>We have been pleased with this product and use it regularly.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here on Amazon because my local store, for whatever reason no longer carries it ;(</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hold, but that&#x27;s ok for me since I was looking for something mainly to control the frizz my hair suddenly seemed to develop.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really only use it to keep fly aways down, I have not tried it for styling.</li>
            <li>large can for an absolute rock bottom add on price and it holds in a wind storm.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive and works as well as some of the high end brands.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it won&#x27;t hold my hair in place for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really keep my baby hairs in place and needs to be reapplied if you&#x27;re going from day to night.</li>
            <li>Also, the pricing here is very competitive.</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>My husband says I use too much of this</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have that much hold</li>
            <li>Holds without looking sprayed and has a very slight nice smell</li>
            <li>Came clogged but no biggie really I just soaked tip in hot water and fixed it!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it holds ALL day long, literally ALL day.</li>
            <li>Okay, not very technical, but it seemed to be stopped up and it wasn&#x27;t on the external parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have curly 3A hair and live in a high humidity state.  </li>
            <li>I live in Jamaica</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll try it again in 6-12 months after not finding a decent replacement (whatever I find is sure to weigh my hair down or not hold it well enough...</li>
            <li>When my hair drys it is soft and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>This spray did nothing for my natural hair as well as my weave.</li>
            <li>Of course, do not over do it with the spray, so that it keeps the hair natural looking.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hairspray that would hold my very fine, thin, color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most hairsprays, this one doesnt leave your hair feeling crunchy, hard, or stiff no matter how much you spray!</li>
            <li>I use for my short curly hair and my daughter uses for her long straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far my everyday hairspray that never fails or makes my hair feel tacky.  </li>
            <li>It works well for our girl with baby fine hair as well as the one with thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I hate the stiff, board like feeling most leave in my hair, not to mention most smell TERRIBLE, but this one smells oddly pleasant and leaves my hair really soft, smooth and shiny.</li>

            <li> It helps with the frizz and keeps my curls locked in all day long.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve been using for a long time now</li>
            <li> After spending the time to wash, dry, and straighten my hair, I sprayed this on to hopefully hold the style.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m trying for a straight look with a little control to keep the sides off my face</li>
            <li> Creates a very dry frizzt look.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of hairspray, but</li>
            <li> might as well i didn&#x27;t buy it because it did nothing my curls still fall within a hour, it slightly dries out my hair and leaves it looking a bit dry.</li>
            <li> As expected with less cost</li>
            <li> but when I tried to clean it the nozzle came off and was impossible to fix.  </li>
            <li> Also, it keeps the frizz down as one would hope with an &#x27;anti-humidity&#x27; spray.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has a ton of hold, but has a slight touchable hold-</li>
            <li> This hair spray holds my hair without weighing it down!</li>
            <li> I got a hug from a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few months</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray - not too firm.</li>
            <li> you will find a heavy hairfall</li>
            <li> The hold lasts a few hours for curls</li>
            <li> used for years but wish it was not so stiff.  </li>
            <li> I think it would work to tame split ends or frizzies, but not for keeping hair in place.</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray, I really do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> I hate hairspray that smells like hairspray.  </li>
            <li> well, time to buy something else, which I hate to do because I like the spray.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Holds without looking sprayed and has a very slight nice smell</li>
            <li> This is by far my everyday hairspray that never fails or makes my hair feel tacky.  It is great for styling as well, just spray a little on my hands and it makes my hair more workable around my face.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it worked great so I bought this and it&#x27;s amazing! Would buy more</li>
            <li> This hair spray holds my hair without weighing it down! It also has a pleasant, clean scent!</li>
            <li> After spending the time to wash, dry, and straighten my hair, I sprayed this on to hopefully hold the style. It turned noticeably crunchy. As I went through the day, it turned a whitish color like dandruff flakes. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Came clogged but no biggie really I just soaked tip in hot water and fixed it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and have been loving it! No residue build up what-so-ever. It helps with the frizz and keeps my curls locked in all day long. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> This spray did nothing for my natural hair as well as my weave. I live in Jamaica and i bought this from my beauty supply store. I wanted the tresemme holding spray but they didn&#x27;t have any and i wanted something to hold my curls. might as well i didn&#x27;t buy it because it did nothing my curls still fall within a hour, it slightly dries out my hair and leaves it looking a bit dry. i would not recommend this hair spray.my hair is permed or creme</li>
            <li> A good flexible hold spray that smells really good! brushes out easily but some slight residue might be seen but not bad at all its a good hold i use for the front &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; style for an up-do</li>
            <li> Works well and has a good scent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hairspray that would hold my very fine, thin, color-treated hair.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  It does make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it won&#x27;t hold my hair in place for more than a few minutes.  I found I was spraying and respraying in hopes that it would keep my bangs out of my face, however for me there was no holding power.  I think it would work to tame split ends or frizzies, but not for keeping hair in place.</li>
            <li> Works ok for me. I like the smell. Hold is just ok. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too crunchy, so I like that.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Shine and good hold, delicious scent and beautiful packaging.  I&#x27;m hooked for life with Garnier Fructis Style Sllek &amp; Shine.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray me and my daughter share it and we&#x27;ve been using for a long time now</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, gives lots of volume, helps with humidity!</li>
            <li> smells nice. large can for an absolute rock bottom add on price and it holds in a wind storm. Nothing but good things to say about the whole Garnier Line.</li>
            <li> I had &#x27;borrowed&#x27; a spray or two from a friend enough to buy my own and it is now my &#x27;go to&#x27; hairspray. I like light spray that doesn&#x27;t build up and that doesn&#x27;t allow frizz to get out of control (hair type 2b/c). I also like to feel I can touch my hair without ruining the curl. This spray comes through on all counts. This is not a firm hold spray - more of the &#x27;touchable hold&#x27; variety. Only thing to make it a 5 is offer it in a pump instead of a spray.</li>
            <li> Does the job as it says, doesn&#x27;t feel like glue</li>
            <li> This hairspray is definitely one of my, if not my most, favorite.  It smells GREAT and it holds well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff. It even gives my hair a nice shine.  The price is excellent, too, so you really can&#x27;t beat it all the way around.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray my curly hair likes.  It&#x27;s a lightweight feel on my hair and the smell isn&#x27;t very much at all.  Scents give me a headache and this does not.  I will not use anything else.  I have curly 3A hair and live in a high humidity state.  I put this on my hair after using Garnier anti frizz serum which is also lightweight.  When my hair drys it is soft and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you live in humid areas (even if you don&#x27;t this is a great product). It is not expensive and works as well as some of the high end brands. This is my go to spray!</li>
            <li> What i like about this hairspray is that it works for my very fine hair. It keeps it tidy even on very windy days. It also gives it a nice shine. Of course, do not over do it with the spray, so that it keeps the hair natural looking.</li>
            <li> This hairspray does the job for me. It keeps fly aways down and lets my hair move, and not feel crunchy. I really only use it to keep fly aways down, I have not tried it for styling.</li>
            <li> Great for me. FINE CRAPPY HAIR. Holds in place good enough. Price great.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  Holds great.  Helps with humidity.  Love this.  I hate hairspray that smells like hairspray.  This just smells like gloriously fresh, clean hair.  I got a hug from a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few months and she said, &amp;#34;You smell nice!  What are you wearing?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Uhhhh....hair spray!!!&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t even have on cologne.  LOL</li>
            <li> Adds a nice shine to my hair, but using to much makes your a hair a bit crunchy. And don&#x27;t hold the can close to your head. That will help also.</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of hairspray, but I love this one.</li>
            <li> Helps to hold hair in place nicely.</li>
            <li> Holds hair in place without stiffness. Smell is not overpowering. Claim to be &amp;#34;bounce-back-hold is true. I use for my short curly hair and my daughter uses for her long straight hair. She like her hair off her face. Purchase from Amazon for a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because it was a low price and offered shine w/ hold. It doesn&#x27;t really keep my baby hairs in place and needs to be reapplied if you&#x27;re going from day to night. The product is labeled &#x27;Ultra Strong&#x27; (4 on a scale of 5) but is probably closer to a 2.5.</li>
            <li> I used to use a more expensive spray (shaper by sebastian) before I found this gem. It is inexensive, lightweight, not sticky and provides flexible control. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this hair spray - not too firm.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair - does not stick. Price is better than Walmart - ( my Walmart)</li>
            <li> Creates a very dry frizzt look. Use yellow (strong) as it leaves a more natural look</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, &amp; smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, it works really well and lives up to the description/ reputation, I recommend this product. Also, the pricing here is very competitive.</li>
            <li> THIS MADE MY HAIR SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO BETTER FLAVOR YOUR FOLLICLES!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying the product isn&#x27;t good. I will say that i have used almost any hair product you can name, and this did not meet my standard. It does not do what it says, and once you spray, it&#x27;s as if you never did because it does nothing.</li>
            <li> used for years but wish it was not so stiff.  Would be nice if same formulation but more flexible</li>
            <li> Like it. I use it lightly, and it holds well</li>
            <li> This is the hair spray that my girls insisted on having. We tried it and I really like it a lot. Garnier Fructis holds quite well and keeps the frizzies away when we use it. It works well for our girl with baby fine hair as well as the one with thick, coarse hair. It has a nice odor about it that lingers just a while. We have been pleased with this product and use it regularly. It isn&#x27;t cheap but we feel that it is worth the price. As someone once said, &amp;#34;It costs to be beautiful&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she was very satisfied with it. I would recommend that others buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light spray that does its job with my very fine hair.  Usually I&#x27;m trying for a straight look with a little control to keep the sides off my face (I don&#x27;t know the &#x27;real&#x27; words&#x27;), and when the can functions, it does a great job.  Also, it keeps the frizz down as one would hope with an &#x27;anti-humidity&#x27; spray.  In other words, great for my fine hair with a simple style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, twice now I have had issues (the last two out of 4 cans) with the canister itself.  Basically, it was acting like a clog but when I tried to clean it the nozzle came off and was impossible to fix.  I have no idea if it really was a clog--and if it was, that was ridiculous to have happen with the inner workings.  Okay, not very technical, but it seemed to be stopped up and it wasn&#x27;t on the external parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, time to buy something else, which I hate to do because I like the spray.  I imagine I&#x27;ll try it again in 6-12 months after not finding a decent replacement (whatever I find is sure to weigh my hair down or not hold it well enough...such a pessimist I am today).  Hopefully the production issue with the cans will be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> Great price. Does the job!</li>
            <li> you will find a heavy hairfall</li>
            <li> Nice hold, not crunchy and smell is tolerable</li>
            <li> Great, for the price!</li>
            <li> This spray is great! The hold lasts a few hours for curls but there&#x27;s no frizz in humidty. Love it! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray, I really do. I hate the stiff, board like feeling most leave in my hair, not to mention most smell TERRIBLE, but this one smells oddly pleasant and leaves my hair really soft, smooth and shiny. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hold, but that&#x27;s ok for me since I was looking for something mainly to control the frizz my hair suddenly seemed to develop.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great lightweight hair spray for controlling frizz and for VERY light hold, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with strong hold, look for something else.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, and it smells good!  I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair overly shiny.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses this daily and loves it.</li>
            <li> Use and see shiney hair</li>
            <li> My husband says I use too much of this but I just cant help myself! It smells fantastic and it holds ALL day long, literally ALL day. I have tried others that work as well but they don&#x27;t smell nearly as good so back to this stuff. So glad I found it here on Amazon because my local store, for whatever reason no longer carries it ;(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has a ton of hold, but has a slight touchable hold- and it smells good.  I think it helps with frizz/humidity but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product  in hopes it would have more holding power and I must say I didn&#x27;t think it was that great.  It didn&#x27;t have that much hold and I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> As expected with less cost</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  This is the only spray that tames my frizzy hair in Miami weather</li>
            <li> Great product. Not sticky at all</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray! Unlike most hairsprays, this one doesnt leave your hair feeling crunchy, hard, or stiff no matter how much you spray! It leaves hair feeling still soft, but it has great hold. I use this when I curl my hair. It holds curls great, even waves! Love it!</li>
            <li> It was a very good product and it came earlier than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Great hold... doesnt get gross like some hair spray. no flaky stuff</li>
            <li> Light spray that holds my hair even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> Has a very fine mist and looks as if you have not used hair spray.  I want my hair to stay in place but not look unnatural.  This hairspray does this.  Odor light and unoffensive (to me).</li>
