            <li>I was pleased with the quality of these tools.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t overuse or abuse your skin, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with these tools.  </li>
            <li>Also, these work much better after you&#x27;ve showered or washed/</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to others and will look for more products by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work more times</li>
            <li>It really does a great job extracting.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to use the kit as it suggested you could use it.</li>
            <li>, I recommend that you watch a doc use them properly not only to get the best results but also to use them correctly so as not to damage your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a teenaged child, buy them, and it&#x27;ll be a gift that gives them better self-esteem, healthier skin and fewer or no acne scarring.</li>
            <li>This is much more recommended than using your hands.</li>
            <li>glad i ordered  it.  </li>
            <li>I feel much more refreshed using these tools</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.</li>
            <li>I love the case and how slim it is for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I really love this kit.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a great gift, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you want to make sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen someone mention rust, so I&#x27;ll be sure to look out for that.</li>
            <li>but I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend because its efficient.</li>
            <li>however I can&#x27;t stand having bumps and lumps in my face since people love to make comments about my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works okay, but you have to apply quite of bit of pressure to make it work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; with the different tools on my skin to figure out which one is best.  </li>
            <li>However they are great tools, it is a great package and their customer service is fantastic - just wish it had a very basic - i.e. one page - list of instructions.</li>
            <li>Love this Blackhead and Blemish Remover kit.  </li>
            <li>: I would make sure you wash you</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a zipper case to hold all the tools.  </li>
            <li>is an instruction manual for the many tools.</li>
            <li>keep checking for more</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>All opinions and experiences are genuine and completely my own.</li>
            <li>I think I need a better explanation of how to use them.</li>
            <li>Hurt the face more than help</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I have tried to many products to get rid of the blackheads on my nose, and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Both arrived in perfect condition and next day.</li>
            <li>Using this makes you feel more relieved after getting everything out.</li>
            <li>Using this is so much better than your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was actually able to extract it using one of the tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with his kit, i used one time because i saw a whitehead in my forehead</li>
            <li>and i used it&#x27;s was like a magic</li>
            <li>I had an extractor stick when I lived in Japan and haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the states quite like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great and also the express was fast.</li>
            <li>Hi, this product was purchased for my wife and she is quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It makes way more sense, and no risk of scarring.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure once I learn how to correctly use each instrument</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll like the kit even more...</li>
            <li>This kit has everything to remove those unwanted skin imperfections and much more sanitary to extract clogged pores than using your fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>This works like magic.</li>
            <li>,  top notch customer service.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>You will be glad  you got it.</li>

            <li>Excellent product; this kit provides a variety of tools for various depths and areas of your face and of course for differing types of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>As described:).</li>
            <li>Many time tried to remove the blackhead</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>much better thans scratching the skin with fingernails</li>
            <li>Nothing better then that 👌</li>
            <li>Just make sure you sterilize the tools and wash and use an astringent after extracting</li>
            <li>Great items work very well</li>
            <li>But overall, the tools are excellent!</li>
            <li>Even the most stubborn blackheads made their way out.</li>
            <li>I love the carrying case and the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are everything you need for blackheads and blemishes. :)</li>
            <li>The tools work OK except for a big flaw, they&#x27;re not polished perfectly and have scratched my face on many occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I have a ready-to-pop zit, the product is ok.  </li>
            <li>ot is more like having 10 as each ends</li>
            <li>There are lot of tools to choose from so if one doesn&#x27;t get it, another is sure to.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, with all tools secure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. .</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted!! :)</li>
            <li>The tool case also smells like a mixture of moth balls and pot, which isn&#x27;t exactly appealing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell for sure.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.. Works as advertised, Will make a great gift with substance and a definite high use item.</li>

            <li>Nice variety of tools to work with to help get pores clean.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good for the most part.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but I wish the tools had more variety.</li>
            <li>Great product, and very professional!</li>
            <li>high quality and great packaging, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean them after you use them!</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a special promotion to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and extremely satisfying  :-)</li>
            <li>thats okay because I have very sensitive skin anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product</li>
            <li>If you know what you&#x27;re doing and if you know how to use these tools, they work pretty good.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for., costumer service was really good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, came with all pieces.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I sterilized the tools and cleaned my husband and my pre-teens pores!</li>
            <li>good product, it really works!</li>
            <li>Pretty good extractor set for the price.</li>
            <li>These work pretty damn good</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good it pulls everything out</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good set of tools.  </li>
            <li>the one end still had a burr on it from the machining and cut me pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I think if you know how to use them, these are very good, although I do wish there was one more instrument that was smaller in size.</li>
            <li>Product came as described and was delivered ahead of the original scheduled time!</li>
            <li>And the case make it easy to travel without misplacing it : )</li>

            <li>nice product and easy to clean and sanitize.  </li>
            <li>Is working great so far!</li>
            <li>Now my pores can be completely clean!</li>
            <li>I looked at other kits and this one gives you most variety for the best price.</li>
            <li>Good with certain pimples.</li>
            <li>This product contains a good set of tools to extract or remove certain blemishes.</li>
            <li>Really nice and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>I get blackheads more than I would like to admit and with this kit I no longer have to worry about it because these tools get them out very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but there are some non smooth parts where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>Equinox is great at following up making sure you are satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great to clear your pores.</li>
            <li>But it was relatively cheap and quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>They sent me two emails checking to see if I was happy with the product complete with PDF manuals on how to use the product.</li>
            <li>Very effective--nice case and tools are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Good to have, very helpful</li>
            <li>good quality, these set really works</li>
            <li>The instruments are of superior stainless steel quality.</li>
            <li>The package is beautiful and useful and Amazon send it very</li>
            <li>fast shipping, good quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and store!  </li>
            <li>The are the best with checking in on you and your new product thanks to all.</li>
            <li>Excellent priced at more or less, $15.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, professional results</li>
            <li>Just got this the other day and let me just say this set is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best deal on blemish and blackhead removing tools on Amazon due to the fact that it&#x27;s a 10 in one package instead of having to buy them all separately.  </li>
            <li>They sent several follow up e-mails to make sure that I was happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Since I got this, I&#x27;ve been able to clean my skin without hurting myself and the case keeps it together.</li>
            <li>It is everything it was said that it is and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it really easy to use!she</li>
            <li>Easy to sterilize.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as easy as it looks</li>
            <li>in a safe and clean way.</li>
            <li>Great kit for those who like to do it themselves or feel better doing it at home in private.</li>
            <li>It easily eliminates zits/pimples, helps remove or fix ingrown hairs, and clears obstructions in the pores of your nose.</li>
            <li>However, it won&#x27;t be nearly as easy to do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but practice and patience made it easy to learn to use.  </li>
            <li>Removes blemishes easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quality tools.</li>
            <li>Easy to grab and hold.</li>
            <li>I do however like the kit and how easy it is to use and then put away.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The tools do their job and they&#x27;re easy to sanitize.</li>
            <li>Strong steel ends.</li>
            <li>This looked like a great replacement and it had many more implements than the single extractor I purchased from Walmart.  </li>
            <li>High quality and fair price.</li>
            <li>but something more detailed included with the product would have been great, as would an explaination of the specific uses for each tool.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the purchase and the customer service is very helpful too.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing a kit of this kind.</li>
            <li>I like the box I am able to put some needles and tweezers in it and have a full kit of /r/popping</li>
            <li>I saw a bunch of cool YouTube videos on extracting blackheads and bumps, but I think using my two fingers is better than this.  </li>
            <li>Best to use with a facial steamer or after a hot shower and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I think the tool quality is just fine</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>The ones that were received were fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with instruction but after a couple of uses, you can figure out what works best and how to make it hurt less.</li>
            <li>It has been great so far, easy to use and the order came in quickly.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t been able to successfully use these for blackheads or smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sterilized the tools and they work fine, but I will not be using this company again.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to look online and figure out what some of the toools do.</li>
            <li>More fun than a barrel full of monkeys!</li>
            <li>used the long one right out of the box and OUCH!!!!!</li>
            <li>I feel that the loops on the tools are too large to be effective compared to the examples I found on google.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I decided to go for another one that was a little tougher to pop.  </li>
            <li>These little tools work great!</li>
            <li>Definitely not as painful as popping things with your fingers and more clean.</li>
            <li>I do feel these are worth 5 stars since they&#x27;re sharp, light, easy to use, and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Works amazing at getting all the blackheads I couldn&#x27;t extremely effective definitely reccommend</li>
            <li>surgical instruments look cheap along with the case and it as no instructions on how to use the instruments.</li>
            <li>Great tool set gives options for variety of blemishes the guide the vendor sends prior to receiving your set</li>
            <li>is helpful overall great buy for the price</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be for blackheads and such, but there is one tool in it that works great as an ear spoon for cleaning wax from ear canal.</li>
            <li>but my primary problem is Milia.</li>
            <li>TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li>Great with facial steamers.</li>
            <li>and once I got it it pass the eye test meaning it didn&#x27;t look cheap and its holding up</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and all the tools work well.</li>
            <li>The company even sent me an email to let me know that I can contact them if I am having trouble learning how to use them which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean the tools just a lil rubbing alcohol..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and includes a nice case.</li>
            <li>Tools are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I received this for free for review.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me free for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>Im happy with the arrival time but was dissapointed to only find 4 instead of 5 tools ...</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great kit that I have been using every chance it is required.</li>
            <li>wash your face with an oil free cleanser before and after using these tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used properly this is a great product.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks great the next day.</li>
            <li>Customer service was fantastic in proactively contacting me regarding any issues I may have with the product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>These tools are made of a durable metal and are easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic and sterile job of cleaning up the skin.</li>
            <li>did not bend like the cheap others I have purchaced</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great tool set.  </li>
            <li>One improvement though, the pieces could have been labeled as there were five different pieces but great product..</li>
            <li>Also the holder is very sleek and stores each item in its own slot.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If I knew tools like this were available for purchase by non-medical professionals...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and affective.</li>
            <li>Some of the metal isn&#x27;t smooth and cuts.</li>
            <li>Great &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; you can have a facial at home without the expense.</li>
            <li>- Fantastic for removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>Would not recommended this purchase cheap looking and the case is wrinkled and looks homemade</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any bruising with using the tools and I was able to clear my clogged pores effectively.</li>
            <li>this tool to work very well.it is best to use it after a shower or after facial washing.</li>
            <li>My 32 yr old son loved it.</li>
            <li>far as the product goes, two fingers are more effective than the tools in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus far I am struggling to use the tools effectively, but I suspect this could have more to do with my ignorance than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>This set is comprised of what appear to be superior, professional medical-quality instruments.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Love all the different sizes and types but not as good of quality as I had hoped….</li>
            <li>It is a superior alternative to the pinch and pray technique that many of us are used to, provided you (even occasionally, provided it is lightly used) clean, sterilize, and maintain the tools.</li>
            <li>Since then the company very quickly reached out to me and ensured that I got the full set.</li>
            <li>Every thing is high quality very durable, im very satisfied!</li>
            <li>This is a very useful tool for removing blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>have had blackhead extractors before which sort of work, but the variety in sizes offered here  is very handy, since one can try different instruments until the desired extraction occurs.</li>
            <li>They are very useful.</li>
            <li>Very useful tools to help remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful in unclogging pores.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful, high quality kit, and has five different tools that cover any blackhead needs.</li>
            <li>but I thought using precise tools would allow me to clean out pimples so they can begin the healing process sooner.</li>
            <li>These 5 tools are all you really need, my first impressions are really good as the tools appear to be quite durable and well made.</li>
            <li>This was quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They remove the blackheads quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert but these tools &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; surgical steel, very strong as they don&#x27;t bend at all no matter how much pressure you put on them when using them.</li>
            <li>no complaints at all with the tools, just the case could be a little better but its all good :)</li>
            <li>Highly effective, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It works better if you steam your face first.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you steam the area your using it on first.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming impressed</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this kit</li>
            <li>However, this has not occurred to me more than once or twice and the first time I noticed it was when I originally opened it after it was shipped to me.</li>
            <li>:) seems to be workin pretty well.</li>
            <li>Great product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch some youtube videos first before attempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the manufactures for providing me with a discounted review unit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>This is exactly as it is described, maybe better.  </li>
            <li>There are many different tools and one will be the most appropriate for the task.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, before using any of these tools, make sure you sterilize them so that it doesn&#x27;t get the area you wish to pick at infected.</li>
            <li>Came very fast, has a nice carry case,does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Very good solid quality instruments that work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this kit -- I love the nice zip up holder and the wide variety of tool sizes and shapes!  </li>
            <li>Since I do use these tools on my face, I like that I can clean it after use and store it away in this case instead of having to buy something else to store it in.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would protect the tools and keep them clean until I need to use them.</li>
            <li>on my face before a light moisturizer (CeraVe) and wow, the results were absolutely amazing.    </li>
            <li>I got it for my teenage son and he has been using it every day with great success.  </li>
            <li>Always recommend that they clean the instruments with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li>The tools come in a synthetic leather pouch that has a zipper on it to keep all your tools in place and clean.</li>
            <li>but I wish they gave some instruction on what each tool is for and how to clean them with the kit.</li>
            <li>Strips / cleansers should be used first, along with the application or pore-opening warm / hot water.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, complete and in excellent condition, definitely has met my expectations</li>
            <li>Nice product for all the pimple obsessed like myself :D</li>
            <li>Even though I only know how to use a couple of the tools, they are the most effective ones for me.</li>
            <li>all in one place and keep them clean.</li>
            <li>They look clean and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth as it contains strong, sturdy, and well made tools with diverse properties.</li>
            <li>The built-in cloth that is in the case makes it very easy and handy to dry tools after sterilization.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking to safely and easily remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>Its soo good, handy, remove black and whiteheads without any pain!</li>
            <li>Really happy with this product, was able to use it easily no matter where I was.</li>
            <li>This kit allows the swelling to be safely and easily removed / reduced without pinching which would normally irritate the skin and still hurt for a while after.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I cannot say enough good things about this kit, I absolutely love it and it has completely changed the way I take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>These stainless steel tools insure great control and can be easily kept clean and germ-free - a key requirement to avoid infections, etc.</li>
            <li>Most of my reviews are very high (4-5 stars) when I purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Not really, but it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be razor like, but nonetheless they work great.</li>
            <li>Some on the holes are off center, and none of them work great.  </li>
            <li>I got this whole kit for about 30% more than I would have paid for just one tool at drug store.  </li>
            <li>, we haven&#x27;t been able to really get them to remove blackheads like they do in the videos.</li>
            <li>These stuffs Look good to me, but I am still practicing working with them to remove my white heads.</li>
            <li>Informative emails accompany the product order with full instructions.</li>
            <li>Seller also offers 100% guarantee which is nice.</li>
            <li>For medical education- NSFE&amp;#34; is good.</li>
            <li>FULL VERSION:  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it is way better than mashing blackheads with your fingers</li>
            <li>: I think this is a really good kit that will work well once I figure out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Now you have five tools all for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Total works and good quality</li>
            <li>It works sooo good and after ther isnt any red marks works like a charm!!!!!</li>
            <li>so much :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to be gentle with your skin :)  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it full stars.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use than fingers for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product it helped out so much with my blackhead problem on my face.</li>
            <li>The tools look so cool.</li>
            <li>Multiple tools and a carrying case made for a good deal here.  </li>
            <li>A great kit , does what it supposed to , as long as you do it the right way.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Would appreciate it more if it&#x27;s soft genuine leather.</li>
            <li>Without injuring surrounding skin by squeezing, these tools target pressure around the clogged pore and allow for quick removal and extraction of blemish-causing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product comes with so many tools, however it needs to come with instructions on what tool to use for what specific problem.</li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>These tools are great for gently helping to get rid of the bacteria, and don&#x27;t make the area as red as if you use your fingers.</li>
            <li>The package came quickly though, I like the quality of the product and I&#x27;ve never used it before now</li>
            <li>and it would make the difference between a 3 and 5 star review if they just included a quick guide.</li>
            <li>They appear to be made well, and I was one of the lucky ones that received all the tools at one time.  </li>
            <li>Just like the picture and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li>After getting acquainted with the different tools I actually enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>Super cooll</li>
            <li>Works very well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I will follow up on YouTube to try to figure out how to best utilize all of the different options, but overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;ve found these tools, and they are</li>
            <li>I bought them for my grandson who has mild acne.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this company over others because they have excellent customer service and came with five different sizes, when others only come  with one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made from high quality material and surely won&#x27;t scratch your face or leave an unwanted mark.</li>
            <li>Product came on time and as expected and works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>They are so much more durable and effective than anything I have found in a drug store or other retail outlet.  </li>
            <li>Upon receiving and opening this product the very first thing I felt was overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Prevents swelling and irritation, super easy to use and much easier than with nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality and easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Very useful and a very well made product!</li>
            <li>A printed paper that showed easy or recommended ways to sterilize the tools would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>Tools are effective, durable and high quality but make sure you follow the directions to use them properly.</li>
            <li>Despite all of the positive feelings and utility of this kit, I do not feel that it should be used as a primary tool when taking care of or cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They look like they will last for many years!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>At first it kinda resembles a dental tray!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>pouch is really useful for storage as it is very compact and easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This has really helped tremendously!</li>
            <li>face first, then use the tool, clean it after use.</li>
            <li>received fast, great Kit-has all you ned for clear skin care, works well so far!</li>
            <li>Great little kit.  </li>
            <li>The case is a little flimsy but the quality of the instruments is great.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great tool that would apply an even amount of pressure with little exertion from me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little kit for removing whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Great quality, but seems like if you have blackheads on your nose you need a little bit of fat or else it hurts and doesn&#x27;t get anything.</li>
            <li>Many products for little price, nice storage case.</li>
            <li>It is in a nice black leather case and all the instruments are VERY nice and solid!!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>Quality is great and even feel heavy.</li>
            <li>Different sizes and amazing quality</li>
            <li>It got here extremely fast and the seller is very concerned that buyers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Definable worth the money.</li>
            <li>and the case is nice enough too.</li>
            <li>They pretty much took off the top layer of my chin the first time I used them so after that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>glad to be using professional tools and no longer my fingers.</li>
            <li>Although it is nice to use the tools for my entire nose and chin areas.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 3 stars is because to the novice (like myself) it would nice to have a chart that explains why each end looks the way it does and how to use it.</li>
            <li>So I felt the need to order tools to help clear my pores better.  </li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the quality of these tools.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the tools on the more minimal blackheads or achne, but instead the more severe cases.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a nice facial care kit.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>not medical grade stuff but really nice for the price</li>
            <li>useful as need.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend anyone interested in buying this product read the full thing.  </li>
            <li>It offers more options than I though it would.  </li>
            <li>As good as expected.</li>
            <li>so I can use it again because I am just absolutely thrilled that I finally found something that works, but nothing yet..</li>
            <li>He is always in dirt and his pores get clogged so it was nice to have different tools to help him remove the dirt from the pours.</li>
            <li>I also received the product on time and it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I hear they&#x27;re are plenty of useful videos on YouTube...</li>
            <li>I found three out of the five tools useful, hence the 3/5 stars.</li>
            <li>Not as good as what was used during my last facial but its OK.</li>
            <li>Quality of the equipment is easily worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>comes in a nice case with several tools.</li>
            <li>handles on all of the pieces are textured which prevents your fingers from slipping off and gives you really good hand control and therefore help with precision removal.</li>
            <li>They feel sturdy and the case is a pretty cool way to keep them all together.  </li>
            <li>I am not a dermatologist, but I have found this product incredibly useful in removing blackheads from around my nose and clearing my skin of pimples.</li>
            <li>The materials are high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very nice little kit.</li>
            <li>I personally have had some of the best results after using a clay mask that helps pull the gunk out of my pores, then I can get any other stuff that&#x27;s still a bit stuck with these tools.  </li>
            <li>I like to use these tools after Aztec Clay Mask or Cellbone Skin Prep (both available on Amazon) to get my pores so clean they&#x27;re nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>one of them broke after a couple of weeks of use but the others worked fine and look like high quality products.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see the professional branded case that zipped to secure the tools.</li>
            <li>All the tools are very workable and useful!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend not to mention the nice soft vinyl pouch.</li>
            <li>This is what I have learned, but it may not be right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right about the size of a sun glass case.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just am not using it right.</li>
            <li>so I may not even be using it right.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>right  away</li>
            <li>There is a diverse set of tools: You&#x27;ll always have the right size and shape to get any pimple/whitehead out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were shipped and arrived right away.</li>
            <li>but it makes a difference if you use the right one.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality of the equipment, I would absolutely recommend Equinox International.</li>
            <li>It really does help squeezing out blackheads, but remember to clean it with rubbing alcohol before using it.</li>
            <li>Seller is very eager to make certain that the buyer is satisfied and that the product is satisfactory which it certainly is.</li>
            <li>They are high quality, and don&#x27;t feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part is that there aren&#x27;t any instructions for what each end of each tool is recommended for doing, so you kind of have to experiment with the different ones until you find the one that effectively removes the blackhead without having to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will come in handy for the occasional stubborn blackhead, but I won&#x27;t make regular use of it.</li>
            <li>Comes with a great little case for all the tools that makes them very discreet to others.  </li>
            <li>The item came packaged carefully and I was able to immediately use my blemish remover tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: would have loved a small guide or instructions, identifying the tools to be able to distinguish them from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tools are a good size for me and the lancet is very sharp.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and easily damaged.</li>
            <li>but now it is fully closed, clear, and looking great.  </li>
            <li>However, I wish they gave some basic instructions with the kit: including proper cleaning/sterilization and each tools suited purpose, but all pieces were in the kit and work great together.</li>
            <li>Some of the tools require careful use, others are precise and work well with more pressure.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery- terrific extractors and nice case.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a better option than using her fingers, and more sanitary as long as you clean them properly and use alcohol after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>All blackheads are not created equal and as such its great that this kit has different size tools for removal, more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I am also a bit worried about the fact that your tools might rust very fast</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Methods for proper sterilization (which is VERY important) are not given and must be found online or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Both like their kits very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It was actually kind of hard to stop using it because I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Fine product, delivered early</li>
            <li>Fair warning, I am reviewing this in a manner that will mention (in general, not graphically or detailed) &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; or removed/reduced zits and other issues.</li>
            <li>With this little money it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>All was as expected - these things work amazingly</li>
            <li>The instructions on how to care for the instruments were clear and accurate, as they fall in line with NYS guidelines.</li>
            <li>this works very well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It appears to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I had been looking for, for some time.  </li>
            <li>so popping pimples are something I&#x27;ve been doing my whole life!</li>
            <li>These tools made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Be sure to poke a tiny hole in the blemish before you scrape it out.</li>
            <li>- The Equinox Blemish Remover Kit is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I even received an email from the manufacturer prior to receiving the kit that specifically told me to make sure all five implements were included in the kit.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much came out of it!</li>
            <li>Not for everyone, but if your looking at it in the first place it&#x27;s probably for you.</li>
            <li>She first used this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I threw the case away after first day.</li>
            <li>Still a better value than buying them individual.</li>
            <li>I would give these a higher rating but there are no instructions included.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t dig at your skin the first place</li>
            <li>It helps much better than going to do facial with a hundred dollars!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described, and works like a charm ;)</li>

            <li>We mostly use these on his back.</li>

            <li>I have so many tiny blackheads</li>
            <li>Sharp stabby one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Tried it the first day it arrived.</li>
            <li>first</li>
            <li>For blackheads or clogged pores (the nose, specifically), I have found that this is a great secondary tool.</li>
            <li>Each tools proper or intended use is not given, which can add a small learning curve as to what works best and where.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.isfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life.</li>
            <li>Thanks !&lt;</li>

            <li>This product got here really fast!  </li>
            <li>Many blackheads and pimples might need some extra time to get closer to the surface.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the kit since the first day I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at Sephora many years ago for $19, it was longer, but it was only one tool.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>A couple of pieces are useful, others not so much.</li>

            <li>Thanks Equinox for putting all of these tools in one kit!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Guess they don&#x27;t want to be put away ;)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used this on my boyfriends back and weirdly enjoyed watching this work,</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who has acne or blackhead issues should most definitely get this.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I decided to do was wash my face and grab my magnifying mirror as suggested on the box.</li>
            <li>The tools are heavy and feel like good quality steel.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, good quality tools.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, as described, and is a good heavy metal.</li>
            <li>Each of the tools are heavy duty and most feature a sort of rectangular metal body, which provides extra support so that you can&#x27;t easily bend the tools when using them These tools basically act like your finger, squeezing the junk out of the pour, but much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>More often you end up creating a new pimple by just trying to clear a pore or pimple.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs removed super simple with any mirror available to you.</li>
            <li>but it you really have to, then I would recommend this product right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all stainless steel and with 5 pieces, I&#x27;m sure it will meet all my future needs.</li>
            <li>The company went out of their way and sent us a PDF with basic instructions and that was a nice, unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>sure I was using this properly, which was very considerate imo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care as I leave mine open most of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty smart, but will take this to dermatologist to view,&lt;br /&gt;before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to give into the hype of positive reviews</li>
            <li>Although I got to pop out and get rid of a lot of pimples, my only issue was that it still didn&#x27;t manage to successfully pop every single one and now I have some scars on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tools in this pack are incredible and do a great job getting out all different sorts of blackheads and crap from my skin.</li>
            <li>she said they really work, and are pretty durable.</li>
            <li>The tools are very sturdy and very well made!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased when I got the kit and saw that the instruments were heavy duty and made well.</li>
            <li>The various sized loops and tools are quite useful and effective on my various skin challenges.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you’ve never used these tools before, either get an expert to show you or look up good examples on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m guilty of using my fingers to squeeze out pimples sometimes, especially when I don’t have a good tool at hand.</li>
            <li>They are extremely well made, easy to sanitize and use and my pores are the cleanest they have probably ever been due to a good mirror and these tools.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I am far from a professional at this, but after figuring out how to use the tools, it was actually pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper (and more complete) than many other sets sold at the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>The differently sized loops make extraction easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use tools simple carrying case ...</li>
            <li>Rather than relying on this kit as a primary removal tool, for the nose I would recommend the stick-on Biore nose strips (or a similar brand / tool) being used first.  </li>
            <li>I watched a video on how to use them properly and found that they are easy to use once you know how.</li>
            <li>The little black zipper case is perfect for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packed in a smart looking  zippered&lt;</li>
            <li>However, I would say this is a &#x27;5-Star Pimple and LARGE Blackhead Remover&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I will be certain to recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li>Used it on my nose where I removed a disgustingly large amount of sebum.</li>
            <li>They come with general instructions, so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the tools I&#x27;d recommend a YouTube video or contacting the sellers customer support.</li>
            <li>I was easily able to remove a blackhead that I had for awhile that I couldn&#x27;t get out through &#x27;natural&#x27; means (hot shower, wait for pores to open, squeeze, or the egg whites</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this for everyday use after a hot bath and right after I remove my Aztec clay mask</li>
            <li>The moment I received this Equinox International Blackhead and Blemish kit I got excited and gotten wait to use it on my first &amp;#34;patient&amp;#34; as ai felt like a surgeon.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent set.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent stuff.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t order this one, but it seems like a decent product!</li>
            <li>Very highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li>Very high quality tools.</li>
            <li>The tools seem to be a very high quality construction, but it has done nothing at all for my acne or blackheads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tools are very high quality.</li>
            <li>They come in their own little pouch which has a zipper.</li>
            <li>Nice little case with all promised tools.</li>
            <li>Nice little case.</li>
            <li>great little kit for a thorough facial, took awhile to get here</li>
            <li>You have to press really hard to get good leverage.</li>
            <li>Very high quality steel tools, delivered in a very timely way.  </li>
            <li>(unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a HD camera to upload clear pics, but I did my best).</li>
            <li>My face looks great no red marks after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The edges are smooth and rounded, which helps to not damage the skin as much as I have found in some local implements I purchased.  </li>
            <li>It is not professional grade, but pretty cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>These things really work well.</li>
            <li>I can really do my business with this kit.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks Equinox.</li>
            <li>my whole life</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so much smoother and cleaner using these tools.</li>
            <li>As with any tools you use on your face you should proceed with caution and not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I really like the tools in this kit.  </li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
            <li>Although the kit was very well made it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I really like my kit</li>
            <li>I find that area is much easier to cover up after popping and heals faster .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>it really work</li>
            <li>I will still use it, just not as much as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>Tools are very well made.</li>
            <li>Real metal pieces that are very sturdy.  </li>

            <li>Tia works very well</li>
            <li>it cures pimples blackheads so fast</li>
            <li>The case is very helpful to keep all together.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and it works really well.</li>
            <li>A whole lot of nothing.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and informative.  </li>
            <li>For real tho, buy this kit.</li>
            <li>They really work.  </li>
            <li>But overall this is a fantastic kit.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier for me to remove pimples from my face.</li>
            <li>No one wants blackheads or any type of blemish, but IF you do; this is your help.</li>
            <li>Very like it,thank you)</li>
            <li>I suffer from ingrown hairs post-bikini waxing, so this has absolutely helped in remedying that issue.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t extract well and</li>
            <li>really wish I took before and after photos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister she really likes it</li>
            <li>I use it so much</li>
            <li>The seller has also been very communicative by sending and informational via email after my purchase on how to use the product.</li>
            <li>Great product, does the job, probably didn&#x27;t need to get the whole kit as I only use a few of the tools in it.</li>
            <li>The price is quite affordable and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone who is in the business or just wants to remove blemishes gently without causing damage to the skin.</li>
            <li>This product really was a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>but at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>I tried it out without really looking into how to use it.  </li>
            <li>so once you&#x27;ve taught yourself how to use it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>As for the material it seems to be made of stainless steel type material..</li>
            <li>they are very sturdy and they don&#x27;t feel like they will bend.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I would like to have some detailed instructions specific to the set.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants a comedome extractor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am constantly on the look out for tools to help me with my art and craft/hobby with miniatures and these proved to fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the product really works</li>
            <li>They do make removing blemishs much easier and do not damage the skin.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed on how well this works.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well....</li>
            <li>but this actually really helps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know how to use it very well, but I did get contacted by the company soon after I received it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Top notch-high quality and shipped in time expected.</li>
            <li>Very efficient for an affordable price</li>
            <li>Stainless?</li>
            <li>Really, how the heck are they rusted in the package?</li>
            <li>Even watching a bunch of &#x27;how-to&#x27; videos didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>Was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the inside of the carrying case wasn&#x27;t very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>The kit offers enough tools for both of us, and the included instructions were most helpful.</li>
            <li>I was able to get rid of an old blackhead from my husbands back.</li>
            <li>I would suggest watching a video or two on YouTube of dermatologists using these tools if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t go crazy and overdo it on your face -- there are good techniques for using these tools and you can find some good videos (might be kinda gross) if you are curious.  </li>
            <li>: easy to clean, strong material, pressure from tools bring out blackheads and pimples, nice carrying case, variety of tools, doesn&#x27;t leave bruises (only small red circles for the next 20 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Everything I need in a nice, black case!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it because these things will inevitably come in handy for something else down the road, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a Dr. Yadav worthy comedone tool.</li>
            <li>5-6 inches long, so it is easily stored almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this item thinking it would totally work</li>
            <li>tried many other products and can not praise this one enough,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy a pore cloger just so you don&#x27;t infect other areas.</li>
            <li>Because of the thickness of some of the extractors, more than extreme pressure is needed to even try to get out blackheads.</li>
            <li>I like most of the extractors - but one of the sides extractors had very rough edges and looked unfinished.  </li>
            <li>I recently got a 50x lighted mirror and saw my pores in a whole new light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning though - your face will be puffy, red, and irritated for atleast 24 hours after a thorough clean out with this.  </li>
            <li>It did take me a little while to figure out how to make the tools work effectively, but I suppose that is just the learning curve with any new product.  </li>
            <li>High quality items for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>nothing special, but if this is what holds you back from buying a product, I&#x27;d reconsider.  </li>
            <li>However, i quickly realized I only really needed that 1 tool with the wire loop.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I am very glad I now have it because it will help me with stubborn pimples in the future.</li>
            <li>My husband and I live this product!</li>
            <li>all still looks like new!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and who really love this kit!it help remove black heads without leavin&lt;br /&gt;small pore holes in her skin</li>
            <li>Was able to remove several stubborn blackheads from my back</li>
            <li>- chin and nose areas in particular.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find the edges able to do the necessary work to put enough pressure to remove the comedome.</li>
            <li>This is a useful tool kit; however, most of the tool ends are too thick for precision blackhead removal.  </li>
            <li>It only leaves a mark on my face for a moment, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m left wanting are better instructions.  </li>
            <li>I recommend exfoliating or steaming your pores prior to using these for maximum effectiveness and to avoid potentially damaging your skin by having to apply more pressure.</li>
            <li>The effort needed isn&#x27;t worth it compared to using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;However, works really well for the larger ones!</li>
            <li>main problem?</li>
            <li>There are NO directions with these, aside from a quick rundown on the box, which honestly is not nearly enough.</li>
            <li>particular set by Equinox comes with 5 separate instruments in a durable leather-like zipper case.</li>
            <li>how and when you would use all of the different options, but the one I have been using has worked very well, and is worth the purchase price by itself.</li>
            <li>Many different options in this packet, which applies to various usage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have obscenely large black heads and this just doesn&#x27;t work great on the little ones.</li>
            <li>Really well made and very professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a super high quality luxury set, but it is more than sufficient for me.</li>
            <li>Only used one of the tools so far and learning to use the rest but very useful.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>These tools are high quality metal.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my dd who just finish high school</li>
            <li>The tools are made from high quality materials that won&#x27;t tarnish or break on you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Tools are not as high quality as &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; or the like.  </li>
            <li>High quality kit 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend cleaning any of the strips left-behind adhesive residue with warm/hot water before using this kit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tools to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>High quality instruments they are not.</li>
            <li>Highly discourage this purchase.</li>
            <li>Whiteheads have always been a problem in my life since high school</li>
            <li>Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li>High quality and does what it should.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both the seller and the product.</li>
            <li>The tools themselves are high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>The cute little storage case it comes in is approx.</li>
            <li>Not sure I need all the tools in this kit, but it is perfect for extracting the hard to eliminate white/black heads.</li>
            <li>Maybe I had high expectations thinking it would be something simple and pain free, and maybe I&#x27;m not using it properly and don&#x27;t know very well the technic</li>
            <li>Wow it really works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great way to save money by skipping  the expensive facials.</li>
            <li>This set is really helpful to get those blemishes gone early and often.</li>
            <li>My face looks so clear thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Something that I had not considered when I purchased the kit was just how useful it would be for those dreaded ingrown hairs from shaving or occasionally on the legs.</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t bend under normal use.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more for stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a useful kit for the arsenal of beauty products necessary for maintaining blemish-free skin.  </li>
            <li>I received this kit a few days ago and am very pleased with my purchase; definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I normally use tweezers and grabbed them thinking i might need them with this kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit it, in the case of this acne treatment kit, I needed to watch quite a few videos on youtube, but once I got it down, my face has been looking great.</li>
            <li>My only con, which is very minor, is that the carrying case could be better made but that is nitpicking.  </li>
            <li>I am able to clear out my pores without damaging my skin like I did previously with my fingernails (</li>
            <li>I remember my mom buying a tool similar to one of these, but it was fragile an broke easily.</li>
            <li>my daughter was very excited of the results she got in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease.</li>
            <li>Get the RIGHT tools and get your confidence back, today!</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it&#x27;s great, but, the other ones are.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably the one that looks the least useful and the roughest, compared to all the others, but the rest look like fine quality, sturdy tools.</li>
            <li>So, my advice-- if you need a complete set this is good, if you just need something basic, like a small pimple/blackhead remover, I&#x27;d keep looking and buy something else.</li>
            <li>A new design is needed for the case; I would have given them a five star review if this hadn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look shines and new like the others; instead, it looked like it was burned, never polished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves less marks</li>
            <li>the only way to really get blackheads out is to really dig the tool into your skin and risk leaving scars..</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know if where the impression sits, damage is being done underneath while the main attraction is being fixed....</li>
            <li>looks as strong as the Tweezerman extractor and costs much less.  </li>
            <li>I love this little set!</li>
            <li>We have been through many &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools over the years and none have served us as well as this efficient little kit!</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all and really works.</li>
            <li>and they arrived looking very old.</li>
            <li>Very complete box.</li>
            <li>The tools look very professional, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use them.</li>
            <li>Very professional looking kit.</li>
            <li>I really only use 1 tool from this, but it works pretty well....</li>
            <li>This is my second set first I use for its purpose, which is not often at all thank goodness</li>
            <li>, you have to place a hot washcloth over the area for 4-6 min to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>the nose does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>Before I was offered a set to evaluate and review, I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were comedone extractors sold to the public.</li>
            <li>Overall this is the first type of purchase, so</li>
            <li>in some cases even better for small pimples and blackheads) for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>He was not able to remove blackheads and whiteheads with them at all, maybe one or two with a lot of effort that seemed to cause even more damage to his skin than squeezing.</li>
            <li>especially since they work, really well!  </li>
            <li>It does remove blackheads, but if you&#x27;re not careful, you can really damage your face.</li>
            <li>With a little experimentation they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li>I find that only 1 of the tools (the small loop) works effectively for me.</li>
            <li>For the nose, a bit more force is usually needed than elsewhere on the face if you want to really get everything out, which may still cause some redness / swelling or pain shortly after.  </li>
            <li>The kit has many black head remover instruments to choose from, and priced well compared to the same product.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and the tools are similar if not the same as what professionals use.</li>
            <li>Only ever use the lancing tool and the large loop.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about some pieces being missing in some people&#x27;s kits but decided to risk it simply based on the fact that all comments mentioned that they had been able to easily request a replacement or missing pieces.</li>
            <li>Thought this would make it easier for teenager and pre teen to remove large blackheads that are causing scarring when removed the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>Love how little effort it takes to pop white heads/ blackheads compared to using fingers and nails.</li>
            <li>I love to see companies that take a little extra step to ensure their products meet customer expectations.</li>
            <li>The tools are mostly the same with little variation.</li>
            <li>The other tools don&#x27;t seem super helpful, but may do the trick if you have severe acne.</li>
            <li>Normally, the eliminated target would have a fairly high risk of scabbing because of &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; bleeding relative to the wound.</li>
            <li>This honestly led to a bunch of tiny little red circles on my face which went away in about an hour.  </li>
            <li>it clearly states it&#x27;s supposed to come with 5.</li>
            <li>My face looked so amazingly clear</li>
            <li>I had mostly clear sink in my teens</li>
            <li>Took two attempts to get all the way clear</li>
            <li>Works great only need cream or something to reduce the amount of pressure needed for the difficult ones</li>
            <li>Then, after using the kit, it is recommended that you then use pore-closing agents / cleaners to reduce the chances of the now clear pores being clogged again.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of blackhead issues with otherwise clear skin, and I have tried a ton of options for removing them (Creams, those things you stick on your face and rip off, exfoliation to the point of almost torture... )</li>
            <li>it helps clear up</li>
            <li>I wish I could find clear instructions anywhere at all about WHICH of these tools to use on what...</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t found anything as yet, that clearly demonstrates how to use each of the 5 tools included.</li>
            <li>Extracts blackheads very well and as gently as possible.</li>
            <li>These are professional, and quality tools.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for the black/ white heads!</li>
            <li>If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions.</li>
            <li>So far, they have worked well, and I anticipate they will continue to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My opinion remains unbiased and is based solely on my experience thus far with the product.</li>
            <li>Complete set.</li>
            <li>Professional grade tools that are well contained in leather carrying case.</li>
            <li>It far surpasses the description it was given by the seller.</li>
            <li>A complete kit of sturdy instruments.</li>
            <li>Had I used this on a client&#x27;s face they could have developed an infection.</li>
            <li>As far as advice goes for using these tools ensure you are using the correct technique, there are instructional materials and videos you can find online that will be of use.</li>
            <li>As of now the remaining blackheads are only visible at a very close distance.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and much safer way of maintaining your skin than squeezing and marking up your face.</li>
            <li>There is a case that comes with the tools, which works well except for the zipper--it is one continuous zipper and can&#x27;t close completely on one end, which allows some of the tools to slip out of the case.  </li>
            <li>I have deep pores on my nose and chin, and these extracting tools work very well in clearing out those stubborn blackheads that won&#x27;t come out with cleaning, scrubbing and masking.  </li>
            <li>The tools are very sturdy and look like they would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I must have for teens and young adults.</li>
            <li>: you really need a smaller tool for the blackheads on your nose, but you can make this work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the comedone is expressed notice the pulling (scraping) movement the doc uses so that it is completely removed.</li>
            <li>These issues can be fixed with both a Google search or Youtube search, but I would like to not need these as a matter of convenience.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked out well</li>
            <li>Completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Professional quality with helpful information included.</li>
            <li>This is a professional quality kit.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not destroying my face trying to get at a zit.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality</li>
            <li>So far no problems.  </li>
            <li>and I would nearly spend every day trying to remove them from my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Professional looking and feel.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me because I guess the blackheads on my nose aren&#x27;t that big...</li>
            <li>Got it for my teenage son and he is amazed at how it really works.</li>
            <li>So far, this kit has taken care of problems 100% of the time.</li>
            <li>Does not work like the old school one I had in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use each piece properly, but it really does work...</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>cause I gave it to my 6 year old to play doctor on her dolls...</li>
            <li>These things are the furthest thing from professional.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at all the tool options in the kit.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality of this kit considering the price.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to replace my old tools.</li>
            <li>and I did not use my tweezers at all which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>The Equinox Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit - 5 Professional Surgical Instruments arrived 2 days after I placed the order.</li>
            <li>Now I am no longer so self conscious about the blackheads/lack of.</li>
            <li>These are tools dermatologists use and should be handled professionally and with an educated hand.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and made of top notch material this product should last for years barring its use as a tool for which it wasn&#x27;t intended.</li>
            <li>The set is ok for the price however after using these a few times I&#x27;m back to square one.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical of the quality of these extractors but decided to give it a try since the reviews seem promising.  </li>
            <li>Looks good but its useless.</li>
            <li>Kind of annoying, but okay for the price point.</li>
            <li>When I opened my package, a long, black, wavy hair was embedded in the zipper of the tool case, as well as touching the tools.</li>
            <li>Wash the tools off with hot water and soap, then dry.  </li>
            <li>Evidently this is a common problem for some that&#x27;s been solved for many, yet I won&#x27;t be one of those people that gets to complete their set.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a product that does what it needs to if performed with careful hands, but an incomplete product that continues to be sent around shouldn&#x27;t be acceptable.</li>
            <li>While I am not a medical professional or cosmetologist, I have used many different medical instruments to help in various home repair projects, jewelry making, and crafts projects, so I feel I am qualified to make such a statement.</li>
            <li>How big or small can a blackhead get that you needs that many sizes</li>
            <li>I mainly just use the tools for individual blemishes when they pop up.</li>
            <li>I find some of them a complete waste, but it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>Hence, the reason I only use mainly one.</li>
            <li>It quickly and painlessly clears black heads with no scarring.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>This kit has allowed me to properly manage the blemishes on my face without having to deal with the usual issues that came with pinching, including redness, bleeding and scabbing, swelling or irritation of skin after pinching, and has ultimately been a very satisfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it; in fact I recently got another set for my friend.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many different facial products but have had no success!</li>
            <li>The instrument usage is not easy to figure out and honestly i find running the length of a needle, not the pointed end, down</li>
            <li>The metal appears to be cheaper drop forge steel, but it doesn&#x27;t really need to be surgical grade or anything as long as you keep them sanitary.</li>
            <li>In medical training we learned that the comedone extractor is used because they effectively remove the problem with the least possible damage to surrounding tissue, thus speeds healing and reduces and/or eliminates scaring, irritation and inflammation.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I had a generic 2-sided blackhead tool I&#x27;ve been using for a while, but I kept having red splotches left on my skin since that particular tool wasn&#x27;t adequate for getting blackheads out of different areas with different thickness and pore</li>
            <li>Since this is something you use on your face, I figured the company would be a little bit more careful about the sterilization and packaging  procedures.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the one tool with the tiny spike at the end, just precise enough to make a little prick into the skin, then I was able to use one of the tools to slowly and evenly push out all the &amp;#34;white stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;surgical grade&amp;#34; extractor, which claims to be brand new, was rusted/eroded in several places.</li>
            <li>arrived brand new with steel plating chipped and peeling back .</li>
            <li>Despite all user-based instructions and time-learned techniques suggesting to clear the blemish / wound until there is some visible blood to completely clear it; I have also found that after using this kit instead of my fingers has led to a massive decrease in the chance of scabbing.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times on some more troubled areas and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>its just not what I expected, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is really good high quality and sterile tools.</li>
            <li>My major problem areas are around my nose and chin; however, after just one use, I can see and feel a noticeable difference in my skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li>It should be used as a secondary tool when compared to normal cleaners and should be used with warm/hot and cold water for best effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to remove that sucker!</li>
            <li>Note that all the loops are rounded and not sharp.</li>
            <li>Favorite application for it has to be the easy and relieving removal of painful blemishes that can appear suddenly.  </li>
            <li>I usually have to use a thumbtack to clean out the openings, but besides that, all is well.</li>
            <li>Updated 2/24/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating my rating because a representative from Equinox immediately shipped a second kit, as the original set that I received was missing tools.</li>
            <li>Black case is cheap and stinky and the tools rust if you don&#x27;t fully dry off.</li>
            <li>None of them are polished smooth, and as a result these instruments damage the delicate tissues of the face.</li>
            <li>There is a general idea of each tool but being an engineer I would like to know the specifics to ensure I maximize what the tool was designed for.</li>
            <li>cause it is less likely to give you infections if you clean it properly, than just popping your pimples with your fingers.</li>
            <li>They come in a case that is small enough to fit just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a must have and clear your skin.</li>
            <li>Product worked as expected really appreciated the price.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li>Three actually look professional.</li>
            <li>and I so far I&#x27;ve only had to use 2 out of the 5 tools in the case for my acne prone, pimple spread skin.</li>
            <li>Quality products l, my wife is a medical professional and she raves about this set.</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful and be gentle.  </li>
            <li>Order arrived fast, packaged well and quality as expected.</li>
            <li>but some people might be surprised to open up the holder and find the tools all over the bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would definitely purchase if I was a professional.</li>
            <li>and you barely have to push an compared to my fingers trying to push my pimples out</li>
            <li>Would have spent the same for 1 higher quality tool.</li>
            <li>It made them worse and it seemed like I was getting more of them.</li>
            <li>Did not find this to be useful in any way, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I had contacted support and they offered a full refund, but I simply wanted that tool that was missing to be shipped over.</li>
            <li>OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>I love the little black travel case that comes with all the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from that I have had other blackhead remover tools in the past and they just felt sturdier and worked better.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for personal or professional use!  </li>
            <li>An aside, this mask really made my skin feel tight and clear and the acne that was already on my skin felt tighter and</li>
            <li>really trust to use this on my face due to the condition it came in.</li>
            <li>Depending on your skin type you may find that you will need to use these tools weekly, monthly or even every couple of days in my case, the key is to be consistent about it as a regimen is key to keeping blackheads at bay and the longer you leave them the harder they will be to remove.</li>
            <li>the kit enables a much larger range of action then tools that can be bought individually.</li>
            <li>I actually expected the whole case to be larger</li>
            <li>This scabbing would often lead to picking for many people, even unintentionally, only making the issue worse.</li>
            <li>What a fun little gadget!</li>
            <li>Wow these little hooks and scrapers really, get into the pores, clears up your pores in a matter of minutes simply amazing,I don&#x27;t feel self consce as before</li>
            <li>Gently use a diabetic lancet to start, as it has a tiny sharp blade, which doesn&#x27;t leave scarring.</li>
            <li>I will never again attempt to remove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands.</li>
            <li>Many times, the spot that is healing could potentially look worse than if left alone.  </li>
            <li>You should go on YouTube first and look at a few videos on how to use these.</li>
            <li>After first receiving this product, it took a few days to get used to using it.  </li>
            <li>However, the first time it arrived, it was missing one tool.</li>
            <li>Common sense says open your pores and keep the tools clean.</li>
            <li>Each tool works as expected and I highly recommend this to all my friends that are constantly trying to attack the blackheads and zits they have.</li>
            <li>so much easier and less painfull than using two fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super confusing to learn how to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She simply places the desired tool end over her blemish and pushes down, or move the tool in a gentle sweeping motion</li>
            <li>As with other reviewers, it does leave a an impression for a while, and this is normal.  </li>
            <li>However, the ridged handles are easy to grip and slow and careful manipulation will get you the results you want.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really understand all the different sizes or the very scary thing that looks like a weapon, but I was able to use one instrument to remove ALL the blackheads on my face and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just pushing it all back in and causing bigger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting the hang of using this properly to remove black heads, slowly I&#x27;m getting better at it.</li>
            <li>As for personal opinion, each tool has some weight to it, which gives the impression of being sturdy (I like the weight, not too much.. not too little).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> But the product is good quality and well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Before I received the product, I got an email about how to use the tools from the company and another after receiving the product asking if I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have ordered many things and have never had anyone care to contact me like they did.</li>
            <li> Had another that was much better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d still recommend it for people that has more patience</li>
            <li> most anyway,</li>
            <li> It works okay, but it came looking either rusty or</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> All Good Fast shipping nice set of tools.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> Love it all</li>
            <li> I have squished so many things out of my pores with it.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews and that is why I bought the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things</li>
            <li> You should never use your fingers to try and expel the bacteria, just adds more bacteria.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> never saw one better</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kit, but WARNING this product is not intended for use by Meth users as they will come out of the bathroom two hours later looking like Freddy Cruger!!!!</li>
            <li> One of the top purchases off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works best after a bath, shower, or sauna when pores are open and debris is softened.</li>
            <li> These are okay</li>
            <li> Great kit works very well</li>
            <li> I love it, so does my dog.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of these tools.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overuse or abuse your skin, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with these tools.  </li>
            <li> Also, these work much better after you&#x27;ve showered or washed/</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to others and will look for more products by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work more times</li>
            <li> It really does a great job extracting.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use the kit as it suggested you could use it.</li>
            <li> , I recommend that you watch a doc use them properly not only to get the best results but also to use them correctly so as not to damage your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a teenaged child, buy them, and it&#x27;ll be a gift that gives them better self-esteem, healthier skin and fewer or no acne scarring.</li>
            <li> This is much more recommended than using your hands.</li>
            <li> glad i ordered  it.  </li>
            <li> I feel much more refreshed using these tools</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.</li>
            <li> I love the case and how slim it is for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I really love this kit.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s such a great gift, too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you want to make sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen someone mention rust, so I&#x27;ll be sure to look out for that.</li>
            <li> but I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend because its efficient.</li>
            <li> however I can&#x27;t stand having bumps and lumps in my face since people love to make comments about my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works okay, but you have to apply quite of bit of pressure to make it work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; with the different tools on my skin to figure out which one is best.  </li>
            <li> However they are great tools, it is a great package and their customer service is fantastic - just wish it had a very basic - i.e. one page - list of instructions.</li>
            <li> Love this Blackhead and Blemish Remover kit.  </li>
            <li> : I would make sure you wash you</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a zipper case to hold all the tools.  </li>
            <li> is an instruction manual for the many tools.</li>
            <li> keep checking for more</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> All opinions and experiences are genuine and completely my own.</li>
            <li> I think I need a better explanation of how to use them.</li>
            <li> Hurt the face more than help</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have tried to many products to get rid of the blackheads on my nose, and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Both arrived in perfect condition and next day.</li>
            <li> Using this makes you feel more relieved after getting everything out.</li>
            <li> Using this is so much better than your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with his kit, i used one time because i saw a whitehead in my forehead</li>
            <li> and i used it&#x27;s was like a magic</li>
            <li> I had an extractor stick when I lived in Japan and haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the states quite like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and also the express was fast.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> As described:).</li>

            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> much better thans scratching the skin with fingernails</li>

            <li> Great items work very well</li>
            <li> But overall, the tools are excellent!</li>

            <li> The tools work OK except for a big flaw, they&#x27;re not polished perfectly and have scratched my face on many occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I have a ready-to-pop zit, the product is ok.  </li>
            <li> ot is more like having 10 as each ends</li>
            <li> There are lot of tools to choose from so if one doesn&#x27;t get it, another is sure to.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, with all tools secure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. .</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!! :)</li>
            <li> The tool case also smells like a mixture of moth balls and pot, which isn&#x27;t exactly appealing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell for sure.  </li>
            <li> Awesome.. Works as advertised, Will make a great gift with substance and a definite high use item.</li>

            <li> Its easy to use and extremely satisfying  :-)</li>
            <li> thats okay because I have very sensitive skin anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing and if you know how to use these tools, they work pretty good.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for., costumer service was really good.</li>

            <li> This is a pretty good set of tools.  </li>
            <li> the one end still had a burr on it from the machining and cut me pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I think if you know how to use them, these are very good, although I do wish there was one more instrument that was smaller in size.</li>

            <li> Good with certain pimples.</li>
            <li> This product contains a good set of tools to extract or remove certain blemishes.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I get blackheads more than I would like to admit and with this kit I no longer have to worry about it because these tools get them out very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but there are some non smooth parts where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> Equinox is great at following up making sure you are satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great to clear your pores.</li>
            <li> But it was relatively cheap and quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> They sent me two emails checking to see if I was happy with the product complete with PDF manuals on how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Very effective--nice case and tools are of good quality.</li>

            <li> Excellent priced at more or less, $15.  </li>
            <li> Very effective, professional results</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day and let me just say this set is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best deal on blemish and blackhead removing tools on Amazon due to the fact that it&#x27;s a 10 in one package instead of having to buy them all separately.  </li>
            <li> They sent several follow up e-mails to make sure that I was happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Since I got this, I&#x27;ve been able to clean my skin without hurting myself and the case keeps it together.</li>
            <li> It is everything it was said that it is and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it really easy to use!she</li>
            <li> Easy to sterilize.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> in a safe and clean way.</li>
            <li> Great kit for those who like to do it themselves or feel better doing it at home in private.</li>
            <li> It easily eliminates zits/pimples, helps remove or fix ingrown hairs, and clears obstructions in the pores of your nose.</li>
            <li> However, it won&#x27;t be nearly as easy to do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but practice and patience made it easy to learn to use.  </li>
            <li> Removes blemishes easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quality tools.</li>
            <li> Easy to grab and hold.</li>
            <li> I do however like the kit and how easy it is to use and then put away.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The tools do their job and they&#x27;re easy to sanitize.</li>
            <li> Strong steel ends.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great replacement and it had many more implements than the single extractor I purchased from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> High quality and fair price.</li>
            <li> but something more detailed included with the product would have been great, as would an explaination of the specific uses for each tool.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the purchase and the customer service is very helpful too.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing a kit of this kind.</li>
            <li> I like the box I am able to put some needles and tweezers in it and have a full kit of /r/popping</li>
            <li> I saw a bunch of cool YouTube videos on extracting blackheads and bumps, but I think using my two fingers is better than this.  </li>
            <li> Best to use with a facial steamer or after a hot shower and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I think the tool quality is just fine</li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> The ones that were received were fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with instruction but after a couple of uses, you can figure out what works best and how to make it hurt less.</li>
            <li> It has been great so far, easy to use and the order came in quickly.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t been able to successfully use these for blackheads or smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sterilized the tools and they work fine, but I will not be using this company again.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to look online and figure out what some of the toools do.</li>
            <li> More fun than a barrel full of monkeys!</li>
            <li> used the long one right out of the box and OUCH!!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel that the loops on the tools are too large to be effective compared to the examples I found on google.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed that I decided to go for another one that was a little tougher to pop.  </li>
            <li> These little tools work great!</li>
            <li> Definitely not as painful as popping things with your fingers and more clean.</li>
            <li> I do feel these are worth 5 stars since they&#x27;re sharp, light, easy to use, and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works amazing at getting all the blackheads I couldn&#x27;t extremely effective definitely reccommend</li>
            <li> surgical instruments look cheap along with the case and it as no instructions on how to use the instruments.</li>
            <li> Great tool set gives options for variety of blemishes the guide the vendor sends prior to receiving your set</li>
            <li> is helpful overall great buy for the price</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be for blackheads and such, but there is one tool in it that works great as an ear spoon for cleaning wax from ear canal.</li>
            <li> but my primary problem is Milia.</li>
            <li> TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li> Great with facial steamers.</li>
            <li> and once I got it it pass the eye test meaning it didn&#x27;t look cheap and its holding up</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and all the tools work well.</li>
            <li> The company even sent me an email to let me know that I can contact them if I am having trouble learning how to use them which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean the tools just a lil rubbing alcohol..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and includes a nice case.</li>
            <li> Tools are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I received this for free for review.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me free for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Im happy with the arrival time but was dissapointed to only find 4 instead of 5 tools ...</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great kit that I have been using every chance it is required.</li>
            <li> wash your face with an oil free cleanser before and after using these tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used properly this is a great product.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks great the next day.</li>
            <li> Customer service was fantastic in proactively contacting me regarding any issues I may have with the product.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> These tools are made of a durable metal and are easy to clean off.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic and sterile job of cleaning up the skin.</li>
            <li> did not bend like the cheap others I have purchaced</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great tool set.  </li>
            <li> One improvement though, the pieces could have been labeled as there were five different pieces but great product..</li>
            <li> Also the holder is very sleek and stores each item in its own slot.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If I knew tools like this were available for purchase by non-medical professionals...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and affective.</li>
            <li> Some of the metal isn&#x27;t smooth and cuts.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; you can have a facial at home without the expense.</li>
            <li> - Fantastic for removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> Would not recommended this purchase cheap looking and the case is wrinkled and looks homemade</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any bruising with using the tools and I was able to clear my clogged pores effectively.</li>
            <li> this tool to work very well.it is best to use it after a shower or after facial washing.</li>
            <li> My 32 yr old son loved it.</li>
            <li> far as the product goes, two fingers are more effective than the tools in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus far I am struggling to use the tools effectively, but I suspect this could have more to do with my ignorance than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> This set is comprised of what appear to be superior, professional medical-quality instruments.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes and types but not as good of quality as I had hoped….</li>
            <li> It is a superior alternative to the pinch and pray technique that many of us are used to, provided you (even occasionally, provided it is lightly used) clean, sterilize, and maintain the tools.</li>
            <li> Since then the company very quickly reached out to me and ensured that I got the full set.</li>
            <li> Every thing is high quality very durable, im very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is a very useful tool for removing blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> have had blackhead extractors before which sort of work, but the variety in sizes offered here  is very handy, since one can try different instruments until the desired extraction occurs.</li>
            <li> They are very useful.</li>
            <li> Very useful tools to help remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful in unclogging pores.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful, high quality kit, and has five different tools that cover any blackhead needs.</li>
            <li> but I thought using precise tools would allow me to clean out pimples so they can begin the healing process sooner.</li>
            <li> These 5 tools are all you really need, my first impressions are really good as the tools appear to be quite durable and well made.</li>
            <li> This was quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They remove the blackheads quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert but these tools &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; surgical steel, very strong as they don&#x27;t bend at all no matter how much pressure you put on them when using them.</li>
            <li> no complaints at all with the tools, just the case could be a little better but its all good :)</li>
            <li> Highly effective, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works better if you steam your face first.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you steam the area your using it on first.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming impressed</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this kit</li>
            <li> However, this has not occurred to me more than once or twice and the first time I noticed it was when I originally opened it after it was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> :) seems to be workin pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> Make sure you watch some youtube videos first before attempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the manufactures for providing me with a discounted review unit.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as it is described, maybe better.  </li>
            <li> There are many different tools and one will be the most appropriate for the task.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, before using any of these tools, make sure you sterilize them so that it doesn&#x27;t get the area you wish to pick at infected.</li>
            <li> Came very fast, has a nice carry case,does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Very good solid quality instruments that work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this kit -- I love the nice zip up holder and the wide variety of tool sizes and shapes!  </li>
            <li> Since I do use these tools on my face, I like that I can clean it after use and store it away in this case instead of having to buy something else to store it in.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would protect the tools and keep them clean until I need to use them.</li>
            <li> on my face before a light moisturizer (CeraVe) and wow, the results were absolutely amazing.    </li>
            <li> I got it for my teenage son and he has been using it every day with great success.  </li>
            <li> Always recommend that they clean the instruments with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li> The tools come in a synthetic leather pouch that has a zipper on it to keep all your tools in place and clean.</li>
            <li> but I wish they gave some instruction on what each tool is for and how to clean them with the kit.</li>
            <li> Strips / cleansers should be used first, along with the application or pore-opening warm / hot water.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, complete and in excellent condition, definitely has met my expectations</li>
            <li> Nice product for all the pimple obsessed like myself :D</li>
            <li> Even though I only know how to use a couple of the tools, they are the most effective ones for me.</li>
            <li> all in one place and keep them clean.</li>
            <li> They look clean and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth as it contains strong, sturdy, and well made tools with diverse properties.</li>
            <li> The built-in cloth that is in the case makes it very easy and handy to dry tools after sterilization.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are looking to safely and easily remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Its soo good, handy, remove black and whiteheads without any pain!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product, was able to use it easily no matter where I was.</li>
            <li> This kit allows the swelling to be safely and easily removed / reduced without pinching which would normally irritate the skin and still hurt for a while after.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I cannot say enough good things about this kit, I absolutely love it and it has completely changed the way I take care of my skin.</li>
            <li> These stainless steel tools insure great control and can be easily kept clean and germ-free - a key requirement to avoid infections, etc.</li>
            <li> Most of my reviews are very high (4-5 stars) when I purchase on Amazon</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Not really, but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be razor like, but nonetheless they work great.</li>
            <li> Some on the holes are off center, and none of them work great.  </li>
            <li> I got this whole kit for about 30% more than I would have paid for just one tool at drug store.  </li>
            <li> , we haven&#x27;t been able to really get them to remove blackheads like they do in the videos.</li>
            <li> These stuffs Look good to me, but I am still practicing working with them to remove my white heads.</li>
            <li> Informative emails accompany the product order with full instructions.</li>
            <li> Seller also offers 100% guarantee which is nice.</li>
            <li> For medical education- NSFE&amp;#34; is good.</li>
            <li> FULL VERSION:  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is way better than mashing blackheads with your fingers</li>
            <li> : I think this is a really good kit that will work well once I figure out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Now you have five tools all for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Total works and good quality</li>
            <li> It works sooo good and after ther isnt any red marks works like a charm!!!!!</li>
            <li> so much :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to be gentle with your skin :)  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it full stars.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use than fingers for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product it helped out so much with my blackhead problem on my face.</li>
            <li> The tools look so cool.</li>
            <li> Multiple tools and a carrying case made for a good deal here.  </li>
            <li> A great kit , does what it supposed to , as long as you do it the right way.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> Would appreciate it more if it&#x27;s soft genuine leather.</li>
            <li> Without injuring surrounding skin by squeezing, these tools target pressure around the clogged pore and allow for quick removal and extraction of blemish-causing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product comes with so many tools, however it needs to come with instructions on what tool to use for what specific problem.</li>
            <li> Items arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> These tools are great for gently helping to get rid of the bacteria, and don&#x27;t make the area as red as if you use your fingers.</li>
            <li> The package came quickly though, I like the quality of the product and I&#x27;ve never used it before now</li>
            <li> and it would make the difference between a 3 and 5 star review if they just included a quick guide.</li>
            <li> They appear to be made well, and I was one of the lucky ones that received all the tools at one time.  </li>
            <li> Just like the picture and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> After getting acquainted with the different tools I actually enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li> Super cooll</li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I will follow up on YouTube to try to figure out how to best utilize all of the different options, but overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;ve found these tools, and they are</li>
            <li> I bought them for my grandson who has mild acne.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this company over others because they have excellent customer service and came with five different sizes, when others only come  with one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made from high quality material and surely won&#x27;t scratch your face or leave an unwanted mark.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and as expected and works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> They are so much more durable and effective than anything I have found in a drug store or other retail outlet.  </li>
            <li> Upon receiving and opening this product the very first thing I felt was overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Prevents swelling and irritation, super easy to use and much easier than with nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality and easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> Very useful and a very well made product!</li>
            <li> A printed paper that showed easy or recommended ways to sterilize the tools would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> Tools are effective, durable and high quality but make sure you follow the directions to use them properly.</li>
            <li> Despite all of the positive feelings and utility of this kit, I do not feel that it should be used as a primary tool when taking care of or cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They look like they will last for many years!</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> At first it kinda resembles a dental tray!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> pouch is really useful for storage as it is very compact and easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has really helped tremendously!</li>
            <li> face first, then use the tool, clean it after use.</li>
            <li> received fast, great Kit-has all you ned for clear skin care, works well so far!</li>
            <li> Great little kit.  </li>
            <li> The case is a little flimsy but the quality of the instruments is great.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great tool that would apply an even amount of pressure with little exertion from me.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little kit for removing whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but seems like if you have blackheads on your nose you need a little bit of fat or else it hurts and doesn&#x27;t get anything.</li>
            <li> Many products for little price, nice storage case.</li>
            <li> It is in a nice black leather case and all the instruments are VERY nice and solid!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> Quality is great and even feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Different sizes and amazing quality</li>
            <li> It got here extremely fast and the seller is very concerned that buyers are satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Definable worth the money.</li>
            <li> and the case is nice enough too.</li>
            <li> They pretty much took off the top layer of my chin the first time I used them so after that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> glad to be using professional tools and no longer my fingers.</li>
            <li> Although it is nice to use the tools for my entire nose and chin areas.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 3 stars is because to the novice (like myself) it would nice to have a chart that explains why each end looks the way it does and how to use it.</li>
            <li> So I felt the need to order tools to help clear my pores better.  </li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the quality of these tools.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the tools on the more minimal blackheads or achne, but instead the more severe cases.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial care kit.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> not medical grade stuff but really nice for the price</li>
            <li> useful as need.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend anyone interested in buying this product read the full thing.  </li>
            <li> It offers more options than I though it would.  </li>
            <li> As good as expected.</li>
            <li> so I can use it again because I am just absolutely thrilled that I finally found something that works, but nothing yet..</li>
            <li> He is always in dirt and his pores get clogged so it was nice to have different tools to help him remove the dirt from the pours.</li>
            <li> I also received the product on time and it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I hear they&#x27;re are plenty of useful videos on YouTube...</li>
            <li> I found three out of the five tools useful, hence the 3/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not as good as what was used during my last facial but its OK.</li>
            <li> Quality of the equipment is easily worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> comes in a nice case with several tools.</li>
            <li> handles on all of the pieces are textured which prevents your fingers from slipping off and gives you really good hand control and therefore help with precision removal.</li>
            <li> They feel sturdy and the case is a pretty cool way to keep them all together.  </li>
            <li> I am not a dermatologist, but I have found this product incredibly useful in removing blackheads from around my nose and clearing my skin of pimples.</li>
            <li> The materials are high quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very nice little kit.</li>
            <li> I personally have had some of the best results after using a clay mask that helps pull the gunk out of my pores, then I can get any other stuff that&#x27;s still a bit stuck with these tools.  </li>
            <li> I like to use these tools after Aztec Clay Mask or Cellbone Skin Prep (both available on Amazon) to get my pores so clean they&#x27;re nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> one of them broke after a couple of weeks of use but the others worked fine and look like high quality products.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see the professional branded case that zipped to secure the tools.</li>
            <li> All the tools are very workable and useful!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend not to mention the nice soft vinyl pouch.</li>
            <li> This is what I have learned, but it may not be right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right about the size of a sun glass case.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just am not using it right.</li>
            <li> so I may not even be using it right.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> right  away</li>
            <li> There is a diverse set of tools: You&#x27;ll always have the right size and shape to get any pimple/whitehead out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were shipped and arrived right away.</li>
            <li> but it makes a difference if you use the right one.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the equipment, I would absolutely recommend Equinox International.</li>
            <li> It really does help squeezing out blackheads, but remember to clean it with rubbing alcohol before using it.</li>
            <li> Seller is very eager to make certain that the buyer is satisfied and that the product is satisfactory which it certainly is.</li>
            <li> They are high quality, and don&#x27;t feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part is that there aren&#x27;t any instructions for what each end of each tool is recommended for doing, so you kind of have to experiment with the different ones until you find the one that effectively removes the blackhead without having to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will come in handy for the occasional stubborn blackhead, but I won&#x27;t make regular use of it.</li>
            <li> Comes with a great little case for all the tools that makes them very discreet to others.  </li>
            <li> The item came packaged carefully and I was able to immediately use my blemish remover tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: would have loved a small guide or instructions, identifying the tools to be able to distinguish them from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tools are a good size for me and the lancet is very sharp.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and easily damaged.</li>
            <li> but now it is fully closed, clear, and looking great.  </li>
            <li> However, I wish they gave some basic instructions with the kit: including proper cleaning/sterilization and each tools suited purpose, but all pieces were in the kit and work great together.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools require careful use, others are precise and work well with more pressure.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery- terrific extractors and nice case.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a better option than using her fingers, and more sanitary as long as you clean them properly and use alcohol after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> All blackheads are not created equal and as such its great that this kit has different size tools for removal, more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I am also a bit worried about the fact that your tools might rust very fast</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Methods for proper sterilization (which is VERY important) are not given and must be found online or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Both like their kits very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It was actually kind of hard to stop using it because I was so excited!</li>
            <li> Fine product, delivered early</li>
            <li> Fair warning, I am reviewing this in a manner that will mention (in general, not graphically or detailed) &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; or removed/reduced zits and other issues.</li>
            <li> With this little money it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> All was as expected - these things work amazingly</li>
            <li> The instructions on how to care for the instruments were clear and accurate, as they fall in line with NYS guidelines.</li>
            <li> this works very well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It appears to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had been looking for, for some time.  </li>
            <li> so popping pimples are something I&#x27;ve been doing my whole life!</li>
            <li> These tools made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Be sure to poke a tiny hole in the blemish before you scrape it out.</li>
            <li> - The Equinox Blemish Remover Kit is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I even received an email from the manufacturer prior to receiving the kit that specifically told me to make sure all five implements were included in the kit.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much came out of it!</li>
            <li> Not for everyone, but if your looking at it in the first place it&#x27;s probably for you.</li>
            <li> She first used this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I threw the case away after first day.</li>
            <li> Still a better value than buying them individual.</li>
            <li> I would give these a higher rating but there are no instructions included.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t dig at your skin the first place</li>
            <li> It helps much better than going to do facial with a hundred dollars!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, and works like a charm ;)</li>
            <li> I was younger, I had many piercings</li>
            <li> We mostly use these on his back.</li>
            <li> At first, I gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have so many tiny blackheads</li>
            <li> Sharp stabby one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Tried it the first day it arrived.</li>
            <li> first</li>
            <li> For blackheads or clogged pores (the nose, specifically), I have found that this is a great secondary tool.</li>
            <li> Each tools proper or intended use is not given, which can add a small learning curve as to what works best and where.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.isfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life.</li>
            <li> Thanks !&lt;</li>
            <li> Or I&#x27;m just a big baby :)</li>
            <li> This product got here really fast!  </li>
            <li> Many blackheads and pimples might need some extra time to get closer to the surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the kit since the first day I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at Sephora many years ago for $19, it was longer, but it was only one tool.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was pretty much exactly what was promised. . .</li>
            <li> I can do the same extractions my aesthetition does, but for free!</li>
            <li> I love that it has many different sizes to use on the different areas of your face!</li>
            <li> A couple of pieces are useful, others not so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they finally came out with a product like this</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, and it is exactly what was promised.  </li>

            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The case seems pretty durable too.</li>
            <li> Seller emails tips on how to use and this very helpful to use these implements!</li>
            <li> Especially the one that is a more sturdy piece</li>
            <li> Thanks Equinox for putting all of these tools in one kit!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Guess they don&#x27;t want to be put away ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I used this on my boyfriends back and weirdly enjoyed watching this work,</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who has acne or blackhead issues should most definitely get this.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I decided to do was wash my face and grab my magnifying mirror as suggested on the box.</li>
            <li> The tools are heavy and feel like good quality steel.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, good quality tools.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, as described, and is a good heavy metal.</li>
            <li> Each of the tools are heavy duty and most feature a sort of rectangular metal body, which provides extra support so that you can&#x27;t easily bend the tools when using them These tools basically act like your finger, squeezing the junk out of the pour, but much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> More often you end up creating a new pimple by just trying to clear a pore or pimple.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs removed super simple with any mirror available to you.</li>
            <li> but it you really have to, then I would recommend this product right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all stainless steel and with 5 pieces, I&#x27;m sure it will meet all my future needs.</li>
            <li> The company went out of their way and sent us a PDF with basic instructions and that was a nice, unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li> sure I was using this properly, which was very considerate imo.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care as I leave mine open most of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty smart, but will take this to dermatologist to view,&lt;br /&gt;before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to give into the hype of positive reviews</li>
            <li> Although I got to pop out and get rid of a lot of pimples, my only issue was that it still didn&#x27;t manage to successfully pop every single one and now I have some scars on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tools in this pack are incredible and do a great job getting out all different sorts of blackheads and crap from my skin.</li>
            <li> she said they really work, and are pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The tools are very sturdy and very well made!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I got the kit and saw that the instruments were heavy duty and made well.</li>
            <li> The various sized loops and tools are quite useful and effective on my various skin challenges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you’ve never used these tools before, either get an expert to show you or look up good examples on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m guilty of using my fingers to squeeze out pimples sometimes, especially when I don’t have a good tool at hand.</li>
            <li> They are extremely well made, easy to sanitize and use and my pores are the cleanest they have probably ever been due to a good mirror and these tools.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am far from a professional at this, but after figuring out how to use the tools, it was actually pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> and it was much cheaper (and more complete) than many other sets sold at the stores where I live.</li>
            <li> The differently sized loops make extraction easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use tools simple carrying case ...</li>
            <li> Rather than relying on this kit as a primary removal tool, for the nose I would recommend the stick-on Biore nose strips (or a similar brand / tool) being used first.  </li>
            <li> I watched a video on how to use them properly and found that they are easy to use once you know how.</li>
            <li> The little black zipper case is perfect for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> packed in a smart looking  zippered&lt;</li>
            <li> However, I would say this is a &#x27;5-Star Pimple and LARGE Blackhead Remover&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I will be certain to recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Used it on my nose where I removed a disgustingly large amount of sebum.</li>
            <li> They come with general instructions, so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the tools I&#x27;d recommend a YouTube video or contacting the sellers customer support.</li>
            <li> I was easily able to remove a blackhead that I had for awhile that I couldn&#x27;t get out through &#x27;natural&#x27; means (hot shower, wait for pores to open, squeeze, or the egg whites</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for everyday use after a hot bath and right after I remove my Aztec clay mask</li>
            <li> The moment I received this Equinox International Blackhead and Blemish kit I got excited and gotten wait to use it on my first &amp;#34;patient&amp;#34; as ai felt like a surgeon.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent set.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent stuff.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t order this one, but it seems like a decent product!</li>
            <li> Very highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tools.</li>
            <li> The tools seem to be a very high quality construction, but it has done nothing at all for my acne or blackheads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tools are very high quality.</li>
            <li> They come in their own little pouch which has a zipper.</li>
            <li> Nice little case with all promised tools.</li>
            <li> Nice little case.</li>
            <li> great little kit for a thorough facial, took awhile to get here</li>
            <li> You have to press really hard to get good leverage.</li>
            <li> Very high quality steel tools, delivered in a very timely way.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a HD camera to upload clear pics, but I did my best).</li>
            <li> My face looks great no red marks after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The edges are smooth and rounded, which helps to not damage the skin as much as I have found in some local implements I purchased.  </li>
            <li> It is not professional grade, but pretty cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> These things really work well.</li>
            <li> I can really do my business with this kit.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely what I wanted.</li>

            <li> I suffer from ingrown hairs post-bikini waxing, so this has absolutely helped in remedying that issue.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t extract well and</li>
            <li> really wish I took before and after photos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister she really likes it</li>
            <li> I use it so much</li>
            <li> The seller has also been very communicative by sending and informational via email after my purchase on how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job, probably didn&#x27;t need to get the whole kit as I only use a few of the tools in it.</li>
            <li> The price is quite affordable and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to anyone who is in the business or just wants to remove blemishes gently without causing damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> This product really was a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> but at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> I tried it out without really looking into how to use it.  </li>
            <li> so once you&#x27;ve taught yourself how to use it, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> As for the material it seems to be made of stainless steel type material..</li>
            <li> they are very sturdy and they don&#x27;t feel like they will bend.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but I would like to have some detailed instructions specific to the set.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who wants a comedome extractor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the look out for tools to help me with my art and craft/hobby with miniatures and these proved to fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the product really works</li>
            <li> They do make removing blemishs much easier and do not damage the skin.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed on how well this works.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well....</li>
            <li> but this actually really helps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know how to use it very well, but I did get contacted by the company soon after I received it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Top notch-high quality and shipped in time expected.</li>
            <li> Very efficient for an affordable price</li>
            <li> Stainless?</li>
            <li> Really, how the heck are they rusted in the package?</li>
            <li> Even watching a bunch of &#x27;how-to&#x27; videos didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the inside of the carrying case wasn&#x27;t very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> The kit offers enough tools for both of us, and the included instructions were most helpful.</li>
            <li> I was able to get rid of an old blackhead from my husbands back.</li>
            <li> I would suggest watching a video or two on YouTube of dermatologists using these tools if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t go crazy and overdo it on your face -- there are good techniques for using these tools and you can find some good videos (might be kinda gross) if you are curious.  </li>
            <li> : easy to clean, strong material, pressure from tools bring out blackheads and pimples, nice carrying case, variety of tools, doesn&#x27;t leave bruises (only small red circles for the next 20 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Everything I need in a nice, black case!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it because these things will inevitably come in handy for something else down the road, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a Dr. Yadav worthy comedone tool.</li>
            <li> 5-6 inches long, so it is easily stored almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this item thinking it would totally work</li>
            <li> tried many other products and can not praise this one enough,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy a pore cloger just so you don&#x27;t infect other areas.</li>
            <li> Because of the thickness of some of the extractors, more than extreme pressure is needed to even try to get out blackheads.</li>
            <li> I like most of the extractors - but one of the sides extractors had very rough edges and looked unfinished.  </li>
            <li> I recently got a 50x lighted mirror and saw my pores in a whole new light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning though - your face will be puffy, red, and irritated for atleast 24 hours after a thorough clean out with this.  </li>
            <li> It did take me a little while to figure out how to make the tools work effectively, but I suppose that is just the learning curve with any new product.  </li>
            <li> High quality items for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> nothing special, but if this is what holds you back from buying a product, I&#x27;d reconsider.  </li>
            <li> However, i quickly realized I only really needed that 1 tool with the wire loop.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I am very glad I now have it because it will help me with stubborn pimples in the future.</li>
            <li> My husband and I live this product!</li>
            <li> all still looks like new!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and who really love this kit!it help remove black heads without leavin&lt;br /&gt;small pore holes in her skin</li>
            <li> Was able to remove several stubborn blackheads from my back</li>
            <li> - chin and nose areas in particular.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the edges able to do the necessary work to put enough pressure to remove the comedome.</li>
            <li> This is a useful tool kit; however, most of the tool ends are too thick for precision blackhead removal.  </li>
            <li> It only leaves a mark on my face for a moment, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m left wanting are better instructions.  </li>
            <li> I recommend exfoliating or steaming your pores prior to using these for maximum effectiveness and to avoid potentially damaging your skin by having to apply more pressure.</li>
            <li> The effort needed isn&#x27;t worth it compared to using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;However, works really well for the larger ones!</li>
            <li> main problem?</li>
            <li> There are NO directions with these, aside from a quick rundown on the box, which honestly is not nearly enough.</li>
            <li> particular set by Equinox comes with 5 separate instruments in a durable leather-like zipper case.</li>
            <li> how and when you would use all of the different options, but the one I have been using has worked very well, and is worth the purchase price by itself.</li>
            <li> Many different options in this packet, which applies to various usage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have obscenely large black heads and this just doesn&#x27;t work great on the little ones.</li>
            <li> Really well made and very professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a super high quality luxury set, but it is more than sufficient for me.</li>
            <li> Only used one of the tools so far and learning to use the rest but very useful.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> These tools are high quality metal.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dd who just finish high school</li>
            <li> The tools are made from high quality materials that won&#x27;t tarnish or break on you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Tools are not as high quality as &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; or the like.  </li>
            <li> High quality kit 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend cleaning any of the strips left-behind adhesive residue with warm/hot water before using this kit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tools to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> High quality instruments they are not.</li>
            <li> Highly discourage this purchase.</li>
            <li> Whiteheads have always been a problem in my life since high school</li>
            <li> Highly recommend seller.</li>
            <li> High quality and does what it should.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both the seller and the product.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are high quality.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> The cute little storage case it comes in is approx.</li>
            <li> Not sure I need all the tools in this kit, but it is perfect for extracting the hard to eliminate white/black heads.</li>
            <li> Maybe I had high expectations thinking it would be something simple and pain free, and maybe I&#x27;m not using it properly and don&#x27;t know very well the technic</li>
            <li> Wow it really works.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great way to save money by skipping  the expensive facials.</li>
            <li> This set is really helpful to get those blemishes gone early and often.</li>
            <li> My face looks so clear thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Something that I had not considered when I purchased the kit was just how useful it would be for those dreaded ingrown hairs from shaving or occasionally on the legs.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t bend under normal use.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more for stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a useful kit for the arsenal of beauty products necessary for maintaining blemish-free skin.  </li>
            <li> I received this kit a few days ago and am very pleased with my purchase; definitely 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I normally use tweezers and grabbed them thinking i might need them with this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it, in the case of this acne treatment kit, I needed to watch quite a few videos on youtube, but once I got it down, my face has been looking great.</li>
            <li> My only con, which is very minor, is that the carrying case could be better made but that is nitpicking.  </li>
            <li> I am able to clear out my pores without damaging my skin like I did previously with my fingernails (</li>
            <li> I remember my mom buying a tool similar to one of these, but it was fragile an broke easily.</li>
            <li> my daughter was very excited of the results she got in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease.</li>
            <li> Get the RIGHT tools and get your confidence back, today!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it&#x27;s great, but, the other ones are.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably the one that looks the least useful and the roughest, compared to all the others, but the rest look like fine quality, sturdy tools.</li>
            <li> So, my advice-- if you need a complete set this is good, if you just need something basic, like a small pimple/blackhead remover, I&#x27;d keep looking and buy something else.</li>
            <li> A new design is needed for the case; I would have given them a five star review if this hadn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look shines and new like the others; instead, it looked like it was burned, never polished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves less marks</li>
            <li> the only way to really get blackheads out is to really dig the tool into your skin and risk leaving scars..</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know if where the impression sits, damage is being done underneath while the main attraction is being fixed....</li>
            <li> looks as strong as the Tweezerman extractor and costs much less.  </li>
            <li> I love this little set!</li>
            <li> We have been through many &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools over the years and none have served us as well as this efficient little kit!</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all and really works.</li>
            <li> and they arrived looking very old.</li>
            <li> Very complete box.</li>
            <li> The tools look very professional, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use them.</li>
            <li> Very professional looking kit.</li>
            <li> I really only use 1 tool from this, but it works pretty well....</li>
            <li> This is my second set first I use for its purpose, which is not often at all thank goodness</li>
            <li> , you have to place a hot washcloth over the area for 4-6 min to open up the pores.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> the nose does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> Before I was offered a set to evaluate and review, I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were comedone extractors sold to the public.</li>
            <li> Overall this is the first type of purchase, so</li>
            <li> in some cases even better for small pimples and blackheads) for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> He was not able to remove blackheads and whiteheads with them at all, maybe one or two with a lot of effort that seemed to cause even more damage to his skin than squeezing.</li>
            <li> especially since they work, really well!  </li>
            <li> It does remove blackheads, but if you&#x27;re not careful, you can really damage your face.</li>
            <li> With a little experimentation they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> I find that only 1 of the tools (the small loop) works effectively for me.</li>
            <li> For the nose, a bit more force is usually needed than elsewhere on the face if you want to really get everything out, which may still cause some redness / swelling or pain shortly after.  </li>
            <li> The kit has many black head remover instruments to choose from, and priced well compared to the same product.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and the tools are similar if not the same as what professionals use.</li>
            <li> Only ever use the lancing tool and the large loop.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about some pieces being missing in some people&#x27;s kits but decided to risk it simply based on the fact that all comments mentioned that they had been able to easily request a replacement or missing pieces.</li>
            <li> Thought this would make it easier for teenager and pre teen to remove large blackheads that are causing scarring when removed the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Love how little effort it takes to pop white heads/ blackheads compared to using fingers and nails.</li>
            <li> I love to see companies that take a little extra step to ensure their products meet customer expectations.</li>
            <li> The tools are mostly the same with little variation.</li>
            <li> The other tools don&#x27;t seem super helpful, but may do the trick if you have severe acne.</li>
            <li> Normally, the eliminated target would have a fairly high risk of scabbing because of &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; bleeding relative to the wound.</li>
            <li> This honestly led to a bunch of tiny little red circles on my face which went away in about an hour.  </li>
            <li> it clearly states it&#x27;s supposed to come with 5.</li>
            <li> My face looked so amazingly clear</li>
            <li> I had mostly clear sink in my teens</li>
            <li> Took two attempts to get all the way clear</li>
            <li> Works great only need cream or something to reduce the amount of pressure needed for the difficult ones</li>
            <li> Then, after using the kit, it is recommended that you then use pore-closing agents / cleaners to reduce the chances of the now clear pores being clogged again.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackhead issues with otherwise clear skin, and I have tried a ton of options for removing them (Creams, those things you stick on your face and rip off, exfoliation to the point of almost torture... )</li>
            <li> it helps clear up</li>
            <li> I wish I could find clear instructions anywhere at all about WHICH of these tools to use on what...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t found anything as yet, that clearly demonstrates how to use each of the 5 tools included.</li>
            <li> Extracts blackheads very well and as gently as possible.</li>
            <li> These are professional, and quality tools.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for the black/ white heads!</li>
            <li> If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions.</li>
            <li> So far, they have worked well, and I anticipate they will continue to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My opinion remains unbiased and is based solely on my experience thus far with the product.</li>
            <li> Complete set.</li>
            <li> Professional grade tools that are well contained in leather carrying case.</li>
            <li> It far surpasses the description it was given by the seller.</li>
            <li> A complete kit of sturdy instruments.</li>
            <li> Had I used this on a client&#x27;s face they could have developed an infection.</li>
            <li> As far as advice goes for using these tools ensure you are using the correct technique, there are instructional materials and videos you can find online that will be of use.</li>
            <li> As of now the remaining blackheads are only visible at a very close distance.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and much safer way of maintaining your skin than squeezing and marking up your face.</li>
            <li> There is a case that comes with the tools, which works well except for the zipper--it is one continuous zipper and can&#x27;t close completely on one end, which allows some of the tools to slip out of the case.  </li>
            <li> I have deep pores on my nose and chin, and these extracting tools work very well in clearing out those stubborn blackheads that won&#x27;t come out with cleaning, scrubbing and masking.  </li>
            <li> The tools are very sturdy and look like they would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I must have for teens and young adults.</li>
            <li> : you really need a smaller tool for the blackheads on your nose, but you can make this work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the comedone is expressed notice the pulling (scraping) movement the doc uses so that it is completely removed.</li>
            <li> These issues can be fixed with both a Google search or Youtube search, but I would like to not need these as a matter of convenience.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked out well</li>
            <li> Completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Professional quality with helpful information included.</li>
            <li> This is a professional quality kit.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not destroying my face trying to get at a zit.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality</li>
            <li> So far no problems.  </li>
            <li> and I would nearly spend every day trying to remove them from my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Professional looking and feel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me because I guess the blackheads on my nose aren&#x27;t that big...</li>
            <li> Got it for my teenage son and he is amazed at how it really works.</li>
            <li> So far, this kit has taken care of problems 100% of the time.</li>
            <li> Does not work like the old school one I had in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use each piece properly, but it really does work...</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> cause I gave it to my 6 year old to play doctor on her dolls...</li>
            <li> These things are the furthest thing from professional.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at all the tool options in the kit.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of this kit considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my old tools.</li>
            <li> and I did not use my tweezers at all which was unexpected.</li>
            <li> The Equinox Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit - 5 Professional Surgical Instruments arrived 2 days after I placed the order.</li>
            <li> Now I am no longer so self conscious about the blackheads/lack of.</li>
            <li> These are tools dermatologists use and should be handled professionally and with an educated hand.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and made of top notch material this product should last for years barring its use as a tool for which it wasn&#x27;t intended.</li>
            <li> The set is ok for the price however after using these a few times I&#x27;m back to square one.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical of the quality of these extractors but decided to give it a try since the reviews seem promising.  </li>
            <li> Looks good but its useless.</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying, but okay for the price point.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package, a long, black, wavy hair was embedded in the zipper of the tool case, as well as touching the tools.</li>
            <li> Wash the tools off with hot water and soap, then dry.  </li>
            <li> Evidently this is a common problem for some that&#x27;s been solved for many, yet I won&#x27;t be one of those people that gets to complete their set.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a product that does what it needs to if performed with careful hands, but an incomplete product that continues to be sent around shouldn&#x27;t be acceptable.</li>
            <li> While I am not a medical professional or cosmetologist, I have used many different medical instruments to help in various home repair projects, jewelry making, and crafts projects, so I feel I am qualified to make such a statement.</li>
            <li> How big or small can a blackhead get that you needs that many sizes</li>
            <li> I mainly just use the tools for individual blemishes when they pop up.</li>
            <li> I find some of them a complete waste, but it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> Hence, the reason I only use mainly one.</li>
            <li> It quickly and painlessly clears black heads with no scarring.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> This kit has allowed me to properly manage the blemishes on my face without having to deal with the usual issues that came with pinching, including redness, bleeding and scabbing, swelling or irritation of skin after pinching, and has ultimately been a very satisfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it; in fact I recently got another set for my friend.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many different facial products but have had no success!</li>
            <li> The instrument usage is not easy to figure out and honestly i find running the length of a needle, not the pointed end, down</li>
            <li> The metal appears to be cheaper drop forge steel, but it doesn&#x27;t really need to be surgical grade or anything as long as you keep them sanitary.</li>
            <li> In medical training we learned that the comedone extractor is used because they effectively remove the problem with the least possible damage to surrounding tissue, thus speeds healing and reduces and/or eliminates scaring, irritation and inflammation.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and is exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I had a generic 2-sided blackhead tool I&#x27;ve been using for a while, but I kept having red splotches left on my skin since that particular tool wasn&#x27;t adequate for getting blackheads out of different areas with different thickness and pore</li>
            <li> Since this is something you use on your face, I figured the company would be a little bit more careful about the sterilization and packaging  procedures.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the one tool with the tiny spike at the end, just precise enough to make a little prick into the skin, then I was able to use one of the tools to slowly and evenly push out all the &amp;#34;white stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;surgical grade&amp;#34; extractor, which claims to be brand new, was rusted/eroded in several places.</li>
            <li> arrived brand new with steel plating chipped and peeling back .</li>
            <li> Despite all user-based instructions and time-learned techniques suggesting to clear the blemish / wound until there is some visible blood to completely clear it; I have also found that after using this kit instead of my fingers has led to a massive decrease in the chance of scabbing.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times on some more troubled areas and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> its just not what I expected, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is really good high quality and sterile tools.</li>
            <li> My major problem areas are around my nose and chin; however, after just one use, I can see and feel a noticeable difference in my skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li> It should be used as a secondary tool when compared to normal cleaners and should be used with warm/hot and cold water for best effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to remove that sucker!</li>
            <li> Note that all the loops are rounded and not sharp.</li>
            <li> Favorite application for it has to be the easy and relieving removal of painful blemishes that can appear suddenly.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use a thumbtack to clean out the openings, but besides that, all is well.</li>
            <li> Updated 2/24/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating my rating because a representative from Equinox immediately shipped a second kit, as the original set that I received was missing tools.</li>
            <li> Black case is cheap and stinky and the tools rust if you don&#x27;t fully dry off.</li>
            <li> None of them are polished smooth, and as a result these instruments damage the delicate tissues of the face.</li>
            <li> There is a general idea of each tool but being an engineer I would like to know the specifics to ensure I maximize what the tool was designed for.</li>
            <li> cause it is less likely to give you infections if you clean it properly, than just popping your pimples with your fingers.</li>
            <li> They come in a case that is small enough to fit just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a must have and clear your skin.</li>
            <li> Product worked as expected really appreciated the price.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li> Three actually look professional.</li>
            <li> and I so far I&#x27;ve only had to use 2 out of the 5 tools in the case for my acne prone, pimple spread skin.</li>
            <li> Quality products l, my wife is a medical professional and she raves about this set.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful and be gentle.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived fast, packaged well and quality as expected.</li>
            <li> but some people might be surprised to open up the holder and find the tools all over the bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase if I was a professional.</li>
            <li> and you barely have to push an compared to my fingers trying to push my pimples out</li>
            <li> Would have spent the same for 1 higher quality tool.</li>
            <li> It made them worse and it seemed like I was getting more of them.</li>
            <li> Did not find this to be useful in any way, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had contacted support and they offered a full refund, but I simply wanted that tool that was missing to be shipped over.</li>
            <li> OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> I love the little black travel case that comes with all the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from that I have had other blackhead remover tools in the past and they just felt sturdier and worked better.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for personal or professional use!  </li>
            <li> An aside, this mask really made my skin feel tight and clear and the acne that was already on my skin felt tighter and</li>
            <li> really trust to use this on my face due to the condition it came in.</li>
            <li> Depending on your skin type you may find that you will need to use these tools weekly, monthly or even every couple of days in my case, the key is to be consistent about it as a regimen is key to keeping blackheads at bay and the longer you leave them the harder they will be to remove.</li>
            <li> the kit enables a much larger range of action then tools that can be bought individually.</li>
            <li> I actually expected the whole case to be larger</li>
            <li> This scabbing would often lead to picking for many people, even unintentionally, only making the issue worse.</li>
            <li> What a fun little gadget!</li>
            <li> Wow these little hooks and scrapers really, get into the pores, clears up your pores in a matter of minutes simply amazing,I don&#x27;t feel self consce as before</li>
            <li> Gently use a diabetic lancet to start, as it has a tiny sharp blade, which doesn&#x27;t leave scarring.</li>
            <li> I will never again attempt to remove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands.</li>
            <li> Many times, the spot that is healing could potentially look worse than if left alone.  </li>
            <li> You should go on YouTube first and look at a few videos on how to use these.</li>
            <li> After first receiving this product, it took a few days to get used to using it.  </li>
            <li> However, the first time it arrived, it was missing one tool.</li>
            <li> Common sense says open your pores and keep the tools clean.</li>
            <li> Each tool works as expected and I highly recommend this to all my friends that are constantly trying to attack the blackheads and zits they have.</li>
            <li> so much easier and less painfull than using two fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super confusing to learn how to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She simply places the desired tool end over her blemish and pushes down, or move the tool in a gentle sweeping motion</li>
            <li> As with other reviewers, it does leave a an impression for a while, and this is normal.  </li>
            <li> However, the ridged handles are easy to grip and slow and careful manipulation will get you the results you want.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really understand all the different sizes or the very scary thing that looks like a weapon, but I was able to use one instrument to remove ALL the blackheads on my face and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just pushing it all back in and causing bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of using this properly to remove black heads, slowly I&#x27;m getting better at it.</li>
            <li> As for personal opinion, each tool has some weight to it, which gives the impression of being sturdy (I like the weight, not too much.. not too little).  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have dark red finger marks from picking, and the little mark the tool makes is gone fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> By using these tools I no longer make a small pimple into a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> I attempted with very little success to clear pores on my nose and using these tools were too painful for me to consider doing it more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few issue I&#x27;ve had on my face, specifically one particularly stubborn blackhead that had been present for quite a while.</li>
            <li> : the zipper on the pouch is bad, the metal is even worse: while the metal loops are great, the one-piece one developed a crack right under the head, making it impossible to use - any more pressure and the ring just snaps off leaving a ragged edge.</li>
            <li> However, I did put up with some dramatic sound effects from him in the process (what a baby).</li>
            <li> Not sure if you really need all those instruments because I only use one.</li>
            <li> This kit allows one to gently remove occasional blackheads and small cysts without inflicting permanent damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> It is definitely going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of blemish removers to choose from as well, allowing for easy removal of blackheads and other nasty blemishes of different sizes and placements on the skin.</li>
            <li> Cost is far less than buying the tools individually - assuming you can even find them.</li>
            <li> Using them was a piece of cake and it easily cleared out stubborn blackheads and gently took care of some painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li> It has some rusty spots and it&#x27;s case was not clean didn&#x27;t seem new</li>
            <li> Maybe I used it too excessively or my pimples just weren&#x27;t ready to pop</li>
            <li> Not really a useful tool unless you want it for the professional look.</li>
            <li> comes with 5 different sizes for all different kind of blackhead an blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t painful at all</li>
            <li> the flat loops for pimples.</li>
            <li> I must have left them in the alcohol too long</li>
            <li> I guess this will be long lasting buy.</li>
            <li> I will put the short version or &amp;#34;tl;dr&amp;#34; (too long; didn&#x27;t read)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to actually use a tool to remove blackheads, instead of the alternative...</li>
            <li> While I did try one of the instruments, it left a red indentation that made me think I wasn&#x27;t using the proper size or something, so I ceased until I could You-Tube or some other such instructive video, to insure I didn&#x27;t damage surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li> It was brand new and came in a neat little package.</li>
            <li> I applied hot towel for couple minutes to prepare pores and both white and black heads came out with little pressure.  </li>
            <li> This kit is very nice ,it is easier than heavy scrubbing and other irritating means of removing the little blackheads before they get out of hand.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is sliding the tools back into the small elastic bands that secure them in the case.</li>
            <li> It is not easily seen in the thumbnail picture, but it is the black part extending to the right</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve got an email every second day since I brought the stupid thing from the company asking for good feedback...</li>
            <li> Same tool in 5 different sizes expected 2.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;just be careful when using it, and maybe watch a few tutorials on how to use it, but it works really</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to where I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face breaking out, but I did have numerous small blackheads around my nose until I used the Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is if you don&#x27;t first learn how to use them properly, you can just make it worse.</li>
            <li> Her skin looks so clear in as little as a week</li>
            <li> I bought these after becoming frustrated with my 30 year old acne.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m inclined to believe they were fake brought upon by getting the product for free.</li>
            <li> The cheapest and most recommended pore-closer being cold water.  </li>
            <li> This may sound weird, but I got it as a gift for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Thus far I have only used one of the extractors as I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> The edges on some of the tools are a bit rough, but overall we are using this set for my boys&#x27; acne.  </li>
            <li> am not a professional.</li>
            <li> The lack of providing this information, while somewhat minor, is what made me knock off a star (can&#x27;t do 4 1/2).  </li>
            <li> , the only thing I can say is just to be careful and know when to use the tools.</li>
            <li> and I know it will be with me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe my grandson just doesn&#x27;t know how to use them properly but they didn&#x27;t do what he expected.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep up on cleaning it before and after each use, there should not be any issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far with no issue.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My eyes were mostly closed then, so I only remember the one tool...</li>
            <li> these tools were all thicker and bulkier than I expected for facial tools.</li>
            <li> just ok.....does the job a couple long fingernails can do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheaply made and the metal is pretty heavy duty.</li>
            <li> all of the tools werent in their slots in the case but it wasnt a big deal, also the zipper seems to be a bit hard to zip but other than that this is a very high quality set.</li>
            <li> The other tools seem to be of decent quality, just agitated that 1 item is missing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the double-ended round loop tool is too deep/thick and therefore less accurate.</li>
            <li> I would push and push on my face on every black head and white head I saw and it didn&#x27;t do anything except make my face really red and cause it to bleed.</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube DIY video and learned how to use the tools and remove black heads and white heads properly...</li>
            <li> I actually used this as soon as I got it because I had a big whitehead on my cheek, and I just had to use one of the tools and it instantly popped it, evenly and without any rough or harsh motions.  </li>
            <li> Sharp edges that actually cut the skin.  </li>
            <li> I havent use the middle one (with the sharp instrument on the end) as of yet.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product, but unfortunately this product did not work for me  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that I don&#x27;t have a need for some of the other ends.</li>
            <li> The kit does everything that it advertises and keeps your skin from swelling or having discoloration due to pinching, but also allows me to not have to &amp;#34;wait out&amp;#34; a pimple before going out in public.  </li>
            <li> We bought two kits, one for the wife the other for our teenage son.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this right before you go out or go some place, it will leave small circle impressions on your face for about 15 or 20 minutes, and it will  leave little  red dots where the  black head was extracted for about 1 to 2 days depending on your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I have already seen a 75% reduction in visible blackheads on my nose since using these every other day for a week and a half now, my case was quite severe as my nose was almost completely covered and the blackheads were visible at a medium distance.</li>
            <li> I get bumps that don&#x27;t go away and start out small until they are huge, and with this I can use the tool with the hole in it to push straight down and get the crap out while it&#x27;s small before they get to be huge blueberry sized bumps.</li>
            <li> I am also unfortunately able to use the tools to get at painful inner nose pimples.</li>
            <li> Wipe with alcohol and allow to dry again.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools seem unnecessary only one or two seem really functional</li>
            <li> I have a lot of small blackheads on my nose, and these tools are slightly too large to help me with them.</li>
            <li> there are enough tools in this kit to get those white and black head out of there!</li>
            <li> The carrying case is decent and has a small suede flap on the inside so the tools don&#x27;t rub against each other.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different about this kit, is they should include a little piece of paper with simple drawn photo instructions on how to PROPERLY use these tools, so as to not mess your skin up any worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a single tool go for almost the price of this kit.</li>
            <li> This little set really works, but it may take a few tries to get used to how to use them.</li>
            <li> It only had 4 tools, the center tool, the one with the sharp point was not included.  </li>
            <li> so I could have prevented past scars from popping incorrectly as my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Quality of tools is not great or consistent.</li>
            <li> My scars are slowly going away since I am no longer creating new ones with my fingers.</li>
            <li> A little careless especially when there is a bag with a special compartment for each tool.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> It has rough edges, just a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think these tools are produced in a consistent manner, hence the mixed reviews and a mediocre rating from me.</li>
            <li> If you’re a beginner or an amateur, these blemish and acne instruments may be more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Not only did it remove every black head I could find it cleared out ones</li>
            <li> But beware in the hands of your wife or significant other they will become addicted to them and chase you down for a chance to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; on you!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I was offered this product at no charge for testing and review purposes, so now I don’t have an excuse to use my hands, which is unhygienic, by the way, and could lead to scarring or infection due to bacterial spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers on here, I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> * 3) I am not sure if much can really be done (realistically) on the seller&#x27;s part, but the longest tool in the set has a poky end that sometimes likes to try and stick through the casing and could potentially cause issues by stabbing through something else in a travel bag or something.</li>
            <li> (Duh[?]) and to open your pores again because they likely closed while waiting for the strips to dry.  </li>
            <li> Tools were a little too big for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am one of those women that constantly picks at her face, any little blackhead or pimple that I get I have to pop.</li>
            <li> a little smaller after she rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> The reason I include the entire regimen is that I&#x27;m a little concerned that if you change any of the steps, it may not work as well.</li>
            <li> took a little getting used to, actually had to look up youtube videos because the instructions werent too helpful..</li>
            <li> The lancing tool is not sharp, not sure how it is supposed to &amp;#34;lance&amp;#34; anything.</li>
            <li> thwy need a little help getting back in.</li>
            <li> the sharp tool is sharp enough to pop a blister or help you get to a splinter, but for excising milia, I found it is not fine or sharp enough, and still had to use a syringe needle.  </li>
            <li> Great kit but terrible for acne.</li>
            <li> It feels so great to get those nasty blackheads out.</li>
            <li> I initially posted a negative comment regarding this item as I had only received 4/5 tools.</li>
            <li> Be a bit careful</li>
            <li> They should be cleaned thoroughly and dried before putting them back in the case to lessen the chance of bacterial infections.  </li>
            <li> I expected 5 as described in the description.</li>
            <li> Place the loop over the blackhead so the blackhead in the center of the loop.</li>
            <li> Then, while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead.</li>
            <li> I had a similar extractor that I bought from Walmart a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Have rough edges</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re left wondering how to use a few of the tools.  </li>
            <li> Well it was not as expected.  </li>
            <li> The tools don&#x27;t work as well as expected...</li>
            <li> One of the pieces was missing, so there were only 4 instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I have personally recommended this to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> Not really the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> There are some rough edges in the metal work...</li>
            <li> As expected for the price.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The tool in the middle (in the current thumbnail / image) has an end that is shaped like a small soup spoon with a hole in the middle that, in combination with tweezers (usually, but not always needed), made getting</li>
            <li> she said she&#x27;s been having trouble with some white heads</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> Came with tools missing, only received 4</li>
            <li> Be careful...</li>
            <li> Waste of money, returned it back.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend if you have trouble with large/clogged pores.</li>
            <li> The remaining spots were totally empty.</li>
            <li> Qualityon par with  what I expected for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned missing pieces.  </li>
            <li> The one shown in the middle has a tiny hole on one end and a dull, arrow shaped point on the other end.  </li>
            <li> but if all 5 sticks none are just plain and simple...</li>
            <li> They did send a half page digital instruction sheet (the other half of the page was instructions for how to leave a review)</li>
            <li> This thing helps me be a little less gross.</li>
            <li> So I had a few black heads and a lot of white heads on my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> Like other readers I would have preferred some printed instructions but there are some videos on you tube.</li>
            <li> all other times it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li> I lost my other blackhead remover</li>
            <li> I used it on my boyfriend the other day on a problem pimple</li>
            <li> The piercer tool isn&#x27;t that sharp</li>
            <li> Two have sharp metal/bad cuts.</li>
            <li> Need instruction on how to use the other tools.</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to but feel extremely fake.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> One&#x27;s kinda sharp though.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how the other 4 hold up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers complain about how sharp these instruments are.</li>
            <li> They work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I can understand though where they might not do this in order to avoid issues with sterilization &amp;#34;not working&amp;#34; or some other liability issue though.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who frequently shaves his face and head, also suffers from ingrowns, so he uses this set frequently and loves it as well!</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are quite sharp, too.</li>
            <li> These tools are SHARP and if you don&#x27;t use them correctly, you WILL hurt yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re metal, sharp, and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> I needed the other tools too.</li>
            <li> used the small double hole tool</li>
            <li> No way you will misplace this like I had with my other extractor.</li>
            <li> As a result, I did not exactly get what I wanted out of this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had any luck with the other pieces &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would pay twice what they are asking for a replacement, I wish they gave clearer instructions on the sizes but other than that I am sold.</li>
            <li> I tried to use on three different areas of the body, even after steaming, and was not able to extract anything.</li>
            <li> I wish the sharp tool was a bit sharper, but it will do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also held up extremely well - the tools, the case, the elastic tool holders, etc.</li>
            <li> Honestly, other companies should follow their example of customer service.</li>
            <li> I thought it would perform better than it does. :(</li>
            <li> be careful, applying pressure to my face in order to remove left hickey type bruises, i probably look worse than if i just left the blackhead</li>
            <li> Using this kit, with other skin care products has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> It should be me (and probably a lot of other people too)</li>
            <li> Not only did I bruise more, the product cut my skin leaving my skin looking sickly!</li>
            <li> This kit works b-e-a-utifully for the pimples or zits that can sometimes appear near points of lots of movement (lips, right below nose, etc) that are normally very painful if left alone.</li>
            <li> It has all the tools you will need and I especially like, since I am not experienced, the instruction sheet and helpful hints that Equinox e-mailed me later.  </li>
            <li> The tools were not clean and unknown debris and hair is inside the case.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with popping pimples and blackheads, and I seriously never knew this existed!</li>
            <li> I am very dilligent with my skin care process, but I have large pores that collect that awful white oil after a day.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest to anyone who suffers from acne and simply can&#x27;t &amp;#34;leave it alone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I Have clusters of tiny blackheads beside my eyes and had tried everything from micro bead facewash, to special exfoliating brushes to those stupid blackhead removing strips.</li>
            <li> Not worth it...</li>
            <li> I cleared out the pore entirely with the tools, took care of the open pore with cold water, a tiny bit of alcohol, and some Neosporin.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth five</li>
            <li> Not really worth the price or time.</li>
            <li> Kit is missing the tool with the pointed tip that is shown int he center of the product picture.</li>
            <li> The tools are rough, and not smooth...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all pretty painful to press down with it, especially around my nose area.</li>
            <li> i have impossible blackheads that this took right out!</li>
            <li> Even drew blood when I pressed it down on my blemish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t work it will be a let down.</li>
            <li> This little kit is extremely helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, I attempted to replace my broken extractor by going to WalMart, and Target, but the only extractors they sell now are a single extractor from Tweezerman that sells for $14.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought a few other face-care products online</li>
            <li> Not what my dermatologist uses - one is very sharp.</li>
            <li> Too bad it looks good but is useless.</li>
            <li> The advantage of this set is less tissue damage and redness.</li>
            <li> I tried to get a black head out with one of the tools though</li>
            <li> I had a black head I could not get out for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help get rid of black heads that show up from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These tools are invaluable and so much less damaging than using your fingers/fingernails.</li>
            <li> Even after soaking and scrubbing with alcohol, I&#x27;d have black residue on my hands after handling the tools.</li>
            <li> I knew I shouldn&#x27;t mess with pimples</li>
            <li> I made a mess of my face.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and now my wife is going crazy with it.</li>
            <li> Overall this set has helped me get rid of painful pimples before they turn into giant red monsters that take over my face.</li>
            <li> Watch videos or read first before doing anything crazy.</li>
            <li> The case leaves a small hole on end when it is closed</li>
            <li> The only piece missing would be a very small lancet.</li>
            <li> don’t waste your time looking at any other brands online!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sorry to say but these tools don&#x27;t appear to be new</li>
            <li> Nifty little kit.</li>
            <li> It peels off in sheets with the little friction from fingernails or tissues over my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little bit of elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> this is probably overkill for little blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are a little well made than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little hesitant to try this product.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be little wood flakes inside of it.</li>
            <li> The poker thing worked a little too well for me</li>
            <li> just little bumps.</li>
            <li> A little temporary redness was all that remained.</li>
            <li> If not carefully this product will make new scars, as it did on me:-(</li>
            <li> The next time I ever get another irritating black head</li>
            <li> This is saved me a lot of time and prevented a lot of (figurative) hair-pulling by making (literal) hair-pulling very simple by isolating the (evil and hateful) hair or damaged follicle and presenting it as an easy target for tweezers (or fingers if you are feeling like Tom Hank&#x27;s Castaway).  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived, it only came with 4 instruments even tough</li>
            <li> The only downside is that some of the tools, the loop is very thick.</li>
            <li> Dull and rough machining.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m careful with how I use these, but anyone who says their skin was bothered by these probably isn&#x27;t using them with cautious pressure, failed to sterilize the tools with rubbing alcohol or didn&#x27;t steam open their pores before using these</li>
            <li> The tools are sturdy and not cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> The kit arrived as show except that one piece was missing.  </li>
            <li> I found the link on YouTube and watched a few videos of people using tools like them to get blackheads and blemishes out.</li>
            <li> Tools are as described, none were missing in mine as some reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few Youtube videos out there, but if you&#x27;re squeamish, you may be grossed</li>
            <li> I got my order in the mail today and it&#x27;s missing 2 of the pieces??</li>
            <li> I use just a few of the pieces.</li>
            <li> For those who posted it did not come with all the tools, it&#x27;s because case is poorly made and they constantly fall out.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I hoped for, a few of the tools are a bit redundant.</li>
            <li> My set was missing one of the tools.</li>
            <li> It has been  virtually useless so far.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really missing is instructions and Q&amp;As.</li>
            <li> Package came missing parts</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Missing 3 of the 5 instruments.</li>
            <li> came missing one tool and the tools didnt even work</li>
            <li> They are made with sturdy metal and they are not cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Product arrived missing a piece.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the elastic loops holding each tool in the case are not very tight, so the tools tend to slip out if you hold the base upright while open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a black head problem for years!</li>
            <li> some of the other negative reviews, I was shipped a case with the tools missing.</li>
            <li> The edges are too sharp and/or too thick and either cuts into the skin.</li>
            <li> Poor quality instruments and not a good idea to anywhere near your skin.</li>
            <li> 😳 Not Cool!</li>
            <li> As yet another (somewhat gross) bonus it allows me to indulge in the guilty pleasure of popping and removing the zits on my face that would normally have to be done with my fingers (if it were required, like in cases of being painful or uncomfortable) and would only serve to further aggravate my skin / pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually much easier and MUCH less painful than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> Pretty painful, but it works wonders.</li>
            <li> had to push so hard to extract anything, it left indentions WAY worse than even my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> and I feel anxious to use them on my face, even after sterilizing them after each use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but knew my dermatologist had used similar tools on me when I was there for an office visit</li>
            <li> As someone who still suffers from acne well into my adult life, I am littered with scars.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not top quality metal.</li>
            <li> These tools will let you drain your pores of excessive sebum and take care of problematic blisters that exfoliating cleansers can&#x27;t seem to reduce.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else I could ask out of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I need instructions or if these just look good.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> No more pinching.</li>
            <li> small warning</li>
            <li> There are several tools to help in difficult to reach areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  case is small fits anywhere</li>
            <li> I requested a replacement and this time, two tools were missing!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t develop those small pore infections.</li>
            <li> Don’t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It appears that because my skin is so oily on my nose that the blackheads will return soon :/</li>
            <li> but this is one of a very few that is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> These tools are so poorly made that some  have sharp edges you can see and feel with your hand.</li>
            <li> They do sometimes leave behind a little mark on your skin from pressing but after a few minutes the mark goes away.</li>
            <li> Or worse yet, leave giant gouges around the blemish, leaving it looking worse than it did as just an irritated pimple.</li>
            <li> Whenever I would try to use the tools it only made my blemishes worse by irritating them and making indents in my skin.</li>
            <li> no good for my little problem.</li>
            <li> not very good quality.</li>
            <li> make things go wrong in the long run?</li>
            <li> Be careful not to push to hard, you don&#x27;t wanna scrape your skin off and leave scabs!!</li>
            <li> My toddler suffers from the virus molluscum, which produces small white knots on his body.</li>
            <li> The black case they come in is not great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard or the tools will leave marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and some of the tools look rusted.</li>
            <li> For those who read my reviews, you know that I never or hardly ever give 4 stars to any product.</li>
            <li> I still have hard time.</li>
            <li> It was hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I received this kit to use personally for those stubborn blackheads &amp; my fiance’ receives those terrible solar comedones that you just cannot seem to remove completely!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting any results.</li>
            <li> I bought this to deal with blackheads on nose and hard to squeeze places.</li>
            <li> Hard to find anything like this is store.</li>
            <li> the tools are a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t work well unless pressing hard on the spot.</li>
            <li> but will leave your skin crazy red ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but it seemed like a common sense type of thing</li>
            <li> but I  can at least assure anyone reading this review that they worked with me.  </li>
            <li> I can see tiny hair and dirty stuff on one of them.</li>
            <li> It leaves negative impressions on your skin, sometimes even causing burst blood vessels.</li>
            <li> I did think the end of the tools was rather thick, I thought it would be thinner, and that would make it somewhat easier to see the blackhead.</li>
            <li> The tools are too thick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too thick and bulky to work.</li>
            <li> Two tools were missing, and another was quite poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Came with an implement missing and interior was dusty</li>
            <li> The extraction tools have too thick of metal for the extraction tip.  </li>
            <li> A thing to note is that if you only buy this product because you watch black head popping videos on YouTube you&#x27;re going to be greatly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> it would mean a lot to me if you gave me a&lt;br /&gt;thumbs up.  </li>
            <li> I mean... how can there not be any instructions.</li>
            <li> I mean come on.</li>
            <li> hopefully, scars are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are a little difficult to use, but once you get the hang of it, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> one particularly bad one on his back just grew until it had to be surgically excised.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from bad break outs constantly.</li>
            <li> The big painful kinds.</li>
            <li> I bought this after being frustrated with a lesser quality tool (Tweezerman.)  </li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I basically got this because I had a big painful blackhead in my ear</li>
            <li> Deep seated blackheads are no longer a problem or painful to remove.  </li>
            <li> The blemishes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; without inflaming the surrounding skin and they dissapear within 24-48 hours rather than the week of raised red painful skin</li>
            <li> harsh and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize how painful it actually is</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bit easier and less painful than just using your fingers, but there is a lot of force and some frustration to it as well.</li>
            <li> It is less painful than someone digging into your skin with their nails, but it can leave a mark if you push to hard.</li>
            <li> Finally a way to take care of pimples and black heads without scratching your skin and making them look worst!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I would not recommend it because it made me break out even worse.</li>
            <li> (zipper doesn&#x27;t close so the tools fall out of it), and the quality of the tools is so poor that they are unusable.</li>
            <li> Just shows you how poor the quality of these are considering I&#x27;ve never had anything rust on me that I&#x27;ve soaked in alcohol</li>
            <li> I wish it came with an instruction manual for whats what or how to use it because I&#x27;m still confused.</li>
            <li> Instructions were poor</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Product is poorly made.</li>
            <li> For the those who don&#x27;t have time to be surfing the web or looking at a bunch of YouTube videos, this may be frustrating.</li>
            <li> Seriously wish I had this kit years ago!  </li>
            <li> Does the job, I would recommended practicing on small areas at a time before going crazy on your face.</li>
            <li> It does well enough, just really painful to use!</li>
            <li> I think it works but can be a little painful.</li>
            <li> It can be a little painful doing it</li>
            <li> Not ideal.</li>
            <li> Worst thing I have ever used on my face,  very cheap made and painful to use!  </li>
            <li> Someone is being very incompetent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m missing 3 of the 5 tools in this kit… disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get really hard to get, painful blackheads.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the YouTube videos that use extractors like this, and I swear,</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you are obsessed with popping things like I am.  </li>
            <li> Allows access to difficult areas.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong using these</li>
            <li> I was almost obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> I still have blackheads because I don&#x27;t want to scar up my face by doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Returned it because it failed my quality control inspection.</li>
            <li> I find these tools difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This item is useless, basically just wasting money.</li>
            <li> perhaps they were just very poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made tools.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality instruments.</li>
            <li> but it is very poor on the manufacturers part not to include any instructions.</li>
            <li> I have asked for a replacement - but very frustrating that this would happen at all.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to give negative feedback, but this item is really awful.</li>
            <li> I used it 1x week for a bit, and my face started peeling horribly, so I cut down on it.</li>
            <li> of the tools is especially hard on my face.</li>
            <li> 2 tools were missing, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> all&lt;br /&gt;manner of the nasty little things that build up beneath the surface</li>
            <li> the moment I got the dirty stuff out of my nose pore.</li>
            <li> Eliminate acne without painful picking and proding with the WRONG tools.</li>
            <li> Tools arrived dirty, case doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> when I received it the case was dirty on the inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tools came dirty.</li>
            <li> For the price you truly can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> ; I know how bad this is for your skin, and have been trying to make my skin healthier.</li>
            <li> Attached is a picture of the one with a bad cut.</li>
            <li> Package kinda smelled bad for a bit</li>
            <li> out the bad stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a bad problem with blackheads</li>
            <li> I have acne really bad</li>
            <li> My bad not the quality of the kit.</li>
            <li> Maybe you have to have REALLY bad issues for this to be beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of bruising myself when I have a blackhead/zit or making a scar.</li>
            <li> The blackhead remover can be painful.</li>
            <li> Like others said, using this set can be painful, but if you are popping pimples by squeezing them you already know about the pain.</li>
            <li> and this is why I got frustrated and just used my fingers instead,</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said it was a really painful</li>
            <li> Do take some time to read the instructions, or you might get frustrated.</li>
            <li> This can be slightly painful if you&#x27;ve never done it before;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend also thought it was really painful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> But when I opened it yesterday I was quite disappointed looking at the condition of the surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is a stupid piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t follow the directions about steaming, etc it can be a painful process!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Just awful!</li>
            <li> Awful --- came with 1 piece in it out of the 5.</li>
            <li> Humans are truly disgusting creatures.</li>
            <li> but these have gotten out years of nasty blackheads.</li>
            <li> It was nasty.  </li>
            <li> Nasty infections and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worst purchase experience!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had blackheads around my nose and because of my fear of using my nails and leaving scars they&#x27;ve been getting worst until now.</li>
            <li> I got it for those times some nasty shows up on my face.</li>
            <li> These are the worst!</li>
            <li> gets all of my nasty blackheads and pimples out.</li>
            <li> and I could never get all the crap out!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is great. But I&#x27;ve got an email every second day since I brought the stupid thing from the company asking for good feedback...</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!! Love how little effort it takes to pop white heads/ blackheads compared to using fingers and nails. Takes not even a minute to get a blackhead out compared to 5 to 10 minutes it takes when using your nails. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!! Before and after photos proved:)</li>
            <li> Extracts blackheads very well and as gently as possible. The differently sized loops make extraction easy. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These things really work well. Be a bit careful</li>
            <li> this works very well! when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease. so much easier and less painfull than using two fingers. and thats becasue it pusshes donw around the pimple rather than just squeezing the pimple up.</li>
            <li> The tools are sturdy and not cheaply made.  I like the carrying case also.  The tools work well and I like the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Everything was prefect not damaged looks sturdy I love it!</li>
            <li> surgical instruments look cheap along with the case and it as no instructions on how to use the instruments.</li>
            <li> Tools were a little too big for my skin. Shipment arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> A gift and my teenager really love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived ahead of schedule, product as described.</li>
            <li> Great tool set gives options for variety of blemishes the guide the vendor sends prior to receiving your set is helpful overall great buy for the price highly recommend</li>
            <li> I just received my kit and it arrived on time and as it was described</li>
            <li> The quality was not all there and they arrived looking very old.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of tools to work with to help get pores clean. Best to use with a facial steamer or after a hot shower and exfoliation. Don&#x27;t press too hard or the tools will leave marks on your skin. Tools are effective, durable and high quality but make sure you follow the directions to use them properly. Additional directions and tips for using these tools can be found on YouTube. I like to use these tools after Aztec Clay Mask or Cellbone Skin Prep (both available on Amazon) to get my pores so clean they&#x27;re nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> I do like this Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit because it can be sterilize after each use and it allows you to remove blackhead and blemishes without scarring your body if used properly.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> Great set!  Works percectly!</li>
            <li> My torture kit has arrived!  Bwahahahaa  I can really do my business with this kit.  It is all surgical quality and very nice.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised.  Looks like it should work out ok. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very effective--nice case and tools are of good quality. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are well-made and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would not recommend it because it made me break out even worse. I knew I shouldn&#x27;t mess with pimples but I thought using precise tools would allow me to clean out pimples so they can begin the healing process sooner. I was wrong. It made them worse and it seemed like I was getting more of them. The big painful kinds. Just awful! I sterilized the tools before and after every use and still ended up breaking out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how and when to use each one of the tools</li>
            <li> Absolutely what I wanted. Works great.</li>
            <li> WorKS but will leave your skin crazy red ... probably more for professionals</li>
            <li> I bought one tool that was 10 dollars (not this one) and I loved it.  This product is okay, but there are some non smooth parts where they shouldn&#x27;t be.  If you are looking for something wonderful, I would recommend something else. I am keeping it as some of the sized will be helpful.</li>
            <li> It got here extremely fast and the seller is very concerned that buyers are satisfied.  It appears to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I don&#x27;t have any doubts it will work.  Items are sturdily made.</li>
            <li> Nice Product works as needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping! !</li>
            <li> Just what they said it was, keep it clean and it works great! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great transaction. These are quality tools and do the job well! Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I had been looking for, for some time.  Good quality, good price.  Delivered quickly.  QUITE PLEASED.</li>
            <li> - Hello, being a professional aesthetician from Trinidad &amp; Tobago, I can say that this is an excellent set of tools...very good quality and gets the job done very well. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> All the tools you need to keep your skin in good condition. Solid build and quality case. Definable worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, much cheaper than those at Sephora and Ulta, and you get so many more tools!</li>
            <li> so so. some of tools could have had a smoother finish.</li>
            <li> The edges on some of the tools are a bit rough, but overall we are using this set for my boys&#x27; acne.  Great set for the price!</li>
            <li> The kit arrived as show except that one piece was missing.  It only had 4 tools, the center tool, the one with the sharp point was not included.  The other tools seem to be of decent quality, just agitated that 1 item is missing.</li>
            <li> This a great product for a very good price. Thanks Equinox.</li>
            <li> Just used it today to pop a whitehead that had been bothering. I&#x27;ve had to deal with moderate to severe acne my whole life so popping pimples are something I&#x27;ve been doing my whole life! (I know you&#x27;re not suppose to)  These tools made my life so much easier! Don&#x27;t forget to sterilize before use.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with instructions and there aren&#x27;t any good ones on the internet. I&#x27;m sure if I knew how to use it it would be great</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift but it looks like a nice sey</li>
            <li> The tools are well made but did not work well for me. There were no instructions so I had to google how to use these things. I feel that the loops on the tools are too large to be effective compared to the examples I found on google.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money.  Well-made, sturdy tools.</li>
            <li> Product came as described and was delivered ahead of the original scheduled time! Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Great on time love the product makes my job easier</li>
            <li> Nice quality and small enough to travel with. Good buy</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter! Its a winner!</li>
            <li> Works well with patience.  It works better if you steam your face first.  Be sure to poke a tiny hole in the blemish before you scrape it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Looks good but its useless.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this kit.  It has all the tools you will need and I especially like, since I am not experienced, the instruction sheet and helpful hints that Equinox e-mailed me later.  The tools work very well once you get  the hang of using them.  I am very impressed with Equinox&#x27;s customer service, as they did not just send the kit and be done with it.  They sent several follow up e-mails to make sure that I was happy with my purchase.  I would definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Exelentes implements, work very well.</li>
            <li> Came very fast, has a nice carry case,does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I recieved great tips on how to use the product in my email. I also just love the ease of use and variety of tools included in the one kit. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Awesome.. Works as advertised, Will make a great gift with substance and a definite high use item.</li>
            <li> Came on time and a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works very well</li>
            <li> Like other readers I would have preferred some printed instructions but there are some videos on you tube. I think the tool quality is just fine and the case is nice enough too.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d known a set like this existed before! With a little experimentation they are easy to use. High quality and easy to clean and maintain.  They should be cleaned thoroughly and dried before putting them back in the case to lessen the chance of bacterial infections.  A lifetime set.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great quality product!! All the tools needed to remove blemishes.</li>
            <li> Where are the directions? That would help a better review.</li>
            <li> A little careless especially when there is a bag with a special compartment for each tool.&lt;br /&gt;recommend buying each piece separately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit for such a great price. Use it as instructed and you will see the benefits without spending lots of money at dermatologists.</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve ever found! Everything about them is great. The quality, the case they come in. I&#x27;ve already soaked them in EPA hospital grade disinfectant and no issue with the quality or grade of metal. Would definitely buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent kit that works well too.  Instructions that were sent also helped as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this item thinking it would totally work but I watched the videos I saw the reviews the instructions and it does not work</li>
            <li> They needed to send instructions with how to properly use these tools. They don&#x27;t work well and I&#x27;m disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit specifically because it was stated that they were quality tools, and specifically for the comedone.  It&#x27;s crap.  Everything else is fairly standard fare that you can find in a local drug-store.  I&#x27;m keeping it because these things will inevitably come in handy for something else down the road, but I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a Dr. Yadav worthy comedone tool.</li>
            <li> Product worked as expected really appreciated the price.</li>
            <li> The tools aren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting but only because I&#x27;m comparing them to tools I&#x27;ve had in the past and have lost. I can tell they&#x27;re made from quality materials. I just haven&#x27;t mastered how to use them yet. They pretty much took off the top layer of my chin the first time I used them so after that all heals and goes away, I may try again...</li>
            <li> These tools are high quality metal. They work great. I never would have thought they would work so great. I found the link on YouTube and watched a few videos of people using tools like them to get blackheads and blemishes out. If you purchase these, I recommend you watching some doctors use theses tools on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Since I got this, I&#x27;ve been able to clean my skin without hurting myself and the case keeps it together. The only issue is if you don&#x27;t first learn how to use them properly, you can just make it worse. I don&#x27;t recommend kids be allowed to use it. Review add on june 11- one of the tools i use most broke off.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first try, got a cyst out that was there for 3 months probably, and all other times it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li> Great product and nice packaging</li>
            <li> I bought this after being frustrated with a lesser quality tool (Tweezerman.)  The blackhead remover and blemish tool work great.</li>
            <li> This is a very useful tool for removing blackheads and whiteheads.  My husband is prone to both and one particularly bad one on his back just grew until it had to be surgically excised.  So, this is a very cost-effective alternative, which lets you nip problems in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had blackhead extractors before which sort of work, but the variety in sizes offered here  is very handy, since one can try different instruments until the desired extraction occurs.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Make sure you steam the area your using it on first.  If you don&#x27;t it does not work like it should.</li>
            <li> I got this whole kit for about 30% more than I would have paid for just one tool at drug store.  Great product for excellent price. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Was able to remove several stubborn blackheads from my back</li>
            <li> As described.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, it only came with 4 instruments even tough it clearly states it&#x27;s supposed to come with 5.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. It leaves dents and marks on your face. Even drew blood when I pressed it down on my blemish.&lt;br /&gt;No thank you. The packaging was a 5 star though. Too bad it looks good but is useless.</li>
            <li> Only one piece of equipment. I expected 5 as described in the description. Very highly unprofessional.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Same tool in 5 different sizes expected 2.  How big or small can a blackhead get that you needs that many sizes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how this is any better than a bobby pin. I&#x27;m sure it will come in handy for the occasional stubborn blackhead, but I won&#x27;t make regular use of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product, arrived fast, and all the tools are in there. Took me a while to figure how to use them, but I was so happy the moment I got the dirty stuff out of my nose pore. recommended.</li>
            <li> It comes with several different tool for any acne issue.</li>
            <li> the kit enables a much larger range of action then tools that can be bought individually. - chin and nose areas in particular. my daughter was very excited of the results she got in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I lost my other blackhead remover so I am glad I found this. It is perfect.</li>
            <li> Its  very good, it use more  convenient and more health,  i like it</li>
            <li> I wish that this came with directions, and a description of each tool, but there are YouTube videos that are helpful. I am able to clear out my pores without damaging my skin like I did previously with my fingernails (gross, I know). I&#x27;m obsessed with the YouTube videos that use extractors like this, and I swear, my skin looks so much smoother and cleaner using these tools. They are high quality, and don&#x27;t feel cheaply made. I would definitely recommend purchasing this kit, especially if you have clogged pores like I tend to get on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Good quality, and easy storage. Also arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and some of the tools look rusted.</li>
            <li> I believe that the quality, price, shipping time, etc. is all 5 star. The only problem that I have with the product is that there are no directions or instructions for the proper use for each tool. I rated this product a 4 for that fact alone; I would rate this as an excellent product if they included instructions.</li>
            <li> These are high-quality tools.  However, there are no instructions for how to use them.  Would be much better if they came with comprehensive instructions.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;ve had a black head problem for years! This has really helped tremendously! Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> These are professional, and quality tools. There are many options to pick from, given what you&#x27;re trying to do. The item came packaged carefully and I was able to immediately use my blemish remover tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: would have loved a small guide or instructions, identifying the tools to be able to distinguish them from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a 5-star product though!</li>
            <li> I purchased the kit because of the multi tools in it. Perfect for any type of blackheads within reason of course. The instruments are well made and does the job. Highly recommend not to mention the nice soft vinyl pouch. Would appreciate it more if it&#x27;s soft genuine leather.</li>
            <li> Tools are as described, none were missing in mine as some reviews mentioned. You definitely need to steam the face before using, and not every teeny tiny blackhead will come out. It is less painful than someone digging into your skin with their nails, but it can leave a mark if you push to hard. I did think the end of the tools was rather thick, I thought it would be thinner, and that would make it somewhat easier to see the blackhead.</li>
            <li> Good to have, very helpful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t get it to work on my daughter&#x27;s blackheads only mine.  I can&#x27;t figure out all of the tools even after watching Youtube videos but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for the black/ white heads!</li>
            <li> Each of the tools are heavy duty and most feature a sort of rectangular metal body, which provides extra support so that you can&#x27;t easily bend the tools when using them These tools basically act like your finger, squeezing the junk out of the pour, but much more efficiently.  I AM ABSOLUTELY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE I MADE!!! BUY EQUINOX!!</li>
            <li> I love this kit.It is supposed to be for blackheads and such, but there is one tool in it that works great as an ear spoon for cleaning wax from ear canal.</li>
            <li> Works great once you learn how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few Youtube videos out there, but if you&#x27;re squeamish, you may be grossed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick, unofficial instructions:&lt;br /&gt;Sterilize everything before and after each use, the tools and your skins.&lt;br /&gt;Use the wire loop for blackheads. Place the loop over the blackhead so the blackhead in the center of the loop. Apply ample pressure downward into the skin. Then, while still applying pressure, slowly drag the loop over the blackhead. You may need to repeat this a couple times and apply more pressure. It may hurt a little.&lt;br /&gt;Use the flat loops for pimples. Same instructions as blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get all the liquids out of there until you start bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional. This is what I have learned, but it may not be right. These tool were made so you don&#x27;t damage yourself, but just in case, I take no responsibility if you somehow damage yourself. If unsure, watch the professional Youtube videos or ask your dermatologist for instructions.</li>
            <li> good product. Nice case.</li>
            <li> Great piece of kit ! A+++</li>
            <li> Great product, and very professional!</li>
            <li> AS ADVERTISED, THANKS !!!!!!</li>
            <li> - The Equinox Blemish Remover Kit is exactly what I needed. I have the occasional blackhead but my primary problem is Milia. The tools are a good size for me and the lancet is very sharp. I think the kit is well made. It&#x27;s all stainless steel and with 5 pieces, I&#x27;m sure it will meet all my future needs. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are a little difficult to use, but once you get the hang of it, it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I really  love my Equinox  Blackhead  Kit.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;nicely  packed in a smart looking  zippered&lt;br /&gt;case. The  comedon are organized  neatly&lt;br /&gt;and held in place with an elastic band. And&lt;br /&gt;it fits perfectly  in any of my pocketbooks.</li>
            <li> Nifty little kit. The various sized loops and tools are quite useful and effective on my various skin challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case and tools are sturdy and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look like they will last for many years! Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got my order in the mail today and it&#x27;s missing 2 of the pieces?? What am I supposed to do now? I paid for a 5 piece set...</li>
            <li> Solid and it arrived on time. Yes, I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and in great condition. Tools are sturdy</li>
            <li> Did not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> A nice selection of tools to remove all sorts of foul bits of myriad sizes embedded in your skin! Very Pleased!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the edges able to do the necessary work to put enough pressure to remove the comedome.</li>
            <li> Yup. These are pretty great.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and the company provides great follow up. This kit is a great value for the money and is a great tool to clean pores without creating scars.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!</li>
            <li> The kit does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Equinox is great at following up making sure you are satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a similar extractor that I bought from Walmart a few years ago.  It broke one day.  This looked like a great replacement and it had many more implements than the single extractor I purchased from Walmart.  By the way, I attempted to replace my broken extractor by going to WalMart, and Target, but the only extractors they sell now are a single extractor from Tweezerman that sells for $14.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks as strong as the Tweezerman extractor and costs much less.  So far, they have worked well, and I anticipate they will continue to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw several reviews that suggested the package might arrive without all five implements.  Mine arrived with all five.  I even received an email from the manufacturer prior to receiving the kit that specifically told me to make sure all five implements were included in the kit.  The email told me that if all five parts were not included, I should return it for a prompt replacement.  They even sent directions for how to use the implements safely and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a very nice case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> item was shipped promptly, quality is good and seller followed up on order to make sure everything is fine with the product. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Only ever use the lancing tool and the large loop.</li>
            <li> This is a useful tool kit; however, most of the tool ends are too thick for precision blackhead removal.  They still work for dealing with blemishes, but you&#x27;ll need to use more pressure and and more skillful angling of the tools.  They did send a half page digital instruction sheet (the other half of the page was instructions for how to leave a review) but something more detailed included with the product would have been great, as would an explaination of the specific uses for each tool.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful, high quality kit, and has five different tools that cover any blackhead needs.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product ! Easy to use tools simple carrying case ... I wish it had an instructions card so I knew what tool was used for what but nothing Google couldn&#x27;t help me with . I love that my hands no longer have to touch my face</li>
            <li> These tools work wonders for blackheads and whiteheads. Just make sure you clean them after you use them!</li>
            <li> When used properly these tools help reduce scarring when removing pimples and blackheads. As with any tools you use on your face you should proceed with caution and not apply too much pressure. All blackheads are not created equal and as such its great that this kit has different size tools for removal, more bang for your buck. What I especially like is the case. Since I do use these tools on my face, I like that I can clean it after use and store it away in this case instead of having to buy something else to store it in. I received a discount on this purchase for my review. My opinion remains unbiased and is based solely on my experience thus far with the product.</li>
            <li> This blackhead and blemish remover is the best! I am absolutely obsessed with popping pimples and blackheads, and I seriously never knew this existed! I used it on my boyfriend the other day on a problem pimple and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much came out of it! (TMI I know....).But I was so satisfied!  I recommend this product if you are obsessed with popping things like I am.  I haven&#x27;t yet found out how to use all the tools, but it comes with about 6 different tools to use and explore.</li>
            <li> Complete set. It even comes with stuff I&#x27;m never going to need :)</li>
            <li> amazinggggggg I loveee thissss!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it &amp;#60;3 it helped all my blackhead problems</li>
            <li> Love this tool kit. I needed something that would protect the tools and keep them clean until I need to use them. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like the tools in this kit.  They are so much more durable and effective than anything I have found in a drug store or other retail outlet.  Very happy.  Cost is far less than buying the tools individually - assuming you can even find them.</li>
            <li> I am an advid skin-picker. I also suffer from perioral dermatitis, and acne of all forms, including cystic. I have so many scars on my face from using needles, tweezers, and my fingernails to try to eliminate these blemishes. This kit has changed my life. I can now destroy any pimples, cystic or not, with a gentle press and swipe with these tools. It only leaves a mark on my face for a moment, but it fades quickly. My skin is extremely sensitive and easily damaged. It peels off in sheets with the little friction from fingernails or tissues over my fingertips. I&#x27;ve tried using a towel or a damp make-up remover to keep the ridges of my nails covered so as to not slip and rip my skin off. Or worse yet, leave giant gouges around the blemish, leaving it looking worse than it did as just an irritated pimple. I would highly suggest to anyone who suffers from acne and simply can&#x27;t &amp;#34;leave it alone&amp;#34; that you purchase one of these tool kits. Eliminate acne without painful picking and proding with the WRONG tools. Get the RIGHT tools and get your confidence back, today! The only thing I wish was different about this kit, is they should include a little piece of paper with simple drawn photo instructions on how to PROPERLY use these tools, so as to not mess your skin up any worse. For proper use guidance, check out some YouTube videos on Proper Comedone Extraction.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! The are durable!</li>
            <li> Works great! Would definitely recommend buying to remove blackheads and pimples.</li>
            <li> The feel and weight of these are wonderful I bought two sets and  I like the quality a lot.</li>
            <li> Kit came as advertised. The piercer tool isn&#x27;t that sharp but it&#x27;s made for at-home use so I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be. Each tool works as described and definitely better than using my fingers, which leaves bruising. I didn&#x27;t have any bruising with using the tools and I was able to clear my clogged pores effectively. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, all in one. Kit. Customer service out of this world!</li>
            <li> I am one of those women that constantly picks at her face, any little blackhead or pimple that I get I have to pop.; I know how bad this is for your skin, and have been trying to make my skin healthier. I had one individual blackhead remover kit years ago, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as these did. I gave this four stars, because there is no chart telling you which tool is for which type of comedone. I have no idea how to use most of them. It is nice that they give you a pdf file in your email on the best method for blackhead extraction, but wish there was a chart on which tool is which,.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> For those of us with a tendency to have pimples (yes, even in your fifties like me), this set of blackhead removal tools is a great help. Without injuring surrounding skin by squeezing, these tools target pressure around the clogged pore and allow for quick removal and extraction of blemish-causing dirt and oil. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing and if you know how to use these tools, they work pretty good. If you have no clue how these tools are used, you might want to watch some videos on how to use them because they come with no instructions at all. Pretty decent set.</li>
            <li> so great. glad to be using professional tools and no longer my fingers. I already see results.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I use just a few of the pieces. However, they are priceless. I mainly just use the tools for individual blemishes when they pop up. Although it is nice to use the tools for my entire nose and chin areas. I still can&#x27;t believe all of the pore blockage that I remove over my nose and chin!!!!</li>
            <li> Professional grade tools that are well contained in leather carrying case.</li>
            <li> Work great! My face looks amazing now!</li>
            <li> I love these tools but I wish it would come with some sort of manual or something.</li>
            <li> good quality, these set really works</li>
            <li> For those who read my reviews, you know that I never or hardly ever give 4 stars to any product. The reason for this is I believe that there is always room for improvement with anything. So, with that being said, I have to give this product 4 stars. It far surpasses the description it was given by the seller. Heavy duty and made of top notch material this product should last for years barring its use as a tool for which it wasn&#x27;t intended. R</li>
            <li> Great tools! Nice and sturdy</li>
            <li> Very good solid quality instruments that work very well</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> The zipper around the edge is great for travel. The quality of the product is solid. Sometimes you can order stuff like this and it be plastic. Not this tool kit. The only reason for 3 stars is because to the novice (like myself) it would nice to have a chart that explains why each end looks the way it does and how to use it. Figuring it out as i go!</li>
            <li> I have this habit of extracting blackheads in my nose, I am not the only one, right?&lt;br /&gt;This kit came with five different tools for extracting blackheads. I am no expert nor a dermatologist, but this kit came in handy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I always sterilize them before using.&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is really useful for storage as it is very compact and easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;I only try to extract my blackheads whenever needed and these tools helped me with that. Always use caution whenever you use them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still best to consult a doctor in regards to using this.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> I recently got a 50x lighted mirror and saw my pores in a whole new light. All puns intended. So I felt the need to order tools to help clear my pores better.  I could not be happier with this set. They are extremely well made, easy to sanitize and use and my pores are the cleanest they have probably ever been due to a good mirror and these tools.</li>
            <li> Ease of use. Allows access to difficult areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these as a birthday gift for your girlfriend even if it&#x27;s an addon joke gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we haven&#x27;t been able to really get them to remove blackheads like they do in the videos. they work its just not the magic that happens in the videos. it kind of hurts when she starts pushing on my nose. then again it could be her trying to hurt me for getting her a blackhead remover for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product comes with so many tools, however it needs to come with instructions on what tool to use for what specific problem.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing a kit of this kind. Although the kit was very well made it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I attempted with very little success to clear pores on my nose and using these tools were too painful for me to consider doing it more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> A complete kit of sturdy instruments.</li>
            <li> I would like instructions but the product is very good.</li>
            <li> Love love love this thing! Not for everyone, but if your looking at it in the first place it&#x27;s probably for you. No instructions, but YouTube makes up for that.</li>
            <li> works as expected, happy with the quality of the product and good customer service from the company</li>
            <li> I really like my kit, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for., costumer service was really good.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I cannot say enough good things about this kit, I absolutely love it and it has completely changed the way I take care of my skin. Let me start from the beginning, I&#x27;ve been a hardy tomboy my entire life, and I&#x27;ve never had any idea about giving myself facials or anything beyond scrubbing my face and putting some lotion on it.    I was at a friend&#x27;s apartment and she offered to give me a facial and mask, and as it was a rainy Tuesday with nothing to do, I told her to go for it. She first used this [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]], which by the way did some really amazing things to my skin. An aside, this mask really made my skin feel tight and clear and the acne that was already on my skin felt tighter and a little smaller after she rinsed it off. Anyway, she used all of the tools in the acne treatment kit and did a lot of squeezing, and pulling, and popping. She then put this [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]] on my face before a light moisturizer (CeraVe) and wow, the results were absolutely amazing.    The reason I include the entire regimen is that I&#x27;m a little concerned that if you change any of the steps, it may not work as well. My face looked so amazingly clear and she&#x27;d gotten rid of all these gross things from my face. I was so happy that I went out and bought everything she used. I&#x27;ll admit it, in the case of this acne treatment kit, I needed to watch quite a few videos on youtube, but once I got it down, my face has been looking great. I recommend all of these products, and definitely this kit.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools seem unnecessary only one or two seem really functional</li>
            <li> yeah overpriced for quality</li>
            <li> I really only use 1 tool from this, but it works pretty well....</li>
            <li> Good kit. Lots of styles and types to choose from.</li>
            <li> this is a very good kit to have on hand</li>
            <li> Only two of the utensils were in the case upon arrival.</li>
            <li> For those who posted it did not come with all the tools, it&#x27;s because case is poorly made and they constantly fall out. I threw the case away after first day. As for tools. They are not finished properly. Have rough edges but I guess that&#x27;s the quality vs.price issue.</li>
            <li> Just started using the kit two days ago and found everything excellent! The kit has every tool that I need to remove blackheads and blemishes. Very satisfied with the purchase and the customer service is very helpful too.</li>
            <li> Great pack of tools for your face!!  Has everything I need and for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to where I don&#x27;t have to worry about my face breaking out, but I did have numerous small blackheads around my nose until I used the Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit.  It couldn&#x27;t have been easier!  I only wished I&#x27;d have come across this product years earlier.  Awesome company!  I would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Buy it. Works great. Learn how to use before buying or you&#x27;ll damage your skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the equinox blackhead and blemish remover kit. It claims to be the #1 dermatologist approved kit. But when I opened it yesterday I was quite disappointed looking at the condition of the surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to say but these tools don&#x27;t appear to be new (nowhere close to what the best dermatologist approved kit should be) - they seem used based on the amount of scratches, dents or perhaps they were just very poorly manufactured. I am uploading some pictures for you to take a look, and therby rectify this situation (unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a HD camera to upload clear pics, but I did my best). I am also a bit worried about the fact that your tools might rust very fast and I feel anxious to use them on my face, even after sterilizing them after each use. Please comment on this.</li>
            <li> These work well and do the trick. Great with facial steamers.</li>
            <li> Great service and product!</li>
            <li> As great as the product is, the customer service is even better! Very very pleased with such great service, product, and price.</li>
            <li> Two have sharp metal/bad cuts. Three actually look professional. Still a better value than buying them individual. Attached is a picture of the one with a bad cut.</li>
            <li> This is a stupid piece of junk. I tried using it and it didn&#x27;t do what it said it would do. I would push and push on my face on every black head and white head I saw and it didn&#x27;t do anything except make my face really red and cause it to bleed. I tried every tool every way possible and still nothing. Waste of time.</li>
            <li> These are good and work better than fingers.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do. The blackhead remover can be painful. Need instruction on how to use the other tools.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy, and the case is very handy. The only downside is that some of the tools, the loop is very thick. You have to press really hard to get good leverage.</li>
            <li> No instructions.  I believe I am using it correctly.  I watched a tutorial online.  I made a mess of my face.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made tools. Sharp edges that actually cut the skin.  Maybe try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect tools for blackheads! Good heavy duty tools with awesome results. These are NOT flimsy like most are.</li>
            <li> one of them broke after a couple of weeks of use but the others worked fine and look like high quality products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say. The set is ok for the price however after using these a few times I&#x27;m back to square one. 😔😔😔</li>
            <li> The tools are nice. I wish they came with instructions but I have been able to YouTube them and figure it out. A handy thing to have around the house with teenagers.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well and now my wife is going crazy with it.</li>
            <li> What a great kit!  I got it for my teenage son and he has been using it every day with great success.  The case is handy and the tools are well made.  The only thing I&#x27;m left wanting are better instructions.  The company went out of their way and sent us a PDF with basic instructions and that was a nice, unexpected surprise.  But the instructions didn&#x27;t provide a lot of detail and we&#x27;re left wondering how to use a few of the tools.  I suggest a youtube video with demonstrations.  But the product is good quality and well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> This little kit is extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it&#x27;s supposed to but feel extremely fake.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice kit for home or travel. The instruments are of superior stainless steel quality. Items arrived quickly. Would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality instruments. None of them are polished smooth, and as a result these instruments damage the delicate tissues of the face.</li>
            <li> The tools are great, but I really enjoyed this company&#x27;s customer service. Before I received the product, I got an email about how to use the tools from the company and another after receiving the product asking if I was satisfied. I love to see companies that take a little extra step to ensure their products meet customer expectations.</li>
            <li> Equinox Blackhead Remover Kit Was shipped in a timely manor and once I got it it pass the eye test meaning it didn&#x27;t look cheap and its holding up</li>
            <li> Heavy-duty Metal And Cuts Into Your Skin.  Makes places on your face. I&#x27;m not going to use it again.</li>
            <li> Junky.  Tools arrived dirty, case doesn&#x27;t work (zipper doesn&#x27;t close so the tools fall out of it), and the quality of the tools is so poor that they are unusable.</li>
            <li> What a great kit and it is priced nicely also.  It is everything it was said that it is and extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> This blackhead and blemish remover kit was a request from my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew things like this were for sale. So when she found this on Amazon, it was a must buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set come with 5 different tools and 10 different ends. The little black zipper case is perfect for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She simply places the desired tool end over her blemish and pushes down, or move the tool in a gentle sweeping motion and it pops the pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were not any directions in the set, but my daughter seemed to know how to use them after watching various youtube videos. I think it&#x27;s a better option than using her fingers, and more sanitary as long as you clean them properly and use alcohol after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s very pleased with the set and pleased with the results. She doesn&#x27;t have dark red finger marks from picking, and the little mark the tool makes is gone fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice set, gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected! Faster than estimated shipping and wonderful customer service. Very pleased with the quality of the equipment, I would absolutely recommend Equinox International.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful, everyone needs one</li>
            <li> Would not recommend at all! Worst thing I have ever used on my face,  very cheap made and painful to use!  Mine went in the trash!!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;surgical grade&amp;#34; extractor, which claims to be brand new, was rusted/eroded in several places. Had I used this on a client&#x27;s face they could have developed an infection. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying this type of product from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Highly effective, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was given this set as a gift. Works fantastic! It is easy to clean and all the tools work well. I would recommend getting this kit.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the quality of these tools. The company even sent me an email to let me know that I can contact them if I am having trouble learning how to use them which is awesome. I have ordered many things and have never had anyone care to contact me like they did. I do need to learn how to use the tools and when I do I will let you know how they worked for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these after becoming frustrated with my 30 year old acne. I had mostly clear sink in my teens and I seem to be paying for it now. This little set really works, but it may take a few tries to get used to how to use them. I would watch the videos online, they help. Like others said, using this set can be painful, but if you are popping pimples by squeezing them you already know about the pain. The advantage of this set is less tissue damage and redness. I find that area is much easier to cover up after popping and heals faster .&lt;br /&gt;They are easiest to use on the forehead and chin (skin over bone), while cheeks and the side of the nose tend to be a bit tricker. Overall this set has helped me get rid of painful pimples before they turn into giant red monsters that take over my face. I wish I would have known about tools like these years ago.</li>
            <li> So I had a few black heads and a lot of white heads on my nose and chin.  I watched a YouTube DIY video and learned how to use the tools and remove black heads and white heads properly... The tool&#x27;s have good grip they never slipped out of my hands. My face looks great no red marks after a few minutes. Easy to clean the tools just a lil rubbing alcohol.. I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom..</li>
            <li> This kit does not come with information or instructions.  I don&#x27;t know what metal the instruments are made from.  There are no instructions as to what each instrument is best used for.  I can probably figure it out but it is very poor on the manufacturers part not to include any instructions.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Had another that was much better.</li>
            <li> I would give these a higher rating but there are no instructions included.</li>
            <li> Tools were tarnished and appeared to have some sort of corrosion on them.</li>
            <li> These stuffs Look good to me, but I am still practicing working with them to remove my white heads. I still have hard time.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievably great tool. Prevents swelling and irritation, super easy to use and much easier than with nails.&lt;br /&gt;3/5 stars for the production quality though: the zipper on the pouch is bad, the metal is even worse: while the metal loops are great, the one-piece one developed a crack right under the head, making it impossible to use - any more pressure and the ring just snaps off leaving a ragged edge.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent stuff. If this is what you are looking for, I&#x27;d say this is a good product to go with.</li>
            <li> It has some rusty spots and it&#x27;s case was not clean didn&#x27;t seem new</li>
            <li> Very good product, exactly as described and great customer service, seller really cares about customers. I definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I basically got this because I had a big painful blackhead in my ear (gross I know) and I couldn&#x27;t squeeze it out. My fiancée had to help me get it out with one of the devices. It worked like a charm and my fiancée had a blast using it on me.</li>
            <li> Awful --- came with 1 piece in it out of the 5. Biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bit easier and less painful than just using your fingers, but there is a lot of force and some frustration to it as well. I think it&#x27;s still valid to use because it deminishes the scars. Maybe I had high expectations thinking it would be something simple and pain free, and maybe I&#x27;m not using it properly and don&#x27;t know very well the technic and this is why I got frustrated and just used my fingers instead, but I&#x27;d still recommend it for people that has more patience cause it is less likely to give you infections if you clean it properly, than just popping your pimples with your fingers. But expect it to hurt and some work to it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality tools.</li>
            <li> Great tools to have!  Very sturdy great quality!  Fast shipping.  I get a lot of use out of them.</li>
            <li> It works very well. It does what it is supposed to, can&#x27;t ask for mode than that</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> Great kit but terrible for acne.</li>
            <li> Well it was not as expected.  Yes it pulled the stuff out...most anyway, but it left red marks and bleeding that will have to scab and heal.  Not ideal.</li>
            <li> not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, Fast shipping, works well!!!</li>
            <li> Great products exactly as described.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dd who just finish high school&lt;br /&gt;and who really love this kit!it help remove black heads without leavin&lt;br /&gt;small pore holes in her skin and it really easy to use!she is very Happy&lt;br /&gt;and wish she had this while in school.....it really work</li>
            <li> Hey Jim,&lt;br /&gt;This is the best kit ever for acne. I wish I had it when I was 16 not 60! It has everything one needs to properly take care of their skin issues. Always recommend that they clean the instruments with alcohol after use.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but it came looking either rusty or like there was some gross coating on all of the tools.  Aside from that I have had other blackhead remover tools in the past and they just felt sturdier and worked better.  I will still use it, just not as much as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> Everything I need in a nice, black case!</li>
            <li> The tools don&#x27;t work as well as expected...</li>
            <li> Works great, sturdy, good quality utensils.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Tools are very well made. My skin is smoother and clearer. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My sister had been using similar devices for years and I never tried them before. I Have clusters of tiny blackheads beside my eyes and had tried everything from micro bead facewash, to special exfoliating brushes to those stupid blackhead removing strips. Nothing short of individual, manual removal with fingernails worked. Best tool for the job. No question.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very pleased with this set!  I was looking to purchase just one tool, and when I saw that this set was the same price as just ONE of the tools, I decided to get this kit instead.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I actually used this as soon as I got it because I had a big whitehead on my cheek, and I just had to use one of the tools and it instantly popped it, evenly and without any rough or harsh motions.  I was so impressed that I decided to go for another one that was a little tougher to pop.  I ended up using the one tool with the tiny spike at the end, just precise enough to make a little prick into the skin, then I was able to use one of the tools to slowly and evenly push out all the &amp;#34;white stuff&amp;#34;.  I would suggest watching a video or two on YouTube of dermatologists using these tools if you want to make sure you don&#x27;t go crazy and overdo it on your face -- there are good techniques for using these tools and you can find some good videos (might be kinda gross) if you are curious.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased this kit -- I love the nice zip up holder and the wide variety of tool sizes and shapes!  What a great investment!  I was looking to purchase just one for this price, and instead I was able to get a variety of tools, and enclosed in a convenient zip case!  I hope this review has been helpful for you!  Thanks for reading! Happy popping! :)  I was looki</li>
            <li> some of the tools came with rust or some type of rust like gunk. Nothing a little bit of elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> This is very low quality. I can&#x27;t believe it had night reviews. These tools are so poorly made that some  have sharp edges you can see and feel with your hand. I would never use them on my face.</li>
            <li> All Good Fast shipping nice set of tools.A++</li>
            <li> Best price I have seen for a kit &amp; these are excellent quality!!!  Real metal pieces that are very sturdy.  I recommend buying.  My only con, which is very minor, is that the carrying case could be better made but that is nitpicking.  I would still buy.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, and they love it!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The quality is top notch and works amazingly, PERIOD!</li>
            <li> Great for our beauty needs!</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t dig at your skin the first place but it you really have to, then I would recommend this product right here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 5 handy dandy tools to eliminate all your pimples and blackheads. The tools come in a synthetic leather pouch that has a zipper on it to keep all your tools in place and clean. The tools are made from high quality materials that won&#x27;t tarnish or break on you. It is definitely going to last for a long time. Before using this product, I suggest cleaning the tools with alcohol and washing your hands so that you don&#x27;t infect the area you&#x27;re trying to dig at. This is perfect for anyone and makes a nice gift because it comes in a great travel friendly case.</li>
            <li> Not as great as they make these look on TV or YouTube but the set like this with various types is beneficial.</li>
            <li> Serves there purpose!</li>
            <li> I bought these tools for a stubborn blackhead that was in my son&#x27;s ear, didn&#x27;t have anyway to get to it.  These tools did the trick!  He is very prone to blackheads so I&#x27;m sure I will turn to these tools to effectively get out the blackhead without damaging his skin.</li>
            <li> Love this set. It&#x27;s very sturdy and includes a nice case.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I hoped for, a few of the tools are a bit redundant. Would have spent the same for 1 higher quality tool.</li>
            <li> Even with following the directions these tools can hurt.</li>
            <li> One of the pieces was missing, so there were only 4 instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Wow it really works. I&#x27;m simply amazed at how well these tools work. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid bruising.  Not only did I bruise more, the product cut my skin leaving my skin looking sickly!</li>
            <li> I watched that doctor on instagram popping pimples and had to get this kit. I used it on my coworker who had a huge blackhead and it worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Excellent selection of tools in the kit, I am very happy with this purchase:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for my wife who just received her esthetics license and she loved it.  I had no idea what I was buying but she assured me that I did good.  I actually expected the whole case to be larger but I was incorrect,  it&#x27;s right about the size of a sun glass case.</li>
            <li> received fast, great Kit-has all you ned for clear skin care, works well so far!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Great product.</li>
            <li> These 5 tools are all you really need, my first impressions are really good as the tools appear to be quite durable and well made. As far as advice goes for using these tools ensure you are using the correct technique, there are instructional materials and videos you can find online that will be of use. I recommend exfoliating or steaming your pores prior to using these for maximum effectiveness and to avoid potentially damaging your skin by having to apply more pressure. I have already seen a 75% reduction in visible blackheads on my nose since using these every other day for a week and a half now, my case was quite severe as my nose was almost completely covered and the blackheads were visible at a medium distance. As of now the remaining blackheads are only visible at a very close distance. Depending on your skin type you may find that you will need to use these tools weekly, monthly or even every couple of days in my case, the key is to be consistent about it as a regimen is key to keeping blackheads at bay and the longer you leave them the harder they will be to remove.</li>
            <li> This set is very helpful. Good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the tools on the more minimal blackheads or achne, but instead the more severe cases. The effort needed isn&#x27;t worth it compared to using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;However, works really well for the larger ones!</li>
            <li> This is my second set first I use for its purpose, which is not often at all thank goodness but the kit is great for that plus I use this kit for working with&lt;br /&gt;Clay. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> They are very useful.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture. My boyfriend said it was a really painful but then we read the directions, you have to place a hot washcloth over the area for 4-6 min to open up the pores. So we will try again when the time comes, Im letting him recover.</li>
            <li> Definitely good and gets the job done and I so far I&#x27;ve only had to use 2 out of the 5 tools in the case for my acne prone, pimple spread skin. Although I got to pop out and get rid of a lot of pimples, my only issue was that it still didn&#x27;t manage to successfully pop every single one and now I have some scars on my face. Maybe I used it too excessively or my pimples just weren&#x27;t ready to pop but I was still give this product a 5/5. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I got these for my sister. she said they really work, and are pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The kit seems has a tool for every blemish type..  Deep seated blackheads are no longer a problem or painful to remove.  The kit arrived timely and there are no issues to report.  The Equinox Co. does great follow up to make sure that you are completely satisfied with this kit.</li>
            <li> Good with certain pimples. If not carefully this product will make new scars, as it did on me:-(</li>
            <li> Tools are fantastic.  Excellent quality for the price.  This company cares about its customers&#x27; satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Got it on time and it&#x27;s a great way to save money by skipping  the expensive facials.</li>
            <li> I received yes, but not yet used. so I do not know if it&#x27;s good. grateful, Marcia</li>
            <li> Very well made instruments.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Tools are perfect and are well constructed. Great selection. Love it all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good kit! It helps much better than going to do facial with a hundred dollars! Follow the instructions and you get a good result. I am really happy buying this. It was delivered on time as well.</li>
            <li> Quality and quantity wise i think i won a jackpot.. Got this product for a really good deal in exchange of review.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and works very well.</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t work at all. Stick with the dual finger approach.</li>
            <li> Best zit popping thing ever. I have squished so many things out of my pores with it. Humans are truly disgusting creatures. This thing helps me be a little less gross.</li>
            <li> Great service and product.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Whenever I would try to use the tools it only made my blemishes worse by irritating them and making indents in my skin. I read so many reviews and that is why I bought the product but now I&#x27;m inclined to believe they were fake brought upon by getting the product for free. Would not recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> I received this for free for review. I loved using it. It didn&#x27;t hurt to use. Just follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Does what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE PROPERLY  WILL CAUSE SCARRING!!!!!! Black case is cheap and stinky and the tools rust if you don&#x27;t fully dry off.</li>
            <li> Did not work for removal of blackheads or blemishes.</li>
            <li> Works great to clear your pores.</li>
            <li> Works great for the hubby&#x27;s backne. For the face?  Best case is nothing happens. More often you end up creating a new pimple by just trying to clear a pore or pimple. Keep it away! Especially for the pockets out there</li>
            <li> Works as expected! Product&#x27;s value is unmatched!</li>
            <li> These little tools work great! I&#x27;m 30 and still have to battle acne. I&#x27;ve tried so many things but these have gotten out years of nasty blackheads. My face looks so much better!</li>
            <li> Excellent selection.  You really only need the wire loop tool and it&#x27;s partner with the wider edges (and they generously provide two sets).  Very good price and the quality of the steel is surprisingly better than kits that cost twice the price.  The case is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> Everything came and works perfect, great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Works amazing at getting all the blackheads I couldn&#x27;t extremely effective definitely reccommend</li>
            <li> High quality product. Exactly what I was hoping for. I steralize them before using with 99% Isopropyl Alcohol and couldnt be happier.</li>
            <li> received timely and intact.  As a retired health care worker, these tools will serve their intended purpose</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described, and works like a charm ;)</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and accurate. High quality items for a reasonable price. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My 13yo daughter is using this in combination with proactive skin kit. Her skin looks so clear in as little as a week and she is so happy.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many other products and can not praise this one enough,&lt;br /&gt;It actually WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome!  You should never use your fingers to try and expel the bacteria, just adds more bacteria.  These tools are great for gently helping to get rid of the bacteria, and don&#x27;t make the area as red as if you use your fingers. Highly recommend for those occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> They rust too easily! I must have left them in the alcohol too long cuz when I went to test them out, each and every one of them had rusted!  Just shows you how poor the quality of these are considering I&#x27;ve never had anything rust on me that I&#x27;ve soaked in alcohol overnight.(When I was younger, I had many piercings so I was constantly soaking my jewelry in alcohol.)</li>
            <li> I got this with a nice packaging pouch this tools for me to remove my blackheads .find this tool to work very well.it is best to use it after a shower or after facial washing. It is very good at removing blackheads, and does good job removing whiteheads too.easy to use and this tool is nicely  may simply designed but works well.i purchase this under promotional item with my Honest review and own opinion</li>
            <li> Works great. I also use them to get thorns and briars out.</li>
            <li> Nice toolkit. Informative emails accompany the product order with full instructions. Seller also offers 100% guarantee which is nice.</li>
            <li> Very high quality steel tools, delivered in a very timely way.  I&#x27;m happy with them, easy to clean, nice storage container, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and shipped on time</li>
            <li> Perfect,  just perfect.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay. A lot of the tools are similar. Wish they had a smaller &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; tool to help extract the smaller comodones. I havent use the middle one (with the sharp instrument on the end) as of yet.</li>
            <li> Great price! These tools feel very solid and well made.</li>
            <li> Good quality ad advertised.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and nice case I love it I would deff recommend!</li>
            <li> Tools are not as high quality as &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; or the like.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, came with all pieces. Sturdy. One&#x27;s kinda sharp though. Package kinda smelled bad for a bit but I let it air out and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Not worth it...piece of trash</li>
            <li> Very nice little kit. Came fast and as pictured.</li>
            <li> The pouch and the equipment itself seem to be a good quality. I tried to get a black head out with one of the tools though and it didn&#x27;t work. I ended up just pushing it out of the skin with my fingertips two days later. The next time I ever get another irritating black head I will give the tools a try again but if it doesn&#x27;t work it will be a let down. Maybe I just am not using it right. The package came quickly though, I like the quality of the product and I&#x27;ve never used it before now so I may not even be using it right. I&#x27;ll have to watch a tutorial or something. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions but it seemed like a common sense type of thing so I winged it. If I can figure out how to properly use it and it works I&#x27;ll raise the number of stars to 4 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE - Like I said if it works I&#x27;ll come back and add another star and I can say that it totally depends on the pimple. Some are just really stubborn but I still like having this tool around because I&#x27;m not a fan of putting fingers all over my face.</li>
            <li> These implements of doom do a good job at performing their intended function. Happy popping.</li>
            <li> great way to remove those unwanted blackheads</li>
            <li> wow! guess I&#x27;m not the only one. should have read the reviews before purchasing. I&#x27;m missing 3 of the 5 tools in this kit… disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Feels good in the hands and the tools are easy to manipulate and are made of metal.  Only gave it a 3-star because the tools are not cut properly for efficient use.  You really have to work at it to make them work.  Maybe with practice and constant use, this set could be bumped up to a 4-star.</li>
            <li> Tia works very well it cures pimples blackheads so fast never saw one better it works like a charm</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  My daughter has acne, and I still have occasional outbreaks. The kit offers enough tools for both of us, and the included instructions were most helpful.</li>
            <li> The are the best with checking in on you and your new product thanks to all.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kit, but WARNING this product is not intended for use by Meth users as they will come out of the bathroom two hours later looking like Freddy Cruger!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use all the tools but I would look for a smaller kit.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Pimples have been popped.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money and useful instructions with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality and utility product. I guess this will be long lasting buy.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very useful and a very well made product!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. I&#x27;m no expert but these tools &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; surgical steel, very strong as they don&#x27;t bend at all no matter how much pressure you put on them when using them. I looked at other kits and this one gives you most variety for the best price. I would definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with instructions detailing how and when to use each instrument. You can look up videos on YouTube but it&#x27;s there&#x27;s conflicting advice and it would make the difference between a 3 and 5 star review if they just included a quick guide.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with quality and quantity. The case is very helpful to keep all together.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and much safer way of maintaining your skin than squeezing and marking up your face. You definitely want to use a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> A great kit , does what it supposed to , as long as you do it the right way.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  No problems.</li>
            <li> Great product. Strong steel ends. Easy to sterilize. Timely shipping and it comes in a really nice zip case. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I am far from a professional at this, but after figuring out how to use the tools, it was actually pretty easy.  It did take me a little while to figure out how to make the tools work effectively, but I suppose that is just the learning curve with any new product.  The tools themselves are sturdy, well-made, and durable; I would recommend thorough cleaning after each use, but even that is simple enough.  I have personally recommended this to a few of my friends. The shipping was fast.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> The end broke off after I used it 3 times.  Let&#x27;s see how the other 4 hold up.</li>
            <li> I had a black head I could not get out for years. I got it out in 5 minutes with one of the  tools. This is a great quality tool set. There is a tool in here for what ever you want to remove or pop. If there is not a tool in here that will not solve your problem there isn&#x27;t one.</li>
            <li> Not really the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> Popped one pimple with this set.  Have all the tools I need to handle my face like a pro!  Watch videos or read first before doing anything crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it works really well. We mostly use these on his back. If you don&#x27;t follow the directions about steaming, etc it can be a painful process! this is probably overkill for little blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company even emailed me after I received the package to be sure I was happy. They emailed me some directions at my request. Really great people.</li>
            <li> Very useful tools to help remove blackheads. I just use warm-hot water/ steam to open my pores and rubbing alcohol to keep the tools sterile. Then I just go to town on my blackheads. A LOT easier than squeezing with my nails.</li>
            <li> At first, I gave it 4 stars.  After a week of trial and error, I figured out how to use the tools properly.  I had a giant open pore on my nose and it would always get clogged with blackheads.  It was nasty.  The pinching technique only damaged my skin.  Strips did not help.  So I tried to use these and see what would happen.  To my surprise, they worked beautifully.  I cleared out the pore entirely with the tools, took care of the open pore with cold water, a tiny bit of alcohol, and some Neosporin.  Took two attempts to get all the way clear but now it is fully closed, clear, and looking great.  One of the top purchases off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Effective . Works best after a bath, shower, or sauna when pores are open and debris is softened.</li>
            <li> it was amazing worked great still working thanks :)</li>
            <li> A whole lot of nothing. The price is good. I&#x27;ve had a blackhead popper before and it worked Great. These are okay but if all 5 sticks none are just plain and simple...</li>
            <li> Quality products l, my wife is a medical professional and she raves about this set.</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial care kit. The quality is pretty good, very good considering the price. Do take some time to read the instructions, or you might get frustrated. I end up using just two of the pieces, I guess that&#x27;s what works for my skin type. But I wouldn&#x27;t have known which to use without having the kit!</li>
            <li> Great kit works very well</li>
            <li> This blemish kit is nicely packaged and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> My kit only included 3 of the 5 tools.  They must have a QC issue.  The ones that were received were fine.</li>
            <li> I have a hairless dog that has a problem with blackheads. This kit is very nice ,it is easier than heavy scrubbing and other irritating means of removing the little blackheads before they get out of hand.  I love it, so does my dog. It does not hurt his legs and feet or his chubby cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of these tools.  They appear to be made well, and I was one of the lucky ones that received all the tools at one time.  The edges are smooth and rounded, which helps to not damage the skin as much as I have found in some local implements I purchased.  There is a case that comes with the tools, which works well except for the zipper--it is one continuous zipper and can&#x27;t close completely on one end, which allows some of the tools to slip out of the case.  A new design is needed for the case; I would have given them a five star review if this hadn&#x27;t been an issue.  I like the variety of this set--they work surprisingly well.  I would suggest keeping these tools sanitized before using to avoid infections.  I have deep pores on my nose and chin, and these extracting tools work very well in clearing out those stubborn blackheads that won&#x27;t come out with cleaning, scrubbing and masking.  Just don&#x27;t overuse or abuse your skin, and you&#x27;ll be pleased with these tools.  Also, these work much better after you&#x27;ve showered or washed/steamed your face in hot/warm water to help open the pores a bit.</li>
            <li> Came on time but came with no instructions.</li>
            <li> Did not work as it was shown in the video that I watched.  I was very disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> No instructions, which I knew going into the purchase.  Not overwhelming impressed like I had hoped to be.  There are some rough edges in the metal work...</li>
            <li> The quality of this product can not be  understated. It has rough edges, just a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> The kit is amazing for what it&#x27;s intended todo.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this product, but unfortunately this product did not work for me  It didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to</li>
            <li> Great set of extractors! Gives you so many options to find which tool works best for you. Very nice quality!</li>
            <li> Nice professional quality tools in a good sturdy case. These tools are surgical grade, which is nice. There are a variety of sizes for extraction of blemishes. It is labeled well with good instructions for use as well as for sterilization. Really nice set and I would recommend to others and will look for more products by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me free for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Just as in the picture! Works great, try it. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with an instruction manual for whats what or how to use it because I&#x27;m still confused. But it was relatively cheap and quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but knew my dermatologist had used similar tools on me when I was there for an office visit so I hoped I could replicate his results at home. Using them was a piece of cake and it easily cleared out stubborn blackheads and gently took care of some painful cystic acne. Can&#x27;t beat the price for the variety of tools.</li>
            <li> Great use for what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> I purchased an item with 5 implements. An item with 4 implements arrived. It&#x27;s a shame because the ones here seem solid. It&#x27;s going back, and I&#x27;m very irritated at the waste Of time.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Comes with a great little case for all the tools that makes them very discreet to others.  I also like that the sellers provided a pdf file to help show me how to use all the tools.  I by no means have ever used any of these kind of tools before,  but I  can at least assure anyone reading this review that they worked with me.  The tools are very sturdy and look like they would last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great product! The packaging is nice, and the case the tools come in doesn&#x27;t seem to be flimsy. There&#x27;s a nice variety of blemish removers to choose from as well, allowing for easy removal of blackheads and other nasty blemishes of different sizes and placements on the skin. My major problem areas are around my nose and chin; however, after just one use, I can see and feel a noticeable difference in my skin&#x27;s condition. Would recommend for anyone struggling to remove stubborn blackheads, zits, etc. in a safe and clean way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tool to use. And the case make it easy to travel without misplacing it : )</li>
            <li> These are fully functional tools and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I wish the edges were softer, still does the job. As expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works amazingly</li>
            <li> Im happy with the arrival time but was dissapointed to only find 4 instead of 5 tools ...</li>
            <li> Just like the picture and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> 2 tools were missing, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but I had to let everyone know this product is AMAZING! I applied hot towel for couple minutes to prepare pores and both white and black heads came out with little pressure.  I loved it so much I sterilized the tools and cleaned my husband and my pre-teens pores! A must have!</li>
            <li> Very nice sturdy set of extractors. I must have for teens and young adults.</li>
            <li> Instructions were poor</li>
            <li> Great product for popping zits</li>
            <li> I love these tools! I have so many tiny blackheads and I have tried many different facial products but have had no success! This definitely has cleared up a lot the blackheads. Some of the tools are a little well made than I&#x27;d like but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> The tools are heavy and feel like good quality steel. My only complaint is that the double-ended round loop tool is too deep/thick and therefore less accurate. I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers complain about how sharp these instruments are. This has not been my experience. In fact, I wish they were sharper.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think these tools are produced in a consistent manner, hence the mixed reviews and a mediocre rating from me.</li>
            <li> I feel I just wasting money.</li>
            <li> Most of the instruments are useless. It didn&#x27;t come with instructions (you&#x27;d think it was self explanatory but it isn&#x27;t) And it doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I expected. It does work more times than not so I give it 3 stars. I&#x27;d give it 4 but I still find it easier to pop them myself sometimes...</li>
            <li> Very good tools to take care of skin imperfections. Must have</li>
            <li> Effective! Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!!! I&#x27;ll never use two fingers ever again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Priced right. Came on time. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;MJU</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent buying experience.  Very helpful and informative.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just got this the other day and let me just say this set is awesome. It&#x27;s not cheaply made and the metal is pretty heavy duty. No complaints here!!</li>
            <li> Sharp stabby one is my favorite! For real tho, buy this kit. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> good item compared with price thank you</li>
            <li> I personally like the blackhead removal tool kit overall. My only problem is that I don&#x27;t have a need for some of the other ends. It really does a great job extracting.</li>
            <li> Good service and quality</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Perfect quality and not pricey.</li>
            <li> I have not used it as of yet but it is a very nice kit</li>
            <li> These tools are a great buy. Great quality!</li>
            <li> They work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to clean, strong material, pressure from tools bring out blackheads and pimples, nice carrying case, variety of tools, doesn&#x27;t leave bruises (only small red circles for the next 20 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: you really need a smaller tool for the blackheads on your nose, but you can make this work.&lt;br /&gt;Overall appeal: works flawlessly</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use the kit as it suggested you could use it. I&#x27;m pretty smart, but will take this to dermatologist to view,&lt;br /&gt;before scarring my teens face.</li>
            <li> Great little kit.  After watching YouTube videos of doctor&#x27;s using this tool, I had to grab it.  As someone who still suffers from acne well into my adult life, I am littered with scars.  This kit contains all you need to properly remove blemishes.</li>
            <li> Works great only need cream or something to reduce the amount of pressure needed for the difficult ones</li>
            <li> not medical grade stuff but really nice for the price</li>
            <li> Great kit for those who like to do it themselves or feel better doing it at home in private. The kit is great comes with everything you could need. It&#x27;s easy to use and leaves less marks then if u were to use ur fingers on your face. Keep in mind this does not make it painless just easier to do.</li>
            <li> They really work.  You just have to be careful and be gentle.  I find some of them a complete waste, but it&#x27;s cool I guess that you can choose which piece feels best against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning though - your face will be puffy, red, and irritated for atleast 24 hours after a thorough clean out with this.  It&#x27;s kind of unavoidable.  I&#x27;d suggest doing it like on the weekend or something.</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast, packaged well and quality as expected. The instrument usage is not easy to figure out and honestly i find running the length of a needle, not the pointed end, down the nose does exactly the same thing. Not really a useful tool unless you want it for the professional look.</li>
            <li> I had a generic 2-sided blackhead tool I&#x27;ve been using for a while, but I kept having red splotches left on my skin since that particular tool wasn&#x27;t adequate for getting blackheads out of different areas with different thickness and pore depths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools in this pack are incredible and do a great job getting out all different sorts of blackheads and crap from my skin. The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part is that there aren&#x27;t any instructions for what each end of each tool is recommended for doing, so you kind of have to experiment with the different ones until you find the one that effectively removes the blackhead without having to use too much pressure. But overall this is a fantastic kit.</li>
            <li> Great price works great! Remember to disinfect before use and I find it helps to use it out of the shower.</li>
            <li> One of the tools had RUST all over it.</li>
            <li> In medical training we learned that the comedone extractor is used because they effectively remove the problem with the least possible damage to surrounding tissue, thus speeds healing and reduces and/or eliminates scaring, irritation and inflammation. Before I was offered a set to evaluate and review, I wasn&#x27;t aware that there were comedone extractors sold to the public. When they arrived I examined their overall construction. These are very nicely built and good quailty!! I was really impressed with them. There was no discoloration or oil residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used them before, don&#x27;t be intimidated, comedone extractors are very easy to use. These come with ome great advice as well as instruction, I recommend that you watch a doc use them properly not only to get the best results but also to use them correctly so as not to damage your skin. YouTube video &amp;#34;Acne blackheads extracted, Dr Sandra Lee. For medical education- NSFE&amp;#34; is good. Pay close attention to the pressure, the angle (very important) and rocking movement the doc uses. After the comedone is expressed notice the pulling (scraping) movement the doc uses so that it is completely removed. Can&#x27;t go wrong using these properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that for the price this set is an excellent value and I highly recommend that you use them. If you have a teenaged child, buy them, and it&#x27;ll be a gift that gives them better self-esteem, healthier skin and fewer or no acne scarring.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Went above and beyond my needs</li>
            <li> Quality of tools is not great or consistent. Did not find this to be useful in any way, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier for me to remove pimples from my face. This is much more recommended than using your hands. Make sure to wash them nicely after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for personal or professional use!  Perfect for my aesthetic practice!</li>
            <li> glad i ordered  it.  useful as need.  thank u</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a little hesitant to try this product. I suffer from bad break outs constantly. Upon receiving and opening this product the very first thing I felt was overwhelmed. I had no idea what the different tools were and I didn&#x27;t see that listed anywhere which is why I am only putting 4 stars. Luckily I was able to look online and figure out what some of the toools do. After getting acquainted with the different tools I actually enjoyed using them. I feel much more refreshed using these tools then I do using my fingers.</li>
            <li> WORKS  REAL GOOD BETTER THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> There is a tool to remove any size zit or blackhead. Heavy duty, good quality tools.</li>
            <li> Definitely not top quality metal. Dull and rough machining.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this kit but it&#x27;s just okay. Some of the instrument ends are thicker than I would have preferred if that makes sense. I don&#x27;t have obscenely large black heads and this just doesn&#x27;t work great on the little ones.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I am truly impressed. At first it kinda resembles a dental tray! Not really, but it is a great product. No one wants blackheads or any type of blemish, but IF you do; this is your help. A+</li>
            <li> Did not like the kit . It is not what I expected.  I was disappointed.  There was no instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Very like it,thank you)</li>
            <li> Tried it the first day it arrived. Although I did not do it properly, it did remove some of the oil build ups. Works pretty good!</li>
            <li> when I received it the case was dirty on the inside. There seemed to be little wood flakes inside of it.</li>
            <li> High quality kit 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> I read reviews about some pieces being missing in some people&#x27;s kits but decided to risk it simply based on the fact that all comments mentioned that they had been able to easily request a replacement or missing pieces. I will put the short version or &amp;#34;tl;dr&amp;#34; (too long; didn&#x27;t read) first but I recommend anyone interested in buying this product read the full thing.  TL;DR Version: This is a purchase I am happy I made, I would recommend it to my friends but I wish they gave some instruction on what each tool is for and how to clean them with the kit. It should be used as a secondary tool when compared to normal cleaners and should be used with warm/hot and cold water for best effectiveness. Favorite application for it has to be the easy and relieving removal of painful blemishes that can appear suddenly.  FULL VERSION:  Fair warning, I am reviewing this in a manner that will mention (in general, not graphically or detailed) &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; or removed/reduced zits and other issues. If picturing these can bother you this review (and likely this kit) is not for you and I recommend sticking with the shortened version above.  Pros: 1) This kit works b-e-a-utifully for the pimples or zits that can sometimes appear near points of lots of movement (lips, right below nose, etc) that are normally very painful if left alone. This kit allows the swelling to be safely and easily removed / reduced without pinching which would normally irritate the skin and still hurt for a while after.  2) For blackheads or clogged pores (the nose, specifically), I have found that this is a great secondary tool. Rather than relying on this kit as a primary removal tool, for the nose I would recommend the stick-on Biore nose strips (or a similar brand / tool) being used first.  2-A) After the &amp;#34;blanket&amp;#34; tool of the strip / cleanser has been used, I use this kit to get any of the remaining or partially-removed obstructions in my pores. I HIGHLY recommend cleaning any of the strips left-behind adhesive residue with warm/hot water before using this kit. This is to prevent any left-over strip stuff from reclogging your pores (Duh[?]) and to open your pores again because they likely closed while waiting for the strips to dry.  3) BUT WAIT! THERE&#x27;S MORE! Something that I had not considered when I purchased the kit was just how useful it would be for those dreaded ingrown hairs from shaving or occasionally on the legs. The tool in the middle (in the current thumbnail / image) has an end that is shaped like a small soup spoon with a hole in the middle that, in combination with tweezers (usually, but not always needed), made getting ingrown hairs removed super simple with any mirror available to you. This is saved me a lot of time and prevented a lot of (figurative) hair-pulling by making (literal) hair-pulling very simple by isolating the (evil and hateful) hair or damaged follicle and presenting it as an easy target for tweezers (or fingers if you are feeling like Tom Hank&#x27;s Castaway).  4) The kit does everything that it advertises and keeps your skin from swelling or having discoloration due to pinching, but also allows me to not have to &amp;#34;wait out&amp;#34; a pimple before going out in public.  5) The built-in cloth that is in the case makes it very easy and handy to dry tools after sterilization. It is not easily seen in the thumbnail picture, but it is the black part extending to the right and it fits very easily back into the case. I do not know if that is its intended function, but it has worked great for me in this way.  6) Despite all user-based instructions and time-learned techniques suggesting to clear the blemish / wound until there is some visible blood to completely clear it; I have also found that after using this kit instead of my fingers has led to a massive decrease in the chance of scabbing. Normally, the eliminated target would have a fairly high risk of scabbing because of &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; bleeding relative to the wound. This scabbing would often lead to picking for many people, even unintentionally, only making the issue worse. Many times, the spot that is healing could potentially look worse than if left alone.  7) As yet another (somewhat gross) bonus it allows me to indulge in the guilty pleasure of popping and removing the zits on my face that would normally have to be done with my fingers (if it were required, like in cases of being painful or uncomfortable) and would only serve to further aggravate my skin / pores. Admit it, we all go back to our pre-teen roots sometimes with these blemishes on our face and have a feeling of satisfaction in eliminating them.  Cons and suggestions to seller:  1) Methods for proper sterilization (which is VERY important) are not given and must be found online or elsewhere. A printed paper that showed easy or recommended ways to sterilize the tools would be appreciated. A quick Google search did the job, but it would have been awesome to not need to search it at all. I can understand though where they might not do this in order to avoid issues with sterilization &amp;#34;not working&amp;#34; or some other liability issue though.  2) Each tools proper or intended use is not given, which can add a small learning curve as to what works best and where.  **Only (potentially) applies to those who may travel a lot with the kit.** 3) I am not sure if much can really be done (realistically) on the seller&#x27;s part, but the longest tool in the set has a poky end that sometimes likes to try and stick through the casing and could potentially cause issues by stabbing through something else in a travel bag or something. However, this has not occurred to me more than once or twice and the first time I noticed it was when I originally opened it after it was shipped to me. Just a fair word of warning though. I have found that a nicer quality zip-loc sandwich bag is enough of a buffer to prevent and issues with this problem.  **SUMMARY** Overall, this is a great kit that I have been using every chance it is required. It is a superior alternative to the pinch and pray technique that many of us are used to, provided you (even occasionally, provided it is lightly used) clean, sterilize, and maintain the tools. It easily eliminates zits/pimples, helps remove or fix ingrown hairs, and clears obstructions in the pores of your nose. For the nose, a bit more force is usually needed than elsewhere on the face if you want to really get everything out, which may still cause some redness / swelling or pain shortly after.  Despite all of the positive feelings and utility of this kit, I do not feel that it should be used as a primary tool when taking care of or cleaning your face. Strips / cleansers should be used first, along with the application or pore-opening warm / hot water. This kit should be used after applying warm-water to open the pores. Then, after using the kit, it is recommended that you then use pore-closing agents / cleaners to reduce the chances of the now clear pores being clogged again. The cheapest and most recommended pore-closer being cold water.  However, I wish they gave some basic instructions with the kit: including proper cleaning/sterilization and each tools suited purpose, but all pieces were in the kit and work great together. These issues can be fixed with both a Google search or Youtube search, but I would like to not need these as a matter of convenience. The lack of providing this information, while somewhat minor, is what made me knock off a star (can&#x27;t do 4 1/2).  This kit has allowed me to properly manage the blemishes on my face without having to deal with the usual issues that came with pinching, including redness, bleeding and scabbing, swelling or irritation of skin after pinching, and has ultimately been a very satisfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life. However, I have it now and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.isfying purchase that I wish I had made earlier in life. However, I have it now and I am glad it caught my eye while browsing.</li>
            <li> Its soo good, handy, remove black and whiteheads without any pain! Just take steam and then you can easily remove acne with this tools!! Super cooll i liked it! I got this priduct to review but the opinion is my own!!</li>
            <li> I love this little set! I suffer from ingrown hairs post-bikini waxing, so this has absolutely helped in remedying that issue. I&#x27;ve used it for a few issue I&#x27;ve had on my face, specifically one particularly stubborn blackhead that had been present for quite a while. I was finally able to remove that sucker! My husband, who frequently shaves his face and head, also suffers from ingrowns, so he uses this set frequently and loves it as well! The cute little storage case it comes in is approx. 5-6 inches long, so it is easily stored almost anywhere. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Wow these little hooks and scrapers really, get into the pores, clears up your pores in a matter of minutes simply amazing,I don&#x27;t feel self consce as before</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Really doesn&#x27;t extract well and the only way to really get blackheads out is to really dig the tool into your skin and risk leaving scars.. No thanks!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery great price, worked like a charm. Well put together as decribed. Would do business with again.</li>
            <li> The case is a little flimsy but the quality of the instruments is great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit! The tools are very sturdy and very well made! I get blackheads more than I would like to admit and with this kit I no longer have to worry about it because these tools get them out very quickly and easily. They do sometimes leave behind a little mark on your skin from pressing but after a few minutes the mark goes away. I really love the case that this kit comes with because you can easily store them in your purse to take with you or keep it nicely stored in your bathroom. I would definitely recommend this kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> good product, it really works! i have impossible blackheads that this took right out!</li>
            <li> Quality is great and even feel heavy. Impressed!!</li>
            <li> Very complete box. We can find all we want, I&#x27;m glad to have ordered this ! Thanks !&lt;br /&gt;Ben</li>
            <li> Pretty good extractor set for the price.</li>
            <li> These work pretty damn good the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it breaks my skin and can make my nose very sore plus it looks like I have a sunburn for a few days, but thats okay because I have very sensitive skin anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product</li>
            <li> More fun than a barrel full of monkeys!</li>
            <li> These tools will let you drain your pores of excessive sebum and take care of problematic blisters that exfoliating cleansers can&#x27;t seem to reduce.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you keep a bottle of disinfectant (like isopropyl alcohol) handy to apply on your skin before, during, and after the process, as well as applying it on your tools for sterilization purposes. Nasty infections and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem? My set was missing one of the tools. I had contacted support and they offered a full refund, but I simply wanted that tool that was missing to be shipped over. Evidently this is a common problem for some that&#x27;s been solved for many, yet I won&#x27;t be one of those people that gets to complete their set.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a product that does what it needs to if performed with careful hands, but an incomplete product that continues to be sent around shouldn&#x27;t be acceptable.</li>
            <li> The tools and case are solidly made, and seem to work well; it does take some practice if you have never used them before, but already we are getting the hang of it. Quite happy I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is way better than mashing blackheads with your fingers and it&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li> It seems like every time I popped a blackhead, it came back. I just got mine, and a lot of people will say that the steaming is necessary. But it&#x27;s not. However, it won&#x27;t be nearly as easy to do. I suggest you steam your face. If you can handle it, watch some tutorials on YouTube. Sanitize your equipment in rubbing alcohol. Great product.</li>
            <li> Described perfectly and product was great!  Great Seller!</li>
            <li> I only use the middle one don&#x27;t know how to use the others but it works well to get pimples without them bleeding</li>
            <li> This items came to me but used. I can see tiny hair and dirty stuff on one of them. The case was stained too. It was hard to believe. Worst purchase experience!!!</li>
            <li> No directions on how to use the tools. Good luck guessing and not hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> My husband and I live this product! It&#x27;s very useful in unclogging pores. Must be sanitized after each use. Great addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect tool kit to keep your complexion blemish free.</li>
            <li> Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is going to school to get her aesthetics license and&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s been bugging me to get this set for myself.  She was&lt;br /&gt;practically evangelizing for this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I was skeptical at first but I chose to follow&lt;br /&gt;her suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I took before and after photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use these tools to extract not only blackheads, but all&lt;br /&gt;manner of the nasty little things that build up beneath the surface&lt;br /&gt;your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up:  This can be slightly painful if you&#x27;ve never done it before;&lt;br /&gt;especially around the rim of your nose.  Or I&#x27;m just a big baby :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip:  wash your face with an oil free cleanser before and after using these tools.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it easier on your skin.  Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;ve helped you at all in this review it would mean a lot to me if you gave me a&lt;br /&gt;thumbs up.  Feel leave a comment/question below and I will help you to the&lt;br /&gt;best of my abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Well made. One of the best I have seen for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister she really likes it she said she&#x27;s been having trouble with some white heads (I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called) she was happy.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product it works great and keeps hands off of the face. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to clean. I love the case and how slim it is for my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> It offers more options than I though it would.  It is doing the job and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great set. Everything you might need.</li>
            <li> This product got here really fast!  I have used it a couple of times on some more troubled areas and it really helps.  I ended up wanting to buy one of these after watching the Dr.pimplepopper videos on Instagram.  It seemed like a great tool that would apply an even amount of pressure with little exertion from me.  So far it has worked out well, the only thing I can say is just to be careful and know when to use the tools. Many blackheads and pimples might need some extra time to get closer to the surface.</li>
            <li> The tools seem to be a very high quality construction, but it has done nothing at all for my acne or blackheads. I am also unfortunately able to use the tools to get at painful inner nose pimples.</li>
            <li> I really love this kit.  It has everything to remove blackheads and blemishes without damaging the skin the way your fingers do.  I will never squeeze a blemish again!</li>
            <li> I love it! Make sure you buy a pore cloger just so you don&#x27;t infect other areas.</li>
            <li> I like most of the extractors - but one of the sides extractors had very rough edges and looked unfinished.  I would never put it on my skin</li>
            <li> I received this kit to use personally for those stubborn blackheads &amp; my fiance’ receives those terrible solar comedones that you just cannot seem to remove completely! I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see the professional branded case that zipped to secure the tools. I immediately tried it out &amp; was AMAZED at the ease of removal. I will never again attempt to remove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands. This is by far the best value for your money – don’t waste your time looking at any other brands online!</li>
            <li> No instructions so I have no idea on what tool to use for what use so I&#x27;m just using one of five of them</li>
            <li> My 32 yr old son loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! Comes in handy and is so convenient. I recommend this to everyone! I use it so much and it&#x27;s such a great gift, too!</li>
            <li> doesnt work at all, just leaves red marks that lasts for days</li>
            <li> The set, while good in theory, does not work. It leaves negative impressions on your skin, sometimes even causing burst blood vessels. Some of the tools are quite sharp, too.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> good product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Basically unusable... The tools are too thick. Completely ineffective. I am better off using my own nails to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I would have hoped for.</li>
            <li> I like the kit. It works fine. It didn&#x27;t come with instruction but after a couple of uses, you can figure out what works best and how to make it hurt less. Not sure if you really need all those instruments because I only use one.</li>
            <li> This set is great. I was easily able to remove a blackhead that I had for awhile that I couldn&#x27;t get out through &#x27;natural&#x27; means (hot shower, wait for pores to open, squeeze, or the egg whites trick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you want to make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing! There are NO directions with these, aside from a quick rundown on the box, which honestly is not nearly enough. You should go on YouTube first and look at a few videos on how to use these. You *need* to watch videos because just reading an article isn&#x27;t enough. These tools are SHARP and if you don&#x27;t use them correctly, you WILL hurt yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now since that&#x27;s out of the way, I&#x27;ll write about the actual quality of the tools. They&#x27;re metal, sharp, and seem to be well made. They come in their own little pouch which has a zipper. It&#x27;s convenient. I&#x27;ve only used these twice since I got them, so I can&#x27;t comment about their durability yet. I&#x27;ve seen someone mention rust, so I&#x27;ll be sure to look out for that. I plan on updating my review in a month if anything changes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great set of blackhead removers. They have been perfect so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review. I do feel these are worth 5 stars since they&#x27;re sharp, light, easy to use, and worked perfectly. I&#x27;m not sure what else I could ask out of them.</li>
            <li> This product contains a good set of tools to extract or remove certain blemishes. However, I would suggest you use these with caution. If you’ve never used these tools before, either get an expert to show you or look up good examples on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m guilty of using my fingers to squeeze out pimples sometimes, especially when I don’t have a good tool at hand. Thankfully, I was offered this product at no charge for testing and review purposes, so now I don’t have an excuse to use my hands, which is unhygienic, by the way, and could lead to scarring or infection due to bacterial spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular set by Equinox comes with 5 separate instruments in a durable leather-like zipper case. Each instrument varies in size and shape. I think if you know how to use them, these are very good, although I do wish there was one more instrument that was smaller in size. If you’re a beginner or an amateur, these blemish and acne instruments may be more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Every Uncle should bequeath this knowledge upon thow nephew.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical of the quality of these extractors but decided to give it a try since the reviews seem promising.  I&#x27;m not one to give into the hype of positive reviews but I must say I&#x27;m glad I bought these.  It works wonderfully.  I love popping things, like REALLY love to pop things and these tools makes the job way easier!</li>
            <li> All tools worked like they should. I was able to get rid of an old blackhead from my husbands back.</li>
            <li> Great kit. Lots of sizes to use and I love a case to keep them!</li>
            <li> Great kit for the money!!</li>
            <li> When used properly this is a great product. I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> Works great! Was referred to it by @docpimplepopper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the kit since the first day I received it in the mail. I&#x27;ve always had blackheads around my nose and because of my fear of using my nails and leaving scars they&#x27;ve been getting worst until now. My nose is beautiful and the tools are so easy to use and sturdy. I give it a 4 star just because the pictures were a bit misleading I thought they would be a bit bigger then they actually are but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The kit has many black head remover instruments to choose from, and priced well compared to the same product. I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend because its efficient.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit for removing whiteheads and blackheads. It&#x27;s actually much easier and MUCH less painful than using your fingers. The seller has also been very communicative by sending and informational via email after my purchase on how to use the product. Thus far I have only used one of the extractors as I&#x27;m not really sure how and when you would use all of the different options, but the one I have been using has worked very well, and is worth the purchase price by itself. I will follow up on YouTube to try to figure out how to best utilize all of the different options, but overall I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great kit and it works great....</li>
            <li> This kit is great and works well. It arrived quickly and the tools are similar if not the same as what professionals use. Very happy with my his purchase.</li>
            <li> These tools are great. They are a good quality and are day to use. I watched a video on how to use them properly and found that they are easy to use once you know how. I am already seeing results and have only used them twice. The blemishes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; without inflaming the surrounding skin and they dissapear within 24-48 hours rather than the week of raised red painful skin you would have had you popped them by squeezing with your fingers. I highly recommend these tools to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was perfect. Different sizes and amazing quality</li>
            <li> Why is this not sold in stores? All my life people have told me not to pick at my acne however I can&#x27;t stand having bumps and lumps in my face since people love to make comments about my skin.  I have cystic acne and have lots of pits and scars on my cheeks and chin.  I can&#x27;t even begin to express how thankful I am to have found and purchased this product.  I no longer squeeze pimples since I have several extractors to use.  By using these tools I no longer make a small pimple into a huge mess.  I extract the oils and the Pimple is gone! My scars are slowly going away since I am no longer creating new ones with my fingers. This has been so helpful in getting my skin under control!  I LOVE THESE EXTRACTORS!</li>
            <li> took a little getting used to, actually had to look up youtube videos because the instructions werent too helpful.. but i think i know what im doing now :) seems to be workin pretty well. all of the tools werent in their slots in the case but it wasnt a big deal, also the zipper seems to be a bit hard to zip but other than that this is a very high quality set. i judge quality based on weight, these have a good weight to them, dont feel cheap at all and are a really nice set! no complaints at all with the tools, just the case could be a little better but its all good :)</li>
            <li> The tools are mostly the same with little variation. One of the wire loop extractors keeps falling out. Kind of annoying, but okay for the price point.</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  need to get used to using it correctly, but there are some tube videos out there.  high quality and great packaging, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I use tjis for clogged pores on my nose and I discovered that it works great along with my dermaroller, I&#x27;ll roll over my nose and then use my toolkit to get clogged pores unclogged amd then dermaroll over the areas again afterwards and then put my vitamin c serum over it and my skin looks great the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this kit on several different occasions.  It has been  virtually useless so far.  I&#x27;m not sure if I need instructions or if these just look good.&lt;br /&gt;They do seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> Nice little case with all promised tools. What&#x27;s really missing is instructions and Q&amp;As. Why they choose to contact customers by email instead of just including the information in the package is beyond me. I never received the Q&amp;A they promised in an email. Instead I went on youtube trying to figure out how to use the set. Couldn&#x27;t find anything posted by Equinox though...&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I think this is a really good kit that will work well once I figure out how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT KIT FOR ACNE.THE TOOLS ARE THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Package came missing parts</li>
            <li> Works great! No more pinching. And doesn&#x27;t leave marks like my nails wood.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but you have to apply quite of bit of pressure to make it work</li>
            <li> Great sturdy kit, and they email you a skin prep video</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m not using correctly but the instrument hurts and didn&#x27;t extract like I think it should</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of tools. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing. It&#x27;s really helpful in removing my blackheads without having to destroy my nose in the process. Now my pores can be completely clean!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Professional quality with helpful information included.</li>
            <li> Great product, does the job, probably didn&#x27;t need to get the whole kit as I only use a few of the tools in it.</li>
            <li> Easy too use and works great</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kit: Great quality, handy pouch. This kit allows one to gently remove occasional blackheads and small cysts without inflicting permanent damage to the skin. These stainless steel tools insure great control and can be easily kept clean and germ-free - a key requirement to avoid infections, etc.</li>
            <li> 3 of the tools are the same. Would like some I structions for the different tools. Good for the price</li>
            <li> This set has every size needed for every situation. Made well. These won&#x27;t bend under normal use.</li>
            <li> This is a professional quality kit.  The price is quite affordable and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great compact package of products.  I travel a lot so it is really handy to stick this in my daub kit or just bring a couple of tools along with me.  The only issue is it doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions.  Customer service was fantastic in proactively contacting me regarding any issues I may have with the product.  I told them I didn&#x27;t get any instructions and they told me they don&#x27;t have instructions and their policy is to encourage users to watch videos on youtube.  I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; with the different tools on my skin to figure out which one is best.  However they are great tools, it is a great package and their customer service is fantastic - just wish it had a very basic - i.e. one page - list of instructions.</li>
            <li> As good as expected. Variety is great, I&#x27;ve used each since not all my whiteheads are the same in size and texture.  Highly recommended.  Excellent priced at more or less, $15.  I bought my first one at Sephora many years ago for $19, it was longer, but it was only one tool.  I needed the other tools too.</li>
            <li> Love this Blackhead and Blemish Remover kit.  As an Esthetics Instructor I have shared this wonderful find with my students. It has taken the fear out of extractions for my students.  Fantastic quality for the price.  Recommend it to anyone who is in the business or just wants to remove blemishes gently without causing damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> These tools are made of a durable metal and are easy to clean off. They come in a case that is small enough to fit just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> Wonderful kit, with great tools for your face</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic and sterile job of cleaning up the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great...Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product really was a lifesaver for me. I&#x27;ve always had trigger fingers when it comes to popping zits. Now I&#x27;m not destroying my face trying to get at a zit. The tools are made out of a great material and are easy to grip and handle. I usually have to use a thumbtack to clean out the openings, but besides that, all is well.</li>
            <li> They work! I had my doubts but they just work great. I purchased this to help get rid of black heads that show up from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I used the small double hole tool and it&#x27;s fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I would make sure you wash you face first, then use the tool, clean it after use. Do NOT use this right before you go out or go some place, it will leave small circle impressions on your face for about 15 or 20 minutes, and it will  leave little  red dots where the  black head was extracted for about 1 to 2 days depending on your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;Works good and glad I got it for those times some nasty shows up on my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit to replace one extractor I somehow lost.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and I would recommend this to anyone at all who is in need of something like this.  They&#x27;re the same quality as anything else I&#x27;ve seen out there but at a much lower price.  It did not come with instructions so you will need to do a bit of research on how to use each tip.  The one shown in the middle has a tiny hole on one end and a dull, arrow shaped point on the other end.  I have no idea what this one is for and it&#x27;s probably the one that looks the least useful and the roughest, compared to all the others, but the rest look like fine quality, sturdy tools. I love that it comes with a zipper case to hold all the tools.  No way you will misplace this like I had with my other extractor.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Great buy at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super confusing to learn how to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to get blackheads out of ears.  It does the job and while some tools are moreful than others, I did find the &#x27;pick&#x27; took especially useful in piercing the tender skin in the ear making it easier to remove blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a super high quality luxury set, but it is more than sufficient for me. Qualityon par with  what I expected for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned missing pieces.  All pieces were in the included case.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, complete and in excellent condition, definitely has met my expectations</li>
            <li> It looks good but there were no instructions on how to use and I have no clue.  So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and as expected and works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> arrived brand new with steel plating chipped and peeling back . High quality instruments they are not. Highly discourage this purchase. I immediately started returning them literally about an hour after I got them.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping and happy with products !</li>
            <li> #1 Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit is a good product; however, it may be mislabeled. You get your money&#x27;s worth as it contains strong, sturdy, and well made tools with diverse properties. However, I would say this is a &#x27;5-Star Pimple and LARGE Blackhead Remover&#x27;. I have a lot of small blackheads on my nose, and these tools are slightly too large to help me with them. As a result, I did not exactly get what I wanted out of this product. On the other hand, I am very glad I now have it because it will help me with stubborn pimples in the future. Good product. Rename it.</li>
            <li> Good! did not bend like the cheap others I have purchaced</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Many different options in this packet, which applies to various usage.</li>
            <li> Sturdy quality instruments. It does the job and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> this does not seem surgical grade steel.</li>
            <li> So far no problems.  Delivery was prompt, package was in good condition.  My Daughter used one of the tools and it worked as stated in the description,</li>
            <li> My toddler suffers from the virus molluscum, which produces small white knots on his body. This is a great tool to &#x27;push&#x27; the virus out. Good quality and good tools for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is well made and is nicely organized in the included carrying case. The one thing I wised it came with is an instruction manual for the many tools. There is a general idea of each tool but being an engineer I would like to know the specifics to ensure I maximize what the tool was designed for.</li>
            <li> This is a very good deal for the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought similar tools before. These are the worst! They&#x27;re too thick and bulky to work. They don&#x27;t really do anything. Total waste of money. Wish I had not lost my last set!</li>
            <li> Why do people buy these sets. Not worth five and I paid 12.</li>
            <li> I think this product is well made and all, but I should have realized that I have no business attacking my face with these kinds of tools.  The poker thing worked a little too well for me and I&#x27;ve never had any luck with the other pieces &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; out the bad stuff.  I think you need some training before messing around with this kit, so be forewarned.</li>
            <li> I requested this item as part of a promotion which gave me a discount if I promised to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have a lot of blackhead issues with otherwise clear skin, and I have tried a ton of options for removing them (Creams, those things you stick on your face and rip off, exfoliation to the point of almost torture... ) so this was sort of a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product (the next day) I tried it out without really looking into how to use it.  This honestly led to a bunch of tiny little red circles on my face which went away in about an hour.  So I tried again, this time reading the instructions and doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  Not only did it remove every black head I could find it cleared out ones I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  I was almost obsessed with it. It was actually kind of hard to stop using it because I was so excited! (Srsly, like addictive..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really understand all the different sizes or the very scary thing that looks like a weapon, but I was able to use one instrument to remove ALL the blackheads on my face and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was just pushing it all back in and causing bigger problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep checking for more so I can use it again because I am just absolutely thrilled that I finally found something that works, but nothing yet..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to lose this set I would pay twice what they are asking for a replacement, I wish they gave clearer instructions on the sizes but other than that I am sold.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It comes in a nice carrying case which is perfect for storing and keeping clean.  Like the other reviewers on here, I&#x27;m not a professional so once you&#x27;ve taught yourself how to use it, it works very well.  I have never had a bad problem with blackheads but I&#x27;ve recently been getting them and this kit does the trick.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product as long as you know what you&#x27;re doing it helps clear up you&#x27;re face right  away</li>
            <li> GREAT assortment of exfoliating tools!!</li>
            <li> This kit is the s*** I love it</li>
            <li> After first receiving this product, it took a few days to get used to using it.  It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but practice and patience made it easy to learn to use.  The seller also sent an email making sure I was using this properly, which was very considerate imo.  Two of the tools seem to be the same, so you really only receive 4 different variations...  But with 2 different ends on each tool, you will have a variety of 8 different types to use.  As for the material it seems to be made of stainless steel type material.. Each tool is definitely not flimsy, and feels like I was get alot of use out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;  As for personal opinion, each tool has some weight to it, which gives the impression of being sturdy (I like the weight, not too much.. not too little).  The case that it comes with is just a generic case.. nothing special, but if this is what holds you back from buying a product, I&#x27;d reconsider.  Overall this is the first type of purchase, so my experience in the differences between brands would be negligible.  The only question I ask myself is &amp;#34;Would I buy this again?&amp;#34;.  Yes I would.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and case</li>
            <li> Whiteheads have always been a problem in my life since high school and I would nearly spend every day trying to remove them from my nose and cheeks. I remember my mom buying a tool similar to one of these, but it was fragile an broke easily. I&#x27;ve relegated to using toothpicks/finger nails, even though it was harmful. Luckily I&#x27;ve found these tools, and they are exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are very high quality. they are very sturdy and they don&#x27;t feel like they will bend. They are also an excellent value: I remember when my mom just bought 1 tool for around 5 bucks. Now you have five tools all for a much more reasonable price. There is a diverse set of tools: You&#x27;ll always have the right size and shape to get any pimple/whitehead out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints is that I find the tools tend to come out of their holds. I don&#x27;t really care as I leave mine open most of the time. but some people might be surprised to open up the holder and find the tools all over the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great kit and I know it will be with me for a long time. I highly recommend it; in fact I recently got another set for my friend. Make sure you watch some youtube videos first before attempting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the manufactures for providing me with a discounted review unit. All opinions and experiences are genuine and completely my own.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do. No red marks or scarring when used according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> Works well for its intended purpose. Comes nicely packaged and is easy to store.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Only used one of the tools so far and learning to use the rest but very useful.</li>
            <li> I do like this set..i only find myself using one or maybe two of the tools. I think I need a better explanation of how to use them. Ive watched some youtube videos and they were helpful but I would like to have some detailed instructions specific to the set.</li>
            <li> Great kit.  Just what we&#x27;ve been looking for.  Professional looking and feel.</li>
            <li> could come with some instructions as to what tool is for what and how to use..looks like they are well made tools though.</li>
            <li> I initially posted a negative comment regarding this item as I had only received 4/5 tools. Since then the company very quickly reached out to me and ensured that I got the full set. I have tried all these tools and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Hurt the face more than help</li>
            <li> Updated 2/24/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating my rating because a representative from Equinox immediately shipped a second kit, as the original set that I received was missing tools. Great customer service, and quick to rectify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, two fingers are more effective than the tools in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some of the other negative reviews, I was shipped a case with the tools missing. Seems there isn&#x27;t quality control on this item.</li>
            <li> Missing 3 of the 5 instruments.</li>
            <li> r/popping sent me here. This product is everything I dreamed it would be.</li>
            <li> great little kit for a thorough facial, took awhile to get here but I use it all the time. I do wish the poker was a bit sharper but still gets the job done! there are enough tools in this kit to get those white and black head out of there!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping!!! Highly recommend seller. Thank you for the purchase.</li>
            <li> the tools are a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t work well unless pressing hard on the spot. Also receive 2 of the same tool.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way just what I wanted professional quality!</li>
            <li> These kit is really nice. You can choose from different styles for a specific skin needs. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. It&#x27;s made from high quality material and surely won&#x27;t scratch your face or leave an unwanted mark. It comes with a really nice pouch that you can carry when you travel or just at home to keep them organize.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t really work for me because I guess the blackheads on my nose aren&#x27;t that big...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re just little bumps. I guess I&#x27;ll have to use those charcoal strips.</li>
            <li> Really well made and very professional. Everyone should have a set in their bathroom supplies.</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was pretty much exactly what was promised. . . and it was much cheaper (and more complete) than many other sets sold at the stores where I live. However, at the same time I bought this I also bought a few other face-care products online and they were just as good (and  in some cases even better for small pimples and blackheads) for a cheaper price. So, my advice-- if you need a complete set this is good, if you just need something basic, like a small pimple/blackhead remover, I&#x27;d keep looking and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Kit is missing the tool with the pointed tip that is shown int he center of the product picture.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my face. Removes blemishes easily. Definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> Got it for my teenage son and he is amazed at how it really works. Wished I would have bought this sooner for him.</li>
            <li> Product is poorly made.</li>
            <li> These did not work as I hoped they would. I bought them for my grandson who has mild acne. They seem to be well made and came in a nice zippered case. They were shipped and arrived right away. Maybe my grandson just doesn&#x27;t know how to use them properly but they didn&#x27;t do what he expected. He was not able to remove blackheads and whiteheads with them at all, maybe one or two with a lot of effort that seemed to cause even more damage to his skin than squeezing.</li>
            <li> I can do the same extractions my aesthetition does, but for free! Its easy to use and extremely satisfying  :-) I would recommend this company over others because they have excellent customer service and came with five different sizes, when others only come  with one. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a comedome extractor.</li>
            <li> Kit is everything as written.</li>
            <li> Nice little case. Note that all the loops are rounded and not sharp. I expected them to be razor like, but nonetheless they work great.</li>
            <li> At the beginning of the year, I was at the spa, and the lady giving me a facial had one of these nifty blackhead and blemish removers. It just basically took care of all of my blackheads. When I was offered a coupon to review the item, I knew I had to try it! It works so amazingly well! I have tried to many products to get rid of the blackheads on my nose, and NOTHING worked. This was quick and easy to use. I love that it has many different sizes to use on the different areas of your face! Great product!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great tool set.  High quality and does what it should.  The one star deduction is only for the fact I had to go online and figure out the proper use for each tool.  I plan on buying a few more for stocking stuffers this Christmas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Been using it and it&#x27;s great!! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Quality product, just as described.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner and was the product that was advertised. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. I just need to learn to use the tools properly.</li>
            <li> We bought two kits, one for the wife the other for our teenage son. Both like their kits very much. Both arrived in perfect condition and next day.</li>
            <li> A couple of pieces are useful, others not so much.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good it pulls everything out and it comes in a nice case to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> This was not at all what I expected. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great kit, does the job well.</li>
            <li> These tools are well made. The case is handy to keep the tools together.  Gently use a diabetic lancet to start, as it has a tiny sharp blade, which doesn&#x27;t leave scarring. Wash the tools off with hot water and soap, then dry.  Wipe with alcohol and allow to dry again.</li>
            <li> its just not what I expected, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is really good high quality and sterile tools.</li>
            <li> I found the kit to be quite helpful with majority of my pimples. I learned a bit after on how to take caution of my skin. Using this makes you feel more relieved after getting everything out.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Finally a way to take care of pimples and black heads without scratching your skin and making them look worst! So far, this kit has taken care of problems 100% of the time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, everything I expected and more! Easy to use and quality tools.</li>
            <li> Total works and good quality</li>
            <li> came missing one tool and the tools didnt even work</li>
            <li> It works sooo good and after ther isnt any red marks works like a charm!!!!! Best remover ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Using this is so much better than your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was this white-head type thing above my lip that was driving me nuts for months and I was actually able to extract it using one of the tools. As long as you keep up on cleaning it before and after each use, there should not be any issues.</li>
            <li> Works like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with his kit, i used one time because i saw a whitehead in my forehead and i used it&#x27;s was like a magic&lt;br /&gt;no scars, nothing&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much :)&lt;br /&gt;ill never regret to buy this product</li>
            <li> I had an extractor stick when I lived in Japan and haven&#x27;t been able to find one in the states quite like it. This kit has it all! Very good.</li>
            <li> gets all of my nasty blackheads and pimples out. love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t think they are great quality because I have another one that I bought at a drug store and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Some on the holes are off center, and none of them work great.  The scraper thing made my nose bleed.  The poppers just hurt. Went back to using my finger nails.  Does not work like the old school one I had in the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I receive them 3 days ago and do not know how to use them all!</li>
            <li> The bag is a. It smaller than I thought but all the 5tools are still there I just need to learn how to use them</li>
            <li> Thought this would make it easier for teenager and pre teen to remove large blackheads that are causing scarring when removed the old fashioned way. This doesn&#x27;t work at all for either of them.</li>
            <li> Seller very helpful and item very nice quality. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wish I could find clear instructions anywhere at all about WHICH of these tools to use on what...or maybe each is for a different part of the face I have ZERO clue</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the institution on how to use them.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Came with directions on How to use it. Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Great transaction, item as promised and delivered before promised. Loving it!</li>
            <li> I received my Blackhead remover case today and used it on my husband, I was impressed with the tools in it for what you need. He is always in dirt and his pores get clogged so it was nice to have different tools to help him remove the dirt from the pours. They are made with sturdy metal and they are not cheap or flimsy. Easy to grab and hold. I&#x27;m glad they finally came out with a product like this</li>
            <li> Only came with 3 of the 5 tools.</li>
            <li> started rusting within a week, how can we use a rusted tool on face.</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the look out for tools to help me with my art and craft/hobby with miniatures and these proved to fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small warning if you buy this, you will get three emails asking how you like the tools, if there is any questions their customer service could help answer and the like. A good thing to know that you aren&#x27;t just a number to this company, if you are buying it to help with skin care.</li>
            <li> Buy for friend..it&#x27;s great and also the express was fast.</li>
            <li> Hi, this product was purchased for my wife and she is quite satisfied with it. It was brand new and came in a neat little package. One improvement though, the pieces could have been labeled as there were five different pieces but great product.. Very sturdy and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this one star was because it was delivered on time. Don&#x27;t buy this product. The edges are too sharp and/or too thick and either cuts into the skin. Because of the thickness of some of the extractors, more than extreme pressure is needed to even try to get out blackheads. I tried to use on three different areas of the body, even after steaming, and was not able to extract anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Nice variety of tool sizes and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think it works but can be a little painful. Unless I&#x27;m not using it correctly. But the product really works</li>
            <li> These tools are well made and excellant quality. They do make removing blemishs much easier and do not damage the skin.</li>
            <li> I received everything that comes with this kit. I also received the product on time and it is worth the cost. I give a five star rating! Thank you</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to actually use a tool to remove blackheads, instead of the alternative...especially since they work, really well!  It makes way more sense, and no risk of scarring.</li>
            <li> no good for my little problem.</li>
            <li> Very effective, professional results</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Arrived in a timely fashion, and it is exactly what was promised.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far with no issue.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works beautifully.  Seller is very eager to make certain that the buyer is satisfied and that the product is satisfactory which it certainly is.</li>
            <li> Many products for little price, nice storage case. All in all a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works great! They come with general instructions, so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the tools I&#x27;d recommend a YouTube video or contacting the sellers customer support.</li>
            <li> This kit is great!! it is exactly what is pictured on-line. I have seen a lot of videos on-line and these are the same tools that the Dr.&#x27;s use. They are very strong and of excellent quality. I highly recommend this if you are looking to safely and easily remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Got it fast, works wonderful.  Bought it for pimples and it is very efficient!</li>
            <li> Good price and good tool. Very good tool and does a great job at taking out blackheads and pimples. I solve my problem. With this little money it&#x27;s good. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed on how well this works.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and is exactly what I expected it to be. I would purchase fro this seller again. 4 out of 5 stars because it did not come with any type of instructions or description for use.</li>
            <li> As described, it came in a nice case, which is great for storage etc. These tools are invaluable and so much less damaging than using your fingers/fingernails. Get these!</li>
            <li> Beautiful case with all the tools.the price is unbelievable perfect gift... I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use each piece properly, but it really does work...I have acne really bad &amp; I pick at my face all the time leaving scars from my nails, but not anymore!!! It really does work &amp; I&#x27;m sure once I learn how to correctly use each instrument I&#x27;ll like the kit even more...I hear they&#x27;re are plenty of useful videos on YouTube...</li>
            <li> High quality and fair price.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything to remove those unwanted skin imperfections and much more sanitary to extract clogged pores than using your fingernails.  To get all of the instruments for the price is unbeatable.  I&#x27;ve seen a single tool go for almost the price of this kit.</li>
            <li> Nice product for all the pimple obsessed like myself :D</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I got the kit and saw that the instruments were heavy duty and made well. Also the holder is very sleek and stores each item in its own slot.</li>
            <li> Thus far I am struggling to use the tools effectively, but I suspect this could have more to do with my ignorance than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Good product. It does well enough, just really painful to use!</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday and the tools feel like a very good quality. The only thing that ducks is that there&#x27;s no instructions... I mean... how can there not be any instructions. It was a nice cute box and great packaging but... I mean come on. This can cause more damage than good. Cause theres nothing to say what goes where. That&#x27;s the only thing that made me give this 3 stars. For the those who don&#x27;t have time to be surfing the web or looking at a bunch of YouTube videos, this may be frustrating.</li>
            <li> Two tools were missing, and another was quite poorly made.  They also seemed like a return - open packaging and a spot on one, but I&#x27;ll give the benefit of the doubt on that one. Attempting return now....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this kit as yet, because it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions, and had to look online for help in how to use,&lt;br /&gt;but haven&#x27;t found anything as yet, that clearly demonstrates how to use each of the 5 tools included. Looks like a nice&lt;br /&gt;kit, but can&#x27;t use as yet.</li>
            <li> Love this kit!  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 1 month and it&#x27;s been so helpful!  I wish the sharp tool was a bit sharper, but it will do.  Seriously wish I had this kit years ago!  As some have mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but simply go to YouTube.com and search for &amp;#34;acne extractions&amp;#34;.  Some of the videos are gross, but it gives you an idea of how it works.  Don&#x27;t forget to be gentle with your skin :)  I personally have had some of the best results after using a clay mask that helps pull the gunk out of my pores, then I can get any other stuff that&#x27;s still a bit stuck with these tools.  For the price you truly can&#x27;t go wrong!  1 YEAR UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this kit for almost a year and I still love it!  I use it all the time and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!  It&#x27;s also held up extremely well - the tools, the case, the elastic tool holders, etc. all still looks like new!</li>
            <li> Caved and bought this set because it&#x27;s the only one sold in America. The one I ordered for $2 from China has probably been lost in the mail. This set is really helpful to get those blemishes gone early and often. Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best deal on blemish and blackhead removing tools on Amazon due to the fact that it&#x27;s a 10 in one package instead of having to buy them all separately.  The metal appears to be cheaper drop forge steel, but it doesn&#x27;t really need to be surgical grade or anything as long as you keep them sanitary. The carrying case is decent and has a small suede flap on the inside so the tools don&#x27;t rub against each other. Haven&#x27;t found a use for them all yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually!</li>
            <li> It is definitely not what I expected. It is not professional grade, but pretty cheaply made.  I only attempted to use one of the tools, but with no results.  I am hoping to find if they have a return policy and send it back. If you are looking for a quality product, you probably shouldn&#x27;t start here.</li>
            <li> Great little kit, very good price, I love finally having a set of these tools. I am a man, and I like to buy the proper tool for the job, and these are the proper tools.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good for the most part. I just need to find a technique that works for me. Definitely not as painful as popping things with your fingers and more clean.</li>
            <li> Great fit. Feel great.</li>
            <li> harsh and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Most of my reviews are very high (4-5 stars) when I purchase on Amazon but this is one of a very few that is not acceptable. The tools were not clean and unknown debris and hair is inside the case. The lancing tool is not sharp, not sure how it is supposed to &amp;#34;lance&amp;#34; anything.</li>
            <li> just as advertised.  Highly recommend both the seller and the product.</li>
            <li> This works like magic.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t exactly figured these all out yet that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it full stars. There&#x27;s a lot to this kit. I am still trying to figure all the tools out.</li>
            <li> It kinda works...I&#x27;ve seen how others do it, but when I try it, I just can&#x27;t reproduce the results.  Maybe everyone&#x27;s skin is just different.  As with other reviewers, it does leave a an impression for a while, and this is normal.  I just don&#x27;t know if where the impression sits, damage is being done underneath while the main attraction is being fixed....so does pressing on your skin like that make things go wrong in the long run?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well.... I had a hard time getting any results.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are high quality. However, there are not instructions included with the kit. Since there are five different tools of varying shapes and configurations, it would be helpful to know what each one is for. That&#x27;s why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> so ive always had an issue with acne but this actually really helps.&lt;br /&gt;just be careful when using it, and maybe watch a few tutorials on how to use it, but it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;really reccomend to anyone with acne or pimples</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t order this one, but it seems like a decent product!</li>
            <li> Works great the utensils fall out of the case though. The case leaves a small hole on end when it is closed</li>
            <li> Came with an implement missing and interior was dusty</li>
            <li> This is exactly as it is described, maybe better.  It is surgical steel,Mao it feels very solid in your hand, nothing is going to bend or break.  I would recommend it.  I still don&#x27;t know how to use it very well, but I did get contacted by the company soon after I received it and they gave good advice and instructions on how to use it.  I am still trying, but it&#x27;s not because of the product.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Everything was exactly as described. No problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also,  top notch customer service. They sent me two emails checking to see if I was happy with the product complete with PDF manuals on how to use the product. Honestly, other companies should follow their example of customer service.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I find that only 1 of the tools (the small loop) works effectively for me. The other tools don&#x27;t seem super helpful, but may do the trick if you have severe acne. The case seems pretty durable too. My only complaint would be that the elastic loops holding each tool in the case are not very tight, so the tools tend to slip out if you hold the base upright while open. Otherwise, good product!</li>
            <li> Have used several implements and this kit works as advertised.  Satisfied with the purchase and the customer service that stands behind the product!  Seller emails tips on how to use and this very helpful to use these implements!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Quality  instruments.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and there are extras for me to inevitably lose.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit. I would recommend it for sure. The one that is for opening pimples, although I haven&#x27;t used it looks like it could be larger than a needle so I am not sure if it&#x27;s great, but, the other ones are. You will be glad  you got it. Especially the one that is a more sturdy piece, it works great. I think everyone is different so you may like the others ones better. I think it&#x27;s a great kit. Seems to be well made also.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; this kit provides a variety of tools for various depths and areas of your face and of course for differing types of blemishes.  Some of the tools require careful use, others are precise and work well with more pressure.  Of course, if you are unfamiliar with how to use this kit, you should go to youtube and watch some videos by professionals/dermatologists.  Otherwise, this is a useful kit for the arsenal of beauty products necessary for maintaining blemish-free skin.  PLEASE REMEMBER, these tools are made of METAL and if used improperly and forcefully they will damage your skin.  However, the ridged handles are easy to grip and slow and careful manipulation will get you the results you want.  Thanks Equinox for putting all of these tools in one kit!  RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit to remove whiteheads and it does work. I would advise that the instructions included in the kit are followed. There are many different tools and one will be the most appropriate for the task. Patience is required for deeply imbedded blemishes. If you are overzealous you will damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Great blackhead remover! My husband has this blackhead that keeps coming back and I could never get all the crap out! These tools are amazing! It&#x27;s been a month since I&#x27;ve used these tools to remove the blackhead and they have not returned!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Great instructions.  Easy to clean and store!  Must have travel case makes this especially nice.  Thank you for a great product! Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality product</li>
            <li> I thought it would perform better than it does. :(</li>
            <li> Love all my products at a cheap price! !!</li>
            <li> received this earlier than the estimated date. Although it did not have any instructions included to show how to properly use the instruments.</li>
            <li> A nice set of tools for a good price.  They get the job done!</li>
            <li> As described:). I bought this to deal with blackheads on nose and hard to squeeze places. There is a trick to using these tools so I suggest as others have to review some on line videos.  Seems to work really good on nose, not so great on forehead or chin.</li>
            <li> Even though I only know how to use a couple of the tools, they are the most effective ones for me. So much easier to use than fingers for sure. It feels so great to get those nasty blackheads out. Only downside, there are no instructions as to how to use all of the tools properly. Hence, the reason I only use mainly one. That I&#x27;ve seen at spas, getting a facial. My eyes were mostly closed then, so I only remember the one tool... Overall, great price, and great results.</li>
            <li> Product does what it ment to do.  I like that I receive a open one and because I feld it would be unsanitary to use customer care just exchange it without any problems.</li>
            <li> this was a good purchase</li>
            <li> If I knew tools like this were available for purchase by non-medical professionals...I would have purchased them years ago! It quickly and painlessly clears black heads with no scarring. A little temporary redness was all that remained. I would recommend this kit to anyone!</li>
            <li> be careful, applying pressure to my face in order to remove left hickey type bruises, i probably look worse than if i just left the blackhead</li>
            <li> They come in real handy for relieving blemishes or pimples. But beware in the hands of your wife or significant other they will become addicted to them and chase you down for a chance to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; on you!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have purchased this a LOOONG time ago!  We have been through many &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34; tools over the years and none have served us as well as this efficient little kit!</li>
            <li> All was as expected - these things work amazingly</li>
            <li> Like a gun cleaning case for you face and body.</li>
            <li> This may sound weird, but I got it as a gift for my boyfriend. It really does help squeezing out blackheads, but remember to clean it with rubbing alcohol before using it.</li>
            <li> Great kit. However, i quickly realized I only really needed that 1 tool with the wire loop. Sturdy construction, good grips. Well made.</li>
            <li> It gets all the gunk out.</li>
            <li> Fine product, delivered early</li>
            <li> these tools were all thicker and bulkier than I expected for facial tools. Not what my dermatologist uses - one is very sharp. The others all have looped hooks - no instructions on how to use any of them.</li>
            <li> It can be the best if the user guide attached.. Many time tried to remove the blackhead but i couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The extraction tools have too thick of metal for the extraction tip.  I found three out of the five tools useful, hence the 3/5 stars.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This kit works great.</li>
            <li> Came with tools missing, only received 4 and I believe it may have been used prior and returned. No thank you</li>
            <li> Very good product. There are several tools to help in difficult to reach areas. Minimizes skin trauma when removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. Not sharp at all and really works. The only negative is sliding the tools back into the small elastic bands that secure them in the case. thwy need a little help getting back in. Guess they don&#x27;t want to be put away ;)</li>
            <li> Have to apply alot of pressure but it works. Does leave a red mark for a day but much better thans scratching the skin with fingernails</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. So I&#x27;m careful with how I use these, but anyone who says their skin was bothered by these probably isn&#x27;t using them with cautious pressure, failed to sterilize the tools with rubbing alcohol or didn&#x27;t steam open their pores before using these tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True they didn&#x27;t come with instructions, but there are plenty of pieces of advice all over the internet. Common sense says open your pores and keep the tools clean.</li>
            <li> It has been great so far, easy to use and the order came in quickly.</li>
            <li> Not as good as what was used during my last facial but its OK.</li>
            <li> Quality of the equipment is easily worth the price tag. The black case they come in is not great but it gets the job done and the equipment is what you pay for not the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  case is small fits anywhere I absolutely love this for everyday use after a hot bath and right after I remove my Aztec clay mask works great together</li>
            <li> This set is comprised of what appear to be superior, professional medical-quality instruments. While I am not a medical professional or cosmetologist, I have used many different medical instruments to help in various home repair projects, jewelry making, and crafts projects, so I feel I am qualified to make such a statement. While I did try one of the instruments, it left a red indentation that made me think I wasn&#x27;t using the proper size or something, so I ceased until I could You-Tube or some other such instructive video, to insure I didn&#x27;t damage surrounding tissue. My bad not the quality of the kit. Would help if set came with instructions for the various instruments . . . Liability issues or something? I would recommend the purchase of this product, as I can tell I will have these instruments to use for years to come. The kit has a variety of instruments that should assist with a variety of cosmetological uses. Would definitely purchase if I was a professional. Even the zipper case is made of good material and craftsmanship that should stay viable for many years.</li>
            <li> I like the box I am able to put some needles and tweezers in it and have a full kit of /r/popping</li>
            <li> This works enough said!</li>
            <li> never knew such tools existed!  very useful!  hopefully, scars are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife after she started having a lot of blackheads it&#x27;s cheap and affective. Nothing better then that 👌</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected. Well described and delivered on time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The tools work great. However, the first time it arrived, it was missing one tool. I requested a replacement and this time, two tools were missing!</li>
            <li> It does what it has to do. Trustful seller and great product</li>
            <li> I love this product it helped out so much with my blackhead problem on my face. My face looks so clear thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I need all the tools in this kit, but it is perfect for extracting the hard to eliminate white/black heads. I am very dilligent with my skin care process, but I have large pores that collect that awful white oil after a day. Using this kit, with other skin care products has helped my skin. Just make sure you sterilize the tools and wash and use an astringent after extracting so you don&#x27;t develop those small pore infections. Done right, it is a great product. Be careful...</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Looked up how to use it and I didn&#x27;t realize how painful it actually is but it works great.</li>
            <li> No instructions included.  Some of the metal isn&#x27;t smooth and cuts.</li>
            <li> i got it at discounted price. I like it, its nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of using this properly to remove black heads, slowly I&#x27;m getting better at it. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars became I thought it would be easier to use.</li>
            <li> Great items work very well</li>
            <li> Eh... not what I thought.  I saw a bunch of cool YouTube videos on extracting blackheads and bumps, but I think using my two fingers is better than this.  Maybe you have to have REALLY bad issues for this to be beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to push so hard to extract anything, it left indentions WAY worse than even my fingernails.  I was actually worried about bruising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try it, but it was a bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars, cause I gave it to my 6 year old to play doctor on her dolls...</li>
            <li> Really great product! The tools look very professional, and it&#x27;s a pleasure to use them. However, instructions on uses of the tools are not present, just as a warning. But overall, the tools are excellent!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and even better customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> These do not seem hygienic enough to use on the face. The tools are rough, and not smooth...I couldn&#x27;t even bear to try using them.</li>
            <li> What a fun little gadget! Things came out of my face that I didn&#x27;t even know was there. Amazing for those stubborn blackheads around the nose. I used this on my boyfriends back and weirdly enjoyed watching this work, haha. Even the most stubborn blackheads made their way out. However, I did put up with some dramatic sound effects from him in the process (what a baby). Just remember to steralize with alcohol before and after every use!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product, was able to use it easily no matter where I was. Top notch-high quality and shipped in time expected. Definitely recommend this over its competitors.</li>
            <li> Very efficient for an affordable price</li>
            <li> Every thing is high quality very durable, im very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Hard to find anything like this is store. Well made and great for acne or blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love the carrying case and the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are everything you need for blackheads and blemishes. :)</li>
            <li> Waste of money, returned it back.</li>
            <li> worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Although it does not come with a lot of instructions. Materials are made well enough to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> There are some things about this product I like and some that I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice case with several tools. The tools work OK except for a big flaw, they&#x27;re not polished perfectly and have scratched my face on many occasions.&lt;br /&gt;One of the tools is especially hard on my face. It has a tiny metal fiber that scratches my face. Also, one of the tools has already broken.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> Most of the kit is useless. Not really worth the price or time. I do however like the kit and how easy it is to use and then put away.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great price. High quality.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit. The only piece missing would be a very small lancet. The one in the case is too big.</li>
            <li> Product arrived missing a piece.  I contacted Equinox by email and received replacement within 2 days.  Service was great.  My daughter is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and appreciated the follow up and handy instruction manual. I will be certain to recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a handy kit to have.  I have a bad habit of bruising myself when I have a blackhead/zit or making a scar. These help me not to do that. Customer service is awesome also.</li>
            <li> lots of neat gizmos with no instructions on how to use!  I still have blackheads because I don&#x27;t want to scar up my face by doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Returned it because it failed my quality control inspection. One of the instruments looked defective when it was being produced. Didn&#x27;t look shines and new like the others; instead, it looked like it was burned, never polished. I fear that it could end up getting rusted and give me tetanus!! 😳 Not Cool!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> These things are the furthest thing from professional. They are total JUNK!! Stainless? Really, how the heck are they rusted in the package? I returned them within 5 minutes of opening the package from Amazon. Don’t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very professional looking kit. Does the job, I would recommended practicing on small areas at a time before going crazy on your face. Be careful not to push to hard, you don&#x27;t wanna scrape your skin off and leave scabs!! I definitely recommend if you have trouble with large/clogged pores.</li>
            <li> the sharp tool is sharp enough to pop a blister or help you get to a splinter, but for excising milia, I found it is not fine or sharp enough, and still had to use a syringe needle.  It arrived on time, as described, and is a good heavy metal.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Great product!</li>
            <li> these work great. I like all the different sizes and varieties that this set comes with.&lt;br /&gt;it comes with 5 different sizes for all different kind of blackhead an blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;it isn&#x27;t painful at all and you barely have to push an compared to my fingers trying to push my pimples out it doesn&#x27;t leave my face all red or scared.</li>
            <li> I find these tools difficult to use.  If I have a ready-to-pop zit, the product is ok.  But I haven&#x27;t been able to successfully use these for blackheads or smaller blemishes.  Even watching a bunch of &#x27;how-to&#x27; videos didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> It works great! The materials are high quality and easy to use. The package is beautiful and useful and Amazon send it very fast!&lt;br /&gt;The customer service works very great. They sent me emails to tell about product detail, how to use, sending status and check everything was great.&lt;br /&gt;However, you have to watch or learn how to use each of them correctly because it can make you hurt or can leave a scar on your face.&lt;br /&gt;You can search the videos on Youtube, everything has post already!</li>
            <li> i lovre this kit, works for me.</li>
            <li> This blackhead and blemish remover kit is packed with all the tools you need to remove or extract a pimple. I was surprised at all the tool options in the kit. It comes in a nice zipper case so you can keep all of the tools together. I received this as part of a special promotion to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I received this kit a few days ago and am very pleased with my purchase; definitely 5 stars. Being a licensed esthetician, I use these instruments on clients. The instructions on how to care for the instruments were clear and accurate, as they fall in line with NYS guidelines.</li>
            <li> Great set! All the tools are very workable and useful!</li>
            <li> * For those that don&#x27;t know how to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; your pimples correctly (like me) this tool is AMAZING! Wish I got this WAY sooner so I could have prevented past scars from popping incorrectly as my skin is sensitive. Don&#x27;t hesitate, get it and zap those pimples or white/blackheads without scarring your skin!</li>
            <li> The moment I received this Equinox International Blackhead and Blemish kit I got excited and gotten wait to use it on my first &amp;#34;patient&amp;#34; as ai felt like a surgeon. The tools look so cool. I love the little black travel case that comes with all the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles on all of the pieces are textured which prevents your fingers from slipping off and gives you really good hand control and therefore help with precision removal. Before I tested it out on my hubby I cleaned them with rubbing alcohol and did the same after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has acne or blackhead issues should most definitely get this.  It can be a little painful doing it but it makes a difference if you use the right one. I didn&#x27;t get an instruction book or paper and wished it came with one as ai was clueless as to what to use but I did my research on the internet. Even though you have 5 pieces in your case ot is more like having 10 as each ends have uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a promotional rate and all views and feedback are 100% of my own. This is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> These tools are awesome for popping pimples or making blackheads disappear if you know how to correctly use them. First and foremost, before using any of these tools, make sure you sterilize them so that it doesn&#x27;t get the area you wish to pick at infected. I feel like it&#x27;s a trail and error when you&#x27;re using these tools. There&#x27;s plenty of youtube videos on how to use them or you can just test it yourself. Loved that this came in a case for you to store all the tools all in one place and keep them clean. I like this because I tend to lose my tools all the time and I don&#x27;t want to buy another product to store them in.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good quality. thank you!</li>
            <li> It works but so do tweezers</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality of this kit considering the price.  Multiple tools and a carrying case made for a good deal here.  I recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my old tools. Was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools came dirty. Even after soaking and scrubbing with alcohol, I&#x27;d have black residue on my hands after handling the tools. Even the inside of the carrying case wasn&#x27;t very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t really trust to use this on my face due to the condition it came in.</li>
            <li> Great product , got it for my Friend who has a acne problem . Got the blackheads out like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but I wish the tools had more variety.</li>
            <li> This item is useless, basically just wasting money. It is hard for me to give negative feedback, but this item is really awful.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; you can have a facial at home without the expense.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product.</li>
            <li> This is a handy kit to have around. Sometimes I get really hard to get, painful blackheads. These tools have been amazing to have on hand. They are easy to use. They remove the blackheads quickly and easily. There are lot of tools to choose from so if one doesn&#x27;t get it, another is sure to. They come in a very nice, well made case. Nice and compact, with all tools secure. *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> After receiving this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first thing I decided to do was wash my face and grab my magnifying mirror as suggested on the box. I normally use tweezers and grabbed them thinking i might need them with this kit. Well needles to say the kit is easier to use than I thought and I did not use my tweezers at all which was unexpected. My favorite tool is the mini circle one which works amazingly well. After trying them all I also realized it didn&#x27;t hurt one bit. Each tool works as expected and I highly recommend this to all my friends that are constantly trying to attack the blackheads and zits they have. Great kit.</li>
            <li> The tools do their job and they&#x27;re easy to sanitize.</li>
            <li> Came in on time, and all the pieces were there. Is working great so far!</li>
            <li> It was helpful in the removal of brackheads.. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. .</li>
            <li> Love all the different sizes and types but not as good of quality as I had hoped….</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!! :)</li>
            <li> I wish they told you the proper use of this product</li>
            <li> Poor quality instruments and not a good idea to anywhere near your skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.</li>
            <li> GREAT!!! The Equinox Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit - 5 Professional Surgical Instruments arrived 2 days after I placed the order. It is in a nice black leather case and all the instruments are VERY nice and solid!! I would definitely order from this company again. For the price I received 3 times more then I could get in a store!! I&#x27;m always happy for a good buy and this definitely is one!!</li>
            <li> nice product and easy to clean and sanitize.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast delivery- terrific extractors and nice case.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped timely and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> No instruction&#x27;s please consult a dermatoligist</li>
            <li> Depending on the type of extraction needed this kit has the one to do the job. Worked on mine. I get bumps that don&#x27;t go away and start out small until they are huge, and with this I can use the tool with the hole in it to push straight down and get the crap out while it&#x27;s small before they get to be huge blueberry sized bumps.</li>
            <li> - Fantastic for removing blackheads. Pretty painful, but it works wonders. Used it on my nose where I removed a disgustingly large amount of sebum. Now I am no longer so self conscious about the blackheads/lack of. It appears that because my skin is so oily on my nose that the blackheads will return soon :/ currently using salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide as well.</li>
            <li> Would not recommended this purchase cheap looking and the case is wrinkled and looks homemade</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> When I opened my package, a long, black, wavy hair was embedded in the zipper of the tool case, as well as touching the tools. Since this is something you use on your face, I figured the company would be a little bit more careful about the sterilization and packaging  procedures. The tool case also smells like a mixture of moth balls and pot, which isn&#x27;t exactly appealing. I&#x27;ve sterilized the tools and they work fine, but I will not be using this company again.</li>
            <li> Package arrived promptly - but of the 5 tools in this kit as advertised, it only had one tool. The remaining spots were totally empty. How can this happen? I have asked for a replacement - but very frustrating that this would happen at all. Someone is being very incompetent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it comes in a handy carrier case. I wish it came with instructions though. But looked it up on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping it would. I also don&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t come with a manual. It should be me (and probably a lot of other people too) don&#x27;t know the differences between each tool. It&#x27;s all pretty painful to press down with it, especially around my nose area. My boyfriend also thought it was really painful.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling and light so you can carry it on the go. For an amazing price you get 5 tools. They look clean and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin. The best part about this kit is that the tools really help and make it easier to get rid of those pesky blackheads! Overall, this is a must have and clear your skin.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but seems like if you have blackheads on your nose you need a little bit of fat or else it hurts and doesn&#x27;t get anything.</li>
            <li> I would have been nice if this product wasn&#x27;t already used before I received it. 👎</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good set of tools.  They feel sturdy and the case is a pretty cool way to keep them all together.  The case itself looks like a nice makeup case.  I won&#x27;t travel with all of these tools but if you would, it would be perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I am not a dermatologist, but I have found this product incredibly useful in removing blackheads from around my nose and clearing my skin of pimples. A thing to note is that if you only buy this product because you watch black head popping videos on YouTube you&#x27;re going to be greatly disappointed with this product. These are tools dermatologists use and should be handled professionally and with an educated hand.</li>
            <li> As described and good quality!</li>
            <li> Kit has multiple heads in the kit for every crevice a blackhead can hide. Good purchase..</li>
            <li> It does remove blackheads, but if you&#x27;re not careful, you can really damage your face. I used it 1x week for a bit, and my face started peeling horribly, so I cut down on it. The tools, however, are well made.</li>
            <li> Did not work like I thought it would</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful set. It fills all my needs.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and truly works every time!!!</li>
            <li> just ok.....does the job a couple long fingernails can do.  still haven&#x27;t figured out what a couple of tools are used for.  used the long one right out of the box and OUCH!!!!! the one end still had a burr on it from the machining and cut me pretty good.  think i&#x27;ll give Judge Judy a call....lol</li>
            <li> Good price, sturdy and effective product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Looks like surgical steel. Can&#x27;t tell for sure.  Keeper</li>
