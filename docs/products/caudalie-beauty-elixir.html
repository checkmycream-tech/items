    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>One of the best toners I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing best smells, soothing calming and wonderful beauty elixir ....</li>
            <li>This product is great to spray on when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face and want my skin to feel and look refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great size for travel</li>
            <li>I look great all day.</li>
            <li>The mist is very nice though..</li>
            <li>It is especially awesome for hot weather because it has menthol in it, so it has a delightful cooling effect!</li>
            <li>This elixir smells great and feels nice on the skin, but I guess I just don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s purpose or how it benefits my skin.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about it though, and the rep that was helping me recommended it for its naturally-derived ingredients and simplicity.</li>
            <li>oh and my husband thinks it smells great:)</li>
            <li>Buy it you are going to love it!</li>
            <li>The cooling sensation (from the balm mint, I suppose) felt nice.</li>
            <li>caudalie has nice products.</li>
            <li>Love love, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, smells great and feels amazing and gave me the glow I have been searching for!</li>
            <li>you could kind of seeing change going on your skin, but it just ok</li>
            <li>The minty scent is definitely refreshing, however, the rest of the mix kind of smells like urine to me.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>It feels kind of refreshing, but I think 90% of that is coming from the scent.</li>
            <li>Recommended by French women, great moisturizing spray, pleasant scent, but still a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li>But I should have known better since their is alcohol in the product...</li>
            <li>I feel a lot more awake after spraying it on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the beauty</li>
            <li>I love this but the smell keeps me from giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>size is perfect for carrying around in your purse but with daily use each bottle only lasts 2-3 months at best.</li>
            <li>On one hand, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is refreshing, but I am not seeing any difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Just love the product.</li>
            <li>Love how it smells,it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Feels super refreshing, and helped shrink up my zits!</li>
            <li>I like the purse friendly convenience of the 1 oz size, but it is rapidly disappearing!</li>
            <li>The most important thing for me is using products with safe ingredients that wont aggravate my oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love the light mist, which immediately seems to set to work tightening pores.</li>
            <li>Fresh Cologne, ideal for hot days.&lt;br /&gt;After the bath is also very refreshing, light citrus, very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>I liked a refreshing smell and mist, which have a certain spa like quality.</li>
            <li>think I like the Super by Perricone better.</li>
            <li>when i ordered it I actually thought it was a serum or something (my mistake), but it turned out to be a toner...and a great one.</li>
            <li>light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards natural and organic products, as they tend to have fewer controversial</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars for the nice packaging, spray, and some decent ingredients.</li>
            <li>Worth the spurge!</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every Penney!</li>
            <li>If you wear any mineral or powder foundation, this stuff will help to set the make-up and give the (as I call it) pregnant glow without the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>This is hands down, one of my favorite products!!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>It seems kind of obvious, but I made that mistake on my first spritz and my eyes burned like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out in a very fine mist - just two sprays was enough for me.</li>
            <li>said, it does a great job of hydrating your skin and far better than other facial mists I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>first found it at Sephora when I was working there</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle of this by my bed and its&#x27; the first thing I do when I wake up, after I shut off my alarm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced that it was these Caudalie products that caused the breakout, but take from it what you will.</li>
            <li>love all the line made with white grapes.</li>
            <li>Definately worth a shot, even if you are someone with majorly sensitive skin and nervous</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very minty and herbal-y.</li>
            <li>Would repurchased  love to use this product especially on hot days or if feeling tired</li>
            <li>to try anything new, you won&#x27;t regret this product and it&#x27;s pretty affordable too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, so it definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I personally quite like</li>
            <li>Especially now that they have discontinued the Pangea Organics line, the only brand I still felt pretty comfortable using there.</li>
            <li>My skin got much better, but was missing that glow..</li>
            <li>Normally, I would not spend $40+ for a fancy water/alcohol blend.</li>
            <li>Within a week my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li>A quick spray on my face refreshes me after a long travel day...or just whenever I need to feel revived!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and breakout prone.</li>
            <li>I usually use the Evian spray but opted for this due to the pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use it, but so far can only rave about it.</li>
            <li>the receptionist asked for my ID and made a wild face..</li>
            <li>I use it sometimes to set powder makeup and while it doesn&#x27;t really help the makeup last, it does keep it from looking powdery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll frequently use it as a toner after washing my face and follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to write this product off completely.</li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s pricier, I would likely not purchase again because I don&#x27;t think it adds much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will likely continue to repurchase as I haven&#x27;t found any other clear mist that is quite as refreshing and</li>
            <li>I live on a tropical island and my skin gets sweaty, clammy and gross between washes.  </li>
            <li>A few whiteheads on occasion are normal for me, but the extent to which I was breaking out at this point was unusual.</li>
            <li>Caudalie products hardly meet these standards, but it&#x27;s better than a lot of the other brands that Sephora offers.</li>
            <li>It has a really fine mist that doesn&#x27;t require any blotting afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight like other brands do.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I really don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing for my skin.</li>

            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use them long enough?</li>
            <li> However, my skin has always been sensitive to alcohol, so it&#x27;d sting for a few second around my eyes, nose, and other sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> keep another bottle with me on shift, especially overnights, to help me stay alert and awake and combat the dry air in my work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> A must for dry airplane cabins.  </li>
            <li> I skin got unusually dry and flakey..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for longer flights which tend to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s with mature dry skin that is dull.</li>
            <li> A few months back I started doing bi weekly glyco peels and using Nuxe micellar cleansing water with 3 roses to wash and mario badescu to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Sometimes oily, sometimes dry, and a total pain in the butt usually.</li>
            <li> I buy it in small doses to supplement other facial moisturizers and sprays.</li>
            <li> Oh and be careful not to spray this in your eyes!</li>
            <li> So, basically I paid $18 to spray some watered down mojito on my face.</li>
            <li> and I am not a super fan of the alcohol</li>
            <li> It dries to a little bit sticky</li>
            <li> Just a little pricey for not seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and saw a difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my skin since I was 13, now I&#x27;m 27 and a few days ago at the doctor</li>
            <li> Excuse me, used to be dull!</li>
            <li> Took three stars for the ridiculous price, use of alcohol plus a few other questionable ingredients, and for potentially making me break out.</li>
            <li> Totally made my day because I&#x27;m the one always wondering what everyone else&#x27;s secret is!</li>
            <li> They must be working for some others at least, just from looking at the reviews.</li>
            <li> The air is dry and dirty on planes and I always get blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, within one or two weeks, I noticed that I was getting a lot of little whiteheads around my T-Zone.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t excruciating, but not pleasant either.    </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to risk making it worse by experimenting to find out, so needless to say, I discontinued use immediately.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong..</li>
            <li> wish it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Just be wary if you&#x27;re acne-prone like me.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this product several years ago when I read an article by the Editor of Travel of Leisure, who said it was her &amp;#34;never leave home without it&amp;#34; travel essential.  A quick spray on my face refreshes me after a long travel day...or just whenever I need to feel revived!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and saw a difference in a few days. My skin is very sensitive and breakout prone. Sometimes oily, sometimes dry, and a total pain in the butt usually. A few months back I started doing bi weekly glyco peels and using Nuxe micellar cleansing water with 3 roses to wash and mario badescu to moisturize. My skin got much better, but was missing that glow.. I have now added the caudalie beauty elixir to the regime. It&#x27;s gentle, smells great and feels amazing and gave me the glow I have been searching for! I have struggled with my skin since I was 13, now I&#x27;m 27 and a few days ago at the doctor the receptionist asked for my ID and made a wild face.. I thought something was wrong.. she told me she just couldn&#x27;t believe my age and asked for \\&quot;my secret\\&quot;.. Totally made my day because I&#x27;m the one always wondering what everyone else&#x27;s secret is! Definately worth a shot, even if you are someone with majorly sensitive skin and nervous to try anything new, you won&#x27;t regret this product and it&#x27;s pretty affordable too. oh and my husband thinks it smells great:)</li>
            <li> I found this product on another site for 3 times the price! This is the first time I use it, but so far can only rave about it. Excellent!</li>
            <li> This elixir smells great and feels nice on the skin, but I guess I just don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s purpose or how it benefits my skin. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> you could kind of seeing change going on your skin, but it just ok</li>
            <li> I live on a tropical island and my skin gets sweaty, clammy and gross between washes.  This product is great to spray on when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face and want my skin to feel and look refreshed.  I also have a problem with my skin when I travel on airplanes.  The air is dry and dirty on planes and I always get blemishes.  If I just spray Caudalie Beauty Elixir on my face before and after the flight-I don&#x27;t have any skin problems.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the price!</li>
            <li> As facial sprays go, this one is the creme de la creme. A must for dry airplane cabins.  Worth the spurge!</li>
            <li> I liked a refreshing smell and mist, which have a certain spa like quality. But I should have known better since their is alcohol in the product... I skin got unusually dry and flakey.. Followed by deep reed cystic zits on my \\&quot;break out side.\\&quot; As someone who&#x27;s taken accutane this was way to drying for a toner..</li>
            <li> when i ordered it I actually thought it was a serum or something (my mistake), but it turned out to be a toner...and a great one. Feels super refreshing, and helped shrink up my zits! Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, one of my favorite products!! It is a must have for every make-up bag. If you wear any mineral or powder foundation, this stuff will help to set the make-up and give the (as I call it) pregnant glow without the pregnancy. It is especially awesome for hot weather because it has menthol in it, so it has a delightful cooling effect! It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on since 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first found it at Sephora when I was working there part time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 6 years. I now have a job where I work 12 hour shifts. I keep a bottle of this by my bed and its&#x27; the first thing I do when I wake up, after I shut off my alarm. I have to wake up at 0300am and let me tell you, a spritz of this product instantly wakes me up and gets me going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep another bottle with me on shift, especially overnights, to help me stay alert and awake and combat the dry air in my work center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was not so expensive. I need to buy additional, larger bottles. This is a comfort item I have selected to put in my \\&quot;go\\&quot; kit.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly. I feel a lot more awake after spraying it on my face. It dries to a little bit sticky but I&#x27;d think that&#x27;s because it has hydrating property. One of the best toners I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would not spend $40+ for a fancy water/alcohol blend. But I had just run out of toner (from another brand), had some store credit I wanted to be rid of from Sephora, and all they had left was one 3.4 oz bottle of this product. I had heard good things about it though, and the rep that was helping me recommended it for its naturally-derived ingredients and simplicity. Along with the Beauty Elixir, the rep recommended the Vinopure Matte Finish Fluid, which I bought as well.    The most important thing for me is using products with safe ingredients that wont aggravate my oily, acne-prone skin. So I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards natural and organic products, as they tend to have fewer controversial and/or proven harmful ingredients. Caudalie products hardly meet these standards, but it&#x27;s better than a lot of the other brands that Sephora offers. Especially now that they have discontinued the Pangea Organics line, the only brand I still felt pretty comfortable using there. ):     I immediately began using the Beauty Elixir along with the Vinopure Matte Finish Fluid twice a day. Unfortunately, within one or two weeks, I noticed that I was getting a lot of little whiteheads around my T-Zone. A few whiteheads on occasion are normal for me, but the extent to which I was breaking out at this point was unusual. I don&#x27;t know whether it was the toner, the moisturizer, both, or something else that just happened to coincided with the time that I began to use these products. Maybe I just didn&#x27;t use them long enough? But I didn&#x27;t want to risk making it worse by experimenting to find out, so needless to say, I discontinued use immediately. Within a week my skin returned to normal. I&#x27;m pretty convinced that it was these Caudalie products that caused the breakout, but take from it what you will. They must be working for some others at least, just from looking at the reviews. Just be wary if you&#x27;re acne-prone like me.    What I DID like about the Beauty Elixer was the glass bottle and spray. It comes out in a very fine mist - just two sprays was enough for me. The cooling sensation (from the balm mint, I suppose) felt nice. However, my skin has always been sensitive to alcohol, so it&#x27;d sting for a few second around my eyes, nose, and other sensitive areas. It wasn&#x27;t excruciating, but not pleasant either.    I gave this product two stars for the nice packaging, spray, and some decent ingredients. Took three stars for the ridiculous price, use of alcohol plus a few other questionable ingredients, and for potentially making me break out. I&#x27;ll be taking this, along with the moisturizer, back to Sephora and returning to the products I had been using before.</li>
            <li> Recommended by French women, great moisturizing spray, pleasant scent, but still a bit pricey.  I buy it in small doses to supplement other facial moisturizers and sprays.</li>
            <li> caudalie has nice products. I have used the face cleanser. I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My daughter loves the caudalie vinexpert firming serum.  She is 32........ I have bought that for her.&lt;br /&gt; I love the beauty serum.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try the premier cru line some time. Or the contouring concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;vicki</li>
            <li> I love this but the smell keeps me from giving it 5 stars. The minty scent is definitely refreshing, however, the rest of the mix kind of smells like urine to me.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does a great job of hydrating your skin and far better than other facial mists I&#x27;ve tried. It has a really fine mist that doesn&#x27;t require any blotting afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight like other brands do. The 1 oz. size is perfect for carrying around in your purse but with daily use each bottle only lasts 2-3 months at best. I use it sometimes to set powder makeup and while it doesn&#x27;t really help the makeup last, it does keep it from looking powdery. I&#x27;ll frequently use it as a toner after washing my face and follow with a moisturizer. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will likely continue to repurchase as I haven&#x27;t found any other clear mist that is quite as refreshing and hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: I definitely recommend shaking the bottle before applying.</li>
            <li> On one hand, I love the smell. It&#x27;s very minty and herbal-y. It&#x27;s pretty strong, so it definitely isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I personally quite like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I really don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing for my skin. It feels kind of refreshing, but I think 90% of that is coming from the scent. I can&#x27;t see any pore tightening or radiance. So, basically I paid $18 to spray some watered down mojito on my face. Oh and be careful not to spray this in your eyes! It seems kind of obvious, but I made that mistake on my first spritz and my eyes burned like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to write this product off completely. I&#x27;ll keep using it and see how it goes. I like the purse friendly convenience of the 1 oz size, but it is rapidly disappearing! I know Embryolisse make a similar product in a 7 oz size for something like $30.</li>
            <li> I love the light mist, which immediately seems to set to work tightening pores. Great size for travel and I know I&#x27;ll be taking it with me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing best smells, soothing calming and wonderful beauty elixir .... Would repurchased  love to use this product especially on hot days or if feeling tired</li>
            <li> I have been using it to tone before moisturizing and to mist during/after make up time..&lt;br /&gt;It is refreshing, but I am not seeing any difference in my skin and I am not a super fan of the alcohol so I had to take one star off.&lt;br /&gt;I think I like the Super by Perricone better. The mist is very nice though..Just a little pricey for not seeing results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for longer flights which tend to dry out my skin. I usually use the Evian spray but opted for this due to the pleasant scent. Considering it&#x27;s pricier, I would likely not purchase again because I don&#x27;t think it adds much. The scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> They say the women in France are hooked on this stuff! I see why. I spray it on and it instantly hydrates and wakens my skin. I look great all day. I am in my 50&#x27;s with mature dry skin that is dull. Excuse me, used to be dull! Love love, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Fresh Cologne, ideal for hot days.&lt;br /&gt;After the bath is also very refreshing, light citrus, very feminine.&lt;br /&gt;Super light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I love all the line made with white grapes.</li>
            <li> Just love the product. Love how it smells,it lasts all day. Buy it you are going to love it! It&#x27;s worth every Penney!</li>
