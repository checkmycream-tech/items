            <li>Good quality and can be used with or without face soap.</li>

            <li>I love this sponge!  </li>
            <li>Love this sponge that Oleavine sent me to review for my blog, GlamRIver!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Actually, so much better than the Clarisoinc brush!</li>
            <li>and then some:)!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Tried this product after a friend recommended it and had no idea what it was or what to expect, but I am in love!  </li>
            <li>Love this sponge!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this sponge!  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully and the results are even better the more I use it.</li>
            <li>Feels AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s just some kind of beauty gimmick?</li>
            <li>Nice to use something that doesn&#x27;t require soap.</li>
            <li>Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It is a nice alternative to a clarisonic type device.</li>
            <li>Dries out nicely.</li>
            <li>so not everyone is going to react to this like me, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to own.</li>
            <li>Worked very well, I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Nice cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, and it&#x27;s not an effective cleansing sponge.</li>
            <li>Then inside was this nice beauty sponge.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need soap or anything with it, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I could feel a nice tingle as I scrubbed my face.</li>
            <li>Removes make up and gives my skin a nice glow with no drying soap.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product.</li>
            <li>’s own.</li>
            <li>The thoughts that are expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li>(I received this product to review, but my opinions are strictly my own.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was really impressed with this sponge and much prefer it to scratchy, drugstore alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opinions, however, are my own.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li>I use sponge with my own cleanser at night and just the sponge in the morning.</li>
            <li>The product is also very affordable and great for the Eco-friendly people in our lives!</li>
            <li>Soak with warm water and rup on your face.</li>
            <li>thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my face but would not buy again.</li>
            <li>: I received it as a gift in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it has a nice texture, shape, and size.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products over the years and can honestly say this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>My son is bed bound and this sponge makes cleaning his face very easy.  </li>
            <li>Awwww, i love it!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that this is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice when used on the face, and i&#x27;m sure it exfoliates to a degree.</li>
            <li>then I could honestly recommend this product ( since you be using a lot of it it :) ).</li>
            <li>I cannot explain the softness perfectly but it is perfectly soft on my face.</li>
            <li>Adding it to warm water and letting it hydrate converted it from Styrofoam to the most luxurious beauty treatment that your skin has ever been treated to.</li>
            <li>Seems to make my face cream work more effectively.  </li>
            <li>So easy!  </li>
            <li>He was impressed by how clean his face felt and looked after the first use.</li>
            <li>Very Cool! :)</li>
            <li>The sensation of scrubbing my face with the sponge especially with warm water feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Really great feel and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>I use it on my body too and my skinn has gotten very smooth, even in winter.</li>
            <li>I love this Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>So I bought this sponge because I have blackheads on my nose and acne on my forehead which are the most oily parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>but I just love the fact that my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li>If so, I will gladly change my review rating.</li>
            <li>Love Oleavine products.</li>

            <li>Love how this sponge makes my face feel and look softer.</li>

            <li>Until that point, it was just okay.</li>
            <li>A washcloth would have worked better than this sponge for me.</li>

            <li>Enjoy!</li>

            <li>Interesting.</li>
            <li>Read More http://goo.gl/e5jFLM</li>
            <li>packaging itself is quite striking, you can tell thought and care went into every aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>It can be used all by itself to cleanse both face and body or with your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was able to fully appreciate this sponge as my exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to use a cleanser with it, but you can if you want to.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I love my Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>I use a non foaming cleanser with it and my face is smoother than smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the sponge and will recommend it to all my friends and colleagues.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Yay! :)</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I am ordering more for gifts.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li>I mostly love to use it before I put a face mask.</li>
            <li>Charcoal is great for absorbing excess oils in the skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I just use the sponge alone</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing 2 more sponges and many more.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more while they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin, leaves my face feeling great.</li>

            <li>I love to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>works really well and is a great size.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>like touching snakeskin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not to sure if this thing is working for me now.</li>
            <li>love this sponge for cleaning my face thoroughly....</li>
            <li>Like soap but with a bit more resistance caused by the holes inside of the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial sponge that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions.</li>
            <li>For me, a better way to keep my skin clearer/healthier is by changing diet.</li>
            <li>so this seemed to be the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>but I love that there are no chemicals in this sponge.</li>
            <li>The Oleavine Konjac Sponge will for sure be a repurchase when this one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Ordering more for my girls.  </li>
            <li>and it has so many benefits.</li>
            <li>It was magical, the soothing effect that it had on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning and evening, and when it is time, I plan on buying another as I really love the way that my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received this sponge free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a sponge.  </li>
            <li>Ho hum but better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I think that people with normal-to-dry skin could definitely not use a cleanser and have flawless skin with this sponge.</li>
            <li>This sponge is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.  </li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>When I applied for this promotion I wasn&#x27;t really sure how a sponge like this worked.</li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and because it&#x27;s interesting to look at.</li>
            <li>would love to use a konjac sponge</li>
            <li>and I love the softness.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this Bamboo Charcoal Infused Konjac Sponge from Oleavine.</li>
            <li>I love using it</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the sponge delivers on any of the grand claims that it makes.</li>
            <li>top of it, the box says the product is &amp;</li>
            <li>most puzzling claim is that there are &amp;#34;no chemicals&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It does provide a nice light exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I have been using it without cleanser when I rinse my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>When I bought this I thought it would have a rougher texture and exfoliate more.</li>
            <li>Very nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>When I received a sample of this charcoal sponge, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I used to use a washcloth, but this is far superior!</li>
            <li>I really liked how it was not tested on animals and is vegan friendly and</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling quite refreshed and very clean.  </li>
            <li>I did not need to use soap and my face felt very clean without any drying.</li>
            <li>I heard about how good the sponges were for exfoliation, but I was surprised at how soft the sponge is and how great it works to exfoliate my skin!</li>

            <li>awesome product, delivered as expected</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon an article a beauty expert wrote on this product and how much she loved it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but I just love the texture and weight of the sponge for washing my face, it is excellent!</li>
            <li>What a super cool &amp; innovative product!  </li>
            <li>Easy to squeeze out moisture between palms and thus maintains shape.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It does exfoliate and rinses easily ...</li>
            <li>the box tells you to go easy with it so that you do not hurt the fibers</li>
            <li>I think it is so important to keep skin healthy and free of any sort of unnatural substance.</li>
            <li>It’s also really easy to use</li>
            <li>Great item and will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Amazingly clean and smooth skin!</li>
            <li>Has a really strong chemical smell that overpowers me when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay nothing special.</li>
            <li>Perfect facial sponge, super soft but still exfoliates fairly well.</li>
            <li>Once it was soft I started massaging my face with it and it felt really good, the sponge is soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving the Konjac Sponge!</li>
            <li>Both are very soft, gentle and leave a wonderful feeling of clean freshness.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin and like it&#x27;s getting every spec of grime off &amp; leaving it soft, smotth &amp; super clean!</li>
            <li>love that it is very light-weighted and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it’s still good as new.</li>
            <li>and honestly I am not super impressed.</li>
            <li>Honestly one of my favorite new beauty tools.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face very smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin, however, it does seem to stay cleaner longer when I use this sponge.</li>
            <li>cause I can get the point to clean around my eyes and nose easily.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package you can see how cheap it is when you see the string you hang it with.</li>
            <li>Immediately realized what a cheap sponge I had purchased and felt ripped off.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so cheap looking, I can&#x27;t give this as gifts to anyone.</li>
            <li>The pointed end makes it easy to clean around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>Konjac sponges are great not only for washing but also for rinsing, since they hold a lot of water.</li>
            <li>, so basic yet it delivers great results.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective and she can use it without a cleanser.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a great product</li>
            <li>received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is different than any others I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I use mine everyday and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth afterward</li>
            <li>Afterwards, it leaves your skin silky smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>but I have used alone on days where I was makeup free</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps unclog pores or not, but I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>i received this product for free for my unbiased opinion from tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>enjoy using the sponge; I just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I bought this though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s essential.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh and smooth afterward, and I feel like my moisturizer absorbs better.</li>
            <li>also loved how soft this sponge is.</li>
            <li>you are wanting a gentle treatment for your skin, especially if your skin is recovering from some of the harsher treatments that are out there, this Konjac sponge is an excellent solution.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit tougher material for exfoliation, but so far all is good</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be one of the people who received this awesome facial sponge in an exchange of an honest review.</li>
            <li>&quot; but I absolutely love this product and even though \\&quot;Oleavine\\&quot; the company isn&#x27;t as well known as \\&quot;Boscia\\&quot; or some other high end skincare company, it does a great job!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth, clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and  smooth without soap.  </li>
            <li>My face got the smooth, clean result</li>
            <li>after you use it, your face just feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of this Konjac Sponge from Oleavine when I first took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see me spending $24.95 (original price) for this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product, but it made me break out.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this sponge on my blackhead prone areas.  </li>
            <li>This is my first activated charcoal sponge and it worked much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>so I was really excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this product when I purchased it</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a review and was so excited.</li>
            <li>However after using this product, my acne worsened significantly.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li>IT leaves my skin feeling clean</li>
            <li>I kept it clean and hanging in the bathroom but couldn&#x27;t get rid of that smell</li>
            <li>Perfect for my ten year old daughter who is just beginning her skin care regime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sponge directions states to use it as a stand along, but I feel my skin will not be properly clean if I did that.</li>
            <li>Since I still had the option to clean with a cleanser, I opt for that</li>
            <li>Helps clean and exfoliate impurities in the skin with the activated charcoal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll clean up your skin &amp; let the mask do</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and exfoliated after I used</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit of my cleanser from LUSH with this along with a moisturizer that this company also makes and have been so impressed.</li>
            <li>With soap on the sponge it does clean my skin but not as well as a washcloth or my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use in the shower, and I feel like I can easily clean myself without worrying about keeping fresh washcloths around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and looks clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it can clean your face.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very soft, so I did not think it would be effective in cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because of the many positive reviews, but it does not do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Worked good the first few times but after that it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.</li>
            <li>w/ a medicated facial towelette, rinse w/ warm water, then use the konjac sponge (soak sponge in warm water for a couple of minutes first).  </li>
            <li>The wider end is great for large surface areas like my cheeks, with the pointed ends being perfect for hard to reach spots around my eyes!!!</li>
            <li>This is very large and makes it great for removing any extra dirts or make-up.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel super smooth, super clean, and keeps me from breaking out.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have used this lovely little sponge for a couple days and man is it amazing!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this in.</li>
            <li>But I love it as it&#x27;s gently even when my skin gets a bit sensitvie in the winter weather.</li>
            <li>Was good initially but took on a mildew smell after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>The teardrop shape fits nicely and naturally into your palm-</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it very gently,although it won&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sponge so much.</li>
            <li>Its true, you don&#x27;t even need cleanser besides for taking makeup off.</li>
            <li>Instead of using different cleansers and soaps on your face, the sponge does the job just as good and even better and is so much simpler to use.</li>
            <li>I really love this so much.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I have been given a sponge prior to this Konjac sponge and I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>it becomes a true &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am was even able to go to a gentle cleanser where I was always using an acne cleaner before.  </li>
            <li>That I think is not bad for a sponge life cycle, but I have to still state</li>
            <li>It is so much better and more effective than any other facial brush I own.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference after the first use, and could easily see changes within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Love this sponge, it is so soft and comfortable washing my face it and leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed</li>
            <li>little facial sponge is awesome, mainly because it does so many great things for your skin and is also completely natural(no chemicals, no colors added, no preservatives and is also biodegradable).</li>
            <li>Good quality as advertised but wish it was a little more abrasive for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>First week was fine</li>
            <li>I am used to with my acne gel but also super soft and even MORE SMOOTH from using the Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, for a sponge that costs $10, I expected more.</li>
            <li>This clears that up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for 5 days, with a mild cleanser... but didn&#x27;t notice any benefits.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, so soft once it is wet.</li>
            <li>I am at the very ealr stages of the purchase, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>but after I used this, it has subsided quite tremendously.</li>
            <li>I put my face was in it and give my face a quick one over with this thing</li>
            <li>This product is great it helped get rid of my acne, it says you don&#x27;t need to use soap, but it highly recommend some type of soap for the ultimate clean.</li>
            <li>My face is very clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the very first use.  </li>
            <li>I love that it works well with my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>Works very well , leaves skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Every Christmas, I package up my favorite new products as gifts for my mother and sisters.</li>
            <li>but I was happy to see that it was a color i enjoy, its the small things in life</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and so gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions, added water and was amazed at how quickly the sponge absorbed the water</li>
            <li>The Konjac Sponge is a low tech solution and my skin looks lovely!</li>
            <li>There are so many similar products on the market, and this is the first that I have tried - after hearing so many raving reviews.</li>
            <li>This is currently one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li>For very light exfoliating for a short period of time (a week or so), this is fine.</li>
            <li>The thing i love the most is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause any sort of redness.</li>
            <li>It felt hard until you put warm water on it, then its like it magically came to life!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this sponge is gentle and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I first clean my face</li>
            <li>This is a great little sponge.</li>
            <li>Great little sponge, non abrasive but still seems to exfoliate quite well.</li>
            <li>The sponge fills with water, stays filled while cleansing my face and somehow it dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>My face is not red after using this (which is amazing b/c</li>
            <li>Nice product for deep pore cleansing</li>
            <li>I decided to test it for myself and enjoyed its soft texture; the cleanser is absorbed by the sponge and foams generously.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin loves that the sponge has no chemicals, pollutants or irritants, while my conscience is pleased that it is biodegradable, sustainable and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think its worth the $10.00 price tag, and then some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fun to play with.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>I still love how soft this sponge is on my face.</li>
            <li>Terrific Natural Sponge, great gift item.  </li>
            <li>in all, I personally think the sponge is great, I’ve always preferred products that are natural and have a lot benefits.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel as fresh as it would had</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin feel and</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is.</li>
            <li>The opinions above are my own</li>
            <li>As a devotee to weekly AHA peels (pumpkin, glycolic, lactic) and regular microdermabrasion treatments, effective and gentle exfoliation is a process I am familiar with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Konjac sponges and this one is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Either way, it was a good purchase, and I continue to use it every other day.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very gentle, not painful at all and also exfoliates pretty well.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, it&#x27;s a rock-hard, thought lightweight, gray oval.</li>
            <li>I know that right now charcoal face washes are all the rage right now, so infusing a sponge with it</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>The price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, but somehow still manages to minimize pores and deeply clean.  </li>
            <li>I really like using this sponge to clean my face.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice and really works for my less is more lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Did clean makeup off very efficiently though.</li>
            <li>Best $10 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>This is a great sponge to clean your makeup off  its very soft and gets into all the little crevices.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth silky elastic texture, kind of reminds me of one of those glutenous rice cakes you find at Asian bakeries or dim sum.</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected it to, but you can find konjac sponges for better prices - even at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>The sponge got so soft really fast and felt very smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked and felt so clean and healthy like this in a long time.</li>
            <li>Most exfoliators give me acne, as they are too harsh and make my skin generate more oil.</li>
            <li>this sponge is by far superior over any facial sponge i&#x27;ve ever used yet.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, easy to use and luxuriously soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin when using this as opposed to water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Too soft to exfoliate well; I don&#x27;t even bother with it as the smell is just too strong.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very very gentle with the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li>Now I use one that is very gentle</li>
            <li>The only difference in the way I normally care for my face is that I am using the konjac sponge &amp; my complexion looks so much better!  </li>
            <li>I imagine most of them are the same.</li>
            <li>product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li>I will defiantly order more in the future .</li>
            <li>I just love it and can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even exfoliate or have any kind of rough texture.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described</li>
            <li>Came so fast before the estimated date!</li>
            <li>Works well with or without cleanser, and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the luxurious sensation- sort of like giving myself an at-home spa facial!</li>
            <li>If the current price ever get cheaper (more on the line of $5-$6 bucks)</li>
            <li>, I thought was pretty brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin felt like I had just used a scrub or microdermabrasion on it, but I used absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>also tried this with my favorite acne facial cleanser as well.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant upon first inspecting this thing,</li>
            <li>Well the first night I used it</li>
            <li>She believes that her skin feels smoother and looks better after only about a week of use.</li>
            <li>It lathers well with any skin wash or soap of your choice and is so soft and smooth on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended  !!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty soon to give a review about results</li>
            <li>- I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li>After words, my skin was not covered in flakes (like it normally is)and felt so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>But I have pretty resilient acne,</li>
            <li>Most Konjac Sponges come with strings attached so that you can hang them on something next to your sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been interested in trying one for some time now</li>
            <li>I really love using this facial sponge because you can feel the sponge exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li>and/or you could use your favorite facial cleanser with it too.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I actually wash my face more with the sponge than I ever did without it.</li>
            <li>In my quest for better skin, I’ve tried a lot of different things–from creams and scrubs to masks and serums.</li>
            <li>First off I use my husbands amazon Prime</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been only using this for 2 days now, but I absolutely love how it&#x27;s making my skin look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li>Sponge really works !</li>
            <li>I hope to see more improvement in the following weeks.</li>
            <li>Since I bought more than one sponge I will likely return the ones I did not use.  </li>
            <li>But it is a interesting tool to use and add to your daily face washing routine.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But, overall I do love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using it consistently for about a week.</li>
            <li>I have only used for 3 days, but my breakouts have subsided and my skin looks more dewey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to another sponge or washcloth ever again after trying this out.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the product, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that the box says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(though I don&#x27;t know what exactly to attribute that to).</li>
            <li>and I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>the wider end is great for larger areas such as the body, while the pointed end easily glides over the smaller contours of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using the sponge and without any face wash my face has not broken out once and looks and feels clean highly recommend</li>
            <li>Honestly I sent my package to my other address and haven&#x27;t picked it up yet.</li>
            <li>It began to fall apart the very first time I soaked it in plain warm water.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a week now and my skin feels soft and a clean.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean and soft after I used it.</li>
            <li>really helped exfoliate my skin and left it super smooth</li>
            <li>I have been using this sponge for a couple of days, and this sponge leaves my face really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Since my face is fairly sensitive, I don&#x27;t like to use anything rough on my it, so I was fairly apprehensive using this sponge.  </li>
            <li>I would love a bigger sponge to use on my whole body</li>
            <li>very gentle to the skin and cleans very well</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry and sort of flaky-ish skin on my nose most of the time.</li>
            <li>It comes hard in the package nice and sealed and then when you add water to it it becomes so soft and literally is like magic for my skin.</li>
            <li>Right now, I guess it makes a decent face sponge for... applying water to your face??    </li>
            <li>Much like any other sponge, does not have a surface that exfoliates, but it is porous and absorbs warm water well.</li>
            <li>None of it chips off and drys pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The leary first time I used it I was amazed at how gentle it was and didn&#x27;t turn my skin</li>
            <li>I have used charcoal face products in the past and had a good experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I soaked the sponge in warm water and it only took about 10 seconds for it to completely be soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Really like how my face feels after using it, soft and really clean.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, not rough enough for me but definitely good quality</li>
            <li>I love it, but I feel like it never gets completely dry.</li>
            <li>This may be because I have a pretty detailed skin routine already or because it simply didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and I believe my skin is looking evener in color.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores with blackheads in my nose.</li>
            <li>Even blackheads and large pores on nose are virtually gone.</li>
            <li>I love that I can choose to use it with or without a cleanser because I tend to avoid washing my face too much because my skin will dry out.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing that it starts out hard as a rock and upon application of water that it is so soft and smooth, yes able to cleanse my face with a soft abrasiveness that is soft enough to clean a baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, thanks!</li>
            <li>is clear, soft and acne free.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference overall, but my skin did feel smoother.</li>
            <li>This sponge is gentle, providing the benefits of exfoliation without the drawbacks.</li>
            <li>It really depends on how much cleansing I need.</li>
            <li>This sponge really helps exfoliate and treat all in one.</li>
            <li>, it is gentle.</li>
            <li>I think it is too gentle.</li>
            <li>and it went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My face is much clearer &amp; continues to improve every day.  </li>
            <li>Just gently go over it sev times.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get the hype.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using the hands, the gentle touch of the sponge takes care of it.  </li>
            <li>My face looks and feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if it is giving me a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like using this sponge.</li>
            <li>When I ordered I really did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I put the sponge under water and it quickly absorbed the water and became soft and sponge</li>
            <li>I really like the shape of the sponge.</li>
            <li>The sponge gently exfoliated my face.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy this sponge for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>, it works with just gentle movements.</li>
            <li>This really did not bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its surface is very slippere .</li>
            <li>if it really helps with acne at all</li>
            <li>Packaged well and arrived really soon.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about Konjac sponges</li>
            <li>The Oleavine Konjac Sponge is a plant based sponge that gently exfoliates while helping to promote circulation.</li>
            <li>, you can gently press the sponge to get out any excess water but NEVER wring out the sponge.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer since I have started using this.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is infused with bamboo charcoal that contains carbons and minerals which will aid in purifying your skin, helping draw out excess oils and acne-causing bacteria, and will supply your skin with much need antioxidants.</li>
            <li>Gently massage your face with the sponge.</li>
            <li>The sponge claims to provide gentle exfoliation and can be used with or without cleanser.</li>
            <li>so my face gets very greasy thru out the day hence the acne.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was more rough.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase another for showering very soon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much of a background on these types of sponges</li>
            <li>I thought that this product wouldn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>For the price, I would expect to use it for a much longer time period before throwing it away.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok..holds too much water.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I use it with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li>There are probably much cheaper products out there</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li>I was eager to do so, since I figured it would reduce the cost per use under sixty cents and that would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and my skin is much happier.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from hormonal acne and after 2 uses I have noticed my complexion is much smoother and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>It really just seems like a gray, teardrop shaped sponge.</li>
            <li>but then again, i only wash my face with african soap and moisturize with rose hip oil</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve gone without a cleanser for a few weeks and still had no breakouts.</li>
            <li>All Charcoal sponges can be a bit harsh on my skin that is eczema prone, but this one seemed to work nicely and well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sponge because of all the good reviews and I&#x27;m surprised at how much I disliked it.  </li>
            <li>Clear evidence to me that the konjac sponge works!!!</li>
            <li>I like to use it on my face because it is much more gentle around the eye area than using a wash cloth or other alternatives.</li>
            <li>Previously I have used many sponges over the years with out success for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I first used their French Red Clay all natural Konjac sponge and liked it.</li>
            <li>The Oleavine Konjac Sponge comes infused with bamboo charcoal which is very good for skin with acne as it can help pull extra oils in the skin that would stay trapped when using just bare hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though so soft, the sponge is a natural exfoliator, massaging your skin to a tingling, relaxing state of clean.</li>
            <li>I am so in love and want to buy the other ones this company makes.</li>
            <li>There are many other brands out there for which I cannot say \\&quot;work\\&quot; or \\&quot;don&#x27;t work\\</li>
            <li>The string makes it easy to hang and dry out in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels extra clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I can buy a lot of washcloths for the same price and use a clean one each time I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes and of course, my skin is still naturally oily and nothing will change that, it does seem to exfoliate and it is very gentle on the skin if that is a concern for you.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>A few of those are fine, but too many are suspicious to me, especially when they seem to be every review.</li>
            <li>It works, but so gently, at cleansing the skin, that I didn&#x27;t realize it was working as well as it was until I rinsed my face, patted it dry and felt how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li>But yea... so far it&#x27;s pretty meh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any different then a wash cloth and face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I thought that this was a really nice touch that not many companies take the time to do.</li>
            <li>Soo soft on the face and amazed how fast it came!</li>
            <li>Firstly I am 44 years old</li>
            <li>Was expecting this to be more than the average kitchen sink sponge.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and gets irritated easily.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice and soft little sponge.</li>
            <li>Removes all the dry skin build up Leaves your face feeling smooth .</li>
            <li>This is likely another beauty trend that will die a quick death.</li>
            <li>so I do not know if this is particular to this brand or</li>
            <li>, I would definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I mainly like the ease when washing with the sponge, nice texture and soft yet firm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who takes care of there face or wants a new beauty product for their routine.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and gentle on my face and makes washing my face a delight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle, especially in the more sensitive areas (around my nose and eyebrows),  and I can use way less cleanser.</li>
            <li>When you try the product for yourself you see that the sponge is super soft, almost like porous cotton balls and not bristle-like at all (unlike general defoliators).</li>
            <li>After using the Activated Charcoal and the French Green Clay, I have found the French Red Clay to be the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would thus highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to try this out.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love the little string to hang it with as it is not in the way when using the sponge.  </li>
            <li>Love this little sponge...will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li>but in my opinion, its a little of both but more the sponge.  </li>
            <li>I used a little of my favorite cleanser and just washed over my face with it.</li>
            <li>Love the product BUT the marketing is a little misleading...</li>
            <li>Love this little thing</li>
            <li>As I have &amp;#34; older skin &amp;#34; it really works to sluff off the old and reveal the healthier skin layer underneath.</li>
            <li>I use a milk-based cleanser, which doesn&#x27;t foam up, but the sponge still enables to cleanser to clean my face without it feeling scrubbed too dry.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates, cleanses, is naturally pH balanced, promotes circulation, absorbs toxins and fights bacteria while leaving your face glowing and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I used as instructed, and I normally don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li>glad I got this one instead of the round</li>
            <li>To do this just wet the sponge with some warm water allowing it to pull as much as it needs to be fully wet</li>
            <li>This facial sponge feels nice against my face and skin, works well with other beauty products!</li>
            <li>The Konjac Sponge is very unique among facial sponges especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Many of the other acne products have caused some major dryness and irritation .The</li>
            <li>However, when soaked in water it becomes a super soft sponge suitable for delicate facial skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a new cleansing system.</li>
            <li>It is a new beauty must-have for</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new beauty products to try, specifically those that help with exfoliation or skin brightening.</li>
            <li>Reminded me of a brand new kitchen sponge.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new friends in skin care.</li>
            <li>Using it for several days now, it doesn&#x27;t really seem its made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Yet, with the Konjac sponge I can do a quick rub all over my face and not have to think twice about moisturizing every single time.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the sponge is either rock hard (when it&#x27;s dry) or way too soft to be a very effective exfoliant (when damp).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>The sponge itself is surprisingly very soft.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and found that it was actually very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft skin after</li>
            <li>But, very soft.</li>
            <li>I expected something special with this one.</li>
            <li>have been really good about hanging it from the small thread hanging hook that is installed on the sponge, and that allows the air to circulate and lets it dry evenly.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it without any type of facial cleanser, my face is left soft and clean.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s enormous!!  </li>
            <li>Soft on my face!</li>
            <li>I like how it feels due to its gentle exfoliation -- not sure if the charcoal has done much, but the exfoliating sponge in itself is nice.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I wash my face first with the sponge to exfoliate and then use a facial cleanser (since they recommend not to use a foam with the sponge)My Skin</li>
            <li>but boy was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li>is a pretty big sponge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it almost two weeks and really like it, the sponge definitely gives me that deep cleansing that I&#x27;m always looking for, while still not feeling rough on my skin or drying it out like many exfoliating products do.</li>
            <li>sponge has made it easy for him to exfoliate and disinfectant his skin without the side effects of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>So, while it felt nice, I&#x27;m not sure there is any actual charcoal in the sponge.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sponge to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use some of the more harsh facial sponges.</li>
            <li>At the current $10, it&#x27;s a far better value than any of the other tools I have seen!</li>
            <li>I have used the sponge for a little over a week and my pores appear smaller and the texture of my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>The sponge is ok, as with any new facial product it made me break out within a few days.</li>
            <li>But after using this for only a few days my skin feels completely different (for the better)!  </li>
            <li>but it did dry back to its original feel and texture.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a while now and typically use it in the shower to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Hopefully over time, the skars can heal and his skin will clear up.</li>
            <li>Is my body wash toxic, and therefore rendered less effective by this chemically active sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone says to buy that clear sonic thing</li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>its just way too soft and has no abrasiveness to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, however I do get occasional blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my fave by far, and I have already received texts from the recipients asking where they can purchase this sponge, so THEY can gift it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This konjac sponge (and I tried 5 others) leaves my skin soft and velvety.  </li>
            <li>I bought this sponge for my son who has sensitive skin but needs the exfoliation properties of a Buf Puf without the irritation rigorous use entails.</li>
            <li>It went straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Switched back to my oatmeal &amp; sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soo soft and exfoliatied.</li>
            <li>It may have just been the scrubbing action, idk, but it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and exfoliating this sponge is.</li>
            <li>It said it was gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I thought since it was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>So natural and the texture is out of this world.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how soft my skin was after using this.  </li>
            <li>I remember thinking no way this sponge is going to be soft on my face.</li>
            <li>Really like the feel of this on my face - it looks like of like pumice, but glides over your skin with no extra cleanser or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This sponge was extremely soft on my face.</li>
            <li>it has fibers in it that make is soft and also pliable.</li>
            <li>As for the product it&#x27;s self, it is so soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said its as soft as a marshmallo .</li>
            <li>I read about this sponge online and decided to try it on my old face.  </li>
            <li>I have natural oily skin</li>
            <li>This Konjac facial sponge gently cleanses, detoxifies,exfoliates, and refreshes your face.</li>
            <li>Also this sponge is naturally pH balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a tad leery because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how soft the sponge is against my face.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft and spongy, but don&#x27;t let that confuse you.</li>
            <li>Leaves  me smooth without  the harsh exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and this works EXCELLENT!💥</li>
            <li>Like a soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Its so soft so its give my face the look I want.</li>
            <li>The sponge is non-abrasive and dries quickly to be ready for the next use.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and it works nicely on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Soft yet still exfoliates.</li>
            <li>That they found a vegan at the bus stop near the factory, and he said he like the sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li>This is just a soft sponge.  </li>
            <li>I could exfoliate my skin better with one of those yellow and green sponges you can by at Walmart.</li>
            <li>This helped get off some dead skin but not much, its nice if used with a sugar scrub or microderm though.</li>
            <li>Apparently charcoal is the new thing in beauty products because it helps rid the skin of impurities and helps with oil.  </li>
            <li>First its a dry sponge or like a fungus.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all different colors, so these active magic ingredients must be what makes the different colors when compared to the &amp;#34;pure white&amp;#34; sponge.</li>
            <li>Although I have used the Konjac three times, the first several seconds during initial use, were sufficient to determine it was just too darn soft (almost slimy) to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t know this was a \\&quot;special konjac sponge\\&quot; I would have thought it was just some weird cheap sponge from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>My mom loves hers as the red clay is for older skin.</li>
            <li>No other products I buy have vendors who contact me so frequently to so aggressively solicit feedback or reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soak or rinse the sponge in warm water to allow the sponge to soften (the sponge is hard in its dry state).</li>
            <li>At first my face was breaking out a little more than usual</li>
            <li>Of particular interest to me is how the &amp;#34;Bamboo Charcoal&amp;#34; selectively absorbs only toxins and not other materials.</li>
            <li>and I had a bit of acne (small spots), redness, uneven skin tone/acne scars and oiliness(especially in my T-zone) and this sponge actually made my face look amazing after one use!</li>
            <li>It looks like a hardened Styrofoam at first, but when wet, it is the softest sponge you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li>The above mentioned cleansers work to remove it pretty well for a few days, but this Konjac Sponge was the first non-chemical thing I have found to take care of that problem area as well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I spent, considering I spotted the same product in the high end cosmetic store for double the price!</li>
            <li>things improved and now I have clear skin again which is radiant and not a single pimple.</li>
            <li>And (3) after rinsing, gently press between your palms to get out any excess water and hang to air dry.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know how long this sponge is suppose to last at first, since it doesn&#x27;t state that information on the box or instruction, so I email the company and asked them.</li>
            <li>My initial thought was “no way that is going near my sensitive skin.”</li>
            <li>My nose is looking better every day, the pores are getting smaller and the acne on my forehead is slowly going away.</li>
            <li>The sponge dried really quickly</li>
            <li>As to the, &#x27;boost effectiveness of facial cleaners ...&#x27; I am unable to post a fair assessment at this point.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>I had a major improvement in my skin by morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a material like no other.  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning thinking wow!</li>
            <li>and my skin has been fine (and much less dry)...</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something that would make my skin feel clean  and radiant without the dryness and harsh chemicals and thesis it!</li>
            <li>I’m fighting some excessive oiliness in my t-zone and I felt like without cleanser, even though the sponge got my face clean, it wasn’t as oil-free as I prefer.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this because of all the terrific reviews but mine broke apart within a few days.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the anti-acne effects of this sponge, since I am using other acne treatments at the moment, but I love how soft and supple it is while washing my face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend  buying this facial sponge because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My biggest issue is just build up in general.  </li>
            <li>After clearly reading the instructions (which oddly enough calls for no cleanser)</li>
            <li>Used it for a month with water only thinking it would clear away.  </li>
            <li>no problems so far with daily use</li>
            <li>Really soft, I just started using this and plan on once daily</li>
            <li>I am a nearly 70 y/o female w/ combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it take off my makeup with ease, but it exfoliated my face and made it really soft.</li>
            <li>Oleavine beauty facial sponge is made of 100% natural Konjac fibers(a plant that is found throughout Asia).</li>
            <li>Oleavine Beauty Konjac Facial Sponge is infused with charcoal and made from natural fibers.</li>
            <li>It was not expected.</li>
            <li>You just have to try it out for yourself, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the softness it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>not impressed to be honest.</li>
            <li>Or, there may be some amount, but the consumer is really unable to tell what that amount is and how effective it might be, and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I used it i followed the box and gently squeezed it between my hands and left it to dry</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was slightly rougher as it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I&#x27;d like, but for the general everyday purpose of cleaning of the face and mild exfoliating, it does its job</li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling a little dry, but was just fine after I put on moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to admit when I first got this sponge, I was really surprised on how hard it was, and I didn&#x27;t want it anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out from the tearing of other sponges.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the Konjac Sponge initially, but I have since enjoyed using the product on my very sensitive skin these past few weeks.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t like spending hours in the bathroom going through several steps of a skin care regimen, but is self conscious about his face at the same time.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Soft enough for a baby&#x27;s skin ... &#x27; should have been my cue to (Exit Stage Left).</li>
            <li>I expected at least something more sturdy like twine.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package the first thing I saw was was a thank you letter thanking you for buying their product with a guarantee behind their products.</li>
            <li>I can see that this needs to be sanitized frequently, as it is never completely dry when I go to use it at night after morning use.</li>
            <li>The sponge removes dried flaky skin everyday safely.</li>
            <li>Feels very soft and takes off the dry skin I get from using ace-prone medicine.</li>
            <li>At first it feels hard and rough, but get it wet and the exfoliation is so smooth and cleansing.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I was a little nervous about using the sponge.</li>
            <li>Once this sponge gets wet, it becomes super soft and really does exfoliator the skin without irritating it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not see much of a difference in using this verses a facial sponge of any other type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>The sponge is hard when you first open it but soon after exposure to water it becomes very soft.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is even if you don&#x27;t squeeze it, it never dries back into it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard when it&#x27;s dry but turns super soft after you put it in water.</li>
            <li>and I was seriously amazed at how clean my face felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Showering every day and letting the sponge air dry, I find that it lasts about six weeks before it becomes too soft and starts deteriorating.</li>
            <li>The sponge did get very soft once wet</li>
            <li>And...not to be indelicate, but there&#x27;s something about that string that reminds me a little too much of a certain type of feminine hygiene product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When you wet this sponge, it becomes so soft!</li>
            <li>but I much rater use an apricot facial scrub prior to using the sponge as I feel it leaves the sponge less greasy.</li>
            <li>My three-star rating signifies neither good or bad.  </li>
            <li>Believe me when i say that I&#x27;ve tried every sort of regimen for my acne, but by using the sponge only, no cleaners, three times a day with warm water and massaging my face for a few minutes, then rinsing my face with cold water, and with this my face has never been so clear and soft.</li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Actually, so much better than the Clarisoinc brush!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this sponge!  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully and the results are even better the more I use it.</li>
            <li> Feels AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Or maybe it&#x27;s just some kind of beauty gimmick?</li>
            <li> Nice to use something that doesn&#x27;t require soap.</li>
            <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It is a nice alternative to a clarisonic type device.</li>
            <li> Dries out nicely.</li>
            <li> so not everyone is going to react to this like me, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to own.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Nice cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, and it&#x27;s not an effective cleansing sponge.</li>
            <li> Then inside was this nice beauty sponge.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need soap or anything with it, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I could feel a nice tingle as I scrubbed my face.</li>
            <li> Removes make up and gives my skin a nice glow with no drying soap.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> ’s own.</li>
            <li> The thoughts that are expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> (I received this product to review, but my opinions are strictly my own.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was really impressed with this sponge and much prefer it to scratchy, drugstore alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opinions, however, are my own.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> I use sponge with my own cleanser at night and just the sponge in the morning.</li>
            <li> The product is also very affordable and great for the Eco-friendly people in our lives!</li>
            <li> Soak with warm water and rup on your face.</li>
            <li> thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my face but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> : I received it as a gift in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a nice texture, shape, and size.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products over the years and can honestly say this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> My son is bed bound and this sponge makes cleaning his face very easy.  </li>
            <li> Awwww, i love it!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that this is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice when used on the face, and i&#x27;m sure it exfoliates to a degree.</li>
            <li> then I could honestly recommend this product ( since you be using a lot of it it :) ).</li>
            <li> I cannot explain the softness perfectly but it is perfectly soft on my face.</li>
            <li> Adding it to warm water and letting it hydrate converted it from Styrofoam to the most luxurious beauty treatment that your skin has ever been treated to.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my face cream work more effectively.  </li>
            <li> So easy!  </li>
            <li> He was impressed by how clean his face felt and looked after the first use.</li>
            <li> Very Cool! :)</li>
            <li> The sensation of scrubbing my face with the sponge especially with warm water feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Really great feel and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body too and my skinn has gotten very smooth, even in winter.</li>
            <li> I love this Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> So I bought this sponge because I have blackheads on my nose and acne on my forehead which are the most oily parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> but I just love the fact that my face feels so much better.</li>
            <li> If so, I will gladly change my review rating.</li>
            <li> Love Oleavine products.</li>
            <li> Love the shape--easy to hold, and the softness.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> just ok.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT :-)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Great sponge, works very well on my face.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it, now I know I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I got the charcoal one I&#x27;ll make sure I review this sponge again to tell if helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> Love how this sponge makes my face feel and look softer.</li>
            <li> Now the breakouts are diminishing and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> Love the results.</li>
            <li> Until that point, it was just okay.</li>
            <li> A washcloth would have worked better than this sponge for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more even toned.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> 3-months ago &amp; am amazed at how much better my skin looks.  </li>

            <li> packaging itself is quite striking, you can tell thought and care went into every aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> It can be used all by itself to cleanse both face and body or with your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was able to fully appreciate this sponge as my exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to use a cleanser with it, but you can if you want to.  </li>
            <li> So glad that I did.  </li>

            <li> I have enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> I mostly love to use it before I put a face mask.</li>
            <li> Charcoal is great for absorbing excess oils in the skin.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I just use the sponge alone</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing 2 more sponges and many more.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more while they&#x27;re on sale.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not to sure if this thing is working for me now.</li>
            <li> love this sponge for cleaning my face thoroughly....</li>
            <li> Like soap but with a bit more resistance caused by the holes inside of the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial sponge that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions.</li>
            <li> For me, a better way to keep my skin clearer/healthier is by changing diet.</li>
            <li> so this seemed to be the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> but I love that there are no chemicals in this sponge.</li>

            <li> Ordering more for my girls.  </li>
            <li> and it has so many benefits.</li>
            <li> It was magical, the soothing effect that it had on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and evening, and when it is time, I plan on buying another as I really love the way that my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received this sponge free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Ho hum but better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I think that people with normal-to-dry skin could definitely not use a cleanser and have flawless skin with this sponge.</li>

            <li> I love using it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think the sponge delivers on any of the grand claims that it makes.</li>
            <li> top of it, the box says the product is &amp;</li>
            <li> most puzzling claim is that there are &amp;#34;no chemicals&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does provide a nice light exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I have been using it without cleanser when I rinse my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it would have a rougher texture and exfoliate more.</li>
            <li> Very nice and gentle.</li>
            <li> When I received a sample of this charcoal sponge, I was very excited.</li>
            <li> I used to use a washcloth, but this is far superior!</li>
            <li> I really liked how it was not tested on animals and is vegan friendly and</li>

            <li> I did not need to use soap and my face felt very clean without any drying.</li>
            <li> I heard about how good the sponges were for exfoliation, but I was surprised at how soft the sponge is and how great it works to exfoliate my skin!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this Konjac Sponge infused with activated charcoal because I have heard lots of really wonderful things about them from many different sources.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have skin that needs exfoliation in order to stay healthy and acne free.  </li>
            <li> Most were glowing, five star ratings by people who recieved free product.</li>
            <li> awesome product, delivered as expected</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon an article a beauty expert wrote on this product and how much she loved it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but I just love the texture and weight of the sponge for washing my face, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> What a super cool &amp; innovative product!  </li>
            <li> Easy to squeeze out moisture between palms and thus maintains shape.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It does exfoliate and rinses easily ...</li>
            <li> the box tells you to go easy with it so that you do not hurt the fibers</li>
            <li> I think it is so important to keep skin healthy and free of any sort of unnatural substance.</li>
            <li> It’s also really easy to use</li>
            <li> Great item and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Amazingly clean and smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Has a really strong chemical smell that overpowers me when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay nothing special.</li>
            <li> Perfect facial sponge, super soft but still exfoliates fairly well.</li>
            <li> Once it was soft I started massaging my face with it and it felt really good, the sponge is soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving the Konjac Sponge!</li>
            <li> Both are very soft, gentle and leave a wonderful feeling of clean freshness.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin and like it&#x27;s getting every spec of grime off &amp; leaving it soft, smotth &amp; super clean!</li>
            <li> love that it is very light-weighted and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it’s still good as new.</li>
            <li> and honestly I am not super impressed.</li>
            <li> Honestly one of my favorite new beauty tools.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin, however, it does seem to stay cleaner longer when I use this sponge.</li>
            <li> cause I can get the point to clean around my eyes and nose easily.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package you can see how cheap it is when you see the string you hang it with.</li>
            <li> Immediately realized what a cheap sponge I had purchased and felt ripped off.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so cheap looking, I can&#x27;t give this as gifts to anyone.</li>
            <li> The pointed end makes it easy to clean around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> Konjac sponges are great not only for washing but also for rinsing, since they hold a lot of water.</li>
            <li> , so basic yet it delivers great results.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective and she can use it without a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a great product</li>
            <li> received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is different than any others I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and gentle.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth afterward</li>
            <li> Afterwards, it leaves your skin silky smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> but I have used alone on days where I was makeup free</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps unclog pores or not, but I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free for my unbiased opinion from tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> enjoy using the sponge; I just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought this though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s essential.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so fresh and smooth afterward, and I feel like my moisturizer absorbs better.</li>
            <li> also loved how soft this sponge is.</li>
            <li> you are wanting a gentle treatment for your skin, especially if your skin is recovering from some of the harsher treatments that are out there, this Konjac sponge is an excellent solution.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bit tougher material for exfoliation, but so far all is good</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be one of the people who received this awesome facial sponge in an exchange of an honest review.</li>
            <li> &quot; but I absolutely love this product and even though \\&quot;Oleavine\\&quot; the company isn&#x27;t as well known as \\&quot;Boscia\\&quot; or some other high end skincare company, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth, clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and  smooth without soap.  </li>
            <li> My face got the smooth, clean result</li>
            <li> after you use it, your face just feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of this Konjac Sponge from Oleavine when I first took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see me spending $24.95 (original price) for this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, but it made me break out.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this sponge on my blackhead prone areas.  </li>
            <li> This is my first activated charcoal sponge and it worked much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> so I was really excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this product when I purchased it</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a review and was so excited.</li>
            <li> However after using this product, my acne worsened significantly.  </li>
            <li> It also rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li> IT leaves my skin feeling clean</li>
            <li> I kept it clean and hanging in the bathroom but couldn&#x27;t get rid of that smell</li>
            <li> Perfect for my ten year old daughter who is just beginning her skin care regime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sponge directions states to use it as a stand along, but I feel my skin will not be properly clean if I did that.</li>
            <li> Since I still had the option to clean with a cleanser, I opt for that</li>
            <li> Helps clean and exfoliate impurities in the skin with the activated charcoal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll clean up your skin &amp; let the mask do</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and exfoliated after I used</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit of my cleanser from LUSH with this along with a moisturizer that this company also makes and have been so impressed.</li>
            <li> With soap on the sponge it does clean my skin but not as well as a washcloth or my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use in the shower, and I feel like I can easily clean myself without worrying about keeping fresh washcloths around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and looks clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how it can clean your face.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very soft, so I did not think it would be effective in cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the many positive reviews, but it does not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Worked good the first few times but after that it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.</li>
            <li> w/ a medicated facial towelette, rinse w/ warm water, then use the konjac sponge (soak sponge in warm water for a couple of minutes first).  </li>
            <li> The wider end is great for large surface areas like my cheeks, with the pointed ends being perfect for hard to reach spots around my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> This is very large and makes it great for removing any extra dirts or make-up.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel super smooth, super clean, and keeps me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have used this lovely little sponge for a couple days and man is it amazing!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this in.</li>
            <li> But I love it as it&#x27;s gently even when my skin gets a bit sensitvie in the winter weather.</li>
            <li> Was good initially but took on a mildew smell after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> The teardrop shape fits nicely and naturally into your palm-</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use it very gently,although it won&#x27;t hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sponge so much.</li>
            <li> Its true, you don&#x27;t even need cleanser besides for taking makeup off.</li>
            <li> Instead of using different cleansers and soaps on your face, the sponge does the job just as good and even better and is so much simpler to use.</li>
            <li> I really love this so much.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have been given a sponge prior to this Konjac sponge and I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> it becomes a true &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am was even able to go to a gentle cleanser where I was always using an acne cleaner before.  </li>
            <li> That I think is not bad for a sponge life cycle, but I have to still state</li>
            <li> It is so much better and more effective than any other facial brush I own.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference after the first use, and could easily see changes within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Love this sponge, it is so soft and comfortable washing my face it and leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> little facial sponge is awesome, mainly because it does so many great things for your skin and is also completely natural(no chemicals, no colors added, no preservatives and is also biodegradable).</li>
            <li> Good quality as advertised but wish it was a little more abrasive for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> First week was fine</li>
            <li> I am used to with my acne gel but also super soft and even MORE SMOOTH from using the Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, for a sponge that costs $10, I expected more.</li>
            <li> This clears that up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 days, with a mild cleanser... but didn&#x27;t notice any benefits.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, so soft once it is wet.</li>
            <li> I am at the very ealr stages of the purchase, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> but after I used this, it has subsided quite tremendously.</li>
            <li> I put my face was in it and give my face a quick one over with this thing</li>
            <li> This product is great it helped get rid of my acne, it says you don&#x27;t need to use soap, but it highly recommend some type of soap for the ultimate clean.</li>
            <li> My face is very clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the very first use.  </li>
            <li> I love that it works well with my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> Works very well , leaves skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Every Christmas, I package up my favorite new products as gifts for my mother and sisters.</li>
            <li> but I was happy to see that it was a color i enjoy, its the small things in life</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and so gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I read the directions, added water and was amazed at how quickly the sponge absorbed the water</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge is a low tech solution and my skin looks lovely!</li>
            <li> There are so many similar products on the market, and this is the first that I have tried - after hearing so many raving reviews.</li>
            <li> This is currently one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li> For very light exfoliating for a short period of time (a week or so), this is fine.</li>
            <li> The thing i love the most is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause any sort of redness.</li>
            <li> It felt hard until you put warm water on it, then its like it magically came to life!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this sponge is gentle and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I first clean my face</li>
            <li> This is a great little sponge.</li>
            <li> Great little sponge, non abrasive but still seems to exfoliate quite well.</li>
            <li> The sponge fills with water, stays filled while cleansing my face and somehow it dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> My face is not red after using this (which is amazing b/c</li>
            <li> Nice product for deep pore cleansing</li>
            <li> I decided to test it for myself and enjoyed its soft texture; the cleanser is absorbed by the sponge and foams generously.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin loves that the sponge has no chemicals, pollutants or irritants, while my conscience is pleased that it is biodegradable, sustainable and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think its worth the $10.00 price tag, and then some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fun to play with.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price</li>
            <li> I still love how soft this sponge is on my face.</li>
            <li> Terrific Natural Sponge, great gift item.  </li>
            <li> in all, I personally think the sponge is great, I’ve always preferred products that are natural and have a lot benefits.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It made my face feel as fresh as it would had</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin feel and</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is.</li>
            <li> The opinions above are my own</li>
            <li> As a devotee to weekly AHA peels (pumpkin, glycolic, lactic) and regular microdermabrasion treatments, effective and gentle exfoliation is a process I am familiar with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Konjac sponges and this one is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Either way, it was a good purchase, and I continue to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very gentle, not painful at all and also exfoliates pretty well.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it&#x27;s a rock-hard, thought lightweight, gray oval.</li>
            <li> I know that right now charcoal face washes are all the rage right now, so infusing a sponge with it</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> The price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle, but somehow still manages to minimize pores and deeply clean.  </li>
            <li> I really like using this sponge to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It feels so nice and really works for my less is more lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Did clean makeup off very efficiently though.</li>
            <li> Best $10 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge to clean your makeup off  its very soft and gets into all the little crevices.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth silky elastic texture, kind of reminds me of one of those glutenous rice cakes you find at Asian bakeries or dim sum.</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected it to, but you can find konjac sponges for better prices - even at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> The sponge got so soft really fast and felt very smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked and felt so clean and healthy like this in a long time.</li>
            <li> Most exfoliators give me acne, as they are too harsh and make my skin generate more oil.</li>
            <li> this sponge is by far superior over any facial sponge i&#x27;ve ever used yet.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, easy to use and luxuriously soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin when using this as opposed to water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Too soft to exfoliate well; I don&#x27;t even bother with it as the smell is just too strong.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very very gentle with the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> Now I use one that is very gentle</li>
            <li> The only difference in the way I normally care for my face is that I am using the konjac sponge &amp; my complexion looks so much better!  </li>
            <li> I imagine most of them are the same.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li> I will defiantly order more in the future .</li>
            <li> I just love it and can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even exfoliate or have any kind of rough texture.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described</li>
            <li> Came so fast before the estimated date!</li>
            <li> Works well with or without cleanser, and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the luxurious sensation- sort of like giving myself an at-home spa facial!</li>
            <li> If the current price ever get cheaper (more on the line of $5-$6 bucks)</li>
            <li> , I thought was pretty brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin felt like I had just used a scrub or microdermabrasion on it, but I used absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> also tried this with my favorite acne facial cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant upon first inspecting this thing,</li>
            <li> Well the first night I used it</li>
            <li> She believes that her skin feels smoother and looks better after only about a week of use.</li>
            <li> It lathers well with any skin wash or soap of your choice and is so soft and smooth on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended  !!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty soon to give a review about results</li>
            <li> - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> After words, my skin was not covered in flakes (like it normally is)and felt so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> But I have pretty resilient acne,</li>
            <li> Most Konjac Sponges come with strings attached so that you can hang them on something next to your sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been interested in trying one for some time now</li>
            <li> I really love using this facial sponge because you can feel the sponge exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li> and/or you could use your favorite facial cleanser with it too.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I actually wash my face more with the sponge than I ever did without it.</li>
            <li> In my quest for better skin, I’ve tried a lot of different things–from creams and scrubs to masks and serums.</li>
            <li> First off I use my husbands amazon Prime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this for 2 days now, but I absolutely love how it&#x27;s making my skin look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li> Sponge really works !</li>
            <li> I hope to see more improvement in the following weeks.</li>
            <li> Since I bought more than one sponge I will likely return the ones I did not use.  </li>
            <li> But it is a interesting tool to use and add to your daily face washing routine.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> But, overall I do love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using it consistently for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have only used for 3 days, but my breakouts have subsided and my skin looks more dewey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to another sponge or washcloth ever again after trying this out.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the product, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that the box says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (though I don&#x27;t know what exactly to attribute that to).</li>
            <li> and I was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> the wider end is great for larger areas such as the body, while the pointed end easily glides over the smaller contours of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using the sponge and without any face wash my face has not broken out once and looks and feels clean highly recommend</li>
            <li> Honestly I sent my package to my other address and haven&#x27;t picked it up yet.</li>
            <li> It began to fall apart the very first time I soaked it in plain warm water.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week now and my skin feels soft and a clean.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean and soft after I used it.</li>
            <li> really helped exfoliate my skin and left it super smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge for a couple of days, and this sponge leaves my face really soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Since my face is fairly sensitive, I don&#x27;t like to use anything rough on my it, so I was fairly apprehensive using this sponge.  </li>
            <li> I would love a bigger sponge to use on my whole body</li>
            <li> very gentle to the skin and cleans very well</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry and sort of flaky-ish skin on my nose most of the time.</li>
            <li> It comes hard in the package nice and sealed and then when you add water to it it becomes so soft and literally is like magic for my skin.</li>
            <li> Right now, I guess it makes a decent face sponge for... applying water to your face??    </li>
            <li> Much like any other sponge, does not have a surface that exfoliates, but it is porous and absorbs warm water well.</li>
            <li> None of it chips off and drys pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The leary first time I used it I was amazed at how gentle it was and didn&#x27;t turn my skin</li>
            <li> I have used charcoal face products in the past and had a good experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I soaked the sponge in warm water and it only took about 10 seconds for it to completely be soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Really like how my face feels after using it, soft and really clean.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, not rough enough for me but definitely good quality</li>
            <li> I love it, but I feel like it never gets completely dry.</li>
            <li> This may be because I have a pretty detailed skin routine already or because it simply didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and I believe my skin is looking evener in color.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores with blackheads in my nose.</li>
            <li> Even blackheads and large pores on nose are virtually gone.</li>
            <li> I love that I can choose to use it with or without a cleanser because I tend to avoid washing my face too much because my skin will dry out.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing that it starts out hard as a rock and upon application of water that it is so soft and smooth, yes able to cleanse my face with a soft abrasiveness that is soft enough to clean a baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, thanks!</li>
            <li> is clear, soft and acne free.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference overall, but my skin did feel smoother.</li>
            <li> This sponge is gentle, providing the benefits of exfoliation without the drawbacks.</li>
            <li> It really depends on how much cleansing I need.</li>
            <li> This sponge really helps exfoliate and treat all in one.</li>
            <li> , it is gentle.</li>
            <li> I think it is too gentle.</li>
            <li> and it went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My face is much clearer &amp; continues to improve every day.  </li>
            <li> Just gently go over it sev times.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get the hype.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using the hands, the gentle touch of the sponge takes care of it.  </li>
            <li> My face looks and feels so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if it is giving me a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like using this sponge.</li>
            <li> When I ordered I really did not know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I put the sponge under water and it quickly absorbed the water and became soft and sponge</li>
            <li> I really like the shape of the sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge gently exfoliated my face.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoy this sponge for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> , it works with just gentle movements.</li>
            <li> This really did not bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its surface is very slippere .</li>
            <li> if it really helps with acne at all</li>
            <li> Packaged well and arrived really soon.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know much about Konjac sponges</li>
            <li> The Oleavine Konjac Sponge is a plant based sponge that gently exfoliates while helping to promote circulation.</li>
            <li> , you can gently press the sponge to get out any excess water but NEVER wring out the sponge.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer since I have started using this.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is infused with bamboo charcoal that contains carbons and minerals which will aid in purifying your skin, helping draw out excess oils and acne-causing bacteria, and will supply your skin with much need antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Gently massage your face with the sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge claims to provide gentle exfoliation and can be used with or without cleanser.</li>
            <li> so my face gets very greasy thru out the day hence the acne.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was more rough.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase another for showering very soon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much of a background on these types of sponges</li>
            <li> I thought that this product wouldn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> For the price, I would expect to use it for a much longer time period before throwing it away.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok..holds too much water.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I use it with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> There are probably much cheaper products out there</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s a bit much.</li>
            <li> I was eager to do so, since I figured it would reduce the cost per use under sixty cents and that would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and my skin is much happier.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from hormonal acne and after 2 uses I have noticed my complexion is much smoother and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> It really just seems like a gray, teardrop shaped sponge.</li>
            <li> but then again, i only wash my face with african soap and moisturize with rose hip oil</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve gone without a cleanser for a few weeks and still had no breakouts.</li>
            <li> All Charcoal sponges can be a bit harsh on my skin that is eczema prone, but this one seemed to work nicely and well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sponge because of all the good reviews and I&#x27;m surprised at how much I disliked it.  </li>
            <li> Clear evidence to me that the konjac sponge works!!!</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my face because it is much more gentle around the eye area than using a wash cloth or other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Previously I have used many sponges over the years with out success for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I first used their French Red Clay all natural Konjac sponge and liked it.</li>
            <li> The Oleavine Konjac Sponge comes infused with bamboo charcoal which is very good for skin with acne as it can help pull extra oils in the skin that would stay trapped when using just bare hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though so soft, the sponge is a natural exfoliator, massaging your skin to a tingling, relaxing state of clean.</li>
            <li> I am so in love and want to buy the other ones this company makes.</li>
            <li> There are many other brands out there for which I cannot say \\&quot;work\\&quot; or \\&quot;don&#x27;t work\\</li>
            <li> The string makes it easy to hang and dry out in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels extra clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I can buy a lot of washcloths for the same price and use a clean one each time I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes and of course, my skin is still naturally oily and nothing will change that, it does seem to exfoliate and it is very gentle on the skin if that is a concern for you.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> A few of those are fine, but too many are suspicious to me, especially when they seem to be every review.</li>
            <li> It works, but so gently, at cleansing the skin, that I didn&#x27;t realize it was working as well as it was until I rinsed my face, patted it dry and felt how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li> But yea... so far it&#x27;s pretty meh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any different then a wash cloth and face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was a really nice touch that not many companies take the time to do.</li>
            <li> Soo soft on the face and amazed how fast it came!</li>
            <li> Firstly I am 44 years old</li>
            <li> Was expecting this to be more than the average kitchen sink sponge.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and gets irritated easily.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice and soft little sponge.</li>
            <li> Removes all the dry skin build up Leaves your face feeling smooth .</li>
            <li> This is likely another beauty trend that will die a quick death.</li>
            <li> so I do not know if this is particular to this brand or</li>
            <li> , I would definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I mainly like the ease when washing with the sponge, nice texture and soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who takes care of there face or wants a new beauty product for their routine.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and gentle on my face and makes washing my face a delight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle, especially in the more sensitive areas (around my nose and eyebrows),  and I can use way less cleanser.</li>
            <li> When you try the product for yourself you see that the sponge is super soft, almost like porous cotton balls and not bristle-like at all (unlike general defoliators).</li>
            <li> After using the Activated Charcoal and the French Green Clay, I have found the French Red Clay to be the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would thus highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to try this out.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the little string to hang it with as it is not in the way when using the sponge.  </li>
            <li> Love this little sponge...will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> but in my opinion, its a little of both but more the sponge.  </li>
            <li> I used a little of my favorite cleanser and just washed over my face with it.</li>
            <li> Love the product BUT the marketing is a little misleading...</li>
            <li> Love this little thing</li>
            <li> As I have &amp;#34; older skin &amp;#34; it really works to sluff off the old and reveal the healthier skin layer underneath.</li>
            <li> I use a milk-based cleanser, which doesn&#x27;t foam up, but the sponge still enables to cleanser to clean my face without it feeling scrubbed too dry.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates, cleanses, is naturally pH balanced, promotes circulation, absorbs toxins and fights bacteria while leaving your face glowing and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used as instructed, and I normally don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> glad I got this one instead of the round</li>
            <li> To do this just wet the sponge with some warm water allowing it to pull as much as it needs to be fully wet</li>
            <li> This facial sponge feels nice against my face and skin, works well with other beauty products!</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge is very unique among facial sponges especially for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Many of the other acne products have caused some major dryness and irritation .The</li>
            <li> However, when soaked in water it becomes a super soft sponge suitable for delicate facial skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a new cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It is a new beauty must-have for</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new beauty products to try, specifically those that help with exfoliation or skin brightening.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of a brand new kitchen sponge.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new friends in skin care.</li>
            <li> Using it for several days now, it doesn&#x27;t really seem its made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Yet, with the Konjac sponge I can do a quick rub all over my face and not have to think twice about moisturizing every single time.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the sponge is either rock hard (when it&#x27;s dry) or way too soft to be a very effective exfoliant (when damp).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> The sponge itself is surprisingly very soft.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and found that it was actually very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft skin after</li>
            <li> But, very soft.</li>
            <li> I expected something special with this one.</li>
            <li> have been really good about hanging it from the small thread hanging hook that is installed on the sponge, and that allows the air to circulate and lets it dry evenly.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it without any type of facial cleanser, my face is left soft and clean.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s enormous!!  </li>
            <li> Soft on my face!</li>
            <li> I like how it feels due to its gentle exfoliation -- not sure if the charcoal has done much, but the exfoliating sponge in itself is nice.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I wash my face first with the sponge to exfoliate and then use a facial cleanser (since they recommend not to use a foam with the sponge)My Skin</li>
            <li> but boy was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li> is a pretty big sponge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost two weeks and really like it, the sponge definitely gives me that deep cleansing that I&#x27;m always looking for, while still not feeling rough on my skin or drying it out like many exfoliating products do.</li>
            <li> sponge has made it easy for him to exfoliate and disinfectant his skin without the side effects of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> So, while it felt nice, I&#x27;m not sure there is any actual charcoal in the sponge.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sponge to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use some of the more harsh facial sponges.</li>
            <li> At the current $10, it&#x27;s a far better value than any of the other tools I have seen!</li>
            <li> I have used the sponge for a little over a week and my pores appear smaller and the texture of my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> The sponge is ok, as with any new facial product it made me break out within a few days.</li>
            <li> But after using this for only a few days my skin feels completely different (for the better)!  </li>
            <li> but it did dry back to its original feel and texture.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a while now and typically use it in the shower to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Hopefully over time, the skars can heal and his skin will clear up.</li>
            <li> Is my body wash toxic, and therefore rendered less effective by this chemically active sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone says to buy that clear sonic thing</li>
            <li> I have rather sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> its just way too soft and has no abrasiveness to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, however I do get occasional blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my fave by far, and I have already received texts from the recipients asking where they can purchase this sponge, so THEY can gift it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This konjac sponge (and I tried 5 others) leaves my skin soft and velvety.  </li>
            <li> I bought this sponge for my son who has sensitive skin but needs the exfoliation properties of a Buf Puf without the irritation rigorous use entails.</li>
            <li> It went straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Switched back to my oatmeal &amp; sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soo soft and exfoliatied.</li>
            <li> It may have just been the scrubbing action, idk, but it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and exfoliating this sponge is.</li>
            <li> It said it was gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and I thought since it was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> So natural and the texture is out of this world.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how soft my skin was after using this.  </li>
            <li> I remember thinking no way this sponge is going to be soft on my face.</li>
            <li> Really like the feel of this on my face - it looks like of like pumice, but glides over your skin with no extra cleanser or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This sponge was extremely soft on my face.</li>
            <li> it has fibers in it that make is soft and also pliable.</li>
            <li> As for the product it&#x27;s self, it is so soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said its as soft as a marshmallo .</li>
            <li> I read about this sponge online and decided to try it on my old face.  </li>
            <li> I have natural oily skin</li>
            <li> This Konjac facial sponge gently cleanses, detoxifies,exfoliates, and refreshes your face.</li>
            <li> Also this sponge is naturally pH balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a tad leery because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how soft the sponge is against my face.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft and spongy, but don&#x27;t let that confuse you.</li>
            <li> Leaves  me smooth without  the harsh exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and this works EXCELLENT!💥</li>
            <li> Like a soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Its so soft so its give my face the look I want.</li>
            <li> The sponge is non-abrasive and dries quickly to be ready for the next use.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and it works nicely on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Soft yet still exfoliates.</li>
            <li> That they found a vegan at the bus stop near the factory, and he said he like the sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh.</li>
            <li> This is just a soft sponge.  </li>
            <li> I could exfoliate my skin better with one of those yellow and green sponges you can by at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This helped get off some dead skin but not much, its nice if used with a sugar scrub or microderm though.</li>
            <li> Apparently charcoal is the new thing in beauty products because it helps rid the skin of impurities and helps with oil.  </li>
            <li> First its a dry sponge or like a fungus.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all different colors, so these active magic ingredients must be what makes the different colors when compared to the &amp;#34;pure white&amp;#34; sponge.</li>
            <li> Although I have used the Konjac three times, the first several seconds during initial use, were sufficient to determine it was just too darn soft (almost slimy) to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t know this was a \\&quot;special konjac sponge\\&quot; I would have thought it was just some weird cheap sponge from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> My mom loves hers as the red clay is for older skin.</li>
            <li> No other products I buy have vendors who contact me so frequently to so aggressively solicit feedback or reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soak or rinse the sponge in warm water to allow the sponge to soften (the sponge is hard in its dry state).</li>
            <li> At first my face was breaking out a little more than usual</li>
            <li> Of particular interest to me is how the &amp;#34;Bamboo Charcoal&amp;#34; selectively absorbs only toxins and not other materials.</li>
            <li> and I had a bit of acne (small spots), redness, uneven skin tone/acne scars and oiliness(especially in my T-zone) and this sponge actually made my face look amazing after one use!</li>
            <li> It looks like a hardened Styrofoam at first, but when wet, it is the softest sponge you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li> The above mentioned cleansers work to remove it pretty well for a few days, but this Konjac Sponge was the first non-chemical thing I have found to take care of that problem area as well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I spent, considering I spotted the same product in the high end cosmetic store for double the price!</li>
            <li> things improved and now I have clear skin again which is radiant and not a single pimple.</li>
            <li> And (3) after rinsing, gently press between your palms to get out any excess water and hang to air dry.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know how long this sponge is suppose to last at first, since it doesn&#x27;t state that information on the box or instruction, so I email the company and asked them.</li>
            <li> My initial thought was “no way that is going near my sensitive skin.”</li>
            <li> My nose is looking better every day, the pores are getting smaller and the acne on my forehead is slowly going away.</li>
            <li> The sponge dried really quickly</li>
            <li> As to the, &#x27;boost effectiveness of facial cleaners ...&#x27; I am unable to post a fair assessment at this point.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> I had a major improvement in my skin by morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a material like no other.  </li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning thinking wow!</li>
            <li> and my skin has been fine (and much less dry)...</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that would make my skin feel clean  and radiant without the dryness and harsh chemicals and thesis it!</li>
            <li> I’m fighting some excessive oiliness in my t-zone and I felt like without cleanser, even though the sponge got my face clean, it wasn’t as oil-free as I prefer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this because of all the terrific reviews but mine broke apart within a few days.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the anti-acne effects of this sponge, since I am using other acne treatments at the moment, but I love how soft and supple it is while washing my face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend  buying this facial sponge because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My biggest issue is just build up in general.  </li>
            <li> After clearly reading the instructions (which oddly enough calls for no cleanser)</li>
            <li> Used it for a month with water only thinking it would clear away.  </li>
            <li> no problems so far with daily use</li>
            <li> Really soft, I just started using this and plan on once daily</li>
            <li> I am a nearly 70 y/o female w/ combination skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it take off my makeup with ease, but it exfoliated my face and made it really soft.</li>
            <li> Oleavine beauty facial sponge is made of 100% natural Konjac fibers(a plant that is found throughout Asia).</li>
            <li> Oleavine Beauty Konjac Facial Sponge is infused with charcoal and made from natural fibers.</li>
            <li> It was not expected.</li>
            <li> You just have to try it out for yourself, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the softness it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> not impressed to be honest.</li>
            <li> Or, there may be some amount, but the consumer is really unable to tell what that amount is and how effective it might be, and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I used it i followed the box and gently squeezed it between my hands and left it to dry</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was slightly rougher as it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I&#x27;d like, but for the general everyday purpose of cleaning of the face and mild exfoliating, it does its job</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling a little dry, but was just fine after I put on moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I first got this sponge, I was really surprised on how hard it was, and I didn&#x27;t want it anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out from the tearing of other sponges.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the Konjac Sponge initially, but I have since enjoyed using the product on my very sensitive skin these past few weeks.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t like spending hours in the bathroom going through several steps of a skin care regimen, but is self conscious about his face at the same time.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Soft enough for a baby&#x27;s skin ... &#x27; should have been my cue to (Exit Stage Left).</li>
            <li> I expected at least something more sturdy like twine.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package the first thing I saw was was a thank you letter thanking you for buying their product with a guarantee behind their products.</li>
            <li> I can see that this needs to be sanitized frequently, as it is never completely dry when I go to use it at night after morning use.</li>
            <li> The sponge removes dried flaky skin everyday safely.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft and takes off the dry skin I get from using ace-prone medicine.</li>
            <li> At first it feels hard and rough, but get it wet and the exfoliation is so smooth and cleansing.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was a little nervous about using the sponge.</li>
            <li> Once this sponge gets wet, it becomes super soft and really does exfoliator the skin without irritating it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not see much of a difference in using this verses a facial sponge of any other type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> The sponge is hard when you first open it but soon after exposure to water it becomes very soft.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is even if you don&#x27;t squeeze it, it never dries back into it&#x27;s original shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard when it&#x27;s dry but turns super soft after you put it in water.</li>
            <li> and I was seriously amazed at how clean my face felt afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Showering every day and letting the sponge air dry, I find that it lasts about six weeks before it becomes too soft and starts deteriorating.</li>
            <li> The sponge did get very soft once wet</li>
            <li> And...not to be indelicate, but there&#x27;s something about that string that reminds me a little too much of a certain type of feminine hygiene product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When you wet this sponge, it becomes so soft!</li>
            <li> but I much rater use an apricot facial scrub prior to using the sponge as I feel it leaves the sponge less greasy.</li>
            <li> My three-star rating signifies neither good or bad.  </li>
            <li> Believe me when i say that I&#x27;ve tried every sort of regimen for my acne, but by using the sponge only, no cleaners, three times a day with warm water and massaging my face for a few minutes, then rinsing my face with cold water, and with this my face has never been so clear and soft.</li>
            <li> It comes dry and hard and you have to soak it with water to get it soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Never completely dries either even if I hang it next to an open window.  </li>
            <li> Worse the string eventually ripped through the top after hanging it to dry wet.</li>
            <li> Yeah, made a difference maybe for a few days but went back to normal after a while</li>
            <li> Though it’s rock hard when removed from the package, it softens quickly when wet.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this product at first due to the fact that I have very sensitive when it comes it exfoliation products that it is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> but my face was left red and dry.  </li>
            <li> This sponge combined with some of the skin treatments and lotions Ive been trying lately have combined to make my skin quite pretty and glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase this sponge for myself again, although I do like how it makes my skin feel I don&#x27;t really see the practicality in it or the need.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and although I have used harsh exfoliating produces, They left me with red skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> This was a little odd at first - different texture/fee.  </li>
            <li> This sponge removes dead skin with out damaging the new skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> When I use it, it just feels like a regular kitchen sponge on my face and when I hang it to dry it</li>
            <li> Many times with an exfoliator it is rough and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Recently, I’ve come to realize that harsh things only make my things worse, and aren’t the answer to getting smooth and radiant skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again and will actually recommend it to all the other teachers I work with.  </li>
            <li> This is a little on the soft side.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this sponge but was searching for something different to clean my face.</li>
            <li> My complexion was always clear until a few years ago when I began having whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
            <li> It makes it look like a gigantic grey tampon hanging by my sink.</li>
            <li> The cleanser goes a long way with one of  these.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;d never heard of anything like it, I was curious and thought a $10 product wasn&#x27;t a big investment, so why not.</li>
            <li> It was completely different than what I expected and like nothing I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used Activated Charcoal and French Pink Clay.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been living so long without this product.</li>
            <li> In places that I have flare ups for my eczema, I need to go over really softly or not use the sponge on those areas - not because of the sponge, but because any sponge can cause a flare up.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Oleavine all natural Konjac Sponge for a few weeks and not using any soap at all on my face</li>
            <li> The manufacturer sells a &amp;#34;pure white&amp;#34; sponge, a &amp;#34;green clay&amp;#34; sponge, a &amp;#34;red clay&amp;#34; sponge, and this grey &amp;#34;activated charcoal&amp;#34; sponge.</li>
            <li> This thing will pay for itself in the long run assuming it holds up.</li>
            <li> Also, my dark spots from my acne is starting to lighten up due to exfoliation gently removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I use one of the red clay ones and the other two were given as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Definitely different than other exfoliators that feel like they are ripping your face off.</li>
            <li> I also tend to get blotchy and red when I exfoliate and due to the softness of this sponge I did</li>
            <li> The way my skin responds to is is simply beyond any other product that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was actually amazed how a sponge that is so hard can turn into a really soft one.</li>
            <li> first I was concerned as the sponge appears to be very hard.  </li>
            <li> Also, string hanging off the thing is so insubstantial that I can&#x27;t imagine it lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> Now after just a couple of days my skin is softer and the clearest it has been in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Hang to dry.</li>
            <li> When finished using it, I rinse the sponge, press it between my palms to squeeze out the water, &amp; hang it to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin; so I used it twice a month.</li>
            <li> It has a wierd texture to it in my fingers, sort of a dry slime (does that make sense?)</li>
            <li> Being that it is winter my face is so dry</li>
            <li> is that it had a string attached to it so that it can hang up and dry when it is not in use.</li>
            <li> Hang the sponge in a ventilated area to air dry.</li>
            <li> Rinse it and hang to somewhere to keep it dry and reuse.</li>
            <li> Does not live up to the hype in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this sponge morning and night with my usual sensitive Neutrogena makeup remover and cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge, as an exfoliating tool, is several notches below an average washcloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough or harsh.  </li>
            <li> I had less obvious and smaller-sized breakouts.</li>
            <li> my sponge is slimmer than my slim wallet when dry and swells only slightly when wet.  </li>
            <li> I use the clarisonic brush, but always have dry skin, this little sponge is working, you need to use a tiny amount of soap.</li>
            <li> In the winter months, when my skin becomes very dry, I think this will work well for</li>
            <li> The sponge I had been using was the size of a small egg, this one (once wet) covers the entire palm and up to the middle of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Is always wet because is hard to dry this helps bacterias life and to soft</li>
            <li> I will say that I do need a little extra cleanser to help with removal</li>
            <li> I worry that chunks of the sponge that fall off will end up clogging my drain or plumbing, so maybe I replace the sponge a little earlier than I might otherwise do.</li>
            <li> my skin will turn red with little provocation).  </li>
            <li> Hard sponge that becomes too soft &amp; slimy when wet.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a difference in the quality of his skin (smoother and more shine) and his breakouts are not as bad.</li>
            <li> I have been so busy lately and stalled using it</li>
            <li> I just wet it and washed.</li>
            <li> The weight of the wet sponge hanging on it cut through.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no affect on your complexion.</li>
            <li> In the evening, I do wash my face with a facial cleanser to remove makeup or heavy sunscreens while I shower.  </li>
            <li> I just simply wet the sponge thoroughly and rubbed it all over my face.</li>
            <li> and I had a total of 12, underneath the surface, pimples to appear on my face in a matter of a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and you really do not need to use this roughly</li>
            <li> Before its wet, it comes as a form of foam like feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days</li>
            <li> Read the directions and follow them carefully.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday now with my facial soap cleaner.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be rough</li>
            <li> This sponge was not at all what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no way to learn what &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; means; there may not be any amount of bamboo charcoal in the product at all.</li>
            <li> After getting soaked, it slowly becomes moist then really soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than the other sponge that I was using.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough to exfoliate a baby&#x27;s ass.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try their other Konjac products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan and might try some of the other sponges too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> As the other commenters have said, it&#x27;s just a sponge.</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of these due to the hype and while it does what it says it does, I don&#x27;t think its \\&quot;all that and a bag of chips</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure they make them bigger???  </li>
            <li> I like this sponge because I use it every other day</li>
            <li> Other unverifiable claims on the box include &amp;#34;vegan approved&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not tested on animals&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little string attached to it so you can hang it somewhere where there’s an air flow so it can dry off after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to be purchasing this little wonder sponge for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I first got it, I was confused because it is hard like a rock or a piece of Styrofoam in its&#x27; plastic over wrap.</li>
            <li> The reason for this is so you don&#x27;t damage the delicate fibers, and in my opinion it helps it last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not much texture to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> There are a few things to note about using a Konjac Sponge (1) you need to use a wet sponge when cleansing.</li>
            <li> but that comes down to what you prefer</li>
            <li> It is hard as a rock, but when you get it wet it gets like wet packaging peanuts.</li>
            <li> It even seems like I&#x27;ve been less oily throughout the day when I use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my face is breaking out less since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> My face needs slightly rougher surface.</li>
            <li> My skin looks slightly fresher after each use.</li>
            <li> I have less blackheads and buildup when I use this.  </li>
            <li> based on the cost, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to you if you are on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting use to but lived up to the claims</li>
            <li> I have been using my sponge for a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> A lot of exfoliators have little beads that don&#x27;t break apart and get deposited into the ocean and rivers.</li>
            <li> I will stick to this little sponge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I dislike giving bad reviews because I&#x27;m sure there are people working very hard on this little sponges</li>
            <li> The sponge starts out hard and then once you get it wet</li>
            <li> Anyone that has or suffers from acne or breakouts should really try this product.</li>
            <li> This does not exfoliate at all for me, I still have to use something else to get the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> and I would probably get another one if this one went missing or started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> and i can feel how delicate the sponge was delicate yet firm enough.</li>
            <li> This year, a few beauty products made it into the gift bag.  </li>
            <li> I started using Dead Sea Minerals soap and the Oleavine sponge and overnight  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, the sponge crumbled.</li>
            <li> I used it a few time, but it hasn&#x27;t cleansed my face that well.</li>
            <li> this was a waste</li>
            <li> I use this sponge everyday and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> and i was wary of it because i did not think it would get soft too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will try to remember to update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s using it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I have never, however, tried a sponge that wasn’t harsh and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this sponge and the round one as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use on my face and can see the difference after just a few weeks in the texture and the elimination of dryness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge a few weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  </li>
            <li> The product basically disintegrated in the shower after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few Konjac sponges.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months now and it has made my skin noticeable</li>
            <li> The sponge came apart after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any instructions, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s just a passive bath sponge as far as I can</li>
            <li> It is black!</li>
            <li> I like black!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer says &amp;#34;no other beauty sponge will work so hard for you!&amp;#34; The sponge hasn&#x27;t done a darn thing; it just sits there.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was a little dark gray oval that was hard and looked like a pumice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I am scrubbing my face raw</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s just how it should feel or not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved the look of my skin...</li>
            <li> All of the past charcoal products I have used had some sort of blackish residue from the charcoal.</li>
            <li> Too soft for exfoliation and awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> Not really sure I get the point of it versus another type of sponge.</li>
            <li> Made me break out :-/</li>
            <li> I am not sure how often to replace it; probably every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure what this is doing for me skin, but I like using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it ,I was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does as it promises though.</li>
            <li> This sponge cleans unbelievably well.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it with a cleanser (just my preference)</li>
            <li> The absurd claims the product makes baffle me, and actually put me off purchasing it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that means; I can&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;hobbyist&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;enthusiast&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, they&#x27;re either too vague to prove or just plain false.</li>
            <li> They stated the sponge has to be replaced every 2-3 months or once the sponge has broken down.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this was VERY stiff when you get it out of the package/box</li>
            <li> The pimples had decreased in size and were less inflamed.  </li>
            <li> I do not rub my face hard.  </li>
            <li> cause it was hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to describe.</li>
            <li> Once I opened it I felt a hard sponge.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment are the sizes of these sponges.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rude my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product works in totality, but all I know is that it DOES WORK!</li>
            <li> What does that specifically mean?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about how this was going to work.</li>
            <li> My wife was a little skeptical but one try</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son who has a bad case of acne and an even worse case of laziness.</li>
            <li> contact the seller to discuss my purchase and then review the product were just unnecessary, and have eliminated any chance that I will purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, some worked well, others didn&#x27;t do anything at all, and some made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> All of the exfoliating brushes and tools are too abrasive for my skin and make it break out even worse.</li>
            <li> it would be worse before it got better&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Too soft to exfoliate and caused me to breakout horribly after one week of use.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Has a weird feel to it.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist sold me over $200 of expensive products which didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I believe it is way to expensive for it being what it is.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had crazy breakouts since I started using this sponge -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> This is also a very vague notion, since we can&#x27;t quantitatively measure any of the effects.</li>
            <li> but then it made me break out really bad.</li>
            <li> and I can visibly see and feel the sponge soaking up all of the bad oil that would cause me to have breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I am sitting there with a stupid brush for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Well, after a couple of years of the mineral makeup, my skin started reacting violently (rosacea type symptoms) with increased blackheads in T zone, flaky skin, and pimples.</li>
            <li> Besides that I am very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> and it still smells terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this sponge a lot. Most exfoliators give me acne, as they are too harsh and make my skin generate more oil. This sponge is gentle, providing the benefits of exfoliation without the drawbacks. I will be buying again. Whether this is the best brand to own, I don&#x27;t know. I imagine most of them are the same.</li>
            <li> We love them! I just ordered another one for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I love this Konjac sponge. It is amazing that it starts out hard as a rock and upon application of water that it is so soft and smooth, yes able to cleanse my face with a soft abrasiveness that is soft enough to clean a baby&#x27;s face. It has such a luxurious feel and I use it every night. This is my favorite way to cleanse my face. I have used it with and without a cleanser. It really depends on how much cleansing I need. The shape is perfect cause I can get the point to clean around my eyes and nose easily. It also rinses clean with water.</li>
            <li> Charcoal is so great for ance prone skin! This sponge really helps exfoliate and treat all in one. I recommend this sponge if you have clogged pores and acne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product to use on my face. Hard sponge that becomes too soft &amp; slimy when wet. Wasn&#x27;t a good feeling for me</li>
            <li> So I bought this sponge because I have blackheads on my nose and acne on my forehead which are the most oily parts of my face.  The sponge is hard when you first open it but soon after exposure to water it becomes very soft. I have been using it for about a week now and my skin feels soft and a clean. I actually see my face getting lighter. I tried using it without a cleanser but I much rater use an apricot facial scrub prior to using the sponge as I feel it leaves the sponge less greasy. Yes, without the cleanser I feel as the sponge remains oily from my face. Not sure if that&#x27;s just how it should feel or not but I just love the fact that my face feels so much better. My nose is looking better every day, the pores are getting smaller and the acne on my forehead is slowly going away. I also have acne scars on my forehead and I see a difference in that as well. I will continue to purchase this product as I feel it works. You should give it a try.</li>
            <li> It is a sponge. Much like any other sponge, does not have a surface that exfoliates, but it is porous and absorbs warm water well. I&#x27;ve used it as suggested with only water. I do not see much of a difference in using this verses a facial sponge of any other type.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to a wash cloth. I have rather sensitive and acne prone skin. no problems so far with daily use, it is gentle. I use it and leave it in the shower to wash and exfoliate. it does the job well.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used this sponge for about a week now. If I didn&#x27;t know this was a \\&quot;special konjac sponge\\&quot; I would have thought it was just some weird cheap sponge from the dollar store. It comes dry and hard and you have to soak it with water to get it soft and ready to use. It has a smooth silky elastic texture, kind of reminds me of one of those glutenous rice cakes you find at Asian bakeries or dim sum. It&#x27;s texture does not seem like something that would exfoliate anything... its just way too soft and has no abrasiveness to it. Using it for several days now, it doesn&#x27;t really seem its made much of a difference. Maybe I need to use it longer? Or maybe it&#x27;s just some kind of beauty gimmick? Honestly, for a sponge that costs $10, I expected more. This does not exfoliate at all for me, I still have to use something else to get the dead skin cells off. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved the look of my skin... I have oily skin and large pores with blackheads in my nose. I was hoping to get rid of those using this sponge. But yea... so far it&#x27;s pretty meh. Hopefully with time I&#x27;ll notice something. If so, I will gladly change my review rating. Right now, I guess it makes a decent face sponge for... applying water to your face??    EDIT: So I&#x27;ve had this sponge for a while now and typically use it in the shower to clean my face. I have to say, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic changes and of course, my skin is still naturally oily and nothing will change that, it does seem to exfoliate and it is very gentle on the skin if that is a concern for you. It&#x27;s kept up well and I would probably get another one if this one went missing or started to fall apart. For that, I have raised my rating of this item from 3 stars to 4. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was slightly rougher as it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I&#x27;d like, but for the general everyday purpose of cleaning of the face and mild exfoliating, it does its job and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints. Get one and try it for yourself! Your results may differ.</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious facial sponge that almost wipes away whiteheads. I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I could feel the difference after the first use, and could easily see changes within 2 weeks.  I opted to use the Sumi Haigou Settuken Charcoal Bar Soap (also sold by Amazon) and the combination of the two, for me, has produced wonderful results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Konjac sponges and this one is pretty fantastic. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again! Good quality and can be used with or without face soap. Helps remove all traces of makeup while lightening and brightening skin tone. As a makeup artist, I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> Love Oleavine products. I first used their French Red Clay all natural Konjac sponge and liked it. I thought I would try their other Konjac products. After using the Activated Charcoal and the French Green Clay, I have found the French Red Clay to be the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge!  I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, however I do get occasional blackheads.  This clears that up quickly.  My skin feels so soft and smooth now.  Love the shape--easy to hold, and the softness.  I was very impressed that this is 100% natural.  Great item for the beauty bag!</li>
            <li> I have used charcoal face products in the past and had a good experience. When I received a sample of this charcoal sponge, I was very excited. I used the sponge without any cleansers. I just wet it and washed. The sponge did get very soft once wet but I have no idea where the charcoal was. All of the past charcoal products I have used had some sort of blackish residue from the charcoal. This didn&#x27;t have any of that. So, while it felt nice, I&#x27;m not sure there is any actual charcoal in the sponge.</li>
            <li> Very nice and gentle. It&#x27;s very soft on the skin. I haven&#x27;t been using it long but it seems to be good. No complaints yet. I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little sponge. I can tell it is exfoliating, but isn&#x27;t too rough on my sensitive skin. It has the consistency of a sponge-not a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Removes all the dry skin build up Leaves your face feeling smooth . It like going to a spa and getting a facial and sauna steam .  I will defiantly order more in the future .</li>
            <li> This was a little odd at first - different texture/fee.  But I love it as it&#x27;s gently even when my skin gets a bit sensitvie in the winter weather. Excellent customer service - received an e-mail after delivery from the vendor to see if I had any questions.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling quite refreshed and very clean.  Easy to squeeze out moisture between palms and thus maintains shape.  Love the little string to hang it with as it is not in the way when using the sponge.  I intend on remaining a Konjac Sponge customer!</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge...will be purchasing again...also as gifts!!</li>
            <li> Is always wet because is hard to dry this helps bacterias life and to soft</li>
            <li> Really soft, I just started using this and plan on once daily so will update once I use for a longer period of time. Nice to use something that doesn&#x27;t require soap.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like it is exfoliating at all.  I think it is too gentle.</li>
            <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Nice product for deep pore cleansing</li>
            <li> ingenious technology!! I have sensitive skin and i can feel how delicate the sponge was delicate yet firm enough. I have been so busy lately and stalled using it but once i have time, i will continue my regimen.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge because of all the good reviews and I&#x27;m surprised at how much I disliked it.  First, it&#x27;s enormous!!  The sponge I had been using was the size of a small egg, this one (once wet) covers the entire palm and up to the middle of my fingers.  That may not seem like a big deal, but when you&#x27;re washing your face, you don&#x27;t want to be fumbling with the sponge.  Also, string hanging off the thing is so insubstantial that I can&#x27;t imagine it lasts very long.  And...not to be indelicate, but there&#x27;s something about that string that reminds me a little too much of a certain type of feminine hygiene product.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and it went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Been using for two weeks...</li>
            <li> At first it feels hard and rough, but get it wet and the exfoliation is so smooth and cleansing. I love it, but I feel like it never gets completely dry.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was skeptical.  But after using this for only a few days my skin feels completely different (for the better)!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works very well , leaves skin smooth and clean. For now it is as described!</li>
            <li> Every Christmas, I package up my favorite new products as gifts for my mother and sisters. This year, a few beauty products made it into the gift bag.  This is my fave by far, and I have already received texts from the recipients asking where they can purchase this sponge, so THEY can gift it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This konjac sponge (and I tried 5 others) leaves my skin soft and velvety.  It is so gentle, but somehow still manages to minimize pores and deeply clean.  I just love it and can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
            <li> Unimpressed. I purchased this item because of the many positive reviews, but it does not do anything for me. Too soft for exfoliation and awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> just ok. Not really sure I get the point of it versus another type of sponge. Has a weird feel to it.</li>
            <li> Just a sponge. I expected something special with this one. When I opened the package you can see how cheap it is when you see the string you hang it with. It is regular sewing string like you use to repair a button. I expected at least something more sturdy like twine. Immediately realized what a cheap sponge I had purchased and felt ripped off. Worse the string eventually ripped through the top after hanging it to dry wet. The weight of the wet sponge hanging on it cut through. I was going to give it as a gift to some family members that appreciate things like this. But it&#x27;s so cheap looking, I can&#x27;t give this as gifts to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t even exfoliate or have any kind of rough texture. I did not see any improvement in my skin in the entire time I have used it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality sponge. It is very gentle and works well for my sensitive skin. It is wonderful for gently exfoliating your face and it leaves your face feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  This cleans my face so well.  I love the softness it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Soft on my face! LOVE IT :-)</li>
            <li> I have skin that needs exfoliation in order to stay healthy and acne free.  I used a buff puff for years, but for some reason had stopped using it and was using mineral foundation on my skin. Well, after a couple of years of the mineral makeup, my skin started reacting violently (rosacea type symptoms) with increased blackheads in T zone, flaky skin, and pimples. I was horrified! Dermatologist sold me over $200 of expensive products which didn&#x27;t help. After months of research and trial and error I started using Dead Sea Minerals soap and the Oleavine sponge and overnight  (no exaggeration here!)  things improved and now I have clear skin again which is radiant and not a single pimple. Even blackheads and large pores on nose are virtually gone. I use it twice a day, in the morning with only water, then at night with the soap, massaging all over face for about a minute then follow up with a tea tree oil toner.  This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Worked good the first few times but after that it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the anti-acne effects of this sponge, since I am using other acne treatments at the moment, but I love how soft and supple it is while washing my face. The pointed end makes it easy to clean around the nose and eyes. Konjac sponges are great not only for washing but also for rinsing, since they hold a lot of water. Now that I have used these, I never want to go back to another method. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after using this wonderful product! I have been searching for something that would make my skin feel clean  and radiant without the dryness and harsh chemicals and thesis it!</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge to clean your makeup off  its very soft and gets into all the little crevices.</li>
            <li> Great product! Exactly as described</li>
            <li> I really like using this sponge to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Great little sponge, non abrasive but still seems to exfoliate quite well. I use the clarisonic brush, but always have dry skin, this little sponge is working, you need to use a tiny amount of soap. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> IT leaves my skin feeling clean</li>
            <li> Great sponge, works very well on my face. Skin feels clean and soft after I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this sponge for my son who has sensitive skin but needs the exfoliation properties of a Buf Puf without the irritation rigorous use entails. He was impressed by how clean his face felt and looked after the first use. I decided to test it for myself and enjoyed its soft texture; the cleanser is absorbed by the sponge and foams generously. It is a nice alternative to a clarisonic type device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough enough to exfoliate. It began to fall apart the very first time I soaked it in plain warm water. The string hanging off the sponge for drying is just tacky. It makes it look like a gigantic grey tampon hanging by my sink. For the price, I expected better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three emails I&#x27;ve received requesting I contact the seller to discuss my purchase and then review the product were just unnecessary, and have eliminated any chance that I will purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 days, with a mild cleanser... but didn&#x27;t notice any benefits. It went straight to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Switched back to my oatmeal &amp; sugar scrubs. Glad I purchased it, now I know I don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my face because it is much more gentle around the eye area than using a wash cloth or other alternatives.</li>
            <li> Came so fast before the estimated date! And the sponge is really nice! It&#x27;s really hard when it&#x27;s dry but turns super soft after you put it in water. None of it chips off and drys pretty fast. Leaves my face soo soft and exfoliatied. I got the charcoal one I&#x27;ll make sure I review this sponge again to tell if helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, feels so great on my face. Works well with or without cleanser, and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Dries out nicely. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love how this sponge makes my face feel and look softer. I noticed a difference the very first use.  I do use it with face soap product so I can&#x27;t say what&#x27;s making the difference but in my opinion, its a little of both but more the sponge.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft and takes off the dry skin I get from using ace-prone medicine. It doesn&#x27;t scratch your face or feel abrasive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face. The cleanser goes a long way with one of  these. Have had for  a month and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sponge since April and wanted to use it for a while before I reviewed. At first my face was breaking out a little more than usual but I expected that. Now the breakouts are diminishing and my skin looks much better. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am almost stupefied on how well this works, so basic yet it delivers great results. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, some worked well, others didn&#x27;t do anything at all, and some made my acne worse. Believe me when i say that I&#x27;ve tried every sort of regimen for my acne, but by using the sponge only, no cleaners, three times a day with warm water and massaging my face for a few minutes, then rinsing my face with cold water, and with this my face has never been so clear and soft. The thing i love the most is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or cause any sort of redness. Granted, everyone is different so not everyone is going to react to this like me, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to own.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, so soft once it is wet. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This does nothing for me..</li>
            <li> Works fantastic. Love the results.</li>
            <li> Feels nice when used on the face, and i&#x27;m sure it exfoliates to a degree. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a deep as one might expect though</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the sponge crumbled. Until that point, it was just okay. The texture of the sponge is either rock hard (when it&#x27;s dry) or way too soft to be a very effective exfoliant (when damp). I was a little skeptical when I read the reviews. Most were glowing, five star ratings by people who recieved free product. A few of those are fine, but too many are suspicious to me, especially when they seem to be every review. A washcloth would have worked better than this sponge for me. For very light exfoliating for a short period of time (a week or so), this is fine.</li>
            <li> Nothing Special for the Price!!!</li>
            <li> very gentle to the skin and cleans very well</li>
            <li> Made me break out :-/ but then again, i only wash my face with african soap and moisturize with rose hip oil and i&#x27;m very very gentle with the skin on my face. It may have just been the scrubbing action, idk, but it didnt work for me. I might just end up using it on my feet or something.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this sponge but was searching for something different to clean my face. I postponed writing any commentary for three weeks. I am very pleased with the results. The sponge is very soft, so I did not think it would be effective in cleaning my skin. It works beautifully and the results are even better the more I use it. My skin is softer and more even toned. Hang to dry. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my sponge.  Leaves my face very smooth and fresh.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sponge. I use it in the morning as part of my cleansing routine. My skin feels so fresh and smooth afterward, and I feel like my moisturizer absorbs better. To note, I don&#x27;t use a cleanser with the sponge. I just use a damp sponge.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting use to but lived up to the claims</li>
            <li> I am a nearly 70 y/o female w/ combination skin.  My complexion was always clear until a few years ago when I began having whiteheads.  I started using the konjac sponge @ 3-months ago &amp; am amazed at how much better my skin looks.  My face is much clearer &amp; continues to improve every day.  I first clean my face w/ a medicated facial towelette, rinse w/ warm water, then use the konjac sponge (soak sponge in warm water for a couple of minutes first).  I do not rub my face hard.  Just gently go over it sev times.  When finished using it, I rinse the sponge, press it between my palms to squeeze out the water, &amp; hang it to dry.  So easy!  The only difference in the way I normally care for my face is that I am using the konjac sponge &amp; my complexion looks so much better!  Clear evidence to me that the konjac sponge works!!!</li>
            <li> I like how it feels due to its gentle exfoliation -- not sure if the charcoal has done much, but the exfoliating sponge in itself is nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any different then a wash cloth and face cleanser. I don&#x27;t really get the hype.</li>
            <li> Not sue this is doing anything at all for me.</li>
            <li> The sensation of scrubbing my face with the sponge especially with warm water feels wonderful. It has become part of a twice a day washing routine. I am not sure how often to replace it; probably every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure what this is doing for me skin, but I like using it. It works, but so gently, at cleansing the skin, that I didn&#x27;t realize it was working as well as it was until I rinsed my face, patted it dry and felt how smooth my skin felt. Interesting. I am at the very ealr stages of the purchase, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, leaves face refreshed!</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected it to, but you can find konjac sponges for better prices - even at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Prefer a different brand of charcoal sponge. Although, shipping was on time without issues.</li>
            <li> Was good initially but took on a mildew smell after a couple of uses. I kept it clean and hanging in the bathroom but couldn&#x27;t get rid of that smell so I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge.  I&#x27;ve used it with and without a cleanser and it seems to work as well either way. My face is very clean, smooth and soft. I will definitely purchase another when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Meh. This is likely another beauty trend that will die a quick death. It has absolutely no affect on your complexion. Don&#x27;t bother; use a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Nice cleaner.  Easy to use.  My son is bed bound and this sponge makes cleaning his face very easy.  I also use it on all my skin.  It makes my skin feel smooth, clean and moisturized.  This product lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my ten year old daughter who is just beginning her skin care regime. It&#x27;s gentle and effective and she can use it without a cleanser. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It looks like a hardened Styrofoam at first, but when wet, it is the softest sponge you could ever imagine. Think jello-like. Instead of using the hands, the gentle touch of the sponge takes care of it.  Read More http://goo.gl/e5jFLM</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. face feels so nice and clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to make of this Konjac Sponge from Oleavine when I first took it out of the package. Right out of the box, it&#x27;s a rock-hard, thought lightweight, gray oval. However, when soaked in water it becomes a super soft sponge suitable for delicate facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though so soft, the sponge is a natural exfoliator, massaging your skin to a tingling, relaxing state of clean. It&#x27;s infused with activated charcoal to help detoxify and deeply cleanse. I really enjoyed the luxurious sensation- sort of like giving myself an at-home spa facial! This sponge combined with some of the skin treatments and lotions Ive been trying lately have combined to make my skin quite pretty and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself is quite striking, you can tell thought and care went into every aspect of this product. It can be used all by itself to cleanse both face and body or with your favorite cleanser. The teardrop shape fits nicely and naturally into your palm- the wider end is great for larger areas such as the body, while the pointed end easily glides over the smaller contours of your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sensitive skin loves that the sponge has no chemicals, pollutants or irritants, while my conscience is pleased that it is biodegradable, sustainable and isn&#x27;t tested on animals. The company also offers a 90 day money back guarantee, which is important to me- companies who don&#x27;t stand behind their products don&#x27;t get my support!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and  smooth without soap.  Great product !</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I first got this sponge, I was really surprised on how hard it was, and I didn&#x27;t want it anywhere near my face. After clearly reading the instructions (which oddly enough calls for no cleanser) I was able to fully appreciate this sponge as my exfoliator. Once this sponge gets wet, it becomes super soft and really does exfoliator the skin without irritating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge directions states to use it as a stand along, but I feel my skin will not be properly clean if I did that. Since I still had the option to clean with a cleanser, I opt for that instead since I know for a fact that if I don&#x27;t use a cleanser on my face, I will break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know how long this sponge is suppose to last at first, since it doesn&#x27;t state that information on the box or instruction, so I email the company and asked them. They stated the sponge has to be replaced every 2-3 months or once the sponge has broken down. That I think is not bad for a sponge life cycle, but I have to still state I don&#x27;t see me spending $24.95 (original price) for this sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So based on the cost, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to you if you are on a tight budget. If the current price ever get cheaper (more on the line of $5-$6 bucks) then I could honestly recommend this product ( since you be using a lot of it it :) ).</li>
            <li> First week was fine but then it made me break out really bad. I used as instructed, and I normally don&#x27;t break out. Am returning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is supposed to do. It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, and it&#x27;s not an effective cleansing sponge. I used it a few time, but it hasn&#x27;t cleansed my face that well. I always end up rewashing my face after using this.</li>
            <li> nothing special. not much texture to remove dead skin. not impressed to be honest. this was a waste</li>
            <li> I have been using the Konjac Sponge for a week now and can see a noticeable improvement already.  My face looks and feels so much smoother.  I have tried a lot of products over the years and can honestly say this is by far the best.  I cannot wait to try the rest of there product line!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and exfoliating this sponge is. In my opinion, it does what it claims to do - it cleanses, fights bacteria and absorbs toxins and excess oil from my skin. It also maximizes my skin&#x27;s ability to absorb my moisturizers and serums. I haven&#x27;t had crazy breakouts since I started using this sponge - so it&#x27;s definitely a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package the first thing I saw was was a thank you letter thanking you for buying their product with a guarantee behind their products. I thought that this was a really nice touch that not many companies take the time to do.Then inside was this nice beauty sponge. It felt hard until you put warm water on it, then its like it magically came to life! It says that you can put a non foaming cleanser on it, if you do not want to use it alone, but I decided to just use it alone and put it to the test. I was really surprised! Not only did it take off my makeup with ease, but it exfoliated my face and made it really soft. I took pictures but it was nothing that you could see on camera, but I could feel the difference. I like that its bamboo and charcoal infused, I think this is what makes it so wonderful. I know that right now charcoal face washes are all the rage right now, so infusing a sponge with it, I thought was pretty brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, I got done using the sponge I pressed the sponge in between both hands. It says to do this instead of wringing it out, and I have to say I agree that it helps to do this instead. The reason for this is so you don&#x27;t damage the delicate fibers, and in my opinion it helps it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think its worth the $10.00 price tag, and then some. I feel like I will get a lot of use out of it and I can&#x27;t wait to try it with my Biore charcoal face wash the next go around.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge that Oleavine sent me to review for my blog, GlamRIver!  What a super cool &amp; innovative product!  I love that you don&#x27;t have to use a cleanser with it, but you can if you want to.  It feels great on my skin and like it&#x27;s getting every spec of grime off &amp; leaving it soft, smotth &amp; super clean! Very Cool! :)</li>
            <li> Since my face is fairly sensitive, I don&#x27;t like to use anything rough on my it, so I was fairly apprehensive using this sponge.  It said it was gentle enough for a baby&#x27;s skin, so I decided to give it a try.  So glad that I did.  After 2 weeks of using the sponge, my pores are considerably smaller.  It&#x27;s almost like I have had a micro mini facelift.  The sponge itself is surprisingly very soft.  I feel as if it is giving me a gentle massage.  In the evening, I do wash my face with a facial cleanser to remove makeup or heavy sunscreens while I shower.  Then when I get out of the shower I will use the sponge.  In the morning, all I use is the sponge.  I used to use a fruit acid mask once or twice a week and I no  longer feel that I need to.  Best $10 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> I love my Konjac sponge. Thank you</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic started to irritate my face so I was looking for a new cleansing system. The Konjac Sponge is a low tech solution and my skin looks lovely! I use a non foaming cleanser with it and my face is smoother than smooth! Buy this... It works!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, but it made me break out. My skin is fairly sensitive and I thought since it was all natural that wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Oleavine Konjac sponge. I heard about how good the sponges were for exfoliation, but I was surprised at how soft the sponge is and how great it works to exfoliate my skin! I did not need to use soap and my face felt very clean without any drying. I love the sponge and will recommend it to all my friends and colleagues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There are so many similar products on the market, and this is the first that I have tried - after hearing so many raving reviews. This product is definetly a great addition to your face regime. Helps clean and exfoliate impurities in the skin with the activated charcoal. Anyone that has or suffers from acne or breakouts should really try this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this Konjac Sponge infused with activated charcoal because I have heard lots of really wonderful things about them from many different sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say that you can use this sponge without any chemicals or with facial cleanser of my choice. I decided to try it both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;facial-beauty-sponge-bamboo-charcoal-infused&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it in the shower without any cleansers. I just simply wet the sponge thoroughly and rubbed it all over my face. Wow! The sponge got so soft really fast and felt very smooth on my skin. The best part? My skin felt like I had just used a scrub or microdermabrasion on it, but I used absolutely nothing! I have pretty dry and sort of flaky-ish skin on my nose most of the time. The above mentioned cleansers work to remove it pretty well for a few days, but this Konjac Sponge was the first non-chemical thing I have found to take care of that problem area as well. The sponge dried really quickly so I don’t have to worry about it being slimy or moldy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this with my favorite acne facial cleanser as well. I was worried that the gel would ruin the sponge or that the sponge would absorb the gel to prevent me from getting the acne fighting powers of the gel. That was definitely not something I should worry about! My face got the smooth, clean result I am used to with my acne gel but also super soft and even MORE SMOOTH from using the Konjac Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot imagine not having this sponge in my bathroom. It is a new beauty must-have for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Bought two more as presents.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new beauty products to try, specifically those that help with exfoliation or skin brightening. I came across this sponge when browsing and although I&#x27;d never heard of anything like it, I was curious and thought a $10 product wasn&#x27;t a big investment, so why not. I&#x27;ve been using it almost two weeks and really like it, the sponge definitely gives me that deep cleansing that I&#x27;m always looking for, while still not feeling rough on my skin or drying it out like many exfoliating products do. I&#x27;m a fan and might try some of the other sponges too.</li>
            <li> This sponge is excellent! I bought one in the charcoal and 2 in the red clay. I use one of the red clay ones and the other two were given as Christmas gifts. My mom loves hers as the red clay is for older skin. I love how it makes my skin feel after I have taken my makeup off and I use the sponge as a rinse. I use this sponge everyday and will be a repeat customer. Its really awesome.</li>
            <li> My skin looks wonderful using the sponge. Actually, so much better than the Clarisoinc brush!</li>
            <li> 5-  Good quality as advertised but wish it was a little more abrasive for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This sponge gives my skin the perfect amount of exfoliation. I love that it works well with my normal cleanser. Oleavine sent this product for me for review, and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with the results. I used to use a washcloth, but this is far superior! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, and I love it.</li>
            <li> What an amazing product! My daughter and I fell in love with this and now I have to get another one. I  have never felt anything like this on my face. So natural and the texture is out of this world. I wanted to take it in the shower and use it on my body. My face feels smoother and it has helped my daughter with her oily skin.</li>
            <li> Totally impressed!  I&#x27;m cleaning my face with a sponge that is infused with charcoal and my face has never felt cleaner.  I was a bit hesitant upon first inspecting this thing, cause it was hard as a rock.  I moistened it with water like the instruction said and began washing my face. It removed all of my makeup.  I will say that I do need a little extra cleanser to help with removal but it wouldn&#x27;t be needed if I didn&#x27;t use mineral based foundation/powder.  I was pleasantly surprised how soft my skin was after using this.  Apparently charcoal is the new thing in beauty products because it helps rid the skin of impurities and helps with oil.  Overall this was a great product and I would definitely recommend to my friends. #beautysponge</li>
            <li> Honestly I sent my package to my other address and haven&#x27;t picked it up yet. I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s there and great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the Konjac Sponge initially, but I have since enjoyed using the product on my very sensitive skin these past few weeks. I use a milk-based cleanser, which doesn&#x27;t foam up, but the sponge still enables to cleanser to clean my face without it feeling scrubbed too dry. I noticed that my face cleared up in that I had less obvious and smaller-sized breakouts. I would thus highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This sponge is really cool!!! It is hard as a rock, but when you get it wet it gets like wet packaging peanuts. You don&#x27;t need soap or anything with it, which is nice. This left my skin feeling a little dry, but was just fine after I put on moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  It&#x27;s really fun to play with.</li>
            <li> I visit an esthetician on a monthly basis, and I am prone to periodic hormonal acne.  Recently, my esthetician put a product on my face that was intended to improve acne, yet it caused my skin to break out and I had a total of 12, underneath the surface, pimples to appear on my face in a matter of a few days.  When I purchased the Konjac Sponge I had no idea that it was intended to improve acne.  Well the first night I used it I had a major improvement in my skin by morning.  The pimples had decreased in size and were less inflamed.  I am not sure how this product works in totality, but all I know is that it DOES WORK! I understand the power of activated charcoal and konjac...but still...it seems like there is nothing in the sponge.  Aagin all I know is that I woke up the next morning and my skin was calmer, smoother and definitely improved.  It has continued to improve.  I will definitely purchase it again and again.  I love the teardrop shape...it is odorless...and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Thank you Oleavine. I am soooo happy!  It is worth the price and then some:)!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt who had mentioned that she would like to try this type of sponge some time. Success! She LOVES it! She believes that her skin feels smoother and looks better after only about a week of use. Yay! :)</li>
            <li> BEST new beauty product in my bathroom....will NEVER be without!!! GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like using this sponge. It is very soft and gentle on my face and makes washing my face a delight. I highly recommend this sponge to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to use some of the more harsh facial sponges.</li>
            <li> When I ordered I really did not know what to expect. I am so pleased that I am ordering more for gifts.  No soap needed.</li>
            <li> I recently received Oleavine Beauty Konjac Sponge with charcoal to review.  Although I don&#x27;t have issues with acne, I do have issues with blackheads.  I was excited to try this sponge on my blackhead prone areas.  The string makes it easy to hang and dry out in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was concerned as the sponge appears to be very hard.  I followed the instructions and found that it was actually very soft.  I have enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> I have dry skin; so I used it twice a month.It&#x27;s a great scrub to exfoliate your skin.It helps to remove all kinda dirt,zits,breakouts, oils from your skin.Make sure to use it very gently,although it won&#x27;t hurt your skin.I mostly love to use it before I put a face mask.It&#x27;ll clean up your skin &amp; let the mask do it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is very light-weighted and very easy to use.It has no stinky smell and 100% natural♥ It is very travel friendly. Their packaging is cute and the shape of the sponge is perfect as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to try this out.</li>
            <li> After using this sponge for a few weeks, I really like it.  I mainly like the ease when washing with the sponge, nice texture and soft yet firm. It does exfoliate and rinses easily ... Good choice for problem skin.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I was a little nervous about using the sponge. I remember thinking no way this sponge is going to be soft on my face. I put the sponge under water and it quickly absorbed the water and became soft and sponge like. I really like the shape of the sponge. The tear drop shaped sponge contours with the shape of my face.I like that the sponge has activated charcoal. Charcoal is great for absorbing excess oils in the skin. This was perfect for me as I have been dealing with oily skin. The sponge gently exfoliated my face. I could feel a nice tingle as I scrubbed my face. I have been using my sponge for a little over 2 weeks and it&#x27;s still in good shape. Most of the time I just use the sponge alone and sometimes I use my face wash with it for extra cleansing. Overall, I really enjoy this sponge for cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge is very unique among facial sponges especially for sensitive skin.  Previously I have used many sponges over the years with out success for my very sensitive skin.  THE KONJAC SPONGE is now the ONLY sponge I will use.  It lathers well with any skin wash or soap of your choice and is so soft and smooth on your skin.  I have not broken out from the tearing of other sponges.  You pay for what you get and the others can not compare.  I plan on purchasing 2 more sponges and many more. Thank you for listening to my review and PLEASE try this excellent sponge.  It is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This thing is great! It&#x27;s super gentle, especially in the more sensitive areas (around my nose and eyebrows),  and I can use way less cleanser. It even seems like I&#x27;ve been less oily throughout the day when I use it in the morning. I just ordered another one to keep at my guy&#x27;s house, and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> Good sponge, but softer than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sponge so much. It was completely different than what I expected and like nothing I have ever used. I am ordering more while they&#x27;re on sale.</li>
            <li> really helped exfoliate my skin and left it super smooth</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT !!  As I have &amp;#34; older skin &amp;#34; it really works to sluff off the old and reveal the healthier skin layer underneath. Highly recommended  !!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I had read great reviews about this product. But I really don&#x27;t care for it. When I use it, it just feels like a regular kitchen sponge on my face and when I hang it to dry it never fully dries. I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this</li>
            <li> I just got my Konjac Sponge and started using it so it&#x27;s pretty soon to give a review about results but I think it&#x27;s so different than anything I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.  It&#x27;s a material like no other.  The sponge fills with water, stays filled while cleansing my face and somehow it dries really fast.  It has the sensation of exfoliating without any roughness.  It&#x27;s really hard to describe. But I like it!</li>
            <li> This product is great it helped get rid of my acne, it says you don&#x27;t need to use soap, but it highly recommend some type of soap for the ultimate clean.</li>
            <li> helped my son&#x27;s acne immediately</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin, leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed by this thing. It feels so nice and really works for my less is more lifestyle. Its true, you don&#x27;t even need cleanser besides for taking makeup off.</li>
            <li> Really like the feel of this on my face - it looks like of like pumice, but glides over your skin with no extra cleanser or moisturizer.  Removes make up and gives my skin a nice glow with no drying soap. I have also used it with cleanser a couple of times, but it just does not need it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have used this sponge for about two weeks now.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked and felt so clean and healthy like this in a long time.</li>
            <li> This sponge removes dead skin with out damaging the new skin underneath.  I have also noticed that my face is breaking out less since I started using this.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love beauty products. They are my favorite things to try out. I was super excited to get this in. I opened it as soon as the mail got to my house and had to try it out.  This sponge is used to cleanse and exfoliate. Exfoliate is my favorite part of my beauty regime. I love to exfoliate. This exfoliator is different than any others I have ever experienced. Once I opened it I felt a hard sponge. Reminded me of a brand new kitchen sponge. I was a little skeptical about how this was going to work. After reading the directions, I find out water will moisten and soften the sponge before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of this sponge is perfect for me. It fits perfectly into my hand. The pointed end definitely helped my get into the contours of my face. I have used the sponge with and without a face cleanser. This sponge was extremely soft on my face. Definitely different than other exfoliators that feel like they are ripping your face off. I personally like that. I still love how soft this sponge is on my face. I cannot explain the softness perfectly but it is perfectly soft on my face. I could rub my face with this sponge the entire time I am in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really great feel and good for sensitive skin. I add cleanser to the sponge and then rinse out and fill with water to remove the soap from my face. works really well and is a great size.</li>
            <li> It is black! I like black! Okay so &#x27;charcoal&#x27; may have given that away but I was happy to see that it was a color i enjoy, its the small things in life right? Anyways, this was VERY stiff when you get it out of the package/box and i was wary of it because i did not think it would get soft too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; pleasantly it did. it has fibers in it that make is soft and also pliable. the box tells you to go easy with it so that you do not hurt the fibers and you really do not need to use this roughly, it works with just gentle movements. It has a wierd texture to it in my fingers, sort of a dry slime (does that make sense?) like touching snakeskin. This really did not bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I used it i followed the box and gently squeezed it between my hands and left it to dry, it took a day but it did dry back to its original feel and texture. This helped get off some dead skin but not much, its nice if used with a sugar scrub or microderm though. I really liked how it was not tested on animals and is vegan friendly and all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to sure if this thing is working for me now. Being that it is winter my face is so dry and I&#x27;m not to prone to breakouts so I will give this thing a try once spring and summer kick in. So I&#x27;m undecided....</li>
            <li> I dont know how I feel about this. I think my acne has subsided a bit...idk onlly been using it for about a week now</li>
            <li> awesome product, delivered as expected</li>
            <li> love this sponge for cleaning my face thoroughly.... the point is great for getting around the eyes...glad I got this one instead of the round</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this because of all the terrific reviews but mine broke apart within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and I think it is an excellent product. I mainly use it without any type of facial cleanser, my face is left soft and clean. Well worth the money I spent, considering I spotted the same product in the high end cosmetic store for double the price!</li>
            <li> Customer service seems excellen . They follow up with questions in case u have concerns. As for the product it&#x27;s self, it is so soft. I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said its as soft as a marshmallo . Before its wet, it comes as a form of foam like feeling. Maybe polyeste . You can press it and it will dent, that type of feeling. After getting soaked, it slowly becomes moist then really soft.  Its surface is very slippere . Like soap but with a bit more resistance caused by the holes inside of the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial sponge that I have ever used. It is a little pricey, but I just love the texture and weight of the sponge for washing my face, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> Terrific Natural Sponge, great gift item.  I have used Activated Charcoal and French Pink Clay.  Both are very soft, gentle and leave a wonderful feeling of clean freshness.  Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this! So awesome for washing face and exfoliating. Very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this product at first due to the fact that I have very sensitive when it comes it exfoliation products that it is ridiculous. I have used this lovely little sponge for a couple days and man is it amazing! The leary first time I used it I was amazed at how gentle it was and didn&#x27;t turn my skin the color of a tomato. After words, my skin was not covered in flakes (like it normally is)and felt so soft and healthy. Now after just a couple of days my skin is softer and the clearest it has been in a very long time. I am going to be purchasing this little wonder sponge for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Tried this product after a friend recommended it and had no idea what it was or what to expect, but I am in love!  I can see a dramatice diffference in my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture in just one week!  I&#x27;ve never used anything as easy, non-abrasive, chemical free and AFFORDABLE as this sponge!  Amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and so gentle on the skin.  My skin is very dry and gets irritated easily.  I have no such problem with this Konjac sponge. Like the packaging and the price is good too.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; works great! When I ordered it ,I was not sure what to expect. Make sure you read the instructions. I use mine everyday and am very happy with the results. It is very gentle on your skin. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days so I can&#x27;t say yet if it really helps with acne at all but I will try to remember to update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Feels AMAZING. I want to wash my face all day with this thing. Very soft skin after</li>
            <li> Omg..amazing!  My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product. I&#x27;m not sure if it does as it promises though. For me, a better way to keep my skin clearer/healthier is by changing diet. Nothing will help. However, this product wasn&#x27;t a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and arrived really soon.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge, it is so soft and comfortable washing my face it and leaves my skin feeling so clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> Great product!! Since using the sponge and without any face wash my face has not broken out once and looks and feels clean highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and gentle. But I have pretty resilient acne, so.... Yeah, made a difference maybe for a few days but went back to normal after a while</li>
            <li> I read about this sponge online and decided to try it on my old face.  I don&#x27;t like the exfoliating beads in some products so this seemed to be the next best thing.  Works good.  It makes my skin smoother, and of course breaking out a bit as exfoliating causes the oil in your skin to flow.  It seems to be helping with enlarged pores a bit.  I like the way it feels on my face.  The price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> As a blogger I get to try a lot of products I have never heard of before. A Konjac Sponge is definitely one of those items. A Konjac sponge is a beauty product that exfoliates, moisturizes, and cleanses your face. It is basically a facial rolled into one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try a 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponge infused with Activated Charcoal by Oleavine. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and honestly I am not super impressed. I found that there was no difference in my skin since using it. This may be because I have a pretty detailed skin routine already or because it simply didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about this sponge though is that it had a string attached to it so that it can hang up and dry when it is not in use. I had mine hanging in the shower out of the way so once I was done using it- it would dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also loved how soft this sponge is. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Many times with an exfoliator it is rough and uncomfortable. I also tend to get blotchy and red when I exfoliate and due to the softness of this sponge I did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about Konjac sponges so I do not know if this is particular to this brand or not- but I love that there are no chemicals in this sponge. I think it is so important to keep skin healthy and free of any sort of unnatural substance. I also like how it is biodegradeable! A lot of exfoliators have little beads that don&#x27;t break apart and get deposited into the ocean and rivers. Marine life will then eat the beads and die because they are harmful!</li>
            <li> This is my first activated charcoal sponge and it worked much better than I thought it would.  The price is very reasonable for what you get.</li>
            <li> this sponge is by far superior over any facial sponge i&#x27;ve ever used yet.</li>
            <li> The Oleavine Konjac Sponge is a plant based sponge that gently exfoliates while helping to promote circulation. The Oleavine Konjac Sponge comes infused with bamboo charcoal which is very good for skin with acne as it can help pull extra oils in the skin that would stay trapped when using just bare hands. There are a few things to note about using a Konjac Sponge (1) you need to use a wet sponge when cleansing. To do this just wet the sponge with some warm water allowing it to pull as much as it needs to be fully wet, you can gently press the sponge to get out any excess water but NEVER wring out the sponge. (2)You can use the Konjac Sponge without any cleanser on it.  And (3) after rinsing, gently press between your palms to get out any excess water and hang to air dry. Most Konjac Sponges come with strings attached so that you can hang them on something next to your sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Oleavine Konjac Sponge was a great Konjac Sponge to try out. I’ve used it multiple times since I’ve received it and it’s still good as new. The Oleavine Konjac Sponge will for sure be a repurchase when this one needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge! All of the exfoliating brushes and tools are too abrasive for my skin and make it break out even worse. This is nothing like that at all. When you wet this sponge, it becomes so soft! It&#x27;s a great option for any skin type. At the current $10, it&#x27;s a far better value than any of the other tools I have seen!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.  I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.  My skin is much clearer since I have started using this.  Ordering more for my girls.  They have the same skin problems I do.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be one of the people who received this awesome facial sponge in an exchange of an honest review. I have been interested in trying one for some time now so I was really excited to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little facial sponge is awesome, mainly because it does so many great things for your skin and is also completely natural(no chemicals, no colors added, no preservatives and is also biodegradable). It gently exfoliates, cleanses, is naturally pH balanced, promotes circulation, absorbs toxins and fights bacteria while leaving your face glowing and refreshed. It also comes with a little string attached to it so you can hang it somewhere where there’s an air flow so it can dry off after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I soaked the sponge in warm water and it only took about 10 seconds for it to completely be soft and ready to use. I was actually amazed how a sponge that is so hard can turn into a really soft one. Once it was soft I started massaging my face with it and it felt really good, the sponge is soft and feels great on the skin. It’s also really easy to use and it has so many benefits. You could also add cleanser and use it with it but that comes down to what you prefer, I prefer the sponge by itself because it has a lot of benefits on it’s own. My face felt clean and exfoliated after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I personally think the sponge is great, I’ve always preferred products that are natural and have a lot benefits. Instead of using different cleansers and soaps on your face, the sponge does the job just as good and even better and is so much simpler to use.</li>
            <li> I really love this so much. Read the directions and follow them carefully. Never wring the sponge out.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I was confused because it is hard like a rock or a piece of Styrofoam in its&#x27; plastic over wrap. Adding it to warm water and letting it hydrate converted it from Styrofoam to the most luxurious beauty treatment that your skin has ever been treated to. I used a little of my favorite cleanser and just washed over my face with it. It was magical, the soothing effect that it had on my skin. I just kept wanting to wash my face with it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;I have been really good about hanging it from the small thread hanging hook that is installed on the sponge, and that allows the air to circulate and lets it dry evenly. I use this every morning and evening, and when it is time, I plan on buying another as I really love the way that my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting a gentle treatment for your skin, especially if your skin is recovering from some of the harsher treatments that are out there, this Konjac sponge is an excellent solution. The way my skin responds to is is simply beyond any other product that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I received this sponge free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. The thoughts that are expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> I really love using this facial sponge because you can feel the sponge exfoliating your face. I have natural oily skin and I can visibly see and feel the sponge soaking up all of the bad oil that would cause me to have breakouts.I would highly recommend  buying this facial sponge because it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine beauty facial sponge is made of 100% natural Konjac fibers(a plant that is found throughout Asia). There are no colors, preservatives, or chemicals add to this sponge. Also this product is biodegradable. This Konjac facial sponge gently cleanses, detoxifies,exfoliates, and refreshes your face.This sponge is infused with bamboo charcoal that contains carbons and minerals which will aid in purifying your skin, helping draw out excess oils and acne-causing bacteria, and will supply your skin with much need antioxidants. Also this sponge is naturally pH balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this sponge is very simple. Soak or rinse the sponge in warm water to allow the sponge to soften (the sponge is hard in its dry state). Gently massage your face with the sponge. You can cleanse your face with just the sponge and/or you could use your favorite facial cleanser with it too. After using the sponge,  rinse and squeeze out the water by pressing the sponge between your palms. DO NOT wring the sponge because you run the risk of damaging the fibers. Hang the sponge in a ventilated area to air dry. (I received this product to review, but my opinions are strictly my own.)</li>
            <li> Love the product BUT the marketing is a little misleading... my sponge is slimmer than my slim wallet when dry and swells only slightly when wet.  Having said that, it works great, and performs as promised.  My wife was a little skeptical but one try and she&#x27;s using it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a sponge.  I was a tad leery because of my sensitive skin.  I tend to avoid exfoliating my face but with the Konjac Sponge; I don&#x27;t have to stress about irritation.  It&#x27;s not rough or harsh.  I was surprised at how soft the sponge is against my face.  I love that I can choose to use it with or without a cleanser because I tend to avoid washing my face too much because my skin will dry out.  Yet, with the Konjac sponge I can do a quick rub all over my face and not have to think twice about moisturizing every single time.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve gone without a cleanser for a few weeks and still had no breakouts. I think I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I actually wash my face more with the sponge than I ever did without it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It seems to work if you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to exfoliate a baby&#x27;s ass.</li>
            <li> Ho hum but better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to my skin. Awwww, i love it!</li>
            <li> In my quest for better skin, I’ve tried a lot of different things–from creams and scrubs to masks and serums. I have never, however, tried a sponge that wasn’t harsh and scratchy. (I’ll admit to being a fan of the Buf-Puf back in the day.) Recently, I’ve come to realize that harsh things only make my things worse, and aren’t the answer to getting smooth and radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine Beauty Konjac Facial Sponge is infused with charcoal and made from natural fibers. Though it’s rock hard when removed from the package, it softens quickly when wet. The sponge claims to provide gentle exfoliation and can be used with or without cleanser. It’s PH balanced to absorb toxins, removes excess oils, and fights bacteria. It is also 100% biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal experience, I found that I preferred to use the sponge with cleanser. I’m fighting some excessive oiliness in my t-zone and I felt like without cleanser, even though the sponge got my face clean, it wasn’t as oil-free as I prefer. I think that people with normal-to-dry skin could definitely not use a cleanser and have flawless skin with this sponge. In the winter months, when my skin becomes very dry, I think this will work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was really impressed with this sponge and much prefer it to scratchy, drugstore alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product was provided to me for review. Opinions, however, are my own.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge! My face feels and looks great and my T-zone problems are gone completely! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Leaves my face very smooth feeling. I use it on my body too and my skinn has gotten very smooth, even in winter.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Impressed. Works as well as everyone says. Noticed a difference in my skin in the morning after only one use! I can see that this needs to be sanitized frequently, as it is never completely dry when I go to use it at night after morning use.</li>
            <li> This sponge is fantastic! I was expecting a bit tougher material for exfoliation, but so far all is good (I purchased 2 weeks ago). I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin, however, it does seem to stay cleaner longer when I use this sponge. I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s possible. Either way, it was a good purchase, and I continue to use it every other day. I recommend the buy.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this sponge and the round one as a gift.  Really like how my face feels after using it, soft and really clean.  My only disappointment are the sizes of these sponges.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I cleaned my face with this thing and got two shades lighter. Don&#x27;t tell anyone, shhh! I use it almost everyday now with my facial soap cleaner. I love it. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I bought it. I thought it would be rough but it&#x27;s soft and spongy, but don&#x27;t let that confuse you. It cleans!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my skin type. Too soft to exfoliate and caused me to breakout horribly after one week of use.  Followed the directions for use.  Never completely dries either even if I hang it next to an open window.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> First off I use my husbands amazon Prime so this is a female writing this review.  I stumbled upon an article a beauty expert wrote on this product and how much she loved it.  I researched it, bought it here and I have to say I love it.  My skin is acne prone, I have hormonal acne so my face gets very greasy thru out the day hence the acne.  I stopped using meds because of pregnancy and relied on just this and my skin has never been better.  I wash my face first with the sponge to exfoliate and then use a facial cleanser (since they recommend not to use a foam with the sponge)My Skin is clear, soft and acne free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay nothing special. I wish it was more rough. But it&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> Just feels really great on my face - fits nicely in my hand too - I think it will last awhile</li>
            <li> Leaves  me smooth without  the harsh exfoliation. It was not expected. Actually this was my second time purchasing  the Konjac sponge.  Great item and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I found this .. price is great... Works just like the more expensive one.. Will buy this as gifts...</li>
            <li> This sponge cleans unbelievably well.  I use on my face and can see the difference after just a few weeks in the texture and the elimination of dryness.  I plan to purchase another for showering very soon.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It cleanses the face so well and after you use it, your face just feels so smooth and clean. I&#x27;ve been only using this for 2 days now, but I absolutely love how it&#x27;s making my skin look. I noticed my face is brighter and my pores seem to look smaller too. I had a red pimple but after I used this, it has subsided quite tremendously. It&#x27;s my first time using a product like this and I have to say, I would definitely buy more in the future. You just have to try it out for yourself, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sponge a few weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  My three-star rating signifies neither good or bad.  Just sort of indifferent.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son who has a bad case of acne and an even worse case of laziness. He doesn&#x27;t like spending hours in the bathroom going through several steps of a skin care regimen, but is self conscious about his face at the same time. Many of the other acne products have caused some major dryness and irritation .The sponge has made it easy for him to exfoliate and disinfectant his skin without the side effects of harsh chemicals. He has only been using it for two weeks and I can already see a difference in the quality of his skin (smoother and more shine) and his breakouts are not as bad. Hopefully over time, the skars can heal and his skin will clear up.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this product when I purchased it but I am very pleased. My face feels extra clean after I use it. It was a good impulse buy!</li>
            <li> This is one of my new friends in skin care. I have purchased two now so I can keep one in my suitcase and one at home. I can tell such a difference in my complexion using this morning and night to cleanse my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> It worked well but it is rather small--should have been bigger for the money.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how awesome this sponge is. I use a tiny bit of my cleanser from LUSH with this along with a moisturizer that this company also makes and have been so impressed. The feels so awesome on my skin. I am so in love and want to buy the other ones this company makes. ONE OF THE COOLEST  beauty products to date I have tried. I got this as part of a review and was so excited. It comes hard in the package nice and sealed and then when you add water to it it becomes so soft and literally is like magic for my skin. Honestly one of my favorite new beauty tools. Everyone is getting this for Christmas this year LoL.</li>
            <li> Amazingly clean and smooth skin! Sponge really works ! I use sponge with my own cleanser at night and just the sponge in the morning. My skin is extremely sensitive and this works EXCELLENT!💥</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and although I have used harsh exfoliating produces, They left me with red skin afterwards. I use this sponge morning and night with my usual sensitive Neutrogena makeup remover and cleanser. The sponge removes dried flaky skin everyday safely. I no longer use the harsher exfoliating products. My only concern is am I cleaning the sponge properly? I bought 2. One for the shower and one for the bath. So far I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used the sponge for a little over a week and my pores appear smaller and the texture of my skin is very smooth. I hope to see more improvement in the following weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it! Soo soft on the face and amazed how fast it came! I ordered it on a sunday night, and it arived the very next day!</li>
            <li> As the other commenters have said, it&#x27;s just a sponge. Nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;Get some activated charcoal pills, open and add to any sponge you have.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed with this one. All Hype.</li>
            <li> My Review:&lt;br /&gt;  This is currently one of my favorite products! I didn&#x27;t have much of a background on these types of sponges but boy was I pleasantly surprised! This sponge actually does detoxify, cleanse and purify your skin! I have combination skin and I had a bit of acne (small spots), redness, uneven skin tone/acne scars and oiliness(especially in my T-zone) and this sponge actually made my face look amazing after one use! I woke up the next morning thinking wow! When you try the product for yourself you see that the sponge is super soft, almost like porous cotton balls and not bristle-like at all (unlike general defoliators). I thought that this product wouldn&#x27;t do much but surprisingly it did a lot more than I thought! I will be definitely picking up a couple for myself and friends/family. This would make a great stocking stuffer and is very trendy. There are many other brands out there for which I cannot say \\&quot;work\\&quot; or \\&quot;don&#x27;t work\\&quot; but I absolutely love this product and even though \\&quot;Oleavine\\&quot; the company isn&#x27;t as well known as \\&quot;Boscia\\&quot; or some other high end skincare company, it does a great job! The product is also very affordable and great for the Eco-friendly people in our lives! I highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item complimentary in return for my 100% honest review, all words are mine*</li>
            <li> Really good sponge for the face. I love how it exfoliates without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> Not what I need. My face needs slightly rougher surface. This is a little on the soft side. Like a soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I love the konjac sponge. First its a dry sponge or like a fungus. Soak with warm water and rup on your face. Its so soft so its give my face the look I want. Doesn&#x27;t rude my skin. I don&#x27;t know how to explain to you guys but all I know everyone should test it out. I just love how my skin feels and when you finish cleaning. Rinse it and hang to somewhere to keep it dry and reuse.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very gentle, not painful at all and also exfoliates pretty well. My skin looks slightly fresher after each use.</li>
            <li> Eh.  I don&#x27;t understand all the rave reviews.  After using it for a bit I am back to edit my initial review.  I purchased a couple of these due to the hype and while it does what it says it does, I don&#x27;t think its \\&quot;all that and a bag of chips too\\&quot;.  With soap on the sponge it does clean my skin but not as well as a washcloth or my Clarisonic.  The cleanser/soap never seems to rinse out of it either.   Will I order another?  No. Heck no. I can buy a lot of washcloths for the same price and use a clean one each time I wash my face.  Since I bought more than one sponge I will likely return the ones I did not use.  Does not live up to the hype in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The product basically disintegrated in the shower after a few uses. For the price, I would expect to use it for a much longer time period before throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product! I&#x27;m obsessed! You don&#x27;t even need to use a cleanser with it! My skin feels so hydrated and soft! Everyone needs to try this! thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this little thing</li>
            <li> Amaaaaaaaaaaazing! Love the way it feels on my face.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is just ok..holds too much water.</li>
            <li> Just seems like a regular sponge to me. But, very soft. Don&#x27;t see any charcoal benefits to it or even water/soap changing to greyish color to indicate there is any charcoal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference overall, but my skin did feel smoother.</li>
            <li> This sponge is absolutely amazing! I have been using urban my face for about a week and I seen results the next day.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the sponge for a short time but I can already feel the difference. The sponge is non-abrasive and dries quickly to be ready for the next use. My skin feels cleaner and softer already! So far I am loving the Konjac Sponge!</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try out this Konjac Facial Sponge! I&#x27;ve never tried one before so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. But it is a interesting tool to use and add to your daily face washing routine. It made my face feel as fresh as it would had i used chemical face wash!</li>
            <li> &#x27;Soft enough for a baby&#x27;s skin ... &#x27; should have been my cue to (Exit Stage Left). Packaging was excellent and included informative literature. The sponge appears well made. As to the, &#x27;boost effectiveness of facial cleaners ...&#x27; I am unable to post a fair assessment at this point. As a devotee to weekly AHA peels (pumpkin, glycolic, lactic) and regular microdermabrasion treatments, effective and gentle exfoliation is a process I am familiar with. The Konjac Sponge, as an exfoliating tool, is several notches below an average washcloth. Although I have used the Konjac three times, the first several seconds during initial use, were sufficient to determine it was just too darn soft (almost slimy) to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this sponge. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I use it with a gentle cleanser. I&#x27;ve noticed that my completion has improved since incorporating this sponge into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> When I applied for this promotion I wasn&#x27;t really sure how a sponge like this worked. You use it by its self, no cleanser needed that activated charcoal in the sponge does the cleansing for you. The sponge is ok, as with any new facial product it made me break out within a few days. I love how soft it makes my skin feel and how it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. My only complaint is even if you don&#x27;t squeeze it, it never dries back into it&#x27;s original shape. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase this sponge for myself again, although I do like how it makes my skin feel I don&#x27;t really see the practicality in it or the need. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This sponge is exponential. It makes my skin feel super smooth, super clean, and keeps me from breaking out. This is a must have. Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been living so long without this product. I will be buying another when this one wears out. You don&#x27;t even have to use cleanser! Just use water and plop it on your face. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is. I have Rosacea and it works nicely on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few Konjac sponges.  All Charcoal sponges can be a bit harsh on my skin that is eczema prone, but this one seemed to work nicely and well.  In places that I have flare ups for my eczema, I need to go over really softly or not use the sponge on those areas - not because of the sponge, but because any sponge can cause a flare up.  But, overall I do love this product.</li>
            <li> Soft yet still exfoliates.</li>
            <li> Very soft, not rough enough for me but definitely good quality</li>
            <li> Love love love.  It is so much better and more effective than any other facial brush I own. Very gentle but effective. I also bought one for my teenage son, which has all but eliminated his acne. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It feels nice on my face but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, easy to use and luxuriously soft, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin when using this as opposed to water and a washcloth.  Did clean makeup off very efficiently though.</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about - I actually don&#x27;t even use it anymore. I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using it consistently for about a week. Now, it&#x27;s off and on when in the mood. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all of the awesome reviews I saw and because I noticed my face getting dry in some areas so I needed something that will exfoliate. This sponge was not at all what I expected it to be. I believe it is way to expensive for it being what it is. I could exfoliate my skin better with one of those yellow and green sponges you can by at Walmart. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I dislike giving bad reviews because I&#x27;m sure there are people working very hard on this little sponges and because it&#x27;s interesting to look at. Besides that I am very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> This product has a perfect shape and feel. I have used it for a few months now and it has made my skin noticeable smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty big sponge so it&#x27;s perfect for washing your body as well as your face.</li>
            <li> The sponge came apart after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to use a konjac sponge but I will not buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Has a really strong chemical smell that overpowers me when I try to use it.  Used it for a month with water only thinking it would clear away.  Finally started using a cleanser with it and it still smells terrible.  Too soft to exfoliate well; I don&#x27;t even bother with it as the smell is just too strong.</li>
            <li> Firstly I am 44 years old and I do still struggle with having some acne.  However after using this product, my acne worsened significantly.  I used it for several weeks thinking that perhaps since I had not used something like this before that &amp;#34;maybe it would be worse before it got better&amp;#34;.  Unfortunately, the better part never came so I quit using it.  Definitely not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I received my sponge about a week ago and I LOVE IT!!!  It makes my face feel so smooth!!!  I also started using it on my neck and elbows and I love the softness.  I would love a bigger sponge to use on my whole body but I&#x27;m not sure they make them bigger???  Buy this sponge....you will love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used for 3 days, but my breakouts have subsided and my skin looks more dewey.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge!  I have very sensitive, acne prone skin, and this sponge is gentle and feels amazing. My face feels so smooth afterward and I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or breakouts. I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective exfoliating sponge for ages and this is the one!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Oleavine all natural Konjac Sponge for a few weeks and not using any soap at all on my face and I really love it.  My skin is super soft and I believe my skin is looking evener in color.  Highly recommend, thanks!</li>
            <li> Have ordered this item from this vendor two times. Lasts much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have been given a sponge prior to this Konjac sponge and I absolutely loved it so when I had the chance to review this sponge, I had to have it. I use it every day while I shower or take a bath and sometimes even if I just need a pick me up during the day. The sponge starts out hard and then once you get it wet it becomes a true &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;. This is very large and makes it great for removing any extra dirts or make-up. Afterwards, it leaves your skin silky smooth and exfoliated. I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to another sponge or washcloth ever again after trying this out. I highly recommend this to anyone who takes care of there face or wants a new beauty product for their routine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Bamboo Charcoal Infused Konjac Sponge from Oleavine. When I first saw the product, I was intrigued. When I opened it, it was a little dark gray oval that was hard and looked like a pumice. My initial thought was “no way that is going near my sensitive skin.” BE SURE TO READ THE DIRECTIONS FOR OPTIMAL RESULTS!!! I read the directions, added water and was amazed at how quickly the sponge absorbed the water and I had myself a super-soft sponge. The sponge is a great shape. The wider end is great for large surface areas like my cheeks, with the pointed ends being perfect for hard to reach spots around my eyes!!! I usually use it with a cleanser (just my preference) but I have used alone on days where I was makeup free and I was seriously amazed at how clean my face felt afterwards. And, without the dryness that a lot of facial cleansers can cause. I have found something that will definitely be in my beauty routine forever.&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I received it as a gift in exchange for my honest review. The opinions above are my own and I would not recommend this if I did not truly believe in the product.</li>
            <li> Great item. I love using it</li>
            <li> I like this sponge because I use it every other day ( on the days I don&#x27;t exfoliate with my battery facial brush). Its a nice and soft little sponge. I don&#x27;t know if it helps unclog pores or not, but I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free for my unbiased opinion from tomoson.com. this sponge works great. it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect facial sponge, super soft but still exfoliates fairly well.</li>
            <li> This facial sponge feels nice against my face and skin, works well with other beauty products!</li>
            <li> Was expecting this to be more than the average kitchen sink sponge.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a nice texture, shape, and size. It&#x27;s easy to use in the shower, and I feel like I can easily clean myself without worrying about keeping fresh washcloths around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showering every day and letting the sponge air dry, I find that it lasts about six weeks before it becomes too soft and starts deteriorating. I worry that chunks of the sponge that fall off will end up clogging my drain or plumbing, so maybe I replace the sponge a little earlier than I might otherwise do. But in six weeks, I take only 42 showers, which means each use of the sponge costs $0.59. There are probably much cheaper products out there and I&#x27;ll keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the sponge delivers on any of the grand claims that it makes. The absurd claims the product makes baffle me, and actually put me off purchasing it for quite some time. After making my purchase, the manufacturer got my address from Amazon and contacted me three or four times; there&#x27;s also a ride-along card from Oleavine in the b ox begging for feedback and reviews. Really, it&#x27;s a bit much. No other products I buy have vendors who contact me so frequently to so aggressively solicit feedback or reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that the box says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure what that means; I can&#x27;t find a &amp;#34;hobbyist&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;enthusiast&amp;#34; version of this sponge. I was eager to do so, since I figured it would reduce the cost per use under sixty cents and that would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listing calls the product a &amp;#34;miracle sponge&amp;#34;, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles occurring around the house (or even in the shower) since I started using it. The manufacturer says &amp;#34;no other beauty sponge will work so hard for you!&amp;#34; The sponge hasn&#x27;t done a darn thing; it just sits there. I can&#x27;t find any instructions, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s just a passive bath sponge as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the benefits of the product surround its manufacture, stating that it is &amp;#34;bamboo charcoal infused&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s really no way to learn what &amp;#34;infused&amp;#34; means; there may not be any amount of bamboo charcoal in the product at all. Or, there may be some amount, but the consumer is really unable to tell what that amount is and how effective it might be, and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim is that this &amp;#34;Activated charcoal&amp;#34; will &amp;#34;absorb toxins, fight bacteria and excess oils&amp;#34;. This is also a very vague notion, since we can&#x27;t quantitatively measure any of the effects. Of particular interest to me is how the &amp;#34;Bamboo Charcoal&amp;#34; selectively absorbs only toxins and not other materials. Is my body wash toxic, and therefore rendered less effective by this chemically active sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says the product &amp;#34;detoxifies&amp;#34;, but I can&#x27;t begin to guess what that specifically means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box further claims that the product is &amp;#34;sustainably developed&amp;#34;, but we&#x27;ve no way to verify this, either. Other unverifiable claims on the box include &amp;#34;vegan approved&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;not tested on animals&amp;#34;. The latter leaves me puzzled; is the sponge just sent to customers with no testing? Aren&#x27;t human beings animals?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of it, the box says the product is &amp;#34;vegan approved&amp;#34;. What does that specifically mean? That they found a vegan at the bus stop near the factory, and he said he like the sponge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most puzzling claim is that there are &amp;#34;no chemicals&amp;#34;. What is this sponge made of, if not chemicals? And the most absurd claim is that there are &amp;#34;no colors added&amp;#34;. The manufacturer sells a &amp;#34;pure white&amp;#34; sponge, a &amp;#34;green clay&amp;#34; sponge, a &amp;#34;red clay&amp;#34; sponge, and this grey &amp;#34;activated charcoal&amp;#34; sponge. They&#x27;re all different colors, so these active magic ingredients must be what makes the different colors when compared to the &amp;#34;pure white&amp;#34; sponge. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using the sponge; I just wish it was cheaper and I&#x27;m bothered by the incredible claims the manufacturer makes. As far as I can tell, they&#x27;re either too vague to prove or just plain false.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought this though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s essential.  I have started using this and changed my daily moisturizer  recently and my skin has been looking awesome (though I don&#x27;t know what exactly to attribute that to). The description says that you can use it without added soap but be forewarned that will not take off any make up. It does provide a nice light exfoliation. Mostly, I have been using it without cleanser when I rinse my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy.  Everyone says to buy that clear sonic thing and I did but my face was left red and dry.  I have acne and rosacea.  My biggest issue is just build up in general.  I saw this and I was willing to give it a try. I put my face was in it and give my face a quick one over with this thing and my skin is much happier.  It&#x27;s not harsh. My face is not red after using this (which is amazing b/c my skin will turn red with little provocation).  I have less blackheads and buildup when I use this.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am scrubbing my face raw and I don&#x27;t feel like I am sitting there with a stupid brush for 2 minutes.  My skin feels clean and looks clean.  I will stick to this little sponge.  It does a good job. I am was even able to go to a gentle cleanser where I was always using an acne cleaner before.  Now I use one that is very gentle and I still don&#x27;t have massive breakouts.  So happy!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this product even with the good reviews. I am very happy that I purchased the Konica sponge. I suffer from hormonal acne and after 2 uses I have noticed my complexion is much smoother and looks healthier. Also, my dark spots from my acne is starting to lighten up due to exfoliation gently removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> This is just a soft sponge.  I don&#x27;t see how it can clean your face. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I thought it would have a rougher texture and exfoliate more. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything. It really just seems like a gray, teardrop shaped sponge.</li>
            <li> Excellent for your face!  Leaves it feeling very clean and smooth.  Seems to make my face cream work more effectively.  I will definitely buy this product again and will actually recommend it to all the other teachers I work with.  A must have!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the sponge</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge for a couple of days, and this sponge leaves my face really soft and clean. It&#x27;s a little bit bigger than the other sponge that I was using.  I hope it last for a couple of months.  We shall see.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by marketing like I was. It&#x27;s a plastic sponge, nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it works well. I stopped using face-wash and my skin has been fine (and much less dry)... This thing will pay for itself in the long run assuming it holds up.</li>
