    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have always thought of banana boat as making some of the best sun screens</li>
            <li>This may be the best sunblock lotion that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>You can benefit from this excellent product as well.  </li>
            <li>Not the best if sweating a lot and not the lightest lotion, but a very good lotion for just hanging around.</li>
            <li>Good price!</li>
            <li>I use Banana Boat spray to get coverage all over, but the liquid is great for applying to areas of maximum sun exposure (chest and shoulders).  </li>
            <li>nice smell!</li>
            <li>+ Pleasant smell&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I needed a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, and I had no sun burn, so it worked well</li>
            <li>this is a good lotion from a good brand.</li>
            <li>This is just plan good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good coverage, stays on even in water.  </li>
            <li>Smells good like a man, not greasy, water resistant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really good stuff here-</li>
            <li>SPF 30 is best for light exposure to the sun and if you are in the sun and sweating, I would go with a heavier SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which I love, not just for my husband but for myself as well!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great choice.</li>
            <li>In my opinion you need something closer to SPF 50 for these kind of activities.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I really liked this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, cologne-type smell to it.</li>
            <li>For this reason alone, I know that my own husband will not use it (he prefers spray-on sunscreens).  </li>
            <li>This sunblock smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It offered good protection from sunburn when applied liberally and about every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining “odor-protection” with a sunscreen is an interesting move.</li>
            <li>, it went on easily, it smelled good, and it would keep me protected for hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went on smoothly and provided good coverage.</li>
            <li>The trick for “odor-protection” is to make sure the product’s scent blends (so to speak) with your own.</li>
            <li>Nice scent for men and did a fine job.</li>
            <li>(It doesn&#x27;t smell like after shave), but it is more subdued and closer to unscented.  </li>
            <li>The fact that I now spend most of my time walking around a college campus in West Texas makes it imperative that I wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>To be sure, this is a SUNSCREEN product, not a cooking oil.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>As for the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent, I actually many scents that I like to use, whether they&#x27;re &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; or not you&#x27;ll have to sniff me and let me know.</li>
            <li>This is Banana Boat product is marketed to men but both my daughter found this to be appealing in fragrance and decided we&#x27;d use it too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Found that it lasted longer then most brands.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does all the things you expect a top of the line sunscreen to do.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need any more burnt skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I won’t be buying more.</li>
            <li>I liked this sun-screen and would not hesitate to recommend it as adequate</li>
            <li>It goes on easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not greasy at</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to hold and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a full sun test.  </li>
            <li>While it’s true that sweating during sports may expel some of the lotion, I am still quite satisfied for two reasons:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean masculine scent without being overpowering, and its suncreen protection does great.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it smells fine but is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>lotion is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>A mild musky men’s scent that you don’t mistake for a women’s scent or the neutral scent most lotions have.  </li>
            <li>a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>Nor do ee enjoy smelling like a lemon jasmine butter sauce that has turned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess what makes it for men is the relatively light</li>
            <li>You can use it while engaging in outdoor sports and not smell like the beach.  </li>
            <li>I like that this has a broad spectrum VUA UVB protectant at a really good price.</li>
            <li>Just smells clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although most sunscreens are similar, this one had some features that he particularly liked.</li>
            <li>As a sunscreen lotion, Banana Boat for Men Triple Defense has a nice consistency, disappears quickly, has decent water resistance, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I just got back from the beach, and my shoulders got fairly burnt.</li>
            <li>Some people sweat it out more readily than others.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and subtle; it conjures up memories of the good old summertime without overwhelming the wearer with that familiar coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I was interested in trying this product because you always need more sunscreen for summer, right?  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin that burns and freckles easily, and I was rolling from a long New England winter straight into Hawaii with absolutely no base tan.</li>
            <li>It feels good (not thick or heavy) and smells good.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a fresh, clean scent and isn&#x27;t fruity smelling at all</li>
            <li>applied it soaked in quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>After the first day of wearing this product the question changed from &amp;#34;Why are you wearing sunscreen?&amp;#34; to the comment, &amp;#34;You smell nice today!&amp;#34; As for sun protection it holds its own against the other SPF 30 sunscreen in Banana Boat&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li>It also doesn’t have much of a smell, which is kind of nice because unless I’m at the beach or a similar locale, I really don’t want to smell like the tropics because of my sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The lotion is not watery, glides on easily, and with several quick rubs you won’t see any more lotion on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the fragrance is more masculine</li>
            <li>It did protect me from getting a sunburn which is its most important feature and at the current price for it on Amazon at $6.30 for six ounces</li>
            <li>There are enough other great sunscreens, including many by Banana Boat, that do the trick without the smell.</li>
            <li>product feels fine on the skin (not too greasy), seems to hold up decent in the water (doesn&#x27;t wash off too quickly), and smels good enough (doesn&#x27;t most sun block pretty much smell the same, anyway?).</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it four stars was that I live in the Midwest and don’t burn so easily anyway</li>
            <li>After several hot days at the neighborhood pool, I&#x27;m sporting a nice tan.</li>
            <li>It just had that same old pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread and smells nice, not the smell you usually associate with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I was okay with using the regular Banana Boat sunscreen with brighter-colored packaging and the stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>Banana Boat has consistent quality, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li>I wore it all afternoon in the hot sun and didn&#x27;t have any sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they have not failed me.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Banana Boat!</li>
            <li>It smells more manly than regular suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>We are interested in spackle for home repair, not on our faces.</li>
            <li>First, I prefer not to apply an SPF higher than 30 for the 4 matches I play a week.  </li>
            <li>Higher SPFs tend to leave a whitey residue, and I’d rather not look like Casper the Ghost when I’m playing league matches.  </li>
            <li>After applying the lotion to his face, neck, arms, and ears, he was able to stay in the sun for several hours each day without burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan (and user) of Banana Boat products for years, and this new product is as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I really thought this sunscreen worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>And thanks to the Banana Boat for Men sunscreen, I was able to spend long hours in the sun without getting burnt.</li>
            <li>Overall just a really solid good sunblock, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I rate this problem very high with no negatives.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day it really is just about the smell but to the every day sunscreen wearer that can make a world of a difference.</li>
            <li>Banana Boat Triple Defense SPF 30 has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>There is nothing overly &#x27;manly&#x27; about this scent and therefore I feel quite comfortable using it myself, especially since I&#x27;m not fond of fruity smelling</li>
            <li>No, it did not burn my eyes when I sweat and &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to be better than others when wet.</li>
            <li>so you don’t smell too much like coconut or that you&#x27;ve put on sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I could really use this product for my high-testosterone, rugged shoulders.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is proper: light, no grease.</li>
            <li>Experience has shown me this really isn’t the case.</li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion is very subdued.  </li>
            <li>What most people do not understand is that sunscreen only protects you from the damaging rays of the sun but more long term damage is done by the general exposure to the elements and having skin lotion with the sunscreen</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell any different or more masculine.</li>
            <li>This implies that the sunscreen is good for at least 80 minutes.</li>
            <li>The deoderant is unnecessary but if you feel that this is the best way to get your SPF and have deoderant, I personally would use the SPF 50 version.  </li>
            <li>Though most people realize this by now and not many companies make &amp;#34;sun tan oils&amp;#34; anymore, it&#x27;s never a bad idea to remind people that what they need to help prevent skin cancer is a sun screen/sun block like this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>SPF 30 a great number for somewhat pale white guys like me.  </li>
            <li>No excessive grease&lt;br /&gt;+ Absorbed well and quickly with no white residue</li>
            <li>This is a decent sun screen that to me doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling cool and hydrated, even after hours of time in the sun and playing with my kids.</li>
            <li>highly recommend Banana Boat to everyone.</li>
            <li>If you want scented sunblock this is definitely a manly man smell which is ok as other scented sunblocks tend to be pretty florally cocoa buttery nutty which may not be what manly man dudes want.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle of this sun-screen from the Vine program right before I went to Hawaii last month.</li>
            <li>my new go-to SPF for outdoor sports.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say overall this is a pretty normal SPF 30 sunscreen, great for every day use and bouts of being outside in direct sunlight, but not strong enough for all day beach time or swim time.</li>
            <li>Rather, I would say that this product is lightly scented, with a scent that is somewhat reminiscent of a basic, beachy sunscreen but also a bit musky--definitely not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it&#x27;s still late spring and there haven&#x27;t been all that many hot days here in upstate New York, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to sample this product only.  </li>
            <li>For men who may want something more masculine however, this product offers it with black, &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; packaging and a fragrance that is more subtle.  </li>
            <li>But a woman could easily use this as well, as the smell is not strong and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I, personally, wouldn’t choose this scent over an antiperspirant, and I certainly wouldn’t combine this one with anything else.</li>
            <li>Second, if you apply the lotion at least 30 minutes prior to playing, it’ll absorb better and not expel as much during intense play.  </li>
            <li>, I like that this sunscreen is a cream and not a spray as I&#x27;m always hesitant quite how much sunscreen you are actually getting with the sprays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of sunscreen ingredients, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as it having a manly scent, I wouldn&#x27;t say that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As is always the case with sunscreen, reapply frequently.</li>
            <li>Which I haven’t noticed, but I don’t have body odor issues, very often, so I assume, there is some type of body deodorant mixed in.  </li>
            <li>like I had been on desert reconnaissance for a week and as far as a manly scent, I have no idea</li>
            <li>but what scent there is seems masculine and not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li>The thing about it that I didn&#x27;t like so much is that when I apply it to my face it actually stings/</li>
            <li>would not recommend this sunscreen to anyone with sensitive skin, sensitivity to smell, or if you don’t want to wear the pine-woods smell all day.</li>
            <li>This lotion is on the thin side so it spreads nicely and coats</li>
            <li>Like most pale people, my life has been a constant battle against the sun.</li>
            <li>I have used various Banana Boat products over the years and have found them all to be of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that there is any special or different about this sun-screen from other sun-screens.</li>
            <li>Re-applying every few hours was important, but then again my white skin was going to get crispy in about 2 seconds without protection</li>
            <li>There is just a little scent (which is good because I have serious allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lastly, the odor protection can only go so far during match play.  </li>
            <li>I have followed the directions and when I used the sunscreen as part of a semi-lengthy workout (about 90 minutes) that involved some heavy sweating, I discovered that this sunscreen does not remain in place when one is working out and sweating profusely under the hot Midwestern, Illinois sun.</li>

            <li> I have very fair skin that burns and freckles easily, and I was rolling from a long New England winter straight into Hawaii with absolutely no base tan.</li>
            <li> It feels good (not thick or heavy) and smells good.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a fresh, clean scent and isn&#x27;t fruity smelling at all</li>
            <li> applied it soaked in quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> After the first day of wearing this product the question changed from &amp;#34;Why are you wearing sunscreen?&amp;#34; to the comment, &amp;#34;You smell nice today!&amp;#34; As for sun protection it holds its own against the other SPF 30 sunscreen in Banana Boat&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> It also doesn’t have much of a smell, which is kind of nice because unless I’m at the beach or a similar locale, I really don’t want to smell like the tropics because of my sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not watery, glides on easily, and with several quick rubs you won’t see any more lotion on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the fragrance is more masculine</li>
            <li> It did protect me from getting a sunburn which is its most important feature and at the current price for it on Amazon at $6.30 for six ounces</li>
            <li> There are enough other great sunscreens, including many by Banana Boat, that do the trick without the smell.</li>
            <li> product feels fine on the skin (not too greasy), seems to hold up decent in the water (doesn&#x27;t wash off too quickly), and smels good enough (doesn&#x27;t most sun block pretty much smell the same, anyway?).</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it four stars was that I live in the Midwest and don’t burn so easily anyway</li>
            <li> After several hot days at the neighborhood pool, I&#x27;m sporting a nice tan.</li>
            <li> It just had that same old pleasant coconut smell.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread and smells nice, not the smell you usually associate with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was okay with using the regular Banana Boat sunscreen with brighter-colored packaging and the stronger scent.  </li>
            <li> Banana Boat has consistent quality, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li> I wore it all afternoon in the hot sun and didn&#x27;t have any sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they have not failed me.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Banana Boat!</li>
            <li> It smells more manly than regular suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> We are interested in spackle for home repair, not on our faces.</li>
            <li> First, I prefer not to apply an SPF higher than 30 for the 4 matches I play a week.  </li>
            <li> Higher SPFs tend to leave a whitey residue, and I’d rather not look like Casper the Ghost when I’m playing league matches.  </li>
            <li> After applying the lotion to his face, neck, arms, and ears, he was able to stay in the sun for several hours each day without burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan (and user) of Banana Boat products for years, and this new product is as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I really thought this sunscreen worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> And thanks to the Banana Boat for Men sunscreen, I was able to spend long hours in the sun without getting burnt.</li>
            <li> Overall just a really solid good sunblock, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I rate this problem very high with no negatives.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day it really is just about the smell but to the every day sunscreen wearer that can make a world of a difference.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat Triple Defense SPF 30 has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing overly &#x27;manly&#x27; about this scent and therefore I feel quite comfortable using it myself, especially since I&#x27;m not fond of fruity smelling</li>
            <li> No, it did not burn my eyes when I sweat and &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to be better than others when wet.</li>
            <li> so you don’t smell too much like coconut or that you&#x27;ve put on sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I could really use this product for my high-testosterone, rugged shoulders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is proper: light, no grease.</li>
            <li> Experience has shown me this really isn’t the case.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is very subdued.  </li>
            <li> What most people do not understand is that sunscreen only protects you from the damaging rays of the sun but more long term damage is done by the general exposure to the elements and having skin lotion with the sunscreen</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell any different or more masculine.</li>
            <li> This implies that the sunscreen is good for at least 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> The deoderant is unnecessary but if you feel that this is the best way to get your SPF and have deoderant, I personally would use the SPF 50 version.  </li>
            <li> Though most people realize this by now and not many companies make &amp;#34;sun tan oils&amp;#34; anymore, it&#x27;s never a bad idea to remind people that what they need to help prevent skin cancer is a sun screen/sun block like this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> SPF 30 a great number for somewhat pale white guys like me.  </li>
            <li> No excessive grease&lt;br /&gt;+ Absorbed well and quickly with no white residue</li>
            <li> This is a decent sun screen that to me doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling cool and hydrated, even after hours of time in the sun and playing with my kids.</li>
            <li> highly recommend Banana Boat to everyone.</li>
            <li> If you want scented sunblock this is definitely a manly man smell which is ok as other scented sunblocks tend to be pretty florally cocoa buttery nutty which may not be what manly man dudes want.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this sun-screen from the Vine program right before I went to Hawaii last month.</li>
            <li> my new go-to SPF for outdoor sports.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say overall this is a pretty normal SPF 30 sunscreen, great for every day use and bouts of being outside in direct sunlight, but not strong enough for all day beach time or swim time.</li>
            <li> Rather, I would say that this product is lightly scented, with a scent that is somewhat reminiscent of a basic, beachy sunscreen but also a bit musky--definitely not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s still late spring and there haven&#x27;t been all that many hot days here in upstate New York, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to sample this product only.  </li>
            <li> For men who may want something more masculine however, this product offers it with black, &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; packaging and a fragrance that is more subtle.  </li>
            <li> But a woman could easily use this as well, as the smell is not strong and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I, personally, wouldn’t choose this scent over an antiperspirant, and I certainly wouldn’t combine this one with anything else.</li>
            <li> Second, if you apply the lotion at least 30 minutes prior to playing, it’ll absorb better and not expel as much during intense play.  </li>
            <li> , I like that this sunscreen is a cream and not a spray as I&#x27;m always hesitant quite how much sunscreen you are actually getting with the sprays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of sunscreen ingredients, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as it having a manly scent, I wouldn&#x27;t say that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As is always the case with sunscreen, reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> Which I haven’t noticed, but I don’t have body odor issues, very often, so I assume, there is some type of body deodorant mixed in.  </li>
            <li> like I had been on desert reconnaissance for a week and as far as a manly scent, I have no idea</li>
            <li> but what scent there is seems masculine and not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li> The thing about it that I didn&#x27;t like so much is that when I apply it to my face it actually stings/</li>
            <li> would not recommend this sunscreen to anyone with sensitive skin, sensitivity to smell, or if you don’t want to wear the pine-woods smell all day.</li>
            <li> This lotion is on the thin side so it spreads nicely and coats</li>
            <li> Like most pale people, my life has been a constant battle against the sun.</li>
            <li> I have used various Banana Boat products over the years and have found them all to be of high quality.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that there is any special or different about this sun-screen from other sun-screens.</li>
            <li> Re-applying every few hours was important, but then again my white skin was going to get crispy in about 2 seconds without protection</li>
            <li> There is just a little scent (which is good because I have serious allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, the odor protection can only go so far during match play.  </li>
            <li> I have followed the directions and when I used the sunscreen as part of a semi-lengthy workout (about 90 minutes) that involved some heavy sweating, I discovered that this sunscreen does not remain in place when one is working out and sweating profusely under the hot Midwestern, Illinois sun.</li>
            <li> The majority of it does stay in place, but some of it runs off with the sweat of your body, particular on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while THE BANANA BOAT FOR ME TRIPLE DEFENSE SPF 30 does work as a sunscreen, I wouldn’t recommend it if you plan on doing heavy activity outdoors in the sun where you will be profusely sweating because it will leak off through some of the sweat on your body.</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and spreads easily, but to me, it DID feel a little greasy, at least at first.  </li>
            <li> I sweat at the mere thought of exertion outside in the sun and if body odor has been a significant problem in the past I wasn’t aware of it</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen for my husband, knowing that he would be playing golf outside for three long days.</li>
            <li> Regarding the scent, I certainly would not call it \\&quot;manly\\&quot; as described on the product page, nor would I agree with other reviewers who have said that it does NOT smell like typical sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I sopped down one side with this stuff and the other with Coppertone Sport which it turns out has exactly the same active ingredients (in variable proportions) and while I may have been hoping for some Frank Gorshin in StarTrek outcome</li>
            <li> Better for your health than that crazy spray-on SPF that seems to damage your lungs</li>
            <li> So I got to try it right away in tough conditions.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time for me even when sweating in this humidity and heat!</li>
            <li> Plus, they tend to smell horrible in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li> I wore it all day (for a few days) at a music festival and the sweat and daily rigors did not wear it off.  </li>
            <li> so that might be a reason I always seem to get a wide berth at poolside…</li>
            <li> The scent is a little &amp;#34;Manly&amp;#34; and the female members of the household are not interested in it.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, I have no idea why this is a &amp;#34;men&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We also had other sun-screens with us that worked just as well as this stuff.</li>
            <li> But so does other sun screen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and have not had any breakouts, like other susncreens give me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays on even when you perspire; does not sting your eyes like other lotions</li>
            <li> On the same day I rode a few miles with it, and a few miles without it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor quibble, but a small annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a baby or like the perfume monster at the outlet mall hosed you down.</li>
            <li> The mixture is a little runnier than other sunscreens I have used, so it takes some time to massage it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, but I read other reviews to suggest that the scent to this product was not strong, so I didn&#x27;t let the \\&quot;for Men\\</li>
            <li> So my conclusion is that the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; label is gimmicky, but the sunscreen works.</li>
            <li> This has an awful aquatic with a cheap coconut hit to it that I can absolutely not live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why you&#x27;d need &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; lotion specifically, but</li>
            <li> I’m not sure how it would do against the sun if I were in Florida or Arizona, but I do use Banana Boat products when I do go out there</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You can consider the spray type for faster and easier even application on difficult areas like your back.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the feminine, delicate, lower-wage-earning sunscreen my wife gave me.</li>
            <li> In at least one review, there was one concern about the use of this product during tennis.  </li>
            <li> I believe this one-two punch has helped hydrate my skin, work up a tan slowly, and avoid skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the coconut smelling sunscreens, very nostalgic smell from my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a guy, or as a purchase for a guy, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d go wrong buying it.  </li>
            <li> As a man, it appears all products in this category are designed to have the consistency of spackle and smell like baby lotion, or to have twisted names scents that evoke unfortunate references to yeast goods or smell like a sauce for a fish</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is unpleasant for any man on any level.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t terribly manly, not in your face like Axe products, but there is a hint of cologne smell to the sunscreen IMO.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price! nice smell!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and smells manly. But even my girlfriend likes the smell...and she used it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this sun-screen from the Vine program right before I went to Hawaii last month. So I got to try it right away in tough conditions. I would say it worked and worked well. I have very fair skin that burns and freckles easily, and I was rolling from a long New England winter straight into Hawaii with absolutely no base tan. So I needed a good product. This product seemed to work well, it went on easily, it smelled good, and it would keep me protected for hours. But not for all day, especially if I was swimming. Re-applying every few hours was important, but then again my white skin was going to get crispy in about 2 seconds without protection so any sun-screen had it&#x27;s work cut out for it. I liked this sun-screen and would not hesitate to recommend it as adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have no idea why this is a &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; product. Didn&#x27;t quite understand that at all. It didn&#x27;t smell any different or more masculine. It just had that same old pleasant coconut smell. We also had other sun-screens with us that worked just as well as this stuff. So my conclusion is that the &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; label is gimmicky, but the sunscreen works. But so does other sun screen. So just use whatever is cost-effective and works for you. I can&#x27;t say that there is any special or different about this sun-screen from other sun-screens.</li>
            <li> I was okay with using the regular Banana Boat sunscreen with brighter-colored packaging and the stronger scent.  For men who may want something more masculine however, this product offers it with black, &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; packaging and a fragrance that is more subtle.  I can&#x27;t say the fragrance is more masculine (It doesn&#x27;t smell like after shave), but it is more subdued and closer to unscented.  As a guy, or as a purchase for a guy, I can&#x27;t see how you&#x27;d go wrong buying it.  Banana Boat has consistent quality, and this product is no exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, and I had no sun burn, so it worked well</li>
            <li> Like most pale people, my life has been a constant battle against the sun. The fact that I now spend most of my time walking around a college campus in West Texas makes it imperative that I wear sunscreen. After the first day of wearing this product the question changed from &amp;#34;Why are you wearing sunscreen?&amp;#34; to the comment, &amp;#34;You smell nice today!&amp;#34; As for sun protection it holds its own against the other SPF 30 sunscreen in Banana Boat&#x27;s line. At the end of the day it really is just about the smell but to the every day sunscreen wearer that can make a world of a difference.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat Triple Defense SPF 30 has worked very well for me. I use Banana Boat spray to get coverage all over, but the liquid is great for applying to areas of maximum sun exposure (chest and shoulders).  I believe this one-two punch has helped hydrate my skin, work up a tan slowly, and avoid skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Banana Boat to everyone.</li>
            <li> This lotion is on the thin side so it spreads nicely and coats well.  I wore it all day (for a few days) at a music festival and the sweat and daily rigors did not wear it off.  The scent is a little &amp;#34;Manly&amp;#34; and the female members of the household are not interested in it.  Not sure why you&#x27;d need &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; lotion specifically, but this is a good lotion from a good brand.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a fresh, clean scent and isn&#x27;t fruity smelling at all which I love, not just for my husband but for myself as well! There is nothing overly &#x27;manly&#x27; about this scent and therefore I feel quite comfortable using it myself, especially since I&#x27;m not fond of fruity smelling creams.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say overall this is a pretty normal SPF 30 sunscreen, great for every day use and bouts of being outside in direct sunlight, but not strong enough for all day beach time or swim time. In my opinion you need something closer to SPF 50 for these kind of activities.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I like that this sunscreen is a cream and not a spray as I&#x27;m always hesitant quite how much sunscreen you are actually getting with the sprays. Plus, they tend to smell horrible in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am not a pool, swimmer guy at my age.  I am just an outdoors, working guy.  So I have this project this spring/summer (heck I&#x27;m in Texas so it&#x27;s already summer) to replace my backyard fence.  Lots of fence.  Lots.  I have been using this and I do wear a hat (kinda bald).  I have not burns this spring.  No peeling.  Today I was out for 8 hours in the sun.  Everything is fine.  I think it works.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan (and user) of Banana Boat products for years, and this new product is as good as I expected it to be. To be sure, this is a SUNSCREEN product, not a cooking oil. Remember that unless the bottle has the SPF number printed on it, you aren&#x27;t getting any protection from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. Though most people realize this by now and not many companies make &amp;#34;sun tan oils&amp;#34; anymore, it&#x27;s never a bad idea to remind people that what they need to help prevent skin cancer is a sun screen/sun block like this.&lt;br /&gt;This product feels fine on the skin (not too greasy), seems to hold up decent in the water (doesn&#x27;t wash off too quickly), and smels good enough (doesn&#x27;t most sun block pretty much smell the same, anyway?). I plan on using this product through the summer, this year, and will very likely pick up another bottle of the stuff for next summer. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I like that this has a broad spectrum VUA UVB protectant at a really good price. I like that it&#x27;s enriched with Aloe and Vitamin B to moisturize. I&#x27;m iffy about the &amp;#34;odor neutralizing agent&amp;#34; because if I think I have an odor, I take a shower to neutralize it. As for the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent, I actually many scents that I like to use, whether they&#x27;re &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; or not you&#x27;ll have to sniff me and let me know. This has an awful aquatic with a cheap coconut hit to it that I can absolutely not live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tossed it.</li>
            <li> After several hot days at the neighborhood pool, I&#x27;m sporting a nice tan. And thanks to the Banana Boat for Men sunscreen, I was able to spend long hours in the sun without getting burnt. It left my skin feeling cool and hydrated, even after hours of time in the sun and playing with my kids. It is easy to spread and smells nice, not the smell you usually associate with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is Banana Boat product is marketed to men but both my daughter found this to be appealing in fragrance and decided we&#x27;d use it too.  Nothing about the smell made it seem to &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; for a woman.  Just smells clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found that it lasted longer then most brands.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells fine but is not overbearing. No, it did not burn my eyes when I sweat and &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to be better than others when wet. Yes, it provides protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate this problem very high with no negatives.</li>
            <li> This banana boat product does double duty-- both sunscreen and as a scent. It&#x27;s got a clean masculine scent without being overpowering, and its suncreen protection does great. Easy to apply, great choice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this sunscreen. I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of sunscreen ingredients, but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went on smoothly and provided good coverage. It has a nice, cologne-type smell to it. But a woman could easily use this as well, as the smell is not strong and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applied it soaked in quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. I wore it all afternoon in the hot sun and didn&#x27;t have any sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face and have not had any breakouts, like other susncreens give me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use Banana Boat products all the time and like them a lot.  As far as it having a manly scent, I wouldn&#x27;t say that.  It just seems like low-odor so you don’t smell too much like coconut or that you&#x27;ve put on sunscreen.  The lotion is not watery, glides on easily, and with several quick rubs you won’t see any more lotion on the skin.  Also it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and you won’t even notice it’s there.  The reason I gave it four stars was that I live in the Midwest and don’t burn so easily anyway so I wasn&#x27;t able to give it a full sun test.  I’m not sure how it would do against the sun if I were in Florida or Arizona, but I do use Banana Boat products when I do go out there and they have not failed me.</li>
            <li> I just got back from the beach, and my shoulders got fairly burnt. I attribute this to the feminine, delicate, lower-wage-earning sunscreen my wife gave me. I could really use this product for my high-testosterone, rugged shoulders. Finally, a sunscreen I can wear while hanging drywall, catcalling at construction sites, and spitting. No longer will I have to worry about whether my sunscreen is too emotional for the heat, or if it can protect me from harmful UV rays while making me a sammich. Thanks, Banana Boat! (Heh. Banana Boat. I get it.)</li>
            <li> I really thought this sunscreen worked pretty well. I applied it before going hiking on a relatively sunny day. I did not get a sunburn at all. While the sunscreen totally has male-like scents to it, once applied the scent disappears. Anyone can use this sunscreen regardless of gender.</li>
            <li> Do your research on sunscreens and check out the Environmental Working Group information. I have no affiliation but I always check sunscreen chemicals and associated safety on their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this sunscreen in a pinch, it&#x27;s in my emergency supply. The scent isn&#x27;t terribly manly, not in your face like Axe products, but there is a hint of cologne smell to the sunscreen IMO. I personally prefer the coconut smelling sunscreens, very nostalgic smell from my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is always the case with sunscreen, reapply frequently. I read lots of reviews of people burning. Some people sweat it out more readily than others. I have not burned the times that I&#x27;ve had to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is just plan good sunscreen.  I have always thought of banana boat as making some of the best sun screens and they continue that tradition here.  SPF 30 a great number for somewhat pale white guys like me.  This sunscreen does all the things you expect a top of the line sunscreen to do.  Doesn&#x27;t come off in water, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, and blocks those uv rays.  What makes it for “For Men” is that it has a “manly scent”.  A mild musky men’s scent that you don’t mistake for a women’s scent or the neutral scent most lotions have.  And there is an odor neutralizing ingredient.  Which I haven’t noticed, but I don’t have body odor issues, very often, so I assume, there is some type of body deodorant mixed in.  But you can run around in this stuff at the beach and it won’t sweat off.  But of course if you are spending 8 hours outdoors or at the beach you may want a second coat at some time.  Overall just a really solid good sunblock, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a mahogany complexion and any sunscreen I have ever used has served only as basting.  Banana Boat hasn’t proved to be any different.  I sweat at the mere thought of exertion outside in the sun and if body odor has been a significant problem in the past I wasn’t aware of it but I’m not saying I was ever all that perceptive so that might be a reason I always seem to get a wide berth at poolside…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I sopped down one side with this stuff and the other with Coppertone Sport which it turns out has exactly the same active ingredients (in variable proportions) and while I may have been hoping for some Frank Gorshin in StarTrek outcome what I noticed was no discernible differences in absorption, hydration ,durability after swimming or greasiness on application. In both instances, beach sand stuck to my legs like I had been on desert reconnaissance for a week and as far as a manly scent, I have no idea what that is supposed to represent. I’d buy and use whichever lotion was cheaper.</li>
            <li> + Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;+ No excessive grease&lt;br /&gt;+ Absorbed well and quickly with no white residue&lt;br /&gt;+ No stain on swimwear&lt;br /&gt;+ Value for money&lt;br /&gt;You can consider the spray type for faster and easier even application on difficult areas like your back.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this product because you always need more sunscreen for summer, right?  I&#x27;m a woman, but I read other reviews to suggest that the scent to this product was not strong, so I didn&#x27;t let the \\&quot;for Men\\&quot; label put me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s still late spring and there haven&#x27;t been all that many hot days here in upstate New York, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to sample this product only.  Regarding the scent, I certainly would not call it \\&quot;manly\\&quot; as described on the product page, nor would I agree with other reviewers who have said that it does NOT smell like typical sunscreen.  Rather, I would say that this product is lightly scented, with a scent that is somewhat reminiscent of a basic, beachy sunscreen but also a bit musky--definitely not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen dispenses as a lotion.  It is not too thick and spreads easily, but to me, it DID feel a little greasy, at least at first.  For this reason alone, I know that my own husband will not use it (he prefers spray-on sunscreens).  However, I don&#x27;t mind continuing to use this, and I will.  I will also update my review when I have the opportunity to use this product in the sun, mostly likely on a biking trip.</li>
            <li> I used this before going to the beach. It smells more manly than regular suntan lotion. It is not overpowering and not greasy. It goes on easy. I did have to re-apply after running and sweating around my eyes while wearing sun glasses. I did not notice any burning in my eyes although I didn&#x27;t rub it where my glasses were covering. Some lotions burn anyway. This is a good product. Not the best if sweating a lot and not the lightest lotion, but a very good lotion for just hanging around.</li>
            <li> As a man, it appears all products in this category are designed to have the consistency of spackle and smell like baby lotion, or to have twisted names scents that evoke unfortunate references to yeast goods or smell like a sauce for a fish boil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unpleasant for any man on any level. We are interested in spackle for home repair, not on our faces. We do not wish to be greased up so we can wind up covered in sand. Nor do ee enjoy smelling like a lemon jasmine butter sauce that has turned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is proper: light, no grease. Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a baby or like the perfume monster at the outlet mall hosed you down. If you stop somewhere for a beer, nobody&#x27;s going to notice you: you smell like a guy.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, stays on even in water.  I wear this on my skin for summer sun.  It&#x27;s sunny in Georgia and I don&#x27;t need any more burnt skin. Smells good like a man, not greasy, water resistant.  It lasts a long time for me even when sweating in this humidity and heat!</li>
            <li> This is a decent sun screen that to me doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent but what scent there is seems masculine and not feminine at all.  The sunscreen comes as a lotion that might be just a bit greasy to the touch.  It did protect me from getting a sunburn which is its most important feature and at the current price for it on Amazon at $6.30 for six ounces this is a well priced product.</li>
            <li> THE BANANA BOAT FOR ME TRIPLE DEFENSE SPF 30 is a sunscreen that does work. It blocks out UV rays the way a SPF 30 sunscreen is supposed to. It also doesn’t have much of a smell, which is kind of nice because unless I’m at the beach or a similar locale, I really don’t want to smell like the tropics because of my sunscreen. The mixture is a little runnier than other sunscreens I have used, so it takes some time to massage it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although THE BANANA BOAT FOR ME TRIPLE DEFENSE SPF 30 doesn’t specifically say it is waterproof, it does state that it should be reapplied after 80 minutes of swimming or sweating. This implies that the sunscreen is good for at least 80 minutes. Experience has shown me this really isn’t the case. I have used the sunscreen three times. I have followed the directions and when I used the sunscreen as part of a semi-lengthy workout (about 90 minutes) that involved some heavy sweating, I discovered that this sunscreen does not remain in place when one is working out and sweating profusely under the hot Midwestern, Illinois sun. The majority of it does stay in place, but some of it runs off with the sweat of your body, particular on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while THE BANANA BOAT FOR ME TRIPLE DEFENSE SPF 30 does work as a sunscreen, I wouldn’t recommend it if you plan on doing heavy activity outdoors in the sun where you will be profusely sweating because it will leak off through some of the sweat on your body.</li>
            <li> This sunblock smells nice.  The scent is noticeable for quite sometime.  My wife also likes the scent.  If you want scented sunblock this is definitely a manly man smell which is ok as other scented sunblocks tend to be pretty florally cocoa buttery nutty which may not be what manly man dudes want.  The thing about it that I didn&#x27;t like so much is that when I apply it to my face it actually stings/burns especially close to my eyes.  Perhaps, I am not manly man enough to this stuff...</li>
            <li> This may be the best sunblock lotion that I have ever used.  It is billed as &amp;#34;for men.&amp;#34;  I guess what makes it for men is the relatively light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this so good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The smell of this lotion is very subdued.  You can use it while engaging in outdoor sports and not smell like the beach.  You can actually go into stores and people&#x27;s homes and not smell like a over-lotioned beach bum&lt;br /&gt;2.  Easy to apply, not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;3.  It works! On the same day I rode a few miles with it, and a few miles without it.  What a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Better for your health than that crazy spray-on SPF that seems to damage your lungs&lt;br /&gt;5.  Stays on even when you perspire; does not sting your eyes like other lotions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle shape.  The opening is on the bottom, so when you have it open, it will not stand up.  It&#x27;s a minor quibble, but a small annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff here- my new go-to SPF for outdoor sports.</li>
            <li> Ladies, pay no heed to the “For Men” label on this suntan lotion.  You can benefit from this excellent product as well.  In at least one review, there was one concern about the use of this product during tennis.  While it’s true that sweating during sports may expel some of the lotion, I am still quite satisfied for two reasons:  First, I prefer not to apply an SPF higher than 30 for the 4 matches I play a week.  Higher SPFs tend to leave a whitey residue, and I’d rather not look like Casper the Ghost when I’m playing league matches.  Second, if you apply the lotion at least 30 minutes prior to playing, it’ll absorb better and not expel as much during intense play.  Lastly, the odor protection can only go so far during match play.  This feature is more for walking around the beach or swimming pool, so it’s irrelevant for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used various Banana Boat products over the years and have found them all to be of high quality.  This one is no different.  The bottle is easy to hold and easy to apply.  There is just a little scent (which is good because I have serious allergies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep makiing the same product with various marketing twists.  This one is it is for men who sweat. Besides the SPF30 sun protection, this one has a deoderant and also a moisturizer.  The deoderant is unnecessary but if you feel that this is the best way to get your SPF and have deoderant, I personally would use the SPF 50 version.  SPF 30 is best for light exposure to the sun and if you are in the sun and sweating, I would go with a heavier SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would instead recommend, the Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion Spf 30, 6 Ounce.  This one has the body lotion and the sunscreen.  What most people do not understand is that sunscreen only protects you from the damaging rays of the sun but more long term damage is done by the general exposure to the elements and having skin lotion with the sunscreen will battle the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a sunscreen, I would recommend the</li>
            <li> I ordered this sunscreen for my husband, knowing that he would be playing golf outside for three long days. Although most sunscreens are similar, this one had some features that he particularly liked. For starters, it worked. After applying the lotion to his face, neck, arms, and ears, he was able to stay in the sun for several hours each day without burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is smooth and easy to apply. It feels good (not thick or heavy) and smells good. The scent is pleasant and subtle; it conjures up memories of the good old summertime without overwhelming the wearer with that familiar coconut smell. In fact, it smells somewhat manly!</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen lotion, Banana Boat for Men Triple Defense has a nice consistency, disappears quickly, has decent water resistance, and is not greasy. It offered good protection from sunburn when applied liberally and about every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining “odor-protection” with a sunscreen is an interesting move. The scent reminds me of woods or pine-scented products, and while not overpowering, you won’t forget you’re wearing it. The scent did not wash off my hands after applying, though, so next time I’ll cajole someone else into rubbing it in. The trick for “odor-protection” is to make sure the product’s scent blends (so to speak) with your own. I, personally, wouldn’t choose this scent over an antiperspirant, and I certainly wouldn’t combine this one with anything else. Deodorant plus sunscreen plus cologne anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this sunscreen to anyone with sensitive skin, sensitivity to smell, or if you don’t want to wear the pine-woods smell all day. There are enough other great sunscreens, including many by Banana Boat, that do the trick without the smell. I won’t be buying more.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who is blonde and tends to burn easier.  Nice scent for men and did a fine job.</li>
