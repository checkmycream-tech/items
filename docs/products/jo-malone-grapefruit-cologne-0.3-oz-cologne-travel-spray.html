            <li> &lt;br /&gt;B. are a detective and are hoping the suspect you&#x27;re interrogating will abruptly confess because he can&#x27;t take the stench anymore..</li>

            <li> Was a gift, my friend love it</li>
            <li> My very favorite fragrance in the Jo Malone series of fragrances....smells fresh and and last a long time</li>
            <li> Jo Malone Grapefruit Cologne is such a light, nice fragrance ~ esp. for summer!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is awful.  It does not smell like grapefruit at all  I was very disappointed.  I have sampled in department stores and this was not even close.  It seemed very pedestrian.</li>
            <li> Went by Oprah&#x27;s review of this a few years ago. WAY too strong and allergy-producing. Have tried to reach vendor&lt;br /&gt;(3) times to return and still haven&#x27;t heard back. Will NOT order from them again.  This is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;I did order thru Amazon but this is NOT their fault.</li>
            <li> It smells like a woman that died in the 1930&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Subtitle notes of grapefruit. I love grapefruit and was hoping for something a little more grapefruit. I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying other Jo Malone fragrances.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this item, it was given to me as a gift. I typically do not like fruity scents and I wouldn&#x27;t have ever bothered trying this had it not been a gift. I was so surprized by this scent! It&#x27;s not overly fruity or flowery; it&#x27;s a good clean fragrance and lasts through the day. I&#x27;m absolutely hooked.</li>
            <li> Perfect wake up but not too acerbic.  Jo Malone spot on as usual.  Convenient, and not too pricey.  Love a spritz in my purse.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just the right amount. Arrived ahead of time.</li>
            <li> I love Jo Malone fragrances! They are a bit pricey, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> It was not the same scent - it was really strong and a bit off</li>
            <li> LOve Jo Malone. this is my new go to line and so many flavors.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li> Old ladies or old ladies soap. Ew. Stinkeriffic. I am so disappointed, I thought it was going to smell like GRAPEFRUIT. Pass on this one unless you want to smell like and old lady (I love old ladies, I just don&#x27;t want to smell like one.)</li>
            <li> Nice unisex fragrance</li>
            <li> my daughter-in-law loved it!</li>
            <li> CAUTION: Wear this cologne if you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. want to smell like an elevator in retirement home in Boca Raton&lt;br /&gt;B. are a detective and are hoping the suspect you&#x27;re interrogating will abruptly confess because he can&#x27;t take the stench anymore..&lt;br /&gt;C. you are a recluse and want to move to Tanzania and live in the wild with an orangutan like Jane Goodall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loathe heavy scents and was curious to try Jo Malone&#x27;s Grapefruit cologne because I&#x27;d heard it was really light and clean and fresh. I was absolutely astounded when I received this cologne. Just one spritz on my wrist was so overpowering and truly vile smelling I had to scrub it with dishwashing soap to get it off and it still wouldn&#x27;t come off. Then my boyfriend came home and asked me what the Godawful smell on my arm was. It smells like an upholstered couch in a Vegas cocktail bar and it doesn&#x27;t have any citrus notes at all. If someone asked me to create a name for this scent I&#x27;d call it &#x27;Funky Donkey On The Mountain&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I love the Jo Malone Grapefruit Cologne.  Everytime I wear it, I get compliments. I will be ordering this item again.</li>
            <li> It smells like men&#x27;s cologne - and a cheap cologne at that.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell at all made me sick to my stomach. I have a sensitive sense of smell not for me. I should not have bought a perfume without prior knowledge of scent.</li>
            <li> I smelled this on a friend and then got some free samples at Nordstroms. I love the freshness of this. This is my fav go- to perfume, by far. And everytime Iwear it, my husband says &#x27;you smell so good! Oh, it&#x27;s Jo Malone!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> not what I thought it to be very cheap smelling not the real stuff</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh-but-not-sweet scent!!  Will order more asap!</li>
