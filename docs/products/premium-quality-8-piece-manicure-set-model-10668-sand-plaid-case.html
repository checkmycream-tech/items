            <li>I was pleased to give this gift and the recipient was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>They were very pleased with everything but the case which is very nice to look at but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not as good).</li>
            <li>keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>It was delivered in good shape, on time, packaged well, but I am somewhat displeased with the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>The case looks good but unfortatly the quality of the instruments is awlful.</li>
            <li>I had to go and buy good brand instruments separately and put them in the case.</li>
            <li>All recipients loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good experience.</li>
            <li>but, hey looks great to me :)</li>
            <li>and I must say that I was very impressed when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love this kit, use it all the time!  </li>
            <li>A good product that has a good price and that was packaged securely and that was promptly shipped at a fair price</li>
            <li>The tools are of great quality and the case keeps the tools together and makes packing and traveling with them easy.</li>
            <li>The clippers don&#x27;t cut through toenails easily and the scissors are 1/4 as good as a pair I already had.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all very durable, very good utensils</li>
            <li>The set contains more utensils than I know what to do with.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very good set for the price.</li>
            <li>Does its job just fine though, and have had no issues with the case.</li>
            <li>All the utensils you need in a perfect little kit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out if you&#x27;re looking for a stylish set that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>I suggest it for any boyfriend looking for a gift that is cheap and thoughtful.</li>
            <li>i had a nail kit already , but this one is smaller and fits in my purse great with my wallet .</li>
            <li>Too light weight.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not getting anything special here</li>
            <li>Makes super clean nail cuts.</li>
            <li>This is a nice professional mens grooming and travel kit.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set (after much research and reading reviews) on Amazon after my podiatrist wanted to ALWAYS bring my own set of tools to a nail salon because she said they don&#x27;t really sterilize the tools there.  </li>
            <li>use!!&lt;br /&gt;This is really made cheap and made to break.</li>
            <li>The tool selection is just about right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good stocking stuffer, especially if you package it with a few nice nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any trouble with the case or its closure, but then again I haven&#x27;t traveled with the set much.</li>
            <li>Might be good for a womens use, but not heavy enough for a man.</li>
            <li>The design is very modern as well.  </li>
            <li>It fell short in quality and appearance it was purchased as a gift very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is really cheaply made and 2 of the tools broke after 1</li>
            <li>and the shipping was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The instruments are nice and sharp when you first purchase it</li>
            <li>Nice case, sharp utensils, not for children...or Kentuckians.</li>
            <li>It is stainless steel and better engineered - not top of the line but likable by the wife and now she is the owner of this set.</li>
            <li>and I have to really squeeze the case to get it to work.</li>
            <li>and thats why you&#x27;re not paying much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made really well</li>
            <li>Nice firm sturdy metal with polished</li>
            <li>High quality set that is priced very well.</li>
            <li>Decent case and tools.</li>
            <li>Everything was sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new manicure set for my husband.  </li>
            <li>You have to put every piece back in the case exactly</li>
            <li>I feel for what I paid for this, it would be top-notch, but it feels a little dangerous when using.  </li>
            <li>has a major flaw in the design for the closure.</li>
            <li>Sharp is a positive for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty low quality and seems like the type of thing that wouldn&#x27;t be consistent across examples so others may have no problems and others may have worse problems.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if a plain case was offered, but obviously that&#x27;s secondary to the products inside.</li>

            <li> Considering the price I would not say that the price doesn&#x27;t justify the value because they do work well in the beginning (and they&#x27;re still usable after they get dull</li>

            <li> This is the perfect travelling manicure kit. Size is perfect for being on the road and the inlcuded tools cover most of your needs. Only time will tell how well the tools hold up.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new manicure set for my husband.  This one is very nice.  The case is attractive, not too girly, and the tools are excellent.  The design is very modern as well.  Overall, very good set for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for Christmas gifts to guys that use this type item on a regular basis. They were very pleased with everything but the case which is very nice to look at but has a major flaw in the design for the closure. I would have sent back but was too close to the holiday and they said to keep in spite of the flaw. The instruments are wonderful and well made. You have to put every piece back in the case exactly or it will not close.</li>
            <li> Nice case, sharp utensils, not for children...or Kentuckians. Just sayin&#x27;.... REALLY SHARP. How long can a finger stay on ice?</li>
            <li> All the utensils you need in a perfect little kit. They&#x27;re all very durable, very good utensils and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I researched some 30 single and manicure sets before settling on this one. It is stainless steel and better engineered - not top of the line but likable by the wife and now she is the owner of this set. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> High quality set that is priced very well. It would be nice if a plain case was offered, but obviously that&#x27;s secondary to the products inside. I&#x27;m using this for traveling, but it would be great for home use too.</li>
            <li> The nicest manicure set I&#x27;ve ever owned. Makes super clean nail cuts. The set contains more utensils than I know what to do with. Very nice. Ending up purchasing 3 of these!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice professional mens grooming and travel kit. Decent case and tools. Nice firm sturdy metal with polished finish.&lt;br /&gt;I wished the nail cleaner was a liitle sharper though to dig out any dirt/grime..</li>
            <li> The outside design makes it appear as a bit of a knock-off because it&#x27;s evokes the image of a premium brand but the instruments inside are great looking. I&#x27;ve had this set for awhile and I must say that I was very impressed when I first purchased it. Everything was sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of drawbacks however. The closure isn&#x27;t great and I have to really squeeze the case to get it to work. It&#x27;s pretty low quality and seems like the type of thing that wouldn&#x27;t be consistent across examples so others may have no problems and others may have worse problems. Also, one of the instruments isn&#x27;t held into place well and will slide out when the case is open. A little frustrating but not that big of a deal. The biggest issue I ran into however was longevity. The instruments are nice and sharp when you first purchase it but it doesn&#x27;t take that long for everything to dull out. The only real option is to replace the kit and thankfully it isn&#x27;t that expensive. Considering the price I would not say that the price doesn&#x27;t justify the value because they do work well in the beginning (and they&#x27;re still usable after they get dull it&#x27;s just not as good). Definitely worth trying out if you&#x27;re looking for a stylish set that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> It fell short in quality and appearance it was purchased as a gift very cheap looking. Look some where else.</li>
            <li> I ordered a similar product a while ago and I lost one, so I ordered this thinking this is the one&lt;br /&gt;I ordered before. WRONG! Wow, this is really cheaply made and 2 of the tools broke after 1 use!!&lt;br /&gt;This is really made cheap and made to break.</li>
            <li> Love this kit, use it all the time!  It also has that &#x27;burberry&#x27; look, which I don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re showing your mani pedi kit too but, hey looks great to me :)</li>
            <li> The product description says \\&quot;Premium\\&quot; and that&#x27;s what this is. Each tool seems as if it&#x27;s hewed from a solid block of steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any trouble with the case or its closure, but then again I haven&#x27;t traveled with the set much. The release button IS a bit vulnerable and it could let go if it&#x27;s not packed carefully. Solution: pack carefully, or at least with an eye on that button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, it&#x27;s sharp, which garnered a negative review. Sharp is a positive for me. So is quality, and my set reeks of it. The tool selection is just about right and the shipping was exactly as promised. Well done!</li>
            <li> A good product that has a good price and that was packaged securely and that was promptly shipped at a fair price</li>
            <li> Nailed it.  It&#x27;s a good stocking stuffer, especially if you package it with a few nice nail polishes.  I suggest it for any boyfriend looking for a gift that is cheap and thoughtful.</li>
            <li> I feel for what I paid for this, it would be top-notch, but it feels a little dangerous when using.  the scissors are not up to par.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to remove some of the items from designated spots.  Very sharp!  I quality is not what I expected, mechanically speaking.</li>
            <li> Awesome manicure set. Arrive in a timely manner. Works great. Quality product. would order again from this site. keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in good shape, on time, packaged well, but I am somewhat displeased with the quality of the product.  The tools  have a tin like feeling.</li>
            <li> Very Nice quality for the price. I was pleased to give this gift and the recipient was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not getting anything special here and thats why you&#x27;re not paying much. Does its job just fine though, and have had no issues with the case.</li>

            <li> i had a nail kit already , but this one is smaller and fits in my purse great with my wallet . it&#x27;s made really well and the case has not come apart.</li>
            <li> Too light weight. Handle broke on cutter! Might be good for a womens use, but not heavy enough for a man.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  All recipients loved it.  I should have ordered more.  Received it quickly without any problem.  Good experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this set (after much research and reading reviews) on Amazon after my podiatrist wanted to ALWAYS bring my own set of tools to a nail salon because she said they don&#x27;t really sterilize the tools there.

I think it&#x27;s too late to return the set, so I&#x27;m out the money.  Very poor quality tools.</li>
            <li> This 8-piece manicure set is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It meets all my needs.  I am completely&lt;br /&gt;satisfied with it.  A must buy!!!</li>
