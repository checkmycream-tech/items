            <li>I used to look for a shampoo that made my hair straight and while this doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair, which is good because I&#x27;ve come to love my curls, it makes my hair wavy instead of curly.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy great for all hair types.</li>
            <li>and most importantly didn&#x27;t want to strip my keratin hair of its health and shine</li>

            <li>I have tried many, many products for my dry, thick and overprocessed hair.</li>
            <li>This product was really nothing special and definitely not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>This is just a luxuriant thick cream and it helps in the process of calming it all down and gives it a great feel and shine.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It softens, detangles, and has a relaxing effect on natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I used this product last summer everyday after swimming in a pool, and it really helped to hold protect my hair in general.</li>

            <li> Great product!!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love Keratase products and if you have frizzy hair you&#x27;ll want to give this whole product line a try!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many products for my dry, thick and overprocessed hair. This stuff works great. I also use the shampoo and leave in conditioner and my hair has never looked or felt softer! Worth the price and shipping!</li>
            <li> This product is very good, it filled my expectations and I will continue to purchase it.  I only used it once so far and the results were good, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this product from Rucci. Shipping was fast and the product was packaged nicely. The actual product however has an awful, strong smell to it. It smells like some type of musk. I don&#x27;t care to use it . It&#x27;s just taking up space under my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating for the hair and it repairs it as well. My hair is no longer frizzy as long a s I am using this. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but have been getting keratin smoothing treatments on it every 3 months for the past 5 years. I recently decided to bring back my curly hair and my hairdresser recommended the Kerastase Oleo line. I&#x27;ve been so scared to start this transition and most importantly didn&#x27;t want to strip my keratin hair of its health and shine but in order to bring back my curl over time I had to change products. I shampooed tonight with Kerastase Oleo then conditioned with this product. I&#x27;m hair obsessed and really like the results so far. It made my hair soft and it smells great. I may post tomorrow after it dries for the real test!</li>
            <li> I used this product last summer everyday after swimming in a pool, and it really helped to hold protect my hair in general.</li>
            <li> Great for conditioning hair</li>
            <li> great for curly hair love it!</li>
            <li> This is the top of range product. I have alot of course, curly hair, it manage my hair nicely and put a silky effect on my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for those of us with coarse and wavy hair.  I have used this for years!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft.  I like the results I&#x27;m getting from using it once a week.</li>
            <li> I shop to on Kerastase&#x27;s website and this item did not perform. The container was not sealed. I did NOT receive the same conditioning benefits that I did before. Beware of Fake product!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is great for curly hair, and a good price! I have loved this product for a long time and find it less expensive on amazon</li>

            <li> My hair is thick and somewhat coarse and as I&#x27;ve aged has become drier and frizzy with grey. This product totally calms it down and seals the follicle. Nothing compares!</li>
            <li> Great product, and I paid so much less than at the salon.</li>
            <li> Thus naked wash and go true fir ne excellent product worth the money</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this and it works OK. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. I&#x27;ll try cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> I used to look for a shampoo that made my hair straight and while this doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair, which is good because I&#x27;ve come to love my curls, it makes my hair wavy instead of curly. It&#x27;s a ton easier to manage.. I guess it could be kinda like a relaxer without the damage? I&#x27;ve never used a relaxer so I don&#x27;t know how efficient they are, but I know this one definitely makes me hair less curly.</li>
            <li> This product was really nothing special and definitely not worth the price tag. It smells great and sure it moisturizes, but it did nothing substantial to my straw-dry winter hair.</li>
            <li> Left hair frizzy, absolutely no benefit. Returned the order highly disappointed with the product. I gave it several tries and it still left no results. Would not use again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for thick color treated hair. Fairly expensive and I think it&#x27;s discontinued. That is sad... It&#x27;s my go to conditioner for several years.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastse! This product is no exception! It keeps your hair silky, shiny, smooth, and frizz-free! I know you&#x27;ll love this product too! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent Product for African-American Hair..,  It softens, detangles, and has a relaxing effect on natural hair.  I would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
            <li> I love how nice my hair feels when conditioned with this masque. My hair feels soft and healthy great for all hair types. First used in salon was so impressed I had to have for home use.  The scent is faint and fresh.</li>
