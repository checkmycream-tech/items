            <li>The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Why purchase a $200 product when this one does the job as effectively?</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s delighted :  )</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no miracle here in terms of my skin getting better, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting a good wash and a healthful abrasion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re worth it , but the improvements I got from this product for this price is amazing !!!</li>
            <li>I have really liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for a child to turn it on.</li>
            <li>All of them are thrilled and love using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they put some instructions and tips for better use of their product.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon the Olay Pro-X, read the great reviews, and decided spending the $21.99 (Walgreens) on this product was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>works well just wish it had more than 1 speed</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both extremely satisfied with their purchase too.</li>
            <li>and I must say I love it.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I bought the Olay product.</li>

            <li>,i will buy more to my friend</li>
            <li>and I paid more for the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I use it 2 or 3 times a week, and feel my skin much better than before.</li>
            <li>Have used before and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;gentally ex-foliates better.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after using brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just yanking might break it, so I&#x27;m glad I refrained from doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had skin this smooth!</li>
            <li>Most reviews are glowing for this product.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product so much &amp; shared it with my mom and now she is totally in-love with it as well &amp; the price is great!</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower-it does a great job keeping my face free from blackheads-and feels gentle</li>
            <li>My face looks amazing-all my products seem more effective, and it is so easy to use-so very much worth it-I would put it as a must.</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X is working great for me.  </li>
            <li>It was the most simple and fastest approach to getting rid of my acne and I am so glad that I get to see the great results.  </li>
            <li>so they are great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Had bought one for myself before and loved it so much i decided to get one for my Mom.  </li>
            <li>I not only feel like I am doing my face some good, but I could use the pampering me time!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product that lasts, does the job, is easy to take with you and will not scratch your skin</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The rotating brush tangles my hair easily too.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as high priced models</li>
            <li>Liked that very much.</li>
            <li>I will say I am very pleased with my purchase, I love how soft the brush head is and how well it cleans my face.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser has a mild abrasive in it and my face feels very clean.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much</li>
            <li>It works great for what it is, which is a rotating facial brush (the Mia is an oscillating brush).</li>
            <li>and after your finished your face glows and feels smooth</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Like this system but would like the settings to be more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin silky smooth after use...</li>
            <li>The cleansing cream that comes with it seems to be great at exfoliating (it has tiny micro-beads in it).</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can see, this is just as good as anything else.  </li>
            <li>But I do love the clean, fresh feeling on my face after using this product.</li>
            <li>it was cheap, but the original price was almost $40.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling baby smooth and extremely clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to wash out the brush up to 3 times to get my face, throat and neck clean but it does it and it feels even betterer when I smooth on my evening emolliants afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love the cleanser as well, since it exfoliates very gently.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how clean this leaves my skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>She said she sees results as well helps clean out the dirt from skin and takes away acne.</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly and packaging was secure.</li>
            <li>It does clean off make up at the end of day.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and my face feels so clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super easy to operate and the brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>My skin really does look better when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it really cleans better, and</li>
            <li>I use a Bobbie Brown product to remove most of my makeup first and this little tool does a great job of removing the rest.</li>
            <li>other than that the product is pretty good, be sure to replace the brush head every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li>thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My face had an obvious difference overnight, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It will be well worth your money  </li>
            <li>I am not an Olay product user but this device is worth getting.  </li>
            <li>To me this is not a product worth the money and this product is not for every skin type.</li>
            <li>seems ok so far but too soon to tell.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, my face has become softer, smoother, and more clear.</li>
            <li>This will bring a smile to her face.</li>
            <li>I have spent YEARS trying to find a way to shrink my pores and make sure I am thoroughly cleaning my face without causing dryness or stripping away too many layers from overexfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet i wish it comes with different kind of brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, and the response was very positive - it arrived on time and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>wife loves this gift, uses regulary, no issues, nice size, not too big or too small&lt;br /&gt;easy to take right out of box and use</li>
            <li>not only use the Olay face cleansing cream but have also used other creams with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and could tell a difference right from the start.</li>
            <li>My face feel fresh, super clean and new.</li>
            <li>It really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li>You feel very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and clean afterwards without feeling &amp;#34;dried  out&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleanser that it comes with is mild in scent, doesn&#x27;t take much of it at all to use.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use, remarkably affordable in comparison to other products that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This handy little machine gets the grit and oil right off my face, neck &amp; collar-line like a dream!</li>
            <li>It is making my facial skin feel like velvet and giving it more surface tone.  </li>
            <li>I remove my makeup with the Regenerist Cleansing Wipes first</li>
            <li>It was a gift and my mother absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH OLAY!  </li>
            <li>at first was still working, like delayed response after pressing the button for a couple times.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>Get for that diva female that cares about her skin and love quality.</li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be mindful of is the brush and cleaner shouldn&#x27;t be used around your eyes so you&#x27;ll have to make sure you use eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes before you apply the cleaner and use the brush on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a higher priced one that she bought.</li>
            <li>the motorized cleansing brush really get into the pores... coupled with the cleansing cream, my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Overall glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>First, the facial brush does nothing more than a wash rag.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin was so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your face feel really clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have had to put batteries very often, and the first time to change the batteries I thought I was going to break it, bc</li>
            <li>I really like the gentle massage.  </li>
            <li>Forget paying $$$$$$$ for a clarisonic, this is a gentle product that works as an efficient and affordable alternative to those pricey face scrubbing tools out there today.</li>
            <li>I expected it work more in power.</li>
            <li>The rotating brush stimulates my face and it and really works the cleanser in</li>
            <li>and I feel very refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li>the cleanser is very grainy and doesn&#x27;t dissolve well or works well with the brush.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower which is a real plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>This product along with the cleanser, works very well.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>I am not going to lie and say my acne has disappeared, but I can tell after just a week of use that my face is beginning to look and feel so much smoother.</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds and is very thorough at cleaning off makeup and dirt.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>ONE THING that really irritated me about this product?</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I imagine it&#x27;s set up that way because the whole thing is water resistant.</li>
            <li>Much fewer breakouts than before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s also nice is that you can buy extra brushes, here at Amazon or at your local Walgreens.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cream has a good texture, the grains are not too thick</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, MY SKIN HAS CLEARED UP COMPLETELY!!!</li>
            <li>This product it very good did exactly what i was expecting would recommend it to anyone that may have any second tough.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how good or not good</li>
            <li>Seems like a decent product I suppose.</li>
            <li>My daughter received this gift for Christmas and said it had high reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used the product just 2 times now, so I don&#x27;t see any crazy major results yet, but it works really well and does feel super great on your face and neck..</li>
            <li>So - this is definitely worth trying out especially at the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and thank you</li>
            <li>Terrific set that includes gentle but powerful cleanser- also the 2 speed rotating soft brush to use with it-which you&lt;br /&gt;can even use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day in the shower...and it real makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and gentle, I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am in my fifties and this product brought new life to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I told myself that I would just live with the acne.  </li>
            <li>The facial scrub is more grainy than expected as well.</li>
            <li>In two weeks my face feels so soft and clean, it&#x27;s not oily nor is it dry and the blackheads that have been on my nose are gone.</li>
            <li>It has very soft movement with just one direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would not use this every day, but it did definitely clear up my skin after just one 1 minute use!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone not wanting to pay hundreds for the higher quality systems.</li>
            <li>I noticed a definite improvement with my skin after consistent use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is okay but not totally satisfying me.</li>
            <li>The blush is good but the facial cleanser is actually very small.</li>
            <li>she tried it the first time, she said how it was basically the same thing as what she had in the spa with the professional one.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and so far no problems.  </li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and soft, and I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and less blackheads.</li>
            <li>After hearing all the rave reviews about Olay&#x27;s products and the fact that other brushes can cost around $200, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it, it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect...</li>
            <li>Before I gave up, I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advance Cleansing System to a least make my skin texture and tone a bit better.  </li>
            <li>This product really works after just one use my skin felt cleaner, clearer and pores were not as big as before.  </li>
            <li>This system makes your skin feel really soft and helps control blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li>I am fifty five years old, and have never put a lot of effort into Beaty products.  </li>
            <li>and I have been suffering from adult acne since I turned 20.  </li>
            <li>Made my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I really recommend against getting a similar product which may cost over $150.  </li>
            <li>then it completely went off...</li>
            <li>have ultra sensitive skin and the cleanser that came with the brush makes my skin look even rougher and redder than it had been.  </li>
            <li>and it feels so soft all of the time.</li>
            <li>cleaner is gentle but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>As I work outside in all weather it really cleans off the grime I pick up during the day.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for every days use which is nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for a few weeks now and it has made my skin ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this 3 months ago and have noticed a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I was expecting my face to feel clean and tight after I used the cleansing system</li>
            <li>the bristles could be a little softer, but comparing its price to any clarisoft, its totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try another R rand of facial brush.  </li>
            <li>then I had to press the button to make it work, so to clean my face and press the button at the same time was not fun.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it, but after seeing the $100 price tag I was going to do some research on other possibilities first.</li>
            <li>I have seen major improvement in my skin , when I used proactive</li>
            <li>The abrasion cream that comes with the kit has just enough beads in it to make your face feel soft and clean without being too abrasive and making your skin feel raw.</li>
            <li>So, due to the fact that using the cleanser with the brush made my skin worse I will have to wait to try the brush with a more gentle cleanser...</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it over the more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are very soft, and the wash included lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on here thoroughly and opted for this rather than the more expensive professional one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I am using this in a gift for a babyshower game and who wouldnt love this especially with the batteries and replacement brush!!</li>
            <li>Just plain Oil of Olay works better a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying this product out before spending so much money on other big names!</li>

            <li> The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Why purchase a $200 product when this one does the job as effectively?</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s delighted :  )</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no miracle here in terms of my skin getting better, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting a good wash and a healthful abrasion.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re worth it , but the improvements I got from this product for this price is amazing !!!</li>
            <li> I have really liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for a child to turn it on.</li>
            <li> All of them are thrilled and love using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they put some instructions and tips for better use of their product.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon the Olay Pro-X, read the great reviews, and decided spending the $21.99 (Walgreens) on this product was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> works well just wish it had more than 1 speed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both extremely satisfied with their purchase too.</li>
            <li> and I must say I love it.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I bought the Olay product.</li>

            <li> Have used before and love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;gentally ex-foliates better.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just yanking might break it, so I&#x27;m glad I refrained from doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had skin this smooth!</li>
            <li> Most reviews are glowing for this product.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product so much &amp; shared it with my mom and now she is totally in-love with it as well &amp; the price is great!</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower-it does a great job keeping my face free from blackheads-and feels gentle</li>
            <li> My face looks amazing-all my products seem more effective, and it is so easy to use-so very much worth it-I would put it as a must.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X is working great for me.  </li>
            <li> It was the most simple and fastest approach to getting rid of my acne and I am so glad that I get to see the great results.  </li>
            <li> so they are great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Had bought one for myself before and loved it so much i decided to get one for my Mom.  </li>
            <li> I not only feel like I am doing my face some good, but I could use the pampering me time!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product that lasts, does the job, is easy to take with you and will not scratch your skin</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The rotating brush tangles my hair easily too.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as high priced models</li>
            <li> Liked that very much.</li>
            <li> I will say I am very pleased with my purchase, I love how soft the brush head is and how well it cleans my face.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser has a mild abrasive in it and my face feels very clean.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much</li>
            <li> It works great for what it is, which is a rotating facial brush (the Mia is an oscillating brush).</li>
            <li> and after your finished your face glows and feels smooth</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Like this system but would like the settings to be more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth after use...</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream that comes with it seems to be great at exfoliating (it has tiny micro-beads in it).</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can see, this is just as good as anything else.  </li>
            <li> But I do love the clean, fresh feeling on my face after using this product.</li>
            <li> it was cheap, but the original price was almost $40.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling baby smooth and extremely clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to wash out the brush up to 3 times to get my face, throat and neck clean but it does it and it feels even betterer when I smooth on my evening emolliants afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser as well, since it exfoliates very gently.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how clean this leaves my skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> She said she sees results as well helps clean out the dirt from skin and takes away acne.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly and packaging was secure.</li>
            <li> It does clean off make up at the end of day.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and my face feels so clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super easy to operate and the brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin really does look better when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it really cleans better, and</li>
            <li> I use a Bobbie Brown product to remove most of my makeup first and this little tool does a great job of removing the rest.</li>
            <li> other than that the product is pretty good, be sure to replace the brush head every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> thank you very much!</li>
            <li> My face had an obvious difference overnight, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It will be well worth your money  </li>
            <li> I am not an Olay product user but this device is worth getting.  </li>
            <li> To me this is not a product worth the money and this product is not for every skin type.</li>
            <li> seems ok so far but too soon to tell.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product, my face has become softer, smoother, and more clear.</li>
            <li> This will bring a smile to her face.</li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS trying to find a way to shrink my pores and make sure I am thoroughly cleaning my face without causing dryness or stripping away too many layers from overexfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet i wish it comes with different kind of brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and the response was very positive - it arrived on time and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> wife loves this gift, uses regulary, no issues, nice size, not too big or too small&lt;br /&gt;easy to take right out of box and use</li>
            <li> not only use the Olay face cleansing cream but have also used other creams with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and could tell a difference right from the start.</li>
            <li> My face feel fresh, super clean and new.</li>
            <li> It really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> You feel very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and clean afterwards without feeling &amp;#34;dried  out&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleanser that it comes with is mild in scent, doesn&#x27;t take much of it at all to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, remarkably affordable in comparison to other products that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This handy little machine gets the grit and oil right off my face, neck &amp; collar-line like a dream!</li>
            <li> It is making my facial skin feel like velvet and giving it more surface tone.  </li>
            <li> I remove my makeup with the Regenerist Cleansing Wipes first</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my mother absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH OLAY!  </li>
            <li> at first was still working, like delayed response after pressing the button for a couple times.</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Get for that diva female that cares about her skin and love quality.</li>
            <li> use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be mindful of is the brush and cleaner shouldn&#x27;t be used around your eyes so you&#x27;ll have to make sure you use eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes before you apply the cleaner and use the brush on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a higher priced one that she bought.</li>
            <li> the motorized cleansing brush really get into the pores... coupled with the cleansing cream, my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Overall glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> First, the facial brush does nothing more than a wash rag.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin was so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your face feel really clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have had to put batteries very often, and the first time to change the batteries I thought I was going to break it, bc</li>
            <li> I really like the gentle massage.  </li>
            <li> Forget paying $$$$$$$ for a clarisonic, this is a gentle product that works as an efficient and affordable alternative to those pricey face scrubbing tools out there today.</li>
            <li> I expected it work more in power.</li>
            <li> The rotating brush stimulates my face and it and really works the cleanser in</li>
            <li> and I feel very refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li> the cleanser is very grainy and doesn&#x27;t dissolve well or works well with the brush.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower which is a real plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> This product along with the cleanser, works very well.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to lie and say my acne has disappeared, but I can tell after just a week of use that my face is beginning to look and feel so much smoother.</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds and is very thorough at cleaning off makeup and dirt.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> ONE THING that really irritated me about this product?</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I imagine it&#x27;s set up that way because the whole thing is water resistant.</li>
            <li> Much fewer breakouts than before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s also nice is that you can buy extra brushes, here at Amazon or at your local Walgreens.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cream has a good texture, the grains are not too thick</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, MY SKIN HAS CLEARED UP COMPLETELY!!!</li>
            <li> This product it very good did exactly what i was expecting would recommend it to anyone that may have any second tough.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how good or not good</li>
            <li> Seems like a decent product I suppose.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this gift for Christmas and said it had high reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used the product just 2 times now, so I don&#x27;t see any crazy major results yet, but it works really well and does feel super great on your face and neck..</li>
            <li> So - this is definitely worth trying out especially at the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and thank you</li>
            <li> Terrific set that includes gentle but powerful cleanser- also the 2 speed rotating soft brush to use with it-which you&lt;br /&gt;can even use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day in the shower...and it real makes my face feel really clean.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and gentle, I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am in my fifties and this product brought new life to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I told myself that I would just live with the acne.  </li>
            <li> The facial scrub is more grainy than expected as well.</li>
            <li> In two weeks my face feels so soft and clean, it&#x27;s not oily nor is it dry and the blackheads that have been on my nose are gone.</li>
            <li> It has very soft movement with just one direction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would not use this every day, but it did definitely clear up my skin after just one 1 minute use!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone not wanting to pay hundreds for the higher quality systems.</li>
            <li> I noticed a definite improvement with my skin after consistent use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is okay but not totally satisfying me.</li>
            <li> The blush is good but the facial cleanser is actually very small.</li>
            <li> she tried it the first time, she said how it was basically the same thing as what she had in the spa with the professional one.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far no problems.  </li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and soft, and I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and less blackheads.</li>
            <li> After hearing all the rave reviews about Olay&#x27;s products and the fact that other brushes can cost around $200, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it, it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect...</li>
            <li> Before I gave up, I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advance Cleansing System to a least make my skin texture and tone a bit better.  </li>
            <li> This product really works after just one use my skin felt cleaner, clearer and pores were not as big as before.  </li>
            <li> This system makes your skin feel really soft and helps control blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li> I am fifty five years old, and have never put a lot of effort into Beaty products.  </li>
            <li> and I have been suffering from adult acne since I turned 20.  </li>
            <li> Made my face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I really recommend against getting a similar product which may cost over $150.  </li>
            <li> then it completely went off...</li>
            <li> have ultra sensitive skin and the cleanser that came with the brush makes my skin look even rougher and redder than it had been.  </li>
            <li> and it feels so soft all of the time.</li>
            <li> cleaner is gentle but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> As I work outside in all weather it really cleans off the grime I pick up during the day.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for every days use which is nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for a few weeks now and it has made my skin ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago and have noticed a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my face to feel clean and tight after I used the cleansing system</li>
            <li> the bristles could be a little softer, but comparing its price to any clarisoft, its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try another R rand of facial brush.  </li>
            <li> then I had to press the button to make it work, so to clean my face and press the button at the same time was not fun.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it, but after seeing the $100 price tag I was going to do some research on other possibilities first.</li>
            <li> I have seen major improvement in my skin , when I used proactive</li>
            <li> The abrasion cream that comes with the kit has just enough beads in it to make your face feel soft and clean without being too abrasive and making your skin feel raw.</li>
            <li> So, due to the fact that using the cleanser with the brush made my skin worse I will have to wait to try the brush with a more gentle cleanser...</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it over the more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very soft, and the wash included lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here thoroughly and opted for this rather than the more expensive professional one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I am using this in a gift for a babyshower game and who wouldnt love this especially with the batteries and replacement brush!!</li>
            <li> Just plain Oil of Olay works better a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend trying this product out before spending so much money on other big names!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t use the cleanser that comes with it everyday, but I do use the brush with my other cleansers everyday, once a day--usually at night.</li>
            <li> The  knife blade was previously unused so it was not dull  </li>
            <li> The shipping packaging was easy to access however the product packaging is too difficult to open..</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the product, the state of my face was: 4-8 large pimples on the forehead and cheeks about two-three days apart, tiny bumps (not exactly pimples) on both sides of my mouth and jaw line, oily and just plain horrendous looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only did my prescription med. make my face worse but it also made it very sensitive and tender (but that&#x27;s a completely diff.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with moderate acne since the age of 15 (I am now 21) and a very dry face that peels a lot from the acne gel I use.</li>
            <li> I like the little cleansing machine, but the container of cleansing lotion was old.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results.</li>
            <li> I got this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except that the brush is a little small.  </li>
            <li> dry skin on my face has gone.  </li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.  </li>
            <li> Blemishes are less frequent and less severe.</li>
            <li> after the 3rd time in a year of changing the batteries, the thing just went down.</li>
            <li> Other causes for this could be wearing less foundation and just a general decrease of acne in college, but the odds are it&#x27;s this gizmo doing the work.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, and after using this for several months, I&#x27;ve noticed I have had considerably less breakouts.</li>
            <li> the batteries were a little wet, so I had to leave it open to dry for over a day.  </li>
            <li> speed slower than expected</li>
            <li> I compared it with mine and there is not much difference.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I had a product similar to this one years ago but the brush was too stiff and the company didn&#x27;t sell replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look dull and it helps somewhat lighten the dark spots (old chemical burn) on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I never doubted the product since I have been using other Oil of Olay products for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as well as other Olay products and my skin</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t use it every day, but probably every other day or two out of three days.  </li>
            <li> I never doubted the product since I have been using other Oil of Olay products for years.</li>
            <li> and it just made those bumps freak out, one after the other.  </li>
            <li> Why is no one else wondering where the other brush is?</li>
            <li> I have other cleansers I can use with the machine.</li>
            <li> have 1/2 a tube of cleanser because the other 1/2 had blood in it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The price is almost 40-50% less than if you will buy each item separately.</li>
            <li> So, for one and a half months, I started my \\&quot;accidental\\&quot; regime twice a day.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27; t see a difference in having less outbreaks/ pimples though.</li>
            <li> typical routine is a salicylic acid-based wash in the morning</li>
            <li> when you are cleaning up in the eye area, it slightly pulls that skin under you eye down, so it is getting cleansed and stimulated!</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s gimmicky</li>
            <li> so I do like the fact that the cleansing systems removes any makeup that&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas after she&#x27;s been a few times to the spa to get facials done.</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes care nicely of dead skin</li>
            <li> Too stiff a brush can cause microscopic abrasions on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried that we&#x27;d be stuck buying expensive paste for it, but she uses so little each time that the one tube will probably last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and does the job.</li>
            <li> In the past two years, I became \\&quot;over-productive\\&quot; with finding a way to get rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li> Moving on, I would wash my face by mixing a small amount of the Neutrogena Grapefruit Acne wash and The Biore Pore Unclogging.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure whether it&#x27;s because of this cleansing system</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream is not overwhelming for an exfoliating product.  </li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a lazy way to wash the face.  </li>
            <li> it was really hard to pull it apart.</li>
            <li> I had to press hard to try &amp; get through .</li>
            <li> hard to grasp  to pull out to insert  the batteries...  </li>
            <li> My experience is negative.  </li>
            <li> however the material of the product packaging was so  thick &amp; ungving</li>
            <li> For those of you having a difficult time taking the bottom off in order to insert the batteries, just use a jar-opener gripper (basically a thin flat piece of textured rubber material) to grip the end and pull it off.  </li>
            <li> Then it was very difficult to open the battery compartment to install the batteries.  </li>
            <li> The picture confused me and the actual product made me felt very disappointed because it is only 20 ml</li>
            <li> and I said it was too expensive and gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and while it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help, it hasn&#x27;t made it any worse either.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As for you guys who are skeptical, I reallyencourage you to \\&quot;accidentally\\</li>
            <li> Difficult to pull off cap to place in batteries.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but I can see a difference in my face in 4 days.</li>
            <li> SO I AM UNABLE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> and I must say I was a little dissapointed because it looked boring.</li>
            <li> but over the course of a couple of weeks using this product in the mornings I became unhappy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have been stressing out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting my self with an utility  blade that  </li>
            <li> This could be dangerous around children who might want to brush their hair with it.  </li>
            <li> It was unpleasant and I threw away after one use.  </li>
            <li> It was nearly impossible to remove the product from its packaging.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Will definitely be giving it to all of my friends for the holidays!</li>
            <li> works well just wish it had more than 1 speed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks now and it&#x27;s very good. Leaves my skin clean and smooth. I never doubted the product since I have been using other Oil of Olay products for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how clean this leaves my skin feeling.  I&#x27;ve been using this as well as other Olay products and my skin definitely looks brighter and my pores are smaller.  Am very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I can not live without this product.  I am in my fifties and this product brought new life to my skin.  I also bought for a friend and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I got this set for my wife for her birthday and she loves using it. This is a great gift guys. She said she sees results as well helps clean out the dirt from skin and takes away acne. Best product. Thank you !!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered--no problems.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife&#x27;s birthday after she said she wanted one in Sam&#x27;s club and I said it was too expensive and gimmicky.  Then, of course, when her birthday came I ordered it.  That was about 6 weeks ago.  I still think it&#x27;s gimmicky but she seems to like it.  She says it dries out her nose some so she doesn&#x27;t use it every day, but probably every other day or two out of three days.  I have to admit she does seem to have cleaner looking skin on her forhead, so maybe it&#x27;s not a gimmick.  I was worried that we&#x27;d be stuck buying expensive paste for it, but she uses so little each time that the one tube will probably last 6 months.  Seems like a decent product I suppose.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X is working great for me.  I like the fact that it has a hi and lo setting, and that I can use the brush in the shower. For those of you having a difficult time taking the bottom off in order to insert the batteries, just use a jar-opener gripper (basically a thin flat piece of textured rubber material) to grip the end and pull it off.  Easy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and could tell a difference right from the start. My skin was smooth and soft, and I&#x27;ve had fewer breakouts and less blackheads. Great product and feels so good using it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t use the cleanser that comes with it everyday, but I do use the brush with my other cleansers everyday, once a day--usually at night. It leaves my skin feeling baby smooth and extremely clean. I am extremely happy with this purchase. I have acne prone skin, and after using this for several months, I&#x27;ve noticed I have had considerably less breakouts. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and best friend decided to buy one for themselves after I heaped praise upon praise on it. They&#x27;re both extremely satisfied with their purchase too.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except that the brush is a little small.  This product really works after just one use my skin felt cleaner, clearer and pores were not as big as before.  The price is almost 40-50% less than if you will buy each item separately.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me for mothers day and I must say I was a little dissapointed because it looked boring. After the first use my skin was so clean and soft. I have been hooked ever since and recommend this product to all. It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X brush since it hit the market and I must say I love it. I actually have 2, 1 for home and 1 for travel. It&#x27;s small and does the job. While some have concerns about the brush softness, it&#x27;s just perfect for me. I had a product similar to this one years ago but the brush was too stiff and the company didn&#x27;t sell replacement brushes. Too stiff a brush can cause microscopic abrasions on your skin. That&#x27;s just asking for problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only use the Olay face cleansing cream but have also used other creams with wonderful results. I use a Bobbie Brown product to remove most of my makeup first and this little tool does a great job of removing the rest. I use this product daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect miracles in regards to skin tightening from any product. I&#x27;ll leave that to a plastic surgeon. But I do love the clean, fresh feeling on my face after using this product. I liked this product so much I bought it for my 3 sisters and 2 nieces. All of them are thrilled and love using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s also nice is that you can buy extra brushes, here at Amazon or at your local Walgreens. I would definitely recommend this product to friends. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality product that lasts, does the job, is easy to take with you and will not scratch your skin then this is the one to get. Why purchase a $200 product when this one does the job as effectively? Definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks now and it&#x27;s very good. Leaves my skin clean and smooth. I never doubted the product since I have been using other Oil of Olay products for years.</li>
            <li> This great face brush can go into the shower..  It is making my facial skin feel like velvet and giving it more surface tone.  Love the cleanser as well, since it exfoliates very gently.  The brush has two speeds and is a delight to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only day 5 and I&#x27;m feeling so-so about this product. I was expecting my face to feel clean and tight after I used the cleansing system but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t. I remove my makeup with the Regenerist Cleansing Wipes first so I do like the fact that the cleansing systems removes any makeup that&#x27;s left behind. I will post an update at day 10.    chharper  Norther Virginia</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I really like the gentle massage.  I not only feel like I am doing my face some good, but I could use the pampering me time!  The price was really good also.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist wanted me to buy the Mia system which is hundreds of dollars. I couldn&#x27;t afford that so I went looking for a cheaper alternative. I found this on sale in a drug store around Christmas last year and thought I&#x27;d try it. It works great for what it is, which is a rotating facial brush (the Mia is an oscillating brush). The brush heads are very soft, and the wash included lasts a really long time. I bought mine almost a year ago and I am only now running out of the wash and replacing the brush heads. This system makes your skin feel really soft and helps control blackheads and acne. I have rosacea and while it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help, it hasn&#x27;t made it any worse either. I would definitely recommend this to someone not wanting to pay hundreds for the higher quality systems.</li>
            <li> The item i purchased is great My skin feels refreshed and does not sting my eyes it feels like your getting  a massage on your face and after your finished your face glows and feels smooth I am really glad I bought the Olay product.</li>
            <li> Just plain Oil of Olay works better a waste of money.</li>
            <li> great value, came prepackaged and sealed. It was a gift and my mother absolutely loves it! Forget paying $$$$$$$ for a clarisonic, this is a gentle product that works as an efficient and affordable alternative to those pricey face scrubbing tools out there today.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The price was better than I was able to find anywhere else. Item shipped quickly and packaging was secure. The cleaser can be used with the brush, or without. I noticed a definite improvement with my skin after consistent use.</li>
            <li> The blush is good but the facial cleanser is actually very small. The picture confused me and the actual product made me felt very disappointed because it is only 20 ml</li>
            <li> I am fifty five years old, and have never put a lot of effort into Beaty products.  I love using this in the shower!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and I have been suffering from adult acne since I turned 20.  In the past two years, I became \\&quot;over-productive\\&quot; with finding a way to get rid of my acne.  I tried over-the-counter products and the likes.  Four months ago, I gave up...I told myself that I would just live with the acne.  Before I gave up, I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advance Cleansing System to a least make my skin texture and tone a bit better.  Before I purchased the product, the state of my face was: 4-8 large pimples on the forehead and cheeks about two-three days apart, tiny bumps (not exactly pimples) on both sides of my mouth and jaw line, oily and just plain horrendous looking skin.  I tried the acid peel to get rid of those bumps and it just made those bumps freak out, one after the other.  Moving on, I would wash my face by mixing a small amount of the Neutrogena Grapefruit Acne wash and The Biore Pore Unclogging.  Lather with my hands and rinse. I would follow up with the spin brush and exfoliator  .  By mistake, I was lathering up the Neutrogena and Biore  and started using the spin brush instead of my hands.  To my great surprise, I saw a lot of dirt on the brush head and was happy with how thorough the spin brush was at lifting the dirt.  So, for one and a half months, I started my \\&quot;accidental\\&quot; regime twice a day. Let me tell you, MY SKIN HAS CLEARED UP COMPLETELY!!! When I started noticing that the pimples were going away, I thought it was fluke, well, then I started seeing the bumps disappear.  I was so amazed but did not want to get my hopes up...but then 1 month went by, then another month and so on.  Currently, I have no pimples on my face but I have gotten the one or two hormonal pimple and when I do, I do the same routine and the pimple is gone the next day.  It was the most simple and fastest approach to getting rid of my acne and I am so glad that I get to see the great results.  THANK YOU SO MUCH OLAY!  As for you guys who are skeptical, I reallyencourage you to \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; find your regime with this Cleansing System.  It will be well worth your money  and if you have the same problems as I have had, then this might be your relief from acne.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  Recommend looking in a drugstore prior to buying sight unseen.  The facial scrub is more grainy than expected as well.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Love the brush. Made my face feel really soft. Thank you for making it cheaper than the rest.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much &amp; shared it with my mom and now she is totally in-love with it as well &amp; the price is great!</li>
            <li> I expected it work more in power. It has very soft movement with just one direction.&lt;br /&gt;It is okay but not totally satisfying me.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it too.  I have never used a system like this.  I will say I am very pleased with my purchase, I love how soft the brush head is and how well it cleans my face.  My face is the softest it has been in yrs.  I am not an Olay product user but this device is worth getting.  I have not tried the clarsonic yet but will add to this review afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have never tried the much more expensive competitor of this product so can&#x27;t compare them but this one works great. The combination of the exfoliating scrub and the hand held scrubber make my skin feel as good as the at home microdermabrasion system I used to use.</li>
            <li> I really recommend against getting a similar product which may cost over $150.  This product is just perfect.  My skin really does look better when I use it.  Just get it, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I had heard it was.  The cleanser has a mild abrasive in it and my face feels very clean. The rotating brush stimulates my face and it and really works the cleanser in and I feel very refreshed after using it.  It is gentl enough that I can use it every day.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a way to give themselves a pick up.</li>
            <li> I had it for about a year. bought it on sale for last xmas clearance bc it was marketed as gift. it was cheap, but the original price was almost $40. I have had to put batteries very often, and the first time to change the batteries I thought I was going to break it, bc it was really hard to pull it apart. I don&#x27;t believe its fully waterproof bc the batteries were a little wet, so I had to leave it open to dry for over a day.  after the 3rd time in a year of changing the batteries, the thing just went down. at first was still working, like delayed response after pressing the button for a couple times. then I had to press the button to make it work, so to clean my face and press the button at the same time was not fun.  then it completely went off... just when I though it will still work.  the cleanser is very grainy and doesn&#x27;t dissolve well or works well with the brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter suggested I try this and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I use it about 3 times a week and I love the feel of my face after using it. I keep it in the shower which is a real plus in my book. Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my husband who has an oily complexion.&lt;br /&gt;He uses it in shower every morning&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t know he did without it.</li>
            <li> After hearing all the rave reviews about Olay&#x27;s products and the fact that other brushes can cost around $200, I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it, it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect...but over the course of a couple of weeks using this product in the mornings I became unhappy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have ultra sensitive skin and the cleanser that came with the brush makes my skin look even rougher and redder than it had been.  So, due to the fact that using the cleanser with the brush made my skin worse I will have to wait to try the brush with a more gentle cleanser...got to give my skin some time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner using this brush than with just a cleanser and a wash cloth.  To me this is not a product worth the money and this product is not for every skin type.</li>
            <li> I have used the product just 2 times now, so I don&#x27;t see any crazy major results yet, but it works really well and does feel super great on your face and neck.. I really like that when you are cleaning up in the eye area, it slightly pulls that skin under you eye down, so it is getting cleansed and stimulated! The cleanser that it comes with is mild in scent, doesn&#x27;t take much of it at all to use. I am very happy with this! And, you cannot beat the price. It&#x27;s almost twice the price in department stores! Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results.</li>
            <li> My face looks amazing-all my products seem more effective, and it is so easy to use-so very much worth it-I would put it as a must. Really.</li>
            <li> Like this system but would like the settings to be more powerful.  I used to have the same cleansing system that&lt;br /&gt;Norelco made.  I loved that one</li>
            <li> i come from china,zhis is shaver is fomes.used is better!&lt;br /&gt;i like this one.it &#x27;s feel well ,i will buy more to my friend</li>
            <li> In a short time of use, I can already see an improvement in my skin.  It really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I bought this item because of the 6oz bottle that is in the description and the picture. But when it arrived the cleanser was ony .68oz. I bought this item especially for the big bottle of soap and I paid more for the product. THEY ARE FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> The product works great. My daughter loves it and I highly recommend it over the more expensive ones that do the same thing. Your face will love you when you finish using it!</li>
            <li> i did not receive the package that is pictured here. it DID NOT come with the extra brush. other than that the product is pretty good, be sure to replace the brush head every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> How does this product not have a billion reviews about how great it is?!  I just moved off to college and I have been stressing out like crazy. I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, cleansers, masks, prescription medication from my dermatologist and nothing has helped. Not only did my prescription med. make my face worse but it also made it very sensitive and tender (but that&#x27;s a completely diff. story)  Anyway, I just bought this 2 weeks ago and I am so happy. My face had an obvious difference overnight, it was amazing. In two weeks my face feels so soft and clean, it&#x27;s not oily nor is it dry and the blackheads that have been on my nose are gone. I would recommend this to ANYONE!   So happy that I don&#x27;t have to wear coverup anymore!  &lt;3</li>
            <li> My daughter received this gift for Christmas and said it had high reviews. She&#x27;s delighted :  )</li>
            <li> seems ok so far but too soon to tell.  It does clean off make up at the end of day.  It would be nice if they put some instructions and tips for better use of their product.  Difficult to pull off cap to place in batteries.  There is nothing to grip to pull the cap off.  Need to improve the design</li>
            <li> This product along with the cleanser, works very well. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and clean. It is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten one of these sooner! My skin feels so good after using it! My kids say they can see a difference in my skin too! A unsolicited  compliment too...LOL!</li>
            <li> Did not find the foam scrubbing brush in my kit.  Also I do not see where there are refills for that brush.  Why is no one else wondering where the other brush is?</li>
            <li> On time. GREAT PRODUCT. Leaves your face feeling good. Got this one for my granddaughter.  Already have one and I love it</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my face cleaner and cleanser that came with it.  I use it every day and my face feels so clean.</li>
            <li> speed slower than expected</li>
            <li> I like how my face feels after using this</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas after she&#x27;s been a few times to the spa to get facials done. I read the reviews on here thoroughly and opted for this rather than the more expensive professional one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she tried it the first time, she said how it was basically the same thing as what she had in the spa with the professional one. So - this is definitely worth trying out especially at the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and thank you Olay - you get extra points for including batteries ..... thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my face has become softer, smoother, and more clear. Blemishes are less frequent and less severe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, you won&#x27;t regret buying it. Leaves your skin silky smooth after use... I use it 2 or 3 times a week, and feel my skin much better than before. The exfoliating cream has a good texture, the grains are not too thick so they are great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product...the bristles could be a little softer, but comparing its price to any clarisoft, its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Great priced product.  It does the job!  Easy to travel with</li>
            <li> 4.5 rating.  I like the little cleansing machine, but the container of cleansing lotion was old.  I believe the smell was from the plastic of the bottle.  It was unpleasant and I threw away after one use.  I have other cleansers I can use with the machine.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working for me. After just one use I noticed I been breaking out on my lip areas. I am not sure whether it&#x27;s because of this cleansing system or maybe I haven&#x27;t been sleeping well..</li>
            <li> Works great and very happy with the skincare results all my products work even better! Quality and value very happy!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one and now I got it. For me and wifey. My face feel fresh, super clean and new. Very smooth. I can use it everyday. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price. Have used before and love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay products because of my mother . I am using this in a gift for a babyshower game and who wouldnt love this especially with the batteries and replacement brush!! Great gift any day !! Get for that diva female that cares about her skin and love quality. This will bring a smile to her face.</li>
            <li> very good  w zhi neng shuo zhe jige danci very good  w zhi neng shuo zhe jige danci very good  w zhi neng shuo zhe jige danci</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond just to try the concept.  Didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to pay for the high-priced ones.  This is a really good deal, since the cleanser is included in the price.  As far as I can see, this is just as good as anything else.  I&#x27;m 66 so there&#x27;s no miracle here in terms of my skin getting better, but I do feel I&#x27;m getting a good wash and a healthful abrasion.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  I can tell the difference in my face after using for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin on my face has gone.  Easy to use.  Just as good as high priced models</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. The cleanser is very good. The brush ... Equivalent to a $10.00 job. I can do the same thing with a wash cloth and making circles. I recommend... The Mia by clarisonic. Expensive, but I can see a difference in my face in 4 days. My pores are closing.</li>
            <li> The shipping packaging was easy to access however the product packaging is too difficult to open.. I ended up cutting my self with an utility  blade that  I had to use to get  to the product. The  knife blade was previously unused so it was not dull  however the material of the product packaging was so  thick &amp; ungving I had to press hard to try &amp; get through . This&lt;br /&gt;caused the the blade to slip ,cut myself  &amp; slit the tube of cleansing cream. just under the cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;I have 1/2 a tube of cleanser because the other 1/2 had blood in it.  the part where the batteries are to be inserted&lt;br /&gt;is hard to grasp  to pull out to insert  the batteries...  also i noticed  the information noted the brushes should be changed...but no information as to where to get replacements  I can&#x27;t say how good or not good the product is&lt;br /&gt;because I CAN&#x27;T GET THE BATTERIES  INSERTED AND 1/2 THE CLEANSER IS BLOODY SO I AM UNABLE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for x-mas and my wife loves it! I would recommend it for any one not wanting to spend a ton of money on similar systems.</li>
            <li> I recently went to my dermatologist and she suggested buying the Clarisonic Mia. I wanted to try it, but after seeing the $100 price tag I was going to do some research on other possibilities first. I stumbled upon the Olay Pro-X, read the great reviews, and decided spending the $21.99 (Walgreens) on this product was worth a shot. I went out and bought this product and used it that night. I use a salicylic acid cleanser instead of the one it comes with. I have always struggled with moderate acne since the age of 15 (I am now 21) and a very dry face that peels a lot from the acne gel I use. After one use my face felt great, and as the days went by I could tell I was completely in love with this product. My face no longer peels at all and it feels so soft all of the time. I am not going to lie and say my acne has disappeared, but I can tell after just a week of use that my face is beginning to look and feel so much smoother. I would definitely recommend trying this product out before spending so much money on other big names!</li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS trying to find a way to shrink my pores and make sure I am thoroughly cleaning my face without causing dryness or stripping away too many layers from overexfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is gentle but it definitely does the job. The brush is amazing. I have been using it about a week and have already seen my pores shrinking. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after a month of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be mindful of is the brush and cleaner shouldn&#x27;t be used around your eyes so you&#x27;ll have to make sure you use eye makeup remover or makeup remover wipes before you apply the cleaner and use the brush on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> I have seen major improvement in my skin , when I used proactive you couldn&#x27;t even tell , I still broke out and it didn&#x27;t prevent future breakouts. So I decided to take a different approach and just try deep cleaning my face and using moisturizer and omgsh I wish I had bought this sooner  . There&#x27;s no way I could buy those $200 brushes and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re worth it , but the improvements I got from this product for this price is amazing !!! I love it</li>
            <li> Instead of spending $100 plus on the name brand face cleanser I purchased this one and I am very satisfied with it! It has 2 speeds and is very thorough at cleaning off makeup and dirt. The abrasion cream that comes with the kit has just enough beads in it to make your face feel soft and clean without being too abrasive and making your skin feel raw.</li>
            <li> Had bought one for myself before and loved it so much i decided to get one for my Mom.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This handy little machine gets the grit and oil right off my face, neck &amp; collar-line like a dream! As I work outside in all weather it really cleans off the grime I pick up during the day. Sometimes I need to wash out the brush up to 3 times to get my face, throat and neck clean but it does it and it feels even betterer when I smooth on my evening emolliants afterwards. It&#x27;s made an enormous difference in my complexion and I hope it continues to serve me well for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I would not use this every day, but it did definitely clear up my skin after just one 1 minute use!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my face. I have really liked it. My daughter has a higher priced one that she bought. I compared it with mine and there is not much difference. I&#x27;m really happy with this one and glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Pro-X.  I use it in the shower-it does a great job keeping my face free from blackheads-and feels gentle</li>
            <li> Terrific set that includes gentle but powerful cleanser- also the 2 speed rotating soft brush to use with it-which you&lt;br /&gt;can even use in the shower. They toss in an additional brush to use later. Seems like it really cleans better, and&lt;br /&gt;gentally ex-foliates better.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and the response was very positive - it arrived on time and works as advertised.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Brush is softer than I thought it would be.  The cleansing cream is not overwhelming for an exfoliating product.  Liked that very much.</li>
            <li> Great for brushing up blemishes and exfoliating my skin yet i wish it comes with different kind of brushes.The equipment died after a month of use so i have to purchase another one or look into another scrubber.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing system for around two weeks. I love the way my face feels after using brush.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel really clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times but I can see a big difference in my facial skin.  I have very sensitive skin and so far no problems.  Very glad that I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She said she looks forward to cleansing her face each night.</li>
            <li> wife loves this gift, uses regulary, no issues, nice size, not too big or too small&lt;br /&gt;easy to take right out of box and use</li>
            <li> I use it every other day in the shower...and it real makes my face feel really clean. I can say, using this makes a difference in my skin. My face doesn&#x27;t look dull and it helps somewhat lighten the dark spots (old chemical burn) on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have very sensitive skin but this &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; does not bother it. It is gentle enough for every days use which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to operate and the brush is nice and soft. You feel very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and clean afterwards without feeling &amp;#34;dried  out&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It takes care nicely of dead skin but I don&#x27; t see a difference in having less outbreaks/ pimples though.</li>
            <li> This product it very good did exactly what i was expecting would recommend it to anyone that may have any second tough.</li>
            <li> Great product... the motorized cleansing brush really get into the pores... coupled with the cleansing cream, my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, remarkably affordable in comparison to other products that do the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONE THING that really irritated me about this product? Figuring out how to get to the battery case. I had to get on Google and RESEARCH how to open up this gadget without breaking it... it&#x27;s sort of a twist, rock-back-and-forth, then pull at the bottom to get it open. Just yanking might break it, so I&#x27;m glad I refrained from doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I imagine it&#x27;s set up that way because the whole thing is water resistant. I just wish they&#x27;d explained how to get into it on the package somewhere.)</li>
            <li> It was nearly impossible to remove the product from its packaging.  It took 20 minutes, using a kitchen knife.  Then it was very difficult to open the battery compartment to install the batteries.  I had to use a rubber jar opener.  Highly recommend you try another R rand of facial brush.  All of them had similar ratings.</li>
            <li> This works really great!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I got this a long time ago. I am still using it almost daily. It is great. It makes my face feel very smooth. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had skin this smooth! I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for a few weeks now and it has made my skin ridiculously smooth. The cleansing cream that comes with it seems to be great at exfoliating (it has tiny micro-beads in it). I use the brush daily in the shower (water proof) and have no complaints. The bristles are very soft and gentle, I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t speak for everyone. I&#x27;ve started using this brush with my regular face wash, although it doesn&#x27;t make the soap foam up like it does with my hands, I still feel like it cleans well. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year-old female who has struggled with monthly breakouts for years. I bought this 3 months ago and have noticed a marked difference in my skin. My makeup usage has dwindled almost to never, and when I do wear some, this removes it at night like, well ... a pro.&lt;br /&gt;My typical routine is a salicylic acid-based wash in the morning and then this system at night. Much fewer breakouts than before. Other causes for this could be wearing less foundation and just a general decrease of acne in college, but the odds are it&#x27;s this gizmo doing the work. hip hip hooray for olay!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like this product cleans your face thoroughly.  The rotating brush tangles my hair easily too.  Overall glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Most reviews are glowing for this product.  My experience is negative.  First, the facial brush does nothing more than a wash rag.  I would say it&#x27;s a lazy way to wash the face.  Second, on several occasions, the brush suddenly  caught my hair on the sides and yanked it out.  I see no warning about this.  This could be dangerous around children who might want to brush their hair with it.  It&#x27;s very easy for a child to turn it on.</li>
