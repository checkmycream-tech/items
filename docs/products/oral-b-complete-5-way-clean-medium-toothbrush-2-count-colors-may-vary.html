            <li> I won&#x27;t be getting these again.  The rubber pieces on the side fell off during my second use.  There are better tooth brushes out there, for sure.  Sorry for such a bad review, but i&#x27;m not overly fond of the taste of rubber.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I ever had</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this toothbrush.  The bristles are firm enough (solid medium) to feel like you&#x27;re really cleaning your teeth.  And on each side it has an extra set of even firmer bristles so the sides don&#x27;t cave in.  The head is medium in length so you can maneuver to thoroughly brush your back teeth as well. Will definitely buy this again.</li>

            <li> Love my new toothbrush. Got 2 in 1 pack. one for me and one for hubby. He says it is too hard for a medium, but I like it. To those who may be looking for a medium toothbrush, it is a little rough at first, but after a few brushes, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great product and simple to use.  My last dental appointment was good and I told them I am using a different toothbrush to improve the equality of my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great quality toothbrushes.  I like the size and style of the grip and the head.  Not too stiff.</li>
