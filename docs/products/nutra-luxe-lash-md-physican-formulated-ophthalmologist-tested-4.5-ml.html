            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>People ask me all the time what I am doing to my lashes and I very nicely say &amp;</li>
            <li>Mascara goes on very nicely and my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>Then my mom told me that my aunt was using this product and could not believe how amazing her eyelashes looked!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>&amp; now I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara &amp; still feel real confident.  </li>
            <li>but with no pain, i recomend this product is amazing and great</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning to take my dogs out, and the bright sun literally made my eyes and head throb--</li>
            <li>all the reviews seemed good.</li>
            <li>These things keep my fiance&#x27;s eyelashes looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and up until now I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
            <li>This product is GOOD.  </li>
            <li>in 5 weeks my lashes are good.</li>
            <li>My co-worker has been using this a month longer than I have and her lashes look as good</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t be good for your eyes</li>
            <li>Maybe its a good product -I</li>
            <li>Ive heard a lot of good things havent seen results yet</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this product did work for me.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with Nutra Luxe Lash MD and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
            <li>I am not prepared to buy the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot; yet with the triple digit price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It had good reviews and was cheaper</li>
            <li>By closer look I realized that those darker patches were indeed very fine hairs growing on the skin of the lower corners of my eyes!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited because I heard great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not, no problem, because I just love the results!</li>
            <li>So glad I took the leap of faith and tried this!</li>
            <li>Love my lashes!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>but I have used this brand before and found it most successful.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, but it sure does work for me!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>not buy again for sure!</li>

            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price and provides fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Strictly a nighttime use, but using continuously the results are just amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product...</li>
            <li>This is amazing</li>
            <li>used to have to HAVE some kind of &#x27;eyebrow darkening&#x27; make up.</li>
            <li>You honestly couldn&#x27;t tell, unless I kept coating the Lashes in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m really thrilled.  </li>
            <li>These work as well as the perscription kind.</li>
            <li>It is an honorably, honestly marketed product that lives up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am impressed, I really</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honest.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest with you.</li>
            <li>They have gotten sparse and they don&#x27;t curl up very easy.</li>
            <li>It is a great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Works great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Growing out my own makes them look more fabulouse then</li>
            <li>pretty lol</li>
            <li>Thé combinaition for quality versus the prince is very fantastic.</li>
            <li>Within three weeks, saw a huge difference.. now, in September, my lashes touch my eyebrows!  </li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure it is safe though.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this product from reputable hair an cosmetics company from Cal.</li>
            <li>Ok, even without mascara</li>
            <li>that they touched my top lid after I did that.</li>
            <li>One swipe of the brush into the vial, covers both top lids, like you&#x27;re putting on liquid eye liner.  </li>
            <li>Beautylash MD seems to be working its magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash and then switched to this product because it lasted longer and seemed a better value.  </li>
            <li>This product is going to be my all around Christmas gift for my girlfriends!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Love LOVE LOVVE</li>
            <li>Love the results....</li>
            <li>This is way better than all those extension mascaras.</li>
            <li>so I can put my eyebrow pencil on better.</li>
            <li>I love Nutra Luxe Lash MD.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it, so I obviously was happy with the product and didnt need to read the reviews.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I came online this morning and read the reviews.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a year or more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more growth in the time to come and I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;P.s.</li>
            <li>It is pricey if purchased in the stores but is more affordable on line</li>
            <li>I have had no side effects, but have had friends who have said it irritates their eyes, but more friends like myself who have not been adversely effected at all.  </li>
            <li>you wake up in a week and magically look like Betty Davis eyes in her twenties?</li>
            <li>Satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>Love love love this</li>
            <li>,, I love this products!&lt;br /&gt;U</li>
            <li>but I have been using it for over a year now and still love the results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are longer and there are more of them.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also I have two daughters who love it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is potent.  </li>
            <li>im going to buy more.</li>
            <li>I cant tell you how many compliments my lashes get.</li>
            <li>I have so many comments on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, and I will continue buying and using this.</li>
            <li>lashes are way better than they used to be, I did try the product on my brows but that didn&#x27;t work as in my youth</li>
            <li>I guess my eyes are more senstive.  </li>
            <li>wonder if the people who have had great results from this product received the counterfeit bottle or the real bottle.....</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I realized that if I took off my eye makeup at night and then waited a while before using the Nutra Luxe, the irritation subsided mostly.  </li>
            <li>and I will buy more.  </li>
            <li>Bern using this for 2 years, i get soooo many complements about my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>While Nutra LUXE LASH MD does help your lashes to grow, I&#x27;ve used a much better product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be keep using it:-)</li>
            <li>I use it every night and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had wonderful results and stopped wearing mascara on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li>I wish I had taken a picture before,  I noticed more lashes by week 2.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>does anyone else have any more info on this..</li>
            <li>The results have been outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed more lashes, just longer stronger lashes.  </li>
            <li>Our comments here are to better understand the effectiveness claimed by many of the products being solicited.</li>
            <li>I kept using it and within a month or so more, the rest of the eyelashes caught up.  </li>
            <li>PS I never tell anyone about this :)</li>
            <li>do not buy this for sure</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>I asked people which eyebrow looked fuller and everyone was able to choose the eyebrow that I used the product on.  </li>
            <li>This brand and product are phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I hope they never change the formula like many cosmetics do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eyelash products and this one didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think about the fact that I would lose most of my lashes when they were removed.  </li>
            <li>I just know that they look better.  </li>
            <li>If using it for more time produces longer, fuller lashes, I will review this product again.</li>
            <li>and you surely are not convinced it does work either.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It says it on the directions, but you always think you need more than you do.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am satisfied with this product as RapidLash stopped working for me in a month and this has continued to work for me.</li>
            <li>and I will be sure to post updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could see for sure if this product would work or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just order 2 more bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I saw great results in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first product at a salon and spa in Fort Myers and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;ve increased in length about 1/8\\&quot;, which for eyelashes is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I laughed when I saw this product at first.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products and Nutra Luxe MD Beautylash is the best I think on the market.  </li>
            <li>At this point my brows started becoming sparse again.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You can use this fit eyebrow too:-)</li>
            <li>Nutra, my lashes not only grow, they are also darker and fuller; the longest they have grown is 3/4 of an inch, something I am more than happy with given that I have more lashes than I ever did, and none of them is white!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lashes were back and looking good in about 2-3 weeks!</li>
            <li>Not bad at all!  </li>
            <li>lashes b/4 Nutra Lux MD had thinned and fall out easily</li>
            <li>The redness is easily covered up with eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks to notice a difference, and three months later I&#x27;m getting so many comments on how great my lashes are.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend near as much time applying mascara trying to perfect my lashes with the wand.  </li>
            <li>I began removing the fine, unwanted hair immediately but thought how I have to share this experience with those using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way the bottle looks, its very pretty</li>
            <li>you will begin to hesitate a second and look at your lashes and as the weeks go by be very pleased and beyond a doubt see a real significant improvement in length, color, and maybe a bit in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Worth the redness for the fantastic results!</li>
            <li>It does grow my lashes longer and my brows filled in as well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it every day since my lashes and brows were looking filled in (longer) and I was just trying to maintain what I had achieved.  </li>
            <li>For several years I have used and been happy with Rapid Lash by Promaxyl.</li>
            <li>It has made my brows silky and filled in all the bald spots.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing, it really makes your lashes grow and makes people wonder if you are using falsies.</li>
            <li>make sure your eye lids are clean, clean, clean before you apply the Nutra LUXE 3.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer, they curl on their own and are much fuller and even.</li>
            <li>I used as directed each night and honestly didn&#x27;t see much for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I have beautiful long and curly lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s super easy.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see what my lashes will look like in another 2 months.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>well worth it!  </li>
            <li>Be patient, it takes afew weeks to work but its worth it!</li>
            <li>you probably won&#x27;t see a significant change...</li>
            <li>also haven&#x27;t noticed that they are significantly thicker...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the end results</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from a person who I get facials from.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It is WORTH every penny!</li>

            <li>I originally tried this product because I had a gift certificate to a beauty website and it caught my eye.  </li>
            <li>so I started researching economically friendly eyelash enhancers (</li>
            <li>Im excited to see what this does over time</li>
            <li>but this is worth my time!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because a friend had had such great success.</li>
            <li>There were so many positive reviews about this product that I thought, &amp;#34;Hmm, it&#x27;s gotta be good!&amp;#34; It ain&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>70 years of age, I am looking forward to having nice lush lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using their mascara!</li>
            <li>this is pure magic...</li>
            <li>This does miracles for your eyelashes if you do it right!</li>
            <li>were bright red for days.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this item a few years ago, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>By 6 weeks they looked good enough for me to just put one coat of mascara on an leave the house.</li>
            <li>I have also been using it on my eyebrows, but I have not been able to detect much change.</li>
            <li>But is it true.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes got really longer and more volume since I started use this.</li>
            <li>But now I have a full set of lashes to die for.  </li>
            <li>stick with it -- it takes time to see the full results 2.</li>
            <li>-- once your lashes are full, you will want to maintain them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Most of us are real people sharing here and not fakers.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and so convenient to use, much easier than the leading brand.</li>
            <li>Love this product - it really works -</li>
            <li>No bad side effects</li>
            <li>lashes have filled in and I haven&#x27;t really experienced any side effects except a little stinging, but that was it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was lucky I had a coach with first-degree experience.</li>
            <li>But my eyes get super bloodshot</li>
            <li>- VERY easy to apply  - Not messy at all  - See results in a couple of days or weeks  </li>
            <li>I also used on my brows as they were becoming very sparse too.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as much higher priced product available at dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The very first morning that I woke up after using this product the night before my eyes were so sore, bloodshot and irritated.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will never try anything new again.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this product and applied it exactly as it stated.</li>
            <li>when i first got this product i was sooo excited</li>
            <li>That was a first!</li>
            <li>People are always telling me what pretty lashes I have!</li>
            <li>When the bloodshot wasn&#x27;t getting better after the third day, she said it was because I was using too much (I was kind of globbing it on at first in overzealous anticipation).</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I have read, it takes a few weeks to see any results but all I have experienced was itchy eyelids and redness in my eyes from time to time.  </li>
            <li>I have rarely missed a night of using it and there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My brows have filled out a bit more, but have seen the bigger difference with my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>, it totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price because it has lasted over a year</li>
            <li>Am currently only using  twice week with with mascacra , but my lashes look great natural.  </li>
            <li>I had already used it for 6 mos, I really got good results,and wanted to buy a larger size.</li>
            <li>After I used it, my eyes were red, itchy, kind of swollen..</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the bloodshot look...I&#x27;ll be searching for another product.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled since there was such a savings.  </li>
            <li>Wow- worked better than Latisse.  </li>
            <li>but I chose to endure the side effects because it offers such great results.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>but i dont care it is soooo worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth it to give it a try</li>
            <li>Like many women, my lashes had become very sparse as I got older.  </li>
            <li>I wear glasses and my eyelashes are so long they are touching the inside of my lens!</li>
            <li>After I applied it each night to my lashes, I  really haven&#x27;t notice any significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>I am soooooo pissed off right now.</li>
            <li>then right around the 6 week mark</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with the fine, tiny brush.  </li>
            <li>She warned me that my eyes would be kind of red and bloodshot for the first two days, which they were.</li>
            <li>My sister had extensions and mine look so much better and didn&#x27;t cost near as much money as hers did!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was still able to use this product - it will last you 6 months or more - the price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow long natural beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>what kind of mascara I use and it is Nutra Luxe Lash that has made my lashes so long.  </li>
            <li>see that some have been lucky and have gotten the right and real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I could use a little more thickness, but the length is just ridiculously, insanely, beautifully, amazingly fabulous!</li>
            <li>I tried lash extensions, which I loved, but there&#x27;s no comparison to having long lush lashes that are actually your own.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes grew back on their own or from this product</li>
            <li>eyes itched and were kind of gunky the first few times I used it, but if you don&#x27;t use too much, it gets better pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More expensive but great length.</li>
            <li>I used it and it worked thank you very much.</li>
            <li>lashes are very much improved in both length and thickness.  </li>
            <li>I have the most beautiful long healthy almost fake looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>There back to normal but better!</li>
            <li>I myself have definitely seen HUGE results!</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube but nearing the end.</li>
            <li>I tried that &#x27;Lashes in a bottle&#x27;, love that too, but only put it on ONE eye, just to see the difference.  </li>
            <li>(although I first found it at Costco) and started using others.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, it explains all :)</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>but when I ordered it a second time and started using the second tube my eyes would become more and more irritated</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey, I agree.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many different kinds of lash conditioners.</li>
            <li>No lie really!   </li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>First of all this is just my first tube</li>
            <li>and it has been since March which still more left .</li>
            <li>I noticed that the lashes started curling up after the first week.</li>
            <li>The first time when i applied then product my eye looked like i had a week of sleepless nights and didn&#x27;t remove cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I ordered a larger size bottle, which costs more and they sent me the smallest size bottle.</li>
            <li>At first you think nothing is happening and</li>
            <li>I used it every night for the first 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I put it on the first time at night and</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this product at first because it&#x27;s not prescription (which made me doubt its authenticity), but all doubts have faded.</li>
            <li>I was applying it a couple times or more daily.</li>
            <li>but then as you continue to use it, it will become more apparant that your lashes are definitely longer and a bit</li>
            <li>This product works really well!</li>
            <li>I started to use this product for two months, I saw pretty fast effects, my eyelashes were long and nice, then they started to fall off.  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time.</li>
            <li>I used it every night for the first couple months and now just do it 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li>It did sting the first couple times i used it, but now with practice</li>
            <li>This product has done exactly what it said it would.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t itch or burn as it did on her at first, and I have not run out yet, been using for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for months now and it most definitely works!</li>
            <li>Maybe not 100% but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>After the first month I could tell a difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>At first, I did have some burning and irritation after use.  </li>
            <li>I might also try another brand only to see if I can get any more results.  </li>
            <li>I first received it</li>
            <li>She sold it to me for a LOT more than what I currently pay on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about irritation, but I followed the directions exactly and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>But it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li>My lashes are definitely longer, but not thicker (more lashes) than before.</li>
            <li>Very scarry stuff!</li>
            <li>I researched the reviews on amazon (much like you are probably doing now) and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>,I WAS USING THIS TWICE A DAY FOR THE FIRST 6 WEEKS,MORN.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my eyes itched and burned for a day or two before I got used to it.</li>
            <li>But one I started applying from the outside in, the irritation got so much better.</li>
            <li>and I looked kinda funny.</li>
            <li>wow!!!!</li>
            <li>OK, so all my life I&#x27;ve had great thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>How many times have we purchased a product along these lines that promises something somewhat hard to measure and it falls into that category where you cannot say for sure it does not work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend it if you are concerned about unmatched eyelash, but you will be able to actually witness what this product does to you.</li>
            <li>Instead of heeding the reviews that mentioned redness and irritation, I thought I would be fine since I had been using a similar product for years with nothing more than a bit of hyperpigmentation on my upper lids.</li>
            <li>People found it hard to look me in the eyes because my eyes made their own eyes tear just from looking at me!</li>
            <li>I was told about this product by my 40 year old niece when I saw her NEW beautiful, long, lush lashes.</li>
            <li>What prompted me to even read the reviews this time around was because the first bottle I received was the real one bc</li>
            <li>For the price... it is OK, but I would like that my lashes stay long as at the beginning.</li>
            <li>but now they are lovely and long.</li>
            <li>It has really added a lot to the length of my lashes, but unfortunately not a lot to the thickness of them.  </li>
            <li>was good, then I got lazy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to the little blue one for sale out there in the tube....  : )</li>
            <li>I used L&#x27;Oreal for almost a year and it was a little better, but then I tried the NutraLuxeMD and OMG!</li>
            <li>but I plan to send this back to the original company with my complaints, hoping that they will do a better job in the future making a product that can accommodate those with sensitivities.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, as it really does look beautiful when I put a thin layer of mascara on.  </li>
            <li>eyelids are kind of pink-ish, or slightly darker around my lashline now.  </li>
            <li>and my lashes are long, thick, and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of using it nightly my lashes started falling out in large clumps.   </li>
            <li>Certainly did not work for me.</li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;nutraluxe lash\\&quot; in a large all lower-case verdana type font.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
            <li>Not necessarily fuller and does not for sure stimulate any new growth.</li>
            <li>This is my third vial of Nutra LUXE LASH MD because it works just as well as Latisse [which is 3x more expensive].&lt;br /&gt;It does not grow new lashes but really increases length and texture..., and it stimulates growth of sparse brows too.&lt;br /&gt;Applicator</li>
            <li>- If you skip a night or two, it won&#x27;t diminish the results  Cons:  - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)  - Not so effective on eyebrows  </li>
            <li>I tried Nutra Luxe MD, started about three weeks ago, and am totally amazed of the HUGE difference in my lash growth.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this, and after several weeks I see a huge difference in my lash length.  </li>
            <li>my eyelashes have grown so much with this product, within six weeks of use of product.  </li>
            <li>and it is much simpler to apply than the Latisse.</li>
            <li>Now I really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my brows, which have filled in, only in the areas that I needed it to.  </li>
            <li>I really did not think it was working - however after 2 months I started to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I have contacted seller, but don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>VERY noticeable difference within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>These really grow your lashes.</li>
            <li>and it really does work.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied....doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids....    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear mascara as much</li>
            <li>It took me 2 months to notice real results but they were.</li>
            <li>This stuff really work.</li>
            <li>Just be careful on who you order from and make sure your getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results after a whole month of using it.</li>
            <li>Forget Lattise, this is much cheaper and really does work.</li>
            <li>Nutralux makes your lashes way longer but not that much thicker.</li>
            <li>my eyes felt as if they were throbbing, and I felt a great amount of pressure behind both eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am telling you, this product is really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tube lasts much longer than it says.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The gap in one brow has disappeared and both look much fuller.  </li>
            <li>Christmas is coming up thanks</li>
            <li>Lashes are really long,and brows are getting thicker.</li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker, longer and much darker.</li>
            <li>and was very sceptical it will do what it promissed.</li>
            <li>very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;After it</li>
            <li>Thickness, not so much.</li>
            <li>, I had both thicker and MUCH longer lashes than I had ever had.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.  </li>
            <li>People really notice my eyes now</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfid at thaïs product</li>
            <li>it is very performance.  </li>
            <li>Expected more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>lashes have really grown.</li>
            <li>I do feel that there is too much burning in my eyes after each application.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the prescription medicine.</li>
            <li>I think the combo of eye makeup remover and the lash serum was just too much.  </li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The REAL product works like a charm.</li>
            <li>, in terms of fullness and color, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li>It irritates my eyes so much that I cant use it at all</li>
            <li>People ask me all the time if my lashes are real.  </li>
            <li>People are amazed that my lashes are real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It really does lengthen you lashes.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works but it darkens your skin around the eyes a bit.</li>
            <li>They became very sparse.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, now they are thicker and much longer.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tube itself is even that much shadier.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Nutra Luxe Lash really did the job  </li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t pay that much at one time.....</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I read the directions carefully before using to make sure that I used it correctly.  </li>
            <li>But I also applied too much product and started from the inside.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>were it is really noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not even Mascara was making much of a difference.</li>
            <li>As I have been getting older my eye lashes were starting to fall out really easy</li>
            <li>I am now waiting for my second tube.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, honestly, for the price range we are in here (especially)</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I saw the length in my lashes extend and to be honest</li>
            <li>I thought this was just another gimmicky kind of thing.</li>
            <li>There is a slight redness but it is very easy to cover.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are so long and full!</li>
            <li>long full lashes...amazing!</li>
            <li>Wow, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to just put it on every other night now, &amp; will see if that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>lashes are long and strong and almost look like as if Im</li>
            <li>- Quick, simple  - Longer/thicker eyelashes (I think I grew a few more!)  </li>
            <li>Just normal!</li>
            <li>Once you stop using it, the length and density of the eyelashes will go back to original.</li>
            <li>But I defiantly am sure I see a difference due to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Within 6 weeks of daily use, I had a significant improvemt in the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li>If you put too much your eyes are going to burn and it is not worth more anyways.</li>
            <li>Great product.does exactly what it sad.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the lenght is so amazing that just a little mascara does the rest!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and I highly recommend the product to my friends.</li>
            <li>Since I lost my eyelashes due to chemo two years ago, this product has helped my lashes return to better than normal.  </li>
            <li>Takes about 6 months of daily use for full effect.  </li>
            <li>But be aware that if you stop using it, or you remember to use it like once a week, your lashes will return to your natural lenght.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time it took nearly 5 weeks for me to notice anything</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>For every woman who wants strong and long lush lashes.</li>
            <li>more like slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly have been using the Latisse</li>
            <li>Only problem it seems to run out of liquid quickly</li>
            <li>If it worked on my sister who is 8 years older than I, it would have to work on me.  </li>
            <li>These mainly lengthen the lashes, not thicken, but nonetheless it does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>I noticed my eyebrows were dissapearing as I am getting older.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am older</li>
            <li>It seems to be coming in, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended so when my sister&#x27;s eyelashes began to fall out i sent it to her</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would (and have) recommended this highly.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with darker lashes that as I have gotten older were not very long or healthy anymore.  </li>
            <li>you look in the mirror and WOW!!  </li>
            <li>Also, clear discoloration of the lids, they look darker along the lashes line, but I don&#x27;t really mind it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes are.</li>
            <li>once full (62 year old) brows to grow back in.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout or cause any harsh side affects.</li>
            <li>I love this product, unfortunately it is not available in NZ and the manufacturer will not send it here either, but by having it sent to a friend and that friend sending it to me</li>
            <li>I continue to put up with the now occasional irritation because I love having the long lashes.</li>
            <li>Now they are all pretty much the same in length.  </li>
            <li>Maybe use it everyday and see more results than I did.</li>
            <li>my lashes is long an full in just 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>When I started using this product my eyes did burn and itch some which is normal.</li>
            <li>They are so long and full</li>
            <li>once I stopped using my skin was normal)</li>
            <li>but this product for some reason work better on me , i&#x27;m going for round two .</li>
            <li>suppose everyone is different, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you want longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it everynight and the product will last a long time too!</li>
            <li>Had results within 5 days of use...always rubbing left eye and lashes shorter then those on right which is why I purchased.</li>
            <li>Thank god the right side caught up with left side after another month or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every night (not morning and night) and what has worked for me is to use it every night for about two weeks and my lashes become super long, and from then</li>
            <li>this is an amazing product , i never saw my eyelashes like this , they are so long, is a dream eyelashes , i saw results at the 3rd month, and the fisrt 2 weeks my eyes were so red</li>
            <li>I just need to get her a new supply now and then.</li>
            <li>Live the look of my lashes even without mascara</li>
            <li>bunch of new.</li>
            <li>any new hairs will pop in.  </li>
            <li>and I have new ones growing in as well.</li>
            <li>I have slightly Asian eyes with extremely short and light</li>
            <li>my eyes are very irritated red and very dry.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and have NEVER had lashes this long or this full.</li>
            <li>The product left my eyes red and irritated for 4 days straight!!!</li>
            <li>After the second use, I woke up in the middle of the night from a sound sleep, itching my eyes and feeling like I was having a hot flash only in the eye area.</li>
            <li>Great product, have used others much more expensive and this by far works as well if not better.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My upper eyelashes grew so much!  </li>
            <li>My eyes were red and stinging for the first 10 days of use.   </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>I got my first one as a present.</li>
            <li>This might be the first time something has actually worked as advertised...</li>
            <li>5 stars is that it darkened my light brown brows to dark brown.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>shot eyes because I thought that the long eyelashes would make it worth it.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product my eyes would get so red.</li>
            <li>I did have the irritated red eyes for the first 3 or 4 days</li>
            <li>It took a long time...like 4 months, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments about my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li>and wow! I cant say enough about this product, other than how nice it is to finally have purchased something that works!</li>
            <li>you are anything like me, you cannot afford the price of a new car to plump out natural eyelash reality.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to because fortunately my brows are still pretty thick, or</li>
            <li>You just have to be super careful when you wash off your eye makeup...</li>
            <li>for a small investment this product is by far the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to trash people&#x27;s positive experiences only because yours was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using it on the other eyebrow and now after some time both my eyebrows match and are both full.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty slight at first,</li>
            <li>The first few days of using this product my eyes burned and were sensitive to light; however, by the third day side effects were gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I have read the other positive reviews about this product, but I would be very cautious.</li>
            <li>It works really great like revitalash but the problem with this product on me; It makes my eyes red and scary...</li>
            <li>Looking at the email they are writing me from it is clear that they have nothing to do with the official distributor.</li>
            <li>if you have moderately sensitive eyes, you can&#x27;t use them on eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough.  </li>
            <li>and when I don&#x27;t have any mascara they are all so naturally</li>
            <li>My lashes have gone from short &amp; sparse to fuller and much lingers.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on once before bed time and have had no issues so far.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a big improvement in my lashes, but my eyebrows are much improved.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely, and have not expereiced any problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>They even marked the bottle as 4.5mL.  </li>
            <li>I been using for 3 months now my lashes are long and pretty ..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if they are thicker but they are definitely longer.  </li>
            <li>By 6 weeks my eyelashes were much longer and starting to thicken also.  </li>
            <li>However I am still using it on my eye brows, too early to determine results.</li>
            <li>So far my eyelashes have shown length.</li>
            <li>No irritation or problems from any of us and my sister has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But the lashes are so long, my friend pulled on them just to see if they were real!</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of days but had to stop because my eyelid became very sore and red.  </li>
            <li>naturally...</li>
            <li>As a young professional I can&#x27;t afford latise) anyways after searching the web for a couple hours I came across nutra luxe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just naturally</li>
            <li>Lashes completely even now and both sides longer.</li>
            <li>I tried the Nutra Luxe Lash MD from amazon and used it only on one eyebrow to really test the benefits.  </li>
            <li>but so far I see no difference.</li>
            <li>My eyes have been red and irritated all day since i started using this product , cant really say if it makes your lashes grow .I</li>
            <li>I gave this product a \\&quot;ho humm\\&quot; review a few months back: it seemed better somehow from a \\&quot;dud\\</li>
            <li>I recommend spending a few dollars more and actually buy a product that works, knock</li>
            <li>The first few days, it did sting, but it seemed that the LESS I tried to re-cover my lid, the better.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers I received counterfeit product, I had an adverse reaction my eyes turned blood shot red and the entire eye area eyelids, under eyes etc.</li>
            <li>tried to read as many reviews as possible, and if you want to be cautious next time you buy something off amazon, look for reviews of certified buyers and then check their reviews to see if they review other things/brands.</li>
            <li>this has helped my eyelashs to grown longer, not as good as the one brooke shields uses, but also less than half the price, and have used this for about seven months now, two containers, and am on my third one.</li>
            <li>After about a few days of consistent use her lashes are for sure longer and a little thicker.</li>
            <li>They really look long and lush when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li>I have seen a little extra length in the farthest corners of my lashes but nothing that anyone would notice and certainly not enough for me to spend more money on a product like this.</li>
            <li>I did experience morning redness around my eyes for the first week, but have found if I apply LuxeLash AFTER I have closed my eyes at bedtime, it is eliminates</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear mascara for almost a week until my eyes were back to normal.</li>
            <li>You must keep using it or your eyelashes go back to normal.  </li>
            <li>And must I add that they stayed that way for {7} whole days, and Visine would not clear it up.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the new lashes come in growing in every direction, so you&#x27;d definitely need mascara (clear or tinted) to train the new growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only made my lashes slightly darker, but significantly longer, feathery and curled at the tips, as well as fuller.  </li>
            <li>I will say I did have pretty long eyelashes to start, but this has definitely helped them grow.  </li>
            <li>A friend purchased this at the same time I did, however her eyes are very sensitive to a number of products.  </li>
            <li>Few month later I noticed that my new eye lashes are not as long and strong anymore.</li>
            <li>Was excited to receive the nutraluxe lash md from amazon yesterday, however...........  Last night I put the product on, felt a little burning sensation and immediately flushed my eyes with water.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive products that have given the exact same results.</li>
            <li>I started to see the new lashes growing in a little thicker an a few more.</li>
            <li>My eyes were also very photo sensitive and hurt when exposed to light (felt actual pain in my eyes and behind them).  </li>
            <li>Anyways it&#x27;s fun to change your image a little</li>
            <li>/&gt;BEWARE:  I having been purchasing from this particular seller and the last purchase I made in June 2014, I noticed the container did not look like the current one I have but still decided to use.</li>
            <li>As someone of Asian decent I&#x27;ve been bestowed with short, downwards-pointing stick-straight lashes, since birth.</li>
            <li>good product same effect of the other expensive bran, this one is really affordable</li>
            <li>But my lashes are very thick now for sure.</li>
            <li>Before they were short and straight, now they are long and curly.</li>
            <li>My bottom lashes are not even visible an barely there with mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am age 55 and my lashes started falling out (bare spots) and the length was no longer there.  </li>
            <li>and my lashes have not only nearly doubled in length, but they are also thicker and they CURL GLORIOUSLY.</li>
            <li>ONLY buy NUTRALUXE LASH MD from authorized resellers, certified by NUTRALUX LASH MD or directly from us the Manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Later  in the evening I developed a headache</li>
            <li>never expected to have this reaction.  </li>
            <li>I apply it at night and the next day, my eyes would be red the entire day so much</li>
            <li>My eyelids were very red and my eyes were completely bloodshot.  </li>
            <li>My eye lashes are naturally barely visible.</li>
            <li>This product really helped my eyelashes grow faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>Keeping this secret for sure</li>
            <li>Crazy good product.  </li>
            <li>Everyone remarks on how great they look and they usually think I have put on false lashes.</li>
            <li>I mean I REALLY have very long and full lashes.</li>
            <li>Some lashes would be very long and others would be my normal length.  </li>
            <li>the first day and a black staining around my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I am beginning to think I would just be better off applying false eyelashes during the times that I want to sport more dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month or so, some of my friends asked me what happened to my right eyelash because it looked half the length of the left side.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this particular tube long enough for it to have had time to work</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription and none of them really worked.  </li>
            <li>Much slower results on brows but hair growing in, will see if it turns into something other than fuzz.  </li>
            <li>I have long lush lashes!</li>
            <li>have sensitive eyes so for me it is really important to apply a small amount of product and be careful not to touch the skin, just the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>- they got long fast, and I was worried that they would get too long.  </li>
            <li>When you close your eyes to sleep, it can sting if it&#x27;s not dry.  </li>
            <li>a little irritation at first, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>At first it irritated my eyes a little</li>
            <li>I purchased this item the ending of August; at first I was a little reluctant</li>
            <li>While Revitalash made my lashes grow very long ( over 1&amp;#34; ),  I never saw fuller or darker lashes, so I had three very long lashes, of which one would be white (LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works, but my eyes turn so red that looks like I smoked something, and also they get very dry inside that I have to constantly  used drops for it,so I quit using it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have natural dark and long eyelashes without the use of mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that were similar to this, but after about a week I could see a real difference in my eyelashes,  </li>
            <li>may cause red, not pink, eye.</li>
            <li>I was starting to look so bare</li>
            <li>They are so long and lush.  </li>
            <li>No long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>But that price is already worth a few cm longer on my lashes!</li>
            <li>When I was young they were black, now they&#x27;re a medium brown and the new lash growth is medium brown, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do not use so much mascara as before and do not spend half an hour trying to make my lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and lush like they were when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>had hardly no side effects other than gooey stuff in my eye, like when you wake up from sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>Nutra Luxe eyelash conditioner may be a little pricey, but it really work.</li>
            <li>So right now I have the length (as in years past) and no bare spots.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> some people don&#x27;t know why I look so great until I explain to them</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m getting great results.  </li>
            <li> My sister &amp; daughter also use this with great results.</li>
            <li> which was great</li>
            <li> I am really happy that I choose it.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for 4 weeks with great results&lt;br /&gt;but would apply this in daytime instead of nighttime to avoid reddish</li>
            <li> I love the price!!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> People ask me all the time what I am doing to my lashes and I very nicely say &amp;</li>
            <li> Mascara goes on very nicely and my lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Then my mom told me that my aunt was using this product and could not believe how amazing her eyelashes looked!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> &amp; now I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara &amp; still feel real confident.  </li>
            <li> but with no pain, i recomend this product is amazing and great</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning to take my dogs out, and the bright sun literally made my eyes and head throb--</li>
            <li> all the reviews seemed good.</li>
            <li> These things keep my fiance&#x27;s eyelashes looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and up until now I&#x27;ve loved it.</li>
            <li> This product is GOOD.  </li>
            <li> in 5 weeks my lashes are good.</li>
            <li> My co-worker has been using this a month longer than I have and her lashes look as good</li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t be good for your eyes</li>
            <li> Maybe its a good product -I</li>
            <li> Ive heard a lot of good things havent seen results yet</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this product did work for me.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with Nutra Luxe Lash MD and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
            <li> I am not prepared to buy the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot; yet with the triple digit price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It had good reviews and was cheaper</li>
            <li> By closer look I realized that those darker patches were indeed very fine hairs growing on the skin of the lower corners of my eyes!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited because I heard great things about this product.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not, no problem, because I just love the results!</li>
            <li> So glad I took the leap of faith and tried this!</li>
            <li> Love my lashes!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> but I have used this brand before and found it most successful.</li>

            <li> Amazing result on my lash and brow.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is a great price and provides fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Strictly a nighttime use, but using continuously the results are just amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product...</li>
            <li> This is amazing</li>
            <li> used to have to HAVE some kind of &#x27;eyebrow darkening&#x27; make up.</li>
            <li> You honestly couldn&#x27;t tell, unless I kept coating the Lashes in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m really thrilled.  </li>
            <li> These work as well as the perscription kind.</li>
            <li> It is an honorably, honestly marketed product that lives up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am impressed, I really</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honest.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I will be honest with you.</li>
            <li> They have gotten sparse and they don&#x27;t curl up very easy.</li>
            <li> It is a great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Works great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Growing out my own makes them look more fabulouse then</li>
            <li> pretty lol</li>
            <li> Thé combinaition for quality versus the prince is very fantastic.</li>
            <li> Within three weeks, saw a huge difference.. now, in September, my lashes touch my eyebrows!  </li>
            <li> I am not 100% sure it is safe though.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from reputable hair an cosmetics company from Cal.</li>
            <li> Ok, even without mascara</li>
            <li> that they touched my top lid after I did that.</li>
            <li> One swipe of the brush into the vial, covers both top lids, like you&#x27;re putting on liquid eye liner.  </li>
            <li> Beautylash MD seems to be working its magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash and then switched to this product because it lasted longer and seemed a better value.  </li>
            <li> This product is going to be my all around Christmas gift for my girlfriends!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love LOVE LOVVE</li>
            <li> Love the results....</li>
            <li> This is way better than all those extension mascaras.</li>
            <li> so I can put my eyebrow pencil on better.</li>
            <li> I love Nutra Luxe Lash MD.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it, so I obviously was happy with the product and didnt need to read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I came online this morning and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a year or more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more growth in the time to come and I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;P.s.</li>
            <li> It is pricey if purchased in the stores but is more affordable on line</li>
            <li> I have had no side effects, but have had friends who have said it irritates their eyes, but more friends like myself who have not been adversely effected at all.  </li>
            <li> you wake up in a week and magically look like Betty Davis eyes in her twenties?</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this</li>
            <li> ,, I love this products!&lt;br /&gt;U</li>
            <li> but I have been using it for over a year now and still love the results.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer and there are more of them.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also I have two daughters who love it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is potent.  </li>
            <li> im going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how many compliments my lashes get.</li>
            <li> I have so many comments on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, and I will continue buying and using this.</li>
            <li> lashes are way better than they used to be, I did try the product on my brows but that didn&#x27;t work as in my youth</li>
            <li> I guess my eyes are more senstive.  </li>
            <li> wonder if the people who have had great results from this product received the counterfeit bottle or the real bottle.....</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I realized that if I took off my eye makeup at night and then waited a while before using the Nutra Luxe, the irritation subsided mostly.  </li>
            <li> and I will buy more.  </li>
            <li> Bern using this for 2 years, i get soooo many complements about my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> While Nutra LUXE LASH MD does help your lashes to grow, I&#x27;ve used a much better product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure it will work well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be keep using it:-)</li>
            <li> I use it every night and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful results and stopped wearing mascara on my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a picture before,  I noticed more lashes by week 2.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> does anyone else have any more info on this..</li>
            <li> The results have been outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed more lashes, just longer stronger lashes.  </li>
            <li> Our comments here are to better understand the effectiveness claimed by many of the products being solicited.</li>
            <li> I kept using it and within a month or so more, the rest of the eyelashes caught up.  </li>
            <li> PS I never tell anyone about this :)</li>
            <li> do not buy this for sure</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I asked people which eyebrow looked fuller and everyone was able to choose the eyebrow that I used the product on.  </li>
            <li> This brand and product are phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I hope they never change the formula like many cosmetics do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyelash products and this one didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think about the fact that I would lose most of my lashes when they were removed.  </li>
            <li> I just know that they look better.  </li>
            <li> If using it for more time produces longer, fuller lashes, I will review this product again.</li>
            <li> and you surely are not convinced it does work either.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It says it on the directions, but you always think you need more than you do.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am satisfied with this product as RapidLash stopped working for me in a month and this has continued to work for me.</li>
            <li> and I will be sure to post updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could see for sure if this product would work or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just order 2 more bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I saw great results in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first product at a salon and spa in Fort Myers and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;ve increased in length about 1/8\\&quot;, which for eyelashes is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I laughed when I saw this product at first.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products and Nutra Luxe MD Beautylash is the best I think on the market.  </li>
            <li> At this point my brows started becoming sparse again.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You can use this fit eyebrow too:-)</li>
            <li> Nutra, my lashes not only grow, they are also darker and fuller; the longest they have grown is 3/4 of an inch, something I am more than happy with given that I have more lashes than I ever did, and none of them is white!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lashes were back and looking good in about 2-3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Not bad at all!  </li>
            <li> lashes b/4 Nutra Lux MD had thinned and fall out easily</li>
            <li> The redness is easily covered up with eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks to notice a difference, and three months later I&#x27;m getting so many comments on how great my lashes are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend near as much time applying mascara trying to perfect my lashes with the wand.  </li>
            <li> I began removing the fine, unwanted hair immediately but thought how I have to share this experience with those using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way the bottle looks, its very pretty</li>
            <li> you will begin to hesitate a second and look at your lashes and as the weeks go by be very pleased and beyond a doubt see a real significant improvement in length, color, and maybe a bit in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Worth the redness for the fantastic results!</li>
            <li> It does grow my lashes longer and my brows filled in as well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it every day since my lashes and brows were looking filled in (longer) and I was just trying to maintain what I had achieved.  </li>
            <li> For several years I have used and been happy with Rapid Lash by Promaxyl.</li>
            <li> It has made my brows silky and filled in all the bald spots.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing, it really makes your lashes grow and makes people wonder if you are using falsies.</li>
            <li> make sure your eye lids are clean, clean, clean before you apply the Nutra LUXE 3.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, they curl on their own and are much fuller and even.</li>
            <li> I used as directed each night and honestly didn&#x27;t see much for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I have beautiful long and curly lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s super easy.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see what my lashes will look like in another 2 months.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> well worth it!  </li>
            <li> Be patient, it takes afew weeks to work but its worth it!</li>
            <li> you probably won&#x27;t see a significant change...</li>
            <li> also haven&#x27;t noticed that they are significantly thicker...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the end results</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from a person who I get facials from.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> It is WORTH every penny!</li>
            <li> Items must be returned in original condition and original packaging (manufacturer&#x27;s box, plastic bags, etc) accompanied by receipt or proof of purchase.</li>
            <li> Please note that the original and return shipping and handling charges will NOT be refunded or reimbursed under any circumstances.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I had a gift certificate to a beauty website and it caught my eye.  </li>
            <li> so I started researching economically friendly eyelash enhancers (</li>
            <li> Im excited to see what this does over time</li>
            <li> but this is worth my time!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because a friend had had such great success.</li>
            <li> There were so many positive reviews about this product that I thought, &amp;#34;Hmm, it&#x27;s gotta be good!&amp;#34; It ain&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> 70 years of age, I am looking forward to having nice lush lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using their mascara!</li>
            <li> this is pure magic...</li>
            <li> This does miracles for your eyelashes if you do it right!</li>
            <li> were bright red for days.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this item a few years ago, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> By 6 weeks they looked good enough for me to just put one coat of mascara on an leave the house.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my eyebrows, but I have not been able to detect much change.</li>
            <li> But is it true.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes got really longer and more volume since I started use this.</li>
            <li> But now I have a full set of lashes to die for.  </li>
            <li> stick with it -- it takes time to see the full results 2.</li>
            <li> -- once your lashes are full, you will want to maintain them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may return the item(s) to us within 30 days of your purchase for a full refund or exchange.</li>
            <li> Most of us are real people sharing here and not fakers.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and so convenient to use, much easier than the leading brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it really works -</li>
            <li> No bad side effects</li>
            <li> lashes have filled in and I haven&#x27;t really experienced any side effects except a little stinging, but that was it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was lucky I had a coach with first-degree experience.</li>
            <li> But my eyes get super bloodshot</li>
            <li> - VERY easy to apply  - Not messy at all  - See results in a couple of days or weeks  </li>
            <li> I also used on my brows as they were becoming very sparse too.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as much higher priced product available at dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The very first morning that I woke up after using this product the night before my eyes were so sore, bloodshot and irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will never try anything new again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product and applied it exactly as it stated.</li>
            <li> when i first got this product i was sooo excited</li>
            <li> That was a first!</li>
            <li> People are always telling me what pretty lashes I have!</li>
            <li> When the bloodshot wasn&#x27;t getting better after the third day, she said it was because I was using too much (I was kind of globbing it on at first in overzealous anticipation).</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I have read, it takes a few weeks to see any results but all I have experienced was itchy eyelids and redness in my eyes from time to time.  </li>
            <li> I have rarely missed a night of using it and there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My brows have filled out a bit more, but have seen the bigger difference with my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> , it totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price because it has lasted over a year</li>
            <li> Am currently only using  twice week with with mascacra , but my lashes look great natural.  </li>
            <li> I had already used it for 6 mos, I really got good results,and wanted to buy a larger size.</li>
            <li> After I used it, my eyes were red, itchy, kind of swollen..</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the bloodshot look...I&#x27;ll be searching for another product.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled since there was such a savings.  </li>
            <li> Wow- worked better than Latisse.  </li>
            <li> but I chose to endure the side effects because it offers such great results.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> but i dont care it is soooo worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth it to give it a try</li>
            <li> Like many women, my lashes had become very sparse as I got older.  </li>
            <li> I wear glasses and my eyelashes are so long they are touching the inside of my lens!</li>
            <li> After I applied it each night to my lashes, I  really haven&#x27;t notice any significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> I am soooooo pissed off right now.</li>
            <li> then right around the 6 week mark</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply with the fine, tiny brush.  </li>
            <li> She warned me that my eyes would be kind of red and bloodshot for the first two days, which they were.</li>
            <li> My sister had extensions and mine look so much better and didn&#x27;t cost near as much money as hers did!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was still able to use this product - it will last you 6 months or more - the price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow long natural beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> what kind of mascara I use and it is Nutra Luxe Lash that has made my lashes so long.  </li>
            <li> see that some have been lucky and have gotten the right and real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I could use a little more thickness, but the length is just ridiculously, insanely, beautifully, amazingly fabulous!</li>
            <li> I tried lash extensions, which I loved, but there&#x27;s no comparison to having long lush lashes that are actually your own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes grew back on their own or from this product</li>
            <li> eyes itched and were kind of gunky the first few times I used it, but if you don&#x27;t use too much, it gets better pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More expensive but great length.</li>
            <li> I used it and it worked thank you very much.</li>
            <li> lashes are very much improved in both length and thickness.  </li>
            <li> I have the most beautiful long healthy almost fake looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> There back to normal but better!</li>
            <li> I myself have definitely seen HUGE results!</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube but nearing the end.</li>
            <li> I tried that &#x27;Lashes in a bottle&#x27;, love that too, but only put it on ONE eye, just to see the difference.  </li>
            <li> (although I first found it at Costco) and started using others.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, it explains all :)</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> but when I ordered it a second time and started using the second tube my eyes would become more and more irritated</li>
            <li> Pretty pricey, I agree.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many different kinds of lash conditioners.</li>
            <li> No lie really!   </li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> First of all this is just my first tube</li>
            <li> and it has been since March which still more left .</li>
            <li> I noticed that the lashes started curling up after the first week.</li>
            <li> The first time when i applied then product my eye looked like i had a week of sleepless nights and didn&#x27;t remove cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I ordered a larger size bottle, which costs more and they sent me the smallest size bottle.</li>
            <li> At first you think nothing is happening and</li>
            <li> I used it every night for the first 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I put it on the first time at night and</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product at first because it&#x27;s not prescription (which made me doubt its authenticity), but all doubts have faded.</li>
            <li> I was applying it a couple times or more daily.</li>
            <li> but then as you continue to use it, it will become more apparant that your lashes are definitely longer and a bit</li>
            <li> This product works really well!</li>
            <li> I started to use this product for two months, I saw pretty fast effects, my eyelashes were long and nice, then they started to fall off.  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time.</li>
            <li> I used it every night for the first couple months and now just do it 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li> It did sting the first couple times i used it, but now with practice</li>
            <li> This product has done exactly what it said it would.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t itch or burn as it did on her at first, and I have not run out yet, been using for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months now and it most definitely works!</li>
            <li> Maybe not 100% but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> After the first month I could tell a difference in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> At first, I did have some burning and irritation after use.  </li>
            <li> I might also try another brand only to see if I can get any more results.  </li>
            <li> I first received it</li>
            <li> She sold it to me for a LOT more than what I currently pay on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about irritation, but I followed the directions exactly and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> But it really WORKS!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are definitely longer, but not thicker (more lashes) than before.</li>
            <li> Very scarry stuff!</li>
            <li> I researched the reviews on amazon (much like you are probably doing now) and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> ,I WAS USING THIS TWICE A DAY FOR THE FIRST 6 WEEKS,MORN.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my eyes itched and burned for a day or two before I got used to it.</li>
            <li> But one I started applying from the outside in, the irritation got so much better.</li>
            <li> and I looked kinda funny.</li>
            <li> wow!!!!</li>
            <li> OK, so all my life I&#x27;ve had great thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> How many times have we purchased a product along these lines that promises something somewhat hard to measure and it falls into that category where you cannot say for sure it does not work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend it if you are concerned about unmatched eyelash, but you will be able to actually witness what this product does to you.</li>
            <li> Instead of heeding the reviews that mentioned redness and irritation, I thought I would be fine since I had been using a similar product for years with nothing more than a bit of hyperpigmentation on my upper lids.</li>
            <li> People found it hard to look me in the eyes because my eyes made their own eyes tear just from looking at me!</li>
            <li> I was told about this product by my 40 year old niece when I saw her NEW beautiful, long, lush lashes.</li>
            <li> What prompted me to even read the reviews this time around was because the first bottle I received was the real one bc</li>
            <li> For the price... it is OK, but I would like that my lashes stay long as at the beginning.</li>
            <li> but now they are lovely and long.</li>
            <li> It has really added a lot to the length of my lashes, but unfortunately not a lot to the thickness of them.  </li>
            <li> was good, then I got lazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to the little blue one for sale out there in the tube....  : )</li>
            <li> I used L&#x27;Oreal for almost a year and it was a little better, but then I tried the NutraLuxeMD and OMG!</li>
            <li> but I plan to send this back to the original company with my complaints, hoping that they will do a better job in the future making a product that can accommodate those with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, as it really does look beautiful when I put a thin layer of mascara on.  </li>
            <li> eyelids are kind of pink-ish, or slightly darker around my lashline now.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes are long, thick, and beautiful!  </li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of using it nightly my lashes started falling out in large clumps.   </li>
            <li> Certainly did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;nutraluxe lash\\&quot; in a large all lower-case verdana type font.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
            <li> Not necessarily fuller and does not for sure stimulate any new growth.</li>
            <li> This is my third vial of Nutra LUXE LASH MD because it works just as well as Latisse [which is 3x more expensive].&lt;br /&gt;It does not grow new lashes but really increases length and texture..., and it stimulates growth of sparse brows too.&lt;br /&gt;Applicator</li>
            <li> - If you skip a night or two, it won&#x27;t diminish the results  Cons:  - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)  - Not so effective on eyebrows  </li>
            <li> I tried Nutra Luxe MD, started about three weeks ago, and am totally amazed of the HUGE difference in my lash growth.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, and after several weeks I see a huge difference in my lash length.  </li>
            <li> my eyelashes have grown so much with this product, within six weeks of use of product.  </li>
            <li> and it is much simpler to apply than the Latisse.</li>
            <li> Now I really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my brows, which have filled in, only in the areas that I needed it to.  </li>
            <li> I really did not think it was working - however after 2 months I started to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have contacted seller, but don&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> VERY noticeable difference within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> These really grow your lashes.</li>
            <li> and it really does work.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied....doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids....    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear mascara as much</li>
            <li> It took me 2 months to notice real results but they were.</li>
            <li> This stuff really work.</li>
            <li> Just be careful on who you order from and make sure your getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after a whole month of using it.</li>
            <li> Forget Lattise, this is much cheaper and really does work.</li>
            <li> Nutralux makes your lashes way longer but not that much thicker.</li>
            <li> my eyes felt as if they were throbbing, and I felt a great amount of pressure behind both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am telling you, this product is really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tube lasts much longer than it says.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The gap in one brow has disappeared and both look much fuller.  </li>
            <li> Christmas is coming up thanks</li>
            <li> Lashes are really long,and brows are getting thicker.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker, longer and much darker.</li>
            <li> and was very sceptical it will do what it promissed.</li>
            <li> very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;After it</li>
            <li> Thickness, not so much.</li>
            <li> , I had both thicker and MUCH longer lashes than I had ever had.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  </li>
            <li> People really notice my eyes now</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfid at thaïs product</li>
            <li> it is very performance.  </li>
            <li> Expected more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> lashes have really grown.</li>
            <li> I do feel that there is too much burning in my eyes after each application.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the prescription medicine.</li>
            <li> I think the combo of eye makeup remover and the lash serum was just too much.  </li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The REAL product works like a charm.</li>
            <li> , in terms of fullness and color, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes so much that I cant use it at all</li>
            <li> People ask me all the time if my lashes are real.  </li>
            <li> People are amazed that my lashes are real.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It really does lengthen you lashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but it darkens your skin around the eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> They became very sparse.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, now they are thicker and much longer.  </li>
            <li> Product works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube itself is even that much shadier.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Nutra Luxe Lash really did the job  </li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t pay that much at one time.....</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully before using to make sure that I used it correctly.  </li>
            <li> But I also applied too much product and started from the inside.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> were it is really noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not even Mascara was making much of a difference.</li>
            <li> As I have been getting older my eye lashes were starting to fall out really easy</li>
            <li> I am now waiting for my second tube.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, honestly, for the price range we are in here (especially)</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I saw the length in my lashes extend and to be honest</li>
            <li> I thought this was just another gimmicky kind of thing.</li>
            <li> There is a slight redness but it is very easy to cover.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are so long and full!</li>
            <li> long full lashes...amazing!</li>
            <li> Wow, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to just put it on every other night now, &amp; will see if that&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> lashes are long and strong and almost look like as if Im</li>
            <li> - Quick, simple  - Longer/thicker eyelashes (I think I grew a few more!)  </li>
            <li> Just normal!</li>
            <li> Once you stop using it, the length and density of the eyelashes will go back to original.</li>
            <li> But I defiantly am sure I see a difference due to this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Within 6 weeks of daily use, I had a significant improvemt in the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> If you put too much your eyes are going to burn and it is not worth more anyways.</li>
            <li> Great product.does exactly what it sad.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the lenght is so amazing that just a little mascara does the rest!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and I highly recommend the product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Since I lost my eyelashes due to chemo two years ago, this product has helped my lashes return to better than normal.  </li>
            <li> Takes about 6 months of daily use for full effect.  </li>
            <li> But be aware that if you stop using it, or you remember to use it like once a week, your lashes will return to your natural lenght.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time it took nearly 5 weeks for me to notice anything</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> For every woman who wants strong and long lush lashes.</li>
            <li> more like slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly have been using the Latisse</li>
            <li> Only problem it seems to run out of liquid quickly</li>
            <li> If it worked on my sister who is 8 years older than I, it would have to work on me.  </li>
            <li> These mainly lengthen the lashes, not thicken, but nonetheless it does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyebrows were dissapearing as I am getting older.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am older</li>
            <li> It seems to be coming in, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended so when my sister&#x27;s eyelashes began to fall out i sent it to her</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would (and have) recommended this highly.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with darker lashes that as I have gotten older were not very long or healthy anymore.  </li>
            <li> you look in the mirror and WOW!!  </li>
            <li> Also, clear discoloration of the lids, they look darker along the lashes line, but I don&#x27;t really mind it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes are.</li>
            <li> once full (62 year old) brows to grow back in.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout or cause any harsh side affects.</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately it is not available in NZ and the manufacturer will not send it here either, but by having it sent to a friend and that friend sending it to me</li>
            <li> I continue to put up with the now occasional irritation because I love having the long lashes.</li>
            <li> Now they are all pretty much the same in length.  </li>
            <li> Maybe use it everyday and see more results than I did.</li>
            <li> my lashes is long an full in just 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product my eyes did burn and itch some which is normal.</li>
            <li> They are so long and full</li>
            <li> once I stopped using my skin was normal)</li>
            <li> but this product for some reason work better on me , i&#x27;m going for round two .</li>
            <li> suppose everyone is different, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you want longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it everynight and the product will last a long time too!</li>
            <li> Had results within 5 days of use...always rubbing left eye and lashes shorter then those on right which is why I purchased.</li>
            <li> Thank god the right side caught up with left side after another month or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every night (not morning and night) and what has worked for me is to use it every night for about two weeks and my lashes become super long, and from then</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product , i never saw my eyelashes like this , they are so long, is a dream eyelashes , i saw results at the 3rd month, and the fisrt 2 weeks my eyes were so red</li>

            <li> I have slightly Asian eyes with extremely short and light</li>
            <li> my eyes are very irritated red and very dry.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have NEVER had lashes this long or this full.</li>
            <li> The product left my eyes red and irritated for 4 days straight!!!</li>
            <li> After the second use, I woke up in the middle of the night from a sound sleep, itching my eyes and feeling like I was having a hot flash only in the eye area.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used others much more expensive and this by far works as well if not better.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My upper eyelashes grew so much!  </li>
            <li> My eyes were red and stinging for the first 10 days of use.   </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> I got my first one as a present.</li>
            <li> This might be the first time something has actually worked as advertised...</li>
            <li> 5 stars is that it darkened my light brown brows to dark brown.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> shot eyes because I thought that the long eyelashes would make it worth it.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product my eyes would get so red.</li>
            <li> I did have the irritated red eyes for the first 3 or 4 days</li>
            <li> It took a long time...like 4 months, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments about my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> and wow! I cant say enough about this product, other than how nice it is to finally have purchased something that works!</li>
            <li> you are anything like me, you cannot afford the price of a new car to plump out natural eyelash reality.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to because fortunately my brows are still pretty thick, or</li>
            <li> You just have to be super careful when you wash off your eye makeup...</li>
            <li> for a small investment this product is by far the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to trash people&#x27;s positive experiences only because yours was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using it on the other eyebrow and now after some time both my eyebrows match and are both full.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty slight at first,</li>
            <li> The first few days of using this product my eyes burned and were sensitive to light; however, by the third day side effects were gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have read the other positive reviews about this product, but I would be very cautious.</li>
            <li> It works really great like revitalash but the problem with this product on me; It makes my eyes red and scary...</li>
            <li> Looking at the email they are writing me from it is clear that they have nothing to do with the official distributor.</li>
            <li> if you have moderately sensitive eyes, you can&#x27;t use them on eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough.  </li>
            <li> and when I don&#x27;t have any mascara they are all so naturally</li>
            <li> My lashes have gone from short &amp; sparse to fuller and much lingers.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on once before bed time and have had no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big improvement in my lashes, but my eyebrows are much improved.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely, and have not expereiced any problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> They even marked the bottle as 4.5mL.  </li>
            <li> I been using for 3 months now my lashes are long and pretty ..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if they are thicker but they are definitely longer.  </li>
            <li> By 6 weeks my eyelashes were much longer and starting to thicken also.  </li>
            <li> However I am still using it on my eye brows, too early to determine results.</li>
            <li> So far my eyelashes have shown length.</li>
            <li> No irritation or problems from any of us and my sister has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But the lashes are so long, my friend pulled on them just to see if they were real!</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of days but had to stop because my eyelid became very sore and red.  </li>
            <li> naturally...</li>
            <li> As a young professional I can&#x27;t afford latise) anyways after searching the web for a couple hours I came across nutra luxe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just naturally</li>
            <li> Lashes completely even now and both sides longer.</li>
            <li> I tried the Nutra Luxe Lash MD from amazon and used it only on one eyebrow to really test the benefits.  </li>
            <li> but so far I see no difference.</li>
            <li> My eyes have been red and irritated all day since i started using this product , cant really say if it makes your lashes grow .I</li>
            <li> I gave this product a \\&quot;ho humm\\&quot; review a few months back: it seemed better somehow from a \\&quot;dud\\</li>
            <li> I recommend spending a few dollars more and actually buy a product that works, knock</li>
            <li> The first few days, it did sting, but it seemed that the LESS I tried to re-cover my lid, the better.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I received counterfeit product, I had an adverse reaction my eyes turned blood shot red and the entire eye area eyelids, under eyes etc.</li>
            <li> tried to read as many reviews as possible, and if you want to be cautious next time you buy something off amazon, look for reviews of certified buyers and then check their reviews to see if they review other things/brands.</li>
            <li> this has helped my eyelashs to grown longer, not as good as the one brooke shields uses, but also less than half the price, and have used this for about seven months now, two containers, and am on my third one.</li>
            <li> After about a few days of consistent use her lashes are for sure longer and a little thicker.</li>
            <li> They really look long and lush when I wear mascara.</li>
            <li> I have seen a little extra length in the farthest corners of my lashes but nothing that anyone would notice and certainly not enough for me to spend more money on a product like this.</li>
            <li> I did experience morning redness around my eyes for the first week, but have found if I apply LuxeLash AFTER I have closed my eyes at bedtime, it is eliminates</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear mascara for almost a week until my eyes were back to normal.</li>
            <li> You must keep using it or your eyelashes go back to normal.  </li>
            <li> And must I add that they stayed that way for {7} whole days, and Visine would not clear it up.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the new lashes come in growing in every direction, so you&#x27;d definitely need mascara (clear or tinted) to train the new growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only made my lashes slightly darker, but significantly longer, feathery and curled at the tips, as well as fuller.  </li>
            <li> I will say I did have pretty long eyelashes to start, but this has definitely helped them grow.  </li>
            <li> A friend purchased this at the same time I did, however her eyes are very sensitive to a number of products.  </li>
            <li> Few month later I noticed that my new eye lashes are not as long and strong anymore.</li>
            <li> Was excited to receive the nutraluxe lash md from amazon yesterday, however...........  Last night I put the product on, felt a little burning sensation and immediately flushed my eyes with water.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products that have given the exact same results.</li>
            <li> I started to see the new lashes growing in a little thicker an a few more.</li>
            <li> My eyes were also very photo sensitive and hurt when exposed to light (felt actual pain in my eyes and behind them).  </li>
            <li> Anyways it&#x27;s fun to change your image a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE:  I having been purchasing from this particular seller and the last purchase I made in June 2014, I noticed the container did not look like the current one I have but still decided to use.</li>
            <li> As someone of Asian decent I&#x27;ve been bestowed with short, downwards-pointing stick-straight lashes, since birth.</li>
            <li> good product same effect of the other expensive bran, this one is really affordable</li>
            <li> But my lashes are very thick now for sure.</li>
            <li> Before they were short and straight, now they are long and curly.</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes are not even visible an barely there with mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am age 55 and my lashes started falling out (bare spots) and the length was no longer there.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes have not only nearly doubled in length, but they are also thicker and they CURL GLORIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> ONLY buy NUTRALUXE LASH MD from authorized resellers, certified by NUTRALUX LASH MD or directly from us the Manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Later  in the evening I developed a headache</li>
            <li> never expected to have this reaction.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at night and the next day, my eyes would be red the entire day so much</li>
            <li> My eyelids were very red and my eyes were completely bloodshot.  </li>
            <li> My eye lashes are naturally barely visible.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my eyelashes grow faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Keeping this secret for sure</li>
            <li> Crazy good product.  </li>
            <li> Everyone remarks on how great they look and they usually think I have put on false lashes.</li>
            <li> I mean I REALLY have very long and full lashes.</li>
            <li> Some lashes would be very long and others would be my normal length.  </li>
            <li> the first day and a black staining around my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to think I would just be better off applying false eyelashes during the times that I want to sport more dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month or so, some of my friends asked me what happened to my right eyelash because it looked half the length of the left side.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this particular tube long enough for it to have had time to work</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription and none of them really worked.  </li>
            <li> Much slower results on brows but hair growing in, will see if it turns into something other than fuzz.  </li>
            <li> I have long lush lashes!</li>
            <li> have sensitive eyes so for me it is really important to apply a small amount of product and be careful not to touch the skin, just the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> - they got long fast, and I was worried that they would get too long.  </li>
            <li> When you close your eyes to sleep, it can sting if it&#x27;s not dry.  </li>
            <li> a little irritation at first, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> At first it irritated my eyes a little</li>
            <li> I purchased this item the ending of August; at first I was a little reluctant</li>
            <li> While Revitalash made my lashes grow very long ( over 1&amp;#34; ),  I never saw fuller or darker lashes, so I had three very long lashes, of which one would be white (LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works, but my eyes turn so red that looks like I smoked something, and also they get very dry inside that I have to constantly  used drops for it,so I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have natural dark and long eyelashes without the use of mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that were similar to this, but after about a week I could see a real difference in my eyelashes,  </li>
            <li> may cause red, not pink, eye.</li>
            <li> I was starting to look so bare</li>
            <li> They are so long and lush.  </li>
            <li> No long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But that price is already worth a few cm longer on my lashes!</li>
            <li> When I was young they were black, now they&#x27;re a medium brown and the new lash growth is medium brown, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not use so much mascara as before and do not spend half an hour trying to make my lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and lush like they were when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> had hardly no side effects other than gooey stuff in my eye, like when you wake up from sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Nutra Luxe eyelash conditioner may be a little pricey, but it really work.</li>
            <li> So right now I have the length (as in years past) and no bare spots.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not had the itching or other nagging results I have seen others</li>
            <li> #34;how long do those last for&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; are you wearing fake eyelashes&amp;#34; more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but didn&#x27;t get a chance to try as it made my eyes irritated and red for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I never would have noticed these minor differences, if it weren&#x27;t for the product name, which blatantly omits the \\&quot;MD\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well, a little redder than normal anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite certain that the majority of these positive reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I never wrote out even a negative review at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My eyelashes got so long that I only need to use it once a week now.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and will buy it again when I&#x27;m out, but the tube seems to be lasting a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has been long enough to say if it is going to make my eyelashes grow to the point</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now easily double as long as they have ever been.</li>
            <li> It gives good results, rapidly : but can sometimes hurt in the eyes :(</li>
            <li> It did make my eyes a little dry and itchy for the first 2-3 days, but I sort of expected this.</li>
            <li> how little I use, I had read reviews stating that if you use too much it will burn, so I made it a point to use as little as possible, but always had the same results, red and burning eyes all day</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures and it did help a little with the thickness just not enough to wow me.</li>
            <li> My lashes on the outer corner of my eyes grew long first (noticeably longer than my other lashes) and then there was a funky period of uneven lash growth.  </li>
            <li> I use far less mascara now.</li>
            <li> I am a half Asian which means that my eye lashes not really long and definitely not curly.</li>
            <li> Not sure on my lashes, but I bought it mainly for my brows.</li>
            <li> item is going back, I&#x27;m not about to put anything near my EYES that is this shady....</li>
            <li> I used way too much and after a few weeks the bottom corners of my eyes are showing dark areas.</li>
            <li> because I know how long my lashes are going to look when I&#x27;m done with my makeup.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never been long.</li>
            <li> &quot; She wasn&#x27;t kidding they are long</li>
            <li> my lashes got so long</li>
            <li> Once you stop using lashes will go back to what they were, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so long.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this item that long to see results, but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago, after seeing what it did for my for my 64 year old sister&#x27;s eyelashes.</li>
            <li> they are long.</li>
            <li> so people would ask me if I had a long night...</li>
            <li> Friends comment on how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li> #34;now occasional&amp;#34; because I have been using this product for almost a year now and the irritation is diminishing; that said, a year is a long time putting up with irritations, but it works.</li>
            <li> I use it as instructed, every night...and no joke my lashes are soooo long</li>
            <li> I have never had long lashes and now I do..</li>
            <li> (I was out) and they are still long and still seem to be growing well.  </li>
            <li> After 1 tube of this I started to notice how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li> They are ridicoulsy long, so long alot of the time people asked me if i had them done at salong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can open my eyes wide and they touch my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and curly.  </li>
            <li> , I wonder how long they will grow if I keep using it.</li>
            <li> The item I received came in a pink box, like the one shown above...</li>
            <li> Still no \\&quot;MD\\&quot;, and not in remotely the same font as you see here in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve wanted long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and my eye lashes are sooo long.</li>
            <li> The second time was worse than the first ...</li>
            <li> I look like I have false lashes when I apply mascara that make it worth putting my make-up on</li>
            <li> so I tired it an they were right.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this serum a year ago and then also tried using two other products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for three months now, and my lashes are long!</li>
            <li> I  looked in the mirror again  today and my eyes are red, swollen, and extremely photosensitive.  </li>
            <li> If it makes your eyes red go to every other day.</li>
            <li> Once I saw results I cut back to every other night or so.  </li>
            <li> Makes the eyes real red if you get it in your eyes, so be so careful!</li>
            <li> My lashes are twice as long now!</li>
            <li> Like other users, I have been using it for five months now and am going to order another one for when this one finally does run out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other eyelash enhancers from Revitalash, Idolash etc with no such reaction to them.</li>
            <li> My husband said I need to stop using it because they are getting too long!</li>
            <li> on I use it only every other night.</li>
            <li> Took about two months this to see results but I have long lashes now!</li>
            <li> In fact, they now are so long they brush against my glasses!</li>
            <li> Her lashes are so stunning, they almost look fake, and I am not exaggerating!</li>
            <li> Her lashes are so stunning, they almost look fake, and I am not exaggerating!</li>
            <li> and I stopped using it after that because my lashes were getting too long!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed every morning when I put on my make up at how long my lashes are!</li>
            <li> I do not need to add any pencil to my brow anymore and each of my lashes are thicker, darker and very long.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months and my eyelashes grew very long</li>
            <li> But when I apply it to the lower eyelashes, my eyes became so dry</li>
            <li> BUT I sometimes wake up with dry eyes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll last for months, every time you only use a few drops</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money when I saw the price, but I have some really short and thin lashes.</li>
            <li> it truly works, i use it everyday since the last two month and now it is really starting to show.</li>
            <li> My right top lashes had fallen out in one section, it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> So far very little, if any change.</li>
            <li> The next clear evidence of it&#x27;s effectiveness came ironically enough through &#x27;false&#x27; application...</li>
            <li> After several years of tattooing of my eyebrow, my right one was very thin.  </li>
            <li> I started using it and my eyelashes are so long!!</li>
            <li> Everyone asks who does my lash extensions, or what I have done to make them so long, and it&#x27;s a real pain blinking my eyes behind my glasses because they now touch the lens.</li>
            <li> Have used this product previously and it definitely works!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I ordered previously around the same price range.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely notice a slight change of color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used this for a couple weeks so not sure if it actually makes your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I used Nutra Luxe Lash regularly for about two weeks and did notice a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> It works equally as well as the latisse but is half the cost.  </li>
            <li> have not had any issues with my skin though I did notice a little irritation after a month (red eyes)</li>
            <li> My eyes were a little red for about three days but since then nothing.  </li>
            <li> do get little red and ichy</li>
            <li> I only put on a little mascara to make my lashes dramatically stand out, and I do see a difference in the length.</li>
            <li> , I tried it at night before going to bed, to wake up the next morning with deep blood shot eyes that I could hardly see my pupils.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t do my usual crimp with the eyelash curler since they had grown long enough</li>
            <li> Yes Nutra Luxe it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I spent the money and wanted to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I figured they were not really going to work.</li>
            <li> Also, I have green eyes and have not noticed any discoloration like similar products warn about.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed any results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I definitely see a difference in my brows!</li>
            <li> You will only waste your money.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not very patient, till I noticed a difference then switched to once a day after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> That was a few months ago, I&#x27;m on my third tube now and my lashes are longer than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Product was delivered as stated and I was careful to check</li>
            <li> be careful when you apply it</li>
            <li> Its harder to tell with the brows.</li>
            <li> Its not an instant thing, but after a few weeks, I swear your lashes do grow.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think i will keep using the product because its irritating my eyes to much .</li>
            <li> They touch my eyebrows when my eyes are opened wide, they are also thicker.</li>
            <li> When used regularly, you will see a difference, but not a huge difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to discovering this serum I had lash extensions which cost $75 every two weeks to re-touch as I naturally had short and thin lashes (I am Korean).  </li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive eyes, apply at bedtime, and apply the thin layer from the outside in.</li>
            <li> when I started getting false eyelashes from the salon every time I took them out it was ripping some of my real with them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lazy lately, haven&#x27;t been applying every night but the length of my lashes is still pretty long,  just a little bit shorter.  </li>
            <li> Previously I bought it from a local spa but to save a little money I decided to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Actually, I ordered it for a friend of mine who has very little eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It does make my eyes a little dry but have had no other negative side effects.</li>
            <li> when using every night, but once I saw results I now use every other night.  </li>
            <li> For maintenance I use it every other day or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try other lash growers on the market.</li>
            <li> COUNTERFEITS are being sold on Amazon.com and other selling portals.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure that i can see any differance at all yet, but will continue to use it until it is gone and watch daily for any change.</li>
            <li> Seems like these products do one or the other.</li>
            <li> I disagree to this due to the nature of the reason to return this item.  </li>
            <li> I have used other lash growing products in the past and did not have this same reaction.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my eyebrows are showing improvement on one side, so I am still waiting for the other side to start filling in those gaps...</li>
            <li> I am also scared to resell it for fear I may be liable if something happens!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Have switched to every other day now without losing results and use on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I feel it surpasses one other I have tried:</li>
            <li> And truthfully, I am not applying it as instructed although I have been applying it daily.  </li>
            <li> I used in the past different products like this and none worked.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it made them half as thick as it has long.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t over use, because of the active ingredient, causes dark circles under eyes if used excessively like I did (several times day) follow directions.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin, short, Asian lashes.</li>
            <li> Would definitely 100% recommend this to those looking to increase the length of their lashes naturally without using mascara or fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, since there are hair on faces, so maybe some got smudged down to other areas....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not seen much difference in my eyelashes from using either product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can make your eyelids appear pink-purple.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re desperate it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> lashes were ripped out from extensions but have grown back about 50% in the past few months</li>
            <li> Now that the dark circles have disappered</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and look almost fake.  </li>
            <li> The average price gives you average results.</li>
            <li> It is not the real deal it is a fake and</li>
            <li> I have always had longer than average eyelashes</li>
            <li> I went through a package of post-its writing down the information and telling them to buy it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, but my eyelashes have NEVER been this long!</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s about 1/3 the cost of the other product!</li>
            <li> I need to return the product due to this!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried other products in the past and had minimal results</li>
            <li> By eight weeks, I tinted them black</li>
            <li> At present (9 days later), 40% of my lashes are remaining, and sadly they are still coming out.     </li>
            <li> So I took her advice and used less than what I thought I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super noticeable to others (I&#x27;ve asked my husband and daughter)</li>
            <li> After a couple of months I had to wear less mascara because I looked like spider eyes.</li>
            <li> some slight itching at times around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Much less money, too.</li>
            <li> After about a month and a half I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> This is less than half the price and for me works just as well.</li>
            <li> It looked like I was slightly stoned all the time.</li>
            <li> Its been less than 3 weeks</li>
            <li> But again I was skeptical so what I did was to apply only on the left eyelid</li>
            <li> I notice a little length, but really not worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> your long thick lashes will fade away.  </li>
            <li> This does make my eye lids a little itchy and it does make them a little dark (</li>
            <li> I would not have minded losing the length of my lashes, but was very unhappy with the bare spots as it was very noticeable.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this purchase, especially considering how much it costs to not work at all.</li>
            <li> is sensible and less waste than drops &amp; brush brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dunno what happened to my poor eyebrows, but over the last few years they&#x27;ve become less and less.  </li>
            <li> just took a little longer</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this product, but my lashes are just a little longer than before to use Nutra Luxe Lash MD.  </li>
            <li> This product works just as well for less than half the price!</li>
            <li> EYES LOOKED A LITTLE BLOOD SHOT AND ALITTLE ITCHY FOR A WEEK</li>
            <li> would &#x27;err&#x27; on the side of saying this product DOES do a little bit of enhancing.  </li>
            <li> and I can see that it&#x27;s getting longer and a little fuller.</li>
            <li> you have a little longer.</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re desperate and not poor, you might want to try this serum.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this after purchasing it a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> an were short an thin.</li>
            <li> Yes we lose lashes everyday and they regrow in 6-8 weeks, but mine would leave spaces for weeks.</li>
            <li> As they fell out the grew back in thin an yucky again.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it is slightly irritating to eye, making lids redish, so I have to put concealer on in morning.</li>
            <li> My lashes are blonde, so, being sparse, just made it look worse</li>
            <li> I am beginning to think it is a waste of money and should try something else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will now go directly to manufacturer&#x27;s website to purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to work in a few days or weeks and might take a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on others, Ive tried the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I ordered a bottle for my mom recently</li>
            <li> Approximately 1 hour later, I viewed myself in the mirror</li>
            <li> It looked as though I had been crying for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep using the bottle and see if there are any results after a few months.</li>
            <li> I heard from my friends that it takes a few months to see the results.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day but stopped using it on my bottom lashes after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> I used to use an eyelash curler everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had some missing eye lashes on one eye for some reason and no amount of mascara could help that</li>
            <li> Its not permanent but after a few uses you do notice darkened orbits.</li>
            <li> but I have been using everyday since March 22, 2013.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of the folks who is sensitive to this product.  </li>
            <li> Does cause irritation if applied too heavily, just use as directed.</li>
            <li> This product is misleading, if you are over 60 don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> but it did irritate my eyes, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Obviously one of us is confused.</li>
            <li> But my eyelash became really thin and short after using water proof mascara for a while</li>
            <li> simply apply be patient, takes approximately 6 weeks, but it works.</li>
            <li> When I tell them yes, they are so shocked and usually tell me how lucky I am.  </li>
            <li> I must also warn you that although it is ALL NATURAL it can still be VERY irritating to the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I noticed that some of the other comments were negative but took a chance.</li>
            <li> I have tried three similar products in the past and have not experienced any of these symptoms.  </li>
            <li> This product left my eyes awfully bloodshot and red, the same pink eye look that has been described by others.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I began using this product because after not getting very far from using the previous ones, I was just not expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad since it really did work growing my lashes but not worth having \\&quot;devil\\&quot; eyes!</li>
            <li> Mind the fact I already have naturally dry eyes, but this product may make them worse.</li>
            <li> I frankly was not sure which of the three caused my thinning but</li>
            <li> But not sure if I would purchase it again since using this product</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d use it as a serum for my entire head!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that was a big mistake!</li>
            <li> and now when I dress them up with my usual choice of mascara (Dior Blackout)</li>
            <li> I bought this product after another I usually buy went up in price.  </li>
            <li> you get lazy and quit using it every night</li>
            <li> product make your eyelash longer, but I&#x27;m not sure about make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> but they hurt and felt heavy!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it is fake lash like, but I definitely notice the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is not reputable and should be banned from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past and this product works comparable to Latisse.  </li>
            <li> if not better than they did when she had eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Im not one to write reviews so ill keep it simple.</li>
            <li> Wi do reccomend it to anyone who has small thinning eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable what this product has done.  </li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical about products that advertise such results but this product truly works!  </li>
            <li> I have tried latisse in the past</li>
            <li> the past I used MD Lash....bought it from HSN on a 3 pay......</li>
            <li> but I was past the allotted time period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula changed or what but this product no longer works for me.</li>
            <li> Me, not sure yet if I would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Been using this a few months now, and although progress is slow, it does seem to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anything on the market will if that is what you are hoping for.</li>
            <li> This product is very harsh for me.</li>
            <li> am applying morning and night a very thin layer on just on the upper eye lid.</li>
            <li> and I am applying a very thin layer to my upper lids.  </li>
            <li> I have been asked if I have eyelash extensions or other false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have thinned at the ends throughout the years, and my lashes are not the worse but in need of serious improvement since they have never been very long.</li>
            <li> a big disappointment and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was getting bald spots in my brows and what hair I did have was stiff and unruly!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes almost look fake, they&#x27;ve gotten so long.  </li>
            <li> But it is unmistakable  that after a few weeks, even with sloppy application (fairly regular - not religiously perfect!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are thick and long and sometime people ask me if they are fake</li>
            <li> Used to makeup my very pale eyebrows every morning, but I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore because my eyebrows are so thick and darker.</li>
            <li> its a hard to see the différence i am a bit deceive.</li>
            <li> Now I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t rub your eyes too hard or your lashes will fall out.</li>
            <li> I continue to be asked about my lashes and always share my little beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another tube, and I was disappointed to see the price had gone up so high.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to go to the reviews to see if I missed something and came upon the negative review about counterfeit product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been debating on trying Lattise before I bought this but was afraid my blue eyes would turn brown(common side effect)</li>
            <li> All the negative effects came out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My lashes not only stopped growing, but also started to fall out like crazy.</li>
            <li> but thought I would at least use up the product.  </li>
            <li> &gt; was going to give it at least 6 weeks like it says.  </li>
            <li> would like to say something about the one or two negative reviews that I have seen on here.</li>
            <li> I developed the worst stye I have ever had on my left eye.  </li>
            <li> If u have thick lashes and want them longer this isn&#x27;t the one for u.</li>
            <li> It does take time for the results to show, but after a few months I started to grow eyebrows in the places that had become noticeably thin.  </li>
            <li> The first few days my eyes we terribly irritated though, but I stuck with it and the burning passed.</li>
            <li> Lashes are crazy long</li>
            <li> I started out using a prescription of latisse, but then decided to try something less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I seriously hope it&#x27;s the inanimate object...</li>
            <li> , I even had to use eye drops for relief, which I am terrible with, hate to use eye drops, so it was just not worth the hassle for me, I can&#x27;t attest to how it works on eye lashes because I couldn&#x27;t keep using it, I do use it on my eye brows however and don&#x27;t see much difference, I will go back to Envyderm.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for eyelashes and if desperate like I was for minimal eyebrow help.</li>
            <li> My eyes did get a little sensitive once in awhile but nothing to horrible</li>
            <li> Not sure if somethings wrong with my serum</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative reaction and have used the product as instructed with no problems!</li>
            <li> I had a poor reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this before.  </li>
            <li> The product is extremely irritating to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I hate to give this product one star since I haven&#x27;t actually used it, but I have to warn others that you might receive a counterfeit item like I did.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product indefinitely because when I stop using it, my eyebrows start getting thin again.</li>
            <li> Well it give me the worse scare of my life</li>
            <li> Also, I apply a thin layer on my brows after applying it on the lashes.</li>
            <li> in my mid-fifties and my lashes were sparce and thin.</li>
            <li> people will ask you whats your secret.</li>
            <li> Was not happy</li>
            <li> people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Everybody asks me if I wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I no longer use false lashes at all.</li>
            <li> Takes about 8 weeks to see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a dramatic change in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that my lashes have not grown like the other posters have.</li>
            <li> By about five weeks of using this product I would get asked if my lashes were real at least once</li>
            <li> I want to see if it works, I tried false eye lashes and now I have very thin eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> When I read the directions I was a little bit disappointed by it</li>
            <li> If you have a bad reaction to the ingredients of the product, which is possible, it is unreasonable and unfair to give it a bad rep.</li>
            <li> I thought they were fake</li>
            <li> The wrong product was sent to me.</li>
            <li> so I think I got a fake.  </li>
            <li> They are longer and thicker then ever people think there fake.</li>
            <li> After one use, I noticed redness, itchiness and an uncomfortable burning sensation not unlike sunburn on my eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have not continued and since it&#x27;s an opened product, the Amazon retailer I purchased from will not work with me in any way.</li>
            <li> but when I do...they look fake.  </li>
            <li> Everyone asks if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> When i put mascara on, it looks like i have fake lashes on.</li>
            <li> it was sad.  </li>
            <li> After using it just for a couple of weeks, I can tell it is either fake or diluted.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The change took some time and in fact I was skeptical that it was even doing anything</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this situation at all!!!  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now morning and night and sadly nothing has happened.</li>
            <li> Then I started noticing random eyelashes were a lot longer than the rest.  </li>
            <li> now they don&#x27;t sell it and really sad about that  </li>
            <li> (yes, poor me!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I started using this product because after I turned 55, my eyebrows started to get very thin in places.</li>
            <li> The biggest downfall is that the skin around my eyes has become darkened, so without coverup on I look very tired.</li>
            <li> They sell FAKE product!</li>
            <li> Ill buy again!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I had never tried any eyelash enhances.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very very sad.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it, my lashes are in bad shape</li>
            <li> if its just a bad batch of the product.</li>
            <li> Beet-red eyes for two days, bad headache</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66,and had been sick 3 yrs,in which time my lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in the product n in amazin</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> after 4 weeks and applying twice a day I still have no growth or improvemnet:( I am dissapointed and will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and then I had extensions put on for some stupid reason.  </li>
            <li> Hate it, have to use for life</li>
            <li> Did have some redness at the base of the lash, but no stinging or burning.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, by the time I read all the terrible things that can happen if you use this product, I was too afraid to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and once they started I would lose them again, a vicious cycle.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes were doing horrible.</li>
            <li> This is insane!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For every woman who wants strong and long lush lashes. I highly recommend this product, I saw great results in 4 weeks. I highly recommend  this product. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> I just started using this after purchasing it a few months ago.  I had surgery and wanted to wait til I was fully recovered.  I&#x27;ve been using this for literally 2 months, and I&#x27;ve seen 0 results!  Then I decided to go to the reviews to see if I missed something and came upon the negative review about counterfeit product.. well guess WHAT!? I got one!  \\&quot;nutraluxe lash\\&quot; with the TM in tiny letters.. everything was lower case, and no MD at the end.. counterfit,  I tried contacting the company that sold me the product and no reply, as well as no replacement because I didn&#x27;t send it back before the alloted time.. ALOTTED TIME SHOULDN&#x27;T COUNT WHEN IT&#x27;S COUNTERFIET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I called Amazon- and they applied my refund to another purchase of the same product, upgraded it to 1 day shipping, and apologized profusely.  They  will be calling me the day my product is delivered to see if I received another \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; and if I did, they&#x27;re going to set up an investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 MONTH UPDATE:  This stuff works pretty well.  It&#x27;s only made my lashes slightly darker, but significantly longer, feathery and curled at the tips, as well as fuller.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, as it really does look beautiful when I put a thin layer of mascara on.  I&#x27;ve gotten literally tons of compliments- I have slightly Asian eyes with extremely short and light eyelashes- and so it&#x27;s been QUITE obvious to everyone that they&#x27;re very different.</li>
            <li> I love the way the bottle looks, its very pretty so you don&#x27;t mind taking it when you travel. It did make my eyelashes grow longer so the product works well! I&#x27;m currently applying it on bald spots on my eye brows as well. It seems to be coming in, slowly but surely! I recommend it for those who would want to enhance their eyelash volume!</li>
            <li> This does miracles for your eyelashes if you do it right! (Takes about 2 weeks) I am not 100% sure it is safe though. Study it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended so when my sister&#x27;s eyelashes began to fall out i sent it to her and she has eyelashes again!  so i ordered some for me!</li>
            <li> I was told about this product by my 40 year old niece when I saw her NEW beautiful, long, lush lashes. I thought they were fake they were so beautiful. I have been using LuxeLash for 3 weeks and there is a noticeable improvement in the thickness and length of my ashes. I did experience morning redness around my eyes for the first week, but have found if I apply LuxeLash AFTER I have closed my eyes at bedtime, it is eliminates my morning redness.&lt;br /&gt;At 70 years of age, I am looking forward to having nice lush lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using their mascara!</li>
            <li> my eyelashes have grown so much with this product, within six weeks of use of product.  recommend Nutra Luxe Lash MD</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from reputable hair an cosmetics company from Cal. so I tired it an they were right. This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen it for also.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes b/4 Nutra Lux MD had thinned and fall out easily an were short an thin. If I pulled them gently when trying to get a chunk of mascara off often I&#x27;d end up with a few lashes with it. Yes we lose lashes everyday and they regrow in 6-8 weeks, but mine would leave spaces for weeks. My bottom lashes are not even visible an barely there with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;After Nu Lux MD use for 3 weeks (twice a day) I started to see the new lashes growing in a little thicker an a few more. By 6 weeks they looked good enough for me to just put one coat of mascara on an leave the house. By eight weeks, I tinted them black an could leave them an feel Ok, even without mascara and I couldn&#x27;t do my usual crimp with the eyelash curler since they had grown long enough that they touched my top lid after I did that. So then I started using a curling mascara formula instead. As matainance I cut back to once a day for 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;All was good, then I got lazy an didn&#x27;t use it at all for 6 weeks. Mistake! As they fell out the grew back in thin an yucky again. Hate it, have to use for life I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back into my 4th week again. Only thing is it is slightly irritating to eye, making lids redish, so I have to put concealer on in morning. I&#x27;m still on my first tube but nearing the end. I&#x27;d say I got 3-4 months out of tube. My eyes are my best feature (with lashes that is). Won&#x27;t go without it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c all the reviews seemed good. I was excited to use this product and applied it exactly as it stated. When i woke up in the morning my eyes were swollen and red. I couldn&#x27;t believe what happened especially since the product touts its \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products. I never used it again, returned it within days. I couldn&#x27;t wear mascara for almost a week until my eyes were back to normal. I definitely would not risk trying this ever again. Would give it no stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after it was recommended to my by my hairdresser. She told me that some of her clients had used this product and she had seen a difference in their eyelashes. I began using the product and then a doctor friend of mine gave me Latisse for Christmas. I mainly have been using the Latisse but I use this product instead when I am traveling. I like the container and it is much simpler to apply than the Latisse. Unfortunately, I have not seen much difference in my eyelashes from using either product. I have rarely missed a night of using it and there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in my eyelashes. I have seen a little extra length in the farthest corners of my lashes but nothing that anyone would notice and certainly not enough for me to spend more money on a product like this. I am beginning to think I would just be better off applying false eyelashes during the times that I want to sport more dramatic lashes. I think this might be a fad product and fade into oblivion once the next vanity obsession comes into play.</li>
            <li> hi I have using this product for 2 years now its not  working, I would like my money back  t hank you</li>
            <li> I tried to use this on my eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I looked like I cried for days after 5 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning so used it on my eye brows instead.&lt;br /&gt;They worked great on my eye brows. they are definitly longer thicker and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to HAVE some kind of &#x27;eyebrow darkening&#x27; make up. Now I really don&#x27;t need to. I&#x27;m that satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just that.. if you have moderately sensitive eyes, you can&#x27;t use them on eye lashes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it would work but it does. almost immediate results. a little irritation at first, but not anymore. can&#x27;t wait to see results 2 months from now.</li>
            <li> I tried Nutra Luxe MD, started about three weeks ago, and am totally amazed of the HUGE difference in my lash growth.  My lashes are blonde, so, being sparse, just made it look worse &amp; now I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara &amp; still feel real confident.  The first few days, it did sting, but it seemed that the LESS I tried to re-cover my lid, the better.  One swipe of the brush into the vial, covers both top lids, like you&#x27;re putting on liquid eye liner.  I also use it on my brows, which have filled in, only in the areas that I needed it to.  I tried that &#x27;Lashes in a bottle&#x27;, love that too, but only put it on ONE eye, just to see the difference.  You honestly couldn&#x27;t tell, unless I kept coating the Lashes in a bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I think I will never be without this stuff now!  I&#x27;m trying to just put it on every other night now, &amp; will see if that&#x27;s good enough.  If it&#x27;s not, no problem, because I just love the results!</li>
            <li> Yes Nutra Luxe it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> The wrong product was sent to me. But I thought I would try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Gave me bloodshot eyes that NOTHING would get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I really did not think it was working - however after 2 months I started to notice a difference. You have to have patience, this is not an overnight  miracle !</li>
            <li> Beautylash MD seems to be working its magic. Without any doubt, my eyelashes are noticeably longer. I have been using the conditioner for about 2 months, probably 3 or 4 days a week. I am excited to see what my lashes will look like in another 2 months. I giggle to myself putting on mascara in the mornings because I know how long my lashes are going to look when I&#x27;m done with my makeup. When I  told my mom what I was using, her comment was \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking that your eyelashes have been looking kinda wild!\\&quot; .... Success! A great product. I have also been using it on my eyebrows, but I have not been able to detect much change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old, and I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to mascara. I didn&#x27;t want to spend 100+ dollars on an eyelash enhancer, and Nutra Luxe MD seemed the best. When I read the directions I was a little bit disappointed by it saying that it is not to be used under the age of 18. Regardless, I spent the money and wanted to try it out.  Pros:  - VERY easy to apply  - Not messy at all  - See results in a couple of days or weeks  - Quick, simple  - Longer/thicker eyelashes (I think I grew a few more!)  - If you skip a night or two, it won&#x27;t diminish the results  Cons:  - Try not to get it in your eye, it stings a little (but it&#x27;s not harmful)  - Not so effective on eyebrows  Overall, this product is amazing. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars just simply because of the eyebrow part. This might be because sometimes the area gets waxed.</li>
            <li> when i first got this product i was sooo excited then i started using it and it made my eyes bloodshot and irritated. it also made me have red undereye circles like a zombie.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since Sept. 27, 2010. So far very little, if any change. I will give it another 2 weeks to see if my lashes grow. It does make my eyes a little dry but have had no other negative side effects. I am disappointed that my lashes have not grown like the other posters have. I am beginning to think it is a waste of money and should try something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as another product I was using stopped working for me.  I am age 55 and my lashes started falling out (bare spots) and the length was no longer there.  I also used on my brows as they were becoming very sparse too.  My brows have filled out a bit more, but have seen the bigger difference with my lashes.  I would not have minded losing the length of my lashes, but was very unhappy with the bare spots as it was very noticeable. So right now I have the length (as in years past) and no bare spots.  I have been using since September 2011 and starting seeing results by the end of November and ordered another to have on hand when this one runs out (which it has not yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with my skin though I did notice a little irritation after a month (red eyes) when using every night, but once I saw results I now use every other night.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone will have this issue, but someone else mentioned in another review and kept that in mind.  I do use it every night on my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE:  I having been purchasing from this particular seller and the last purchase I made in June 2014, I noticed the container did not look like the current one I have but still decided to use. Since I have been using it, my lashes are in bad shape so I think I got a fake.  Just a warning because this has happened to others.  I have contacted seller, but don&#x27;t expect much.  Unfortunately, I will now go directly to manufacturer&#x27;s website to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always been \\&quot;lash challenged\\&quot;, and started using this product in May 2011.  Within three weeks, saw a huge difference.. now, in September, my lashes touch my eyebrows!  Also worked well on my eyebrows.  Did have some redness at the base of the lash, but no stinging or burning.  The redness is easily covered up with eyeshadow.  Worth the redness for the fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Never been happier. My eyelashes are fuller, stronger and thicker. I get compliments all the time, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> After using this product for four weeks I began to see result.  My upper eyelashes grew so much!  But when I apply it to the lower eyelashes, my eyes became so dry so I stopped using it on my lower lash line.  I&#x27;ve been lazy lately, haven&#x27;t been applying every night but the length of my lashes is still pretty long,  just a little bit shorter.  But I&#x27;m still happy~~ although you are spending $50 on it but it&#x27;ll last for months, every time you only use a few drops and you&#x27;ll still see result.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it for my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I initially tried this serum a year ago and then also tried using two other products.  I frankly was not sure which of the three caused my thinning but once full (62 year old) brows to grow back in.  I dropped this product as I could not buy it in any store locally (although I first found it at Costco) and started using others.  At this point my brows started becoming sparse again. I decided to go back to this item and buy it at Amazon in the 4.5 ml size.  And Voila, they once again grew back in.  This was the one that worked for me and is currently working for me.  I guess I will have to keep on using it.  I just use it on my brows and at night only. It&#x27;s not going to work in a few days or weeks and might take a couple of months. Anyway, I&#x27;m really thrilled.  I don&#x27;t even have to use brow makeup now whereas before finding Nutra Luxe MD, if I could only use one makeup product it would have been brow makeup.  I don&#x27;t know if it will work for everyone, but I guess if you&#x27;re desperate and not poor, you might want to try this serum.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This is my second one, it explains all :)</li>
            <li> I started using Nutra Luxe Lash MD on August. 2, 2011.    My eyes were red and stinging for the first 10 days of use.   After 4 weeks of using it nightly my lashes started falling out in large clumps.   I ceased using the product immediately    At present (9 days later), 40% of my lashes are remaining, and sadly they are still coming out.     I have no history of any drug allergies or sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and like the fact that it darkens your lashes and brows. But not sure if I would purchase it again since using this product my eyes are very irritated red and very dry.[[ASIN:B001WAKUUC Nutra LUXE LASH MD Physican Formulated-Ophthalmologist Tested 4.5 ml]]</li>
            <li> I started using this product as soon as I received it. I started off using it twice a day and now just once per day. I wish I would&#x27;ve taken before and after pics. I wear glasses and my eyelashes are so long they are touching the inside of my lens! You have to use it religiously and faithfully...everyday. I didn&#x27;t experience any red or itchy eyes. You will see growth after being on it for a week!</li>
            <li> It really works! My lashes are stronger and longer than ever. For maintenance I use it every other day or 3 times a week. It is a great investment!</li>
            <li> I had a poor reaction to this product. It made my eyelids so red, people noticed even with make up on, and it causes swelling even after only two uses. I will return it.</li>
            <li> These things keep my fiance&#x27;s eyelashes looking good. I just need to get her a new supply now and then. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and up until now I&#x27;ve loved it. This last one I received isn&#x27;t working at all. It seems like its just water or something. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or if its just a bad batch of the product. But I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this purchase, especially considering how much it costs to not work at all.</li>
            <li> OK, so all my life I&#x27;ve had great thick, long lashes. Age has taken its toll, as well as thyroid issues and hereditary hair loss, and my lashes were getting thinner and falling out. I was heartbroken because my lashes have always been my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34;. I used L&#x27;Oreal for almost a year and it was a little better, but then I tried the NutraLuxeMD and OMG! Everyone asks who does my lash extensions, or what I have done to make them so long, and it&#x27;s a real pain blinking my eyes behind my glasses because they now touch the lens. I could use a little more thickness, but the length is just ridiculously, insanely, beautifully, amazingly fabulous! If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d use it as a serum for my entire head! And no, I was not paid to do this review.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as the prescription Latisse.  I have recommended to several of my friends who all feel the same way after trying it.  My only complaint is that it can make your eyelids appear pink-purple.  My guess is that there is increased blood flow to the lash line and that is what is causing that hue.  I just cover it up with concealer or eyeshadow.  My eyelashes get compliments all the time!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rapid Lash and then switched to this product because it lasted longer and seemed a better value.  At first it irritated my eyes a little and then that went away.  It does grow my lashes longer and my brows filled in as well but when I ordered it a second time and started using the second tube my eyes would become more and more irritated everytime I used it.  I didn&#x27;t use it every day since my lashes and brows were looking filled in (longer) and I was just trying to maintain what I had achieved.  However, the last time I used it my eyes, brows and the entire area around my eyes turned so red I was scaring people.  It took two days for the redness to subside and I haven&#x27;t used it since.  Too bad since it really did work growing my lashes but not worth having \\&quot;devil\\&quot; eyes!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and I highly recommend the product to my friends. VERY noticeable difference within a couple weeks. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it! But is it true.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have never been long. Just normal! I didn&#x27;t want to spend $120/month on latisse! I was hesitant to try other lash growers on the market. I figured they were not really going to work. Then my mom told me that my aunt was using this product and could not believe how amazing her eyelashes looked! So I decided to try it. All I can say is WOW! It works! I actually had a girl at the MAC makeup counter ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes! Ha! That was a first! This product is going to be my all around Christmas gift for my girlfriends!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love LOVE LOVVE this stuff..    Pretty pricey, I agree.  But if you&#x27;re desperate it&#x27;s so worth it.  I dunno what happened to my poor eyebrows, but over the last few years they&#x27;ve become less and less.  Actually got this stuff at Costco, but it&#x27;s the same product listed here, and it helped my nonexistent eybrows grow back.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s super easy.  Just apply it as the directions state, like eyeliner over your eyebrow (or eyelashes)  I applied it every night before bed and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
            <li> These really grow your lashes. I have bought many different kinds of lash conditioners. These work as well as the perscription kind.</li>
            <li> I am amazed with this product. I can use an eyelash curler again.  So glad I took the leap of faith and tried this!</li>
            <li> expecting results yet, but im sure ill work, it will take 12 weeks to see the desire results. Higly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love my lashes! They are longer and thicker then ever people think there fake. I just add some mascara and fabulous!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So this product works I had written a review about a week and 1/2 ago. I said it did not work ... Well pulled my foot out of my mouth. I am still using it. It took another week. I have eye lashes. My Daughter said \\&quot;Mom where did they come from I can see them in your profile.\\&quot; She wasn&#x27;t kidding they are long and I&#x27;m amazed. thank you it works great just took a little longer then I thought. Love the results....</li>
            <li> This product is very harsh for me. For several years I have used and been happy with Rapid Lash by Promaxyl. For whatever reason, Amazon stopped carrying Rapid Lash for several months and then when it returned, it was more expensive. I decided I would try another lash product at or around the same price with comparable reviews. Unfortunately, that was a big mistake! Instead of heeding the reviews that mentioned redness and irritation, I thought I would be fine since I had been using a similar product for years with nothing more than a bit of hyperpigmentation on my upper lids. After one use, I noticed redness, itchiness and an uncomfortable burning sensation not unlike sunburn on my eyebrows and eyelashes. After the second use, I woke up in the middle of the night from a sound sleep, itching my eyes and feeling like I was having a hot flash only in the eye area. Needless to say, I have not continued and since it&#x27;s an opened product, the Amazon retailer I purchased from will not work with me in any way. I am out forty dollars but I plan to send this back to the original company with my complaints, hoping that they will do a better job in the future making a product that can accommodate those with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now and it really does work.I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have natural dark and long eyelashes without the use of mascara.</li>
            <li> As I have been getting older my eye lashes were starting to fall out really easy and I would lose chunks out of the upper lashes leaving a gap in my lashes and would take forever to grow back and once they started I would lose them again, a vicious cycle.  I have tried so many other products and Nutra Luxe MD Beautylash is the best I think on the market.  No irritation at all, I wear contacts and this is so awesome.  My lashes are so long and full! No lie really!   I will never be without this ever and the 4.5 ml last about 3 months.  Not bad at all!  I really can&#x27;t say enough.  I am just thankful I have found it! One thing, try not to over saturate the lashes as it may irritate your eyes.  I sometimes give myself a couple days break every so often if that happensm as my eyes will burn and get red. I love this product, it is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I received counterfeit product, I had an adverse reaction my eyes turned blood shot red and the entire eye area eyelids, under eyes etc. were bright red for days. Horrible!</li>
            <li> Have used this product previously and it definitely works!  However, it must be used every day.</li>
            <li> This really works! I was nervous to try b/c I thought it wouldn&#x27;t, but I definitely noticed a lengthening in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Make my lashes look great!</li>
            <li> First of all this is just my first tube and it has been since March which still more left . Amazing result on my lash and brow. I do not need to add any pencil to my brow anymore and each of my lashes are thicker, darker and very long. I look like I have false lashes when I apply mascara that make it worth putting my make-up on and when I don&#x27;t have any mascara they are all so naturally long.&lt;br /&gt;I am applying morning and night a very thin layer on just on the upper eye lid. If you put too much your eyes are going to burn and it is not worth more anyways. I love the price!!  I guarantee the results on this. I heard about some people complain about packages are not appears the same as this photo and returning the item . Mine was also looking a bit different but who cares, it&#x27;s works as they promised .</li>
            <li> this has helped my eyelashs to grown longer, not as good as the one brooke shields uses, but also less than half the price, and have used this for about seven months now, two containers, and am on my third one.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, but my eyelashes have NEVER been this long! I saw results within just a couple of days. In two months my lashes curl all the way up to my eyebrows! This is way better than all those extension mascaras. I didn&#x27;t have any burning or itching either. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> My lashes have gone from short &amp; sparse to fuller and much lingers.  Live the look of my lashes even without mascara</li>
            <li> My right top lashes had fallen out in one section, it was horrible.  This was recommended, I tried IT WORKED.  A little pricey, but well worth it!  Lashes were back and looking good in about 2-3 weeks! I have continued to use it and noticed all lashes longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, since there are hair on faces, so maybe some got smudged down to other areas.... may cause red, not pink, eye.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied....doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids....    This stuff works...will buy again!!!  Within a month my lashes are longer...Don&#x27;t wear mascara as much but when I do...they look fake.  Use it on my eyebrows as well since they are sparce and they are growing in so I can put my eyebrow pencil on better.</li>
            <li> I am a half Asian which means that my eye lashes not really long and definitely not curly. I noticed that the lashes started curling up after the first week. i could not believe it. The first time when i applied then product my eye looked like i had a week of sleepless nights and didn&#x27;t remove cosmetics. They were red and hurt a lot. i did not give up using the product. It took me 2 months to notice real results but they were. I do not use so much mascara as before and do not spend half an hour trying to make my lashes look longer. I think if i had not used my  mascara at all they would had grown even longer. I cant say the lashes look thicker but anyway i am happy even with this result.</li>
            <li> I love Nutra Luxe Lash MD. I have used it for about three weeks and can already see longer and fuller lashes. I would recommend this product to any person wanting longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> As someone of Asian decent I&#x27;ve been bestowed with short, downwards-pointing stick-straight lashes, since birth. Not even eyelash curlers followed by curling mascara would make them look much different. Then a coworker recommended this stuff to me (probably as a kinder way of telling me to lay off the ridiculous-looking falsies) after I asked her how her eyes took a turn for the doey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it asap. I was lucky I had a coach with first-degree experience. My coworker told me to use the teensiest bit of it, and whatever comes out when you pull the brush from the tube is all you need for both eyes. Do NOT double dip. She warned me that my eyes would be kind of red and bloodshot for the first two days, which they were. When the bloodshot wasn&#x27;t getting better after the third day, she said it was because I was using too much (I was kind of globbing it on at first in overzealous anticipation). So I took her advice and used less than what I thought I needed. I applied it twice a day, morning and evening after I washed my face, and alternated which eyelid I started on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut to 5 weeks later and my lashes have not only nearly doubled in length, but they are also thicker and they CURL GLORIOUSLY. Haven&#x27;t used my curler since and now when I dress them up with my usual choice of mascara (Dior Blackout) people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. And I obnoxiously bat my lashes all like, \\&quot;Who me?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> gave me red eyes. stopped using it so i don&#x27;t know if it even works...&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a shame... but the product came with warning about the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Nutra Luxe eyelash conditioner may be a little pricey, but it really work. I have had over plucked eyebrow for years.  I always tried growing them back, but they never seemed to come back . I tried this product, and over a couple weeks I notice a big change   in my eyebrows condition and thickness. Dont waste your money on others, Ive tried the cheaper products. This stuff really work.</li>
            <li> I had used this item before and I am pleased with the results. Only problem it seems to run out of liquid quickly</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Thicker, longer, stronger and darker lashes! It has worked wonderful for me! No bad side effects</li>
            <li> There were so many positive reviews about this product that I thought, &amp;#34;Hmm, it&#x27;s gotta be good!&amp;#34; It ain&#x27;t. My eyes were so bloodshot red after using this product, from day one. Yet, I prevailed, because I wanted lashes like my daughter&#x27;s. I used it as directed for weeks and the redness NEVER subsided. People found it hard to look me in the eyes because my eyes made their own eyes tear just from looking at me! I don&#x27;t even know if the product worked because I just couldn&#x27;t stand the redness and no amount of Visine got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this particular tube long enough for it to have had time to work but I have used this brand before and found it most successful.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product , i never saw my eyelashes like this , they are so long, is a dream eyelashes , i saw results at the 3rd month, and the fisrt 2 weeks my eyes were so red but with no pain, i recomend this product is amazing and great, thank u .</li>
            <li> The product irritated my eyelids to the point that they became swollen, burnt and itchy. Am trying to get my money back but amazon has no customer support at all. Extremely disappointed in the product n in amazin</li>

            <li> I have been using nutra luxe lash MD for 3 weeks and have not noticed any difference. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am soooooo pissed off right now. I just came online to amazon to look up Nutra Luxe Lash MD and discovered I am also one of the people that got the counterfeit bottle too. What prompted me to even read the reviews this time around was because the first bottle I received was the real one bc my lashes got so long and I loved it, so I obviously was happy with the product and didnt need to read the reviews. When I ordered the second bottle, the one I&#x27;m using now, all of my lashes fell out. I couldnt for the life of it understand why it was working anymore. I just figured my lashes became too used to the formula or something. I am so glad that I came online this morning and read the reviews. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! To make matters worse, I ordered a bottle for my mom recently and now I have to call her and make sure she doesnt have a fake like mine. ugh.</li>
            <li> My eyes were a little red for about three days but since then nothing.  It&#x27;s not irritable at all and it&#x27;s working!  My lashes are beginning to get longer and I believe thicker!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Been using this for a year or more.  My lashes are long and lush like they were when I was younger.  No need for mascara now.  Takes about 6 months of daily use for full effect.  Once you stop using lashes will go back to what they were, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered a larger size bottle, which costs more and they sent me the smallest size bottle. They did the same thing to my mom too. Just be careful on who you order from and make sure your getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Still awaiting results. It takes time on this type product. So far I have not had the itching or other nagging results I have seen others input. As with all products...every one of us is individual.</li>
            <li> So: you got to be patient! That&#x27;s rule #1. I started seeing results after a whole month of using it. My lashes got longer, they even curl on the corners, but I don&#x27;t think I see any improvement in volume. They really look long and lush when I wear mascara. I&#x27;m looking forward to more growth in the time to come and I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;P.s. no specific sensitivity to the product, no red eyes, BUT I sometimes wake up with dry eyes. Mind the fact I already have naturally dry eyes, but this product may make them worse. Also, clear discoloration of the lids, they look darker along the lashes line, but I don&#x27;t really mind it.</li>
            <li> Forget Lattise, this is much cheaper and really does work. I&#x27;ve been debating on trying Lattise before I bought this but was afraid my blue eyes would turn brown(common side effect) so I gave this a try. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and I&#x27;m really surprised at how much fuller and longer my lashes are. I will definitely buy again. I just put it on once before bed time and have had no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have been using it for three months now, and my lashes are long! the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the price double. I had to buy another tube, and I was disappointed to see the price had gone up so high.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work like it use to be before i pourchase the same brand and it worked now this its a hard to see the différence i am a bit deceive.</li>
            <li> Nutralux makes your lashes way longer but not that much thicker. It is pricey if purchased in the stores but is more affordable on line</li>
            <li> Was excited to receive the nutraluxe lash md from amazon yesterday, however...........  Last night I put the product on, felt a little burning sensation and immediately flushed my eyes with water.  Approximately 1 hour later, I viewed myself in the mirror and I looked as if I had pinkeye.  I flushed my eyes again to no avail.  Later  in the evening I developed a headache (I&#x27;m not one to get headaches,) my eyes felt as if they were throbbing, and I felt a great amount of pressure behind both eyes.  At this point, I put visine in both eyes and took some naproxyn and went to sleep.  I woke up this morning to take my dogs out, and the bright sun literally made my eyes and head throb--I have never experienced this before.  I  looked in the mirror again  today and my eyes are red, swollen, and extremely photosensitive.  I have tried three similar products in the past and have not experienced any of these symptoms.  I know for a fact that the product is to blame because my daughter is experiencing similar symptoms after we used this product together last night.  We followed the directions as written..............never expected to have this reaction.  I wrote to the company and am waiting for a response--will update this when the company responds to let you know about their customer service.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes got so long that I only need to use it once a week now. Just use on upper lids. Do not re-dip. A little goes a long way. If it makes your eyes red go to every other day. Stick it out you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  It does take about 6 weeks before you see results.  At first you think nothing is happening and then right around the 6 week mark you look in the mirror and WOW!!  My lashes are thick and long and sometime people ask me if they are fake they&#x27;re so long.  I used it every night for the first 6 weeks.  Once I saw results I cut back to every other night or so.  You do have to keep using it or your long thick lashes will fade away.  I have had no side effects, but have had friends who have said it irritates their eyes, but more friends like myself who have not been adversely effected at all.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it sure does work for me!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a \\&quot;ho humm\\&quot; review a few months back: it seemed better somehow from a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; I ordered previously around the same price range.  I am now waiting for my second tube.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, honestly, for the price range we are in here (especially) this stuff is EXCELLENT.  This product is GOOD.  It is NOT a ripoff.  It is an honorably, honestly marketed product that lives up to the claims.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed, I really am.&lt;br /&gt;If you are anything like me, you cannot afford the price of a new car to plump out natural eyelash reality.  I am telling you, this product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;Do you wake up in a week and magically look like Betty Davis eyes in her twenties? oh come on, you know not.  But it is unmistakable  that after a few weeks, even with sloppy application (fairly regular - not religiously perfect!  ;)  you will begin to hesitate a second and look at your lashes and as the weeks go by be very pleased and beyond a doubt see a real significant improvement in length, color, and maybe a bit in thickness.&lt;br /&gt;This product is Good!! It&#x27;s honest.  It delivers.  It is a definite yes!  Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it.  I swear.  If not, oh honey, go have lunch with Paris and pay thousands for whatever miracle products may or may not exist.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> Terrible reaction to this product. Beet-red eyes for two days, bad headache the first day and a black staining around my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes grew back on their own or from this product but it does leave your eyes itchy&lt;br /&gt;My lashes were ripped out from extensions but have grown back about 50% in the past few months</li>
            <li> I put it on the first time at night and the next morning my eyes were all red. Waited a couple days and put in on again at night, the next day my eyes were all red again! I had to request for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after another I usually buy went up in price.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.  I notice a little length, but really not worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product at first because it&#x27;s not prescription (which made me doubt its authenticity), but all doubts have faded. It took about 3 weeks to notice a difference, and three months later I&#x27;m getting so many comments on how great my lashes are. Before they were short and straight, now they are long and curly. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were getting sparse, I used this for 2 weeks, I quit using it cuz it does work! Makes the eyes real red if you get it in your eyes, so be so careful! It works wonders on the eyebrows too! Fixes sparse eyebrows &amp; lashes!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Be patient, it takes afew weeks to work but its worth it! I have used it for 6 months, long full lashes...amazing!</li>
            <li> Definitely have longer thicker lashes...love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon and have been using it for a month. I applied as an eyeliner and then as a mascara (swiping it up on my lashes, like we do with the mascara&#x27;s wand). My lashes are longer and they look great. I was applying it a couple times or more daily. At the beginning I didn&#x27;t see a difference and almost returned it, thinking it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;But everyone noticed that my lashes were longer and I am happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to read as many reviews as possible, and if you want to be cautious next time you buy something off amazon, look for reviews of certified buyers and then check their reviews to see if they review other things/brands. Over 150 reviews are certified buyers and that&#x27;s why I decided to buy it. The only downside is that I did not see any thickness, only growth. A friend also bought it off amazon and she saw growth and thickness.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, this Does Work!  It takes a week or so before you start to see any difference and it&#x27;s pretty slight at first, but then as you continue to use it, it will become more apparant that your lashes are definitely longer and a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things I have noted while using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes itched and were kind of gunky the first few times I used it, but if you don&#x27;t use too much, it gets better pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelids are kind of pink-ish, or slightly darker around my lashline now.  It&#x27;s not super noticeable to others (I&#x27;ve asked my husband and daughter) but I definitely notice a slight change of color.&lt;br /&gt;If you get lazy and quit using it every night you probably won&#x27;t see a significant change...but if you quit using it for a week or two, you&#x27;ll notice your lashes are going back to how they were prior to using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed that my lashes are darker.  When I was young they were black, now they&#x27;re a medium brown and the new lash growth is medium brown, as well.&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t noticed that they are significantly thicker...more like slightly thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product definitely works and works well.</li>
            <li> This is a miraculous product! I love it! I don&#x27;t need to use a lash curler anymore. My eyelashes look longer and thicker. They look great even if I don&#x27;t use mascara. The tube lasts much longer than it says. I won&#x27;t stop using it!</li>
            <li> This product started showing results in just over two weeks. After a couple of months I had to wear less mascara because I looked like spider eyes. People actually notice my eyelashes and comment on their length. After obtaining the results you want, then use once or twice a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I looooove  this item! My eyelashes got really longer and more volume since I started use this. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am 65 and my lids were practically bald.  But now I have a full set of lashes to die for.  I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love love love this, it totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;This product make your eyelash longer, but I&#x27;m not sure about make it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Still,, I love this products!&lt;br /&gt;U&lt;br /&gt;You can use this fit eyebrow too:-)</li>
            <li> To say I am stunned would be an understatement. I am 65 years old and have NEVER had lashes this long or this full. Everytime I put on mascara I am just amazed. I mean I REALLY have very long and full lashes. Just blows my mind. LOVE IT!!!  Make sure you use it everynight and the product will last a long time too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big improvement in my lashes, but my eyebrows are much improved.  The gap in one brow has disappeared and both look much fuller.  I now use it about three times a week to maintain them.</li>
            <li> Before this product I purchased revitalash. While Revitalash made my lashes grow very long ( over 1&amp;#34; ),  I never saw fuller or darker lashes, so I had three very long lashes, of which one would be white (LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Nutra, my lashes not only grow, they are also darker and fuller; the longest they have grown is 3/4 of an inch, something I am more than happy with given that I have more lashes than I ever did, and none of them is white!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product left my eyes red and irritated for 4 days straight!!! Not only that, but they hurt and felt heavy! I have never tried a product like this and do not recommend. It looked as though I had been crying for days. I regret wasting $50 some dollars on this!!!</li>
            <li> I only used this for a couple weeks so not sure if it actually makes your eyelashes grow. This product turned the whites of my eye a purplish color so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Bought it to fill in some over-plucked brows &amp; ended up using it for both brows and lashes.  Works really great. Only problem is that the new lashes come in growing in every direction, so you&#x27;d definitely need mascara (clear or tinted) to train the new growth.</li>
            <li> Definitely longer eyelashes if you have patience to use it every night. Once you stop using it, the length and density of the eyelashes will go back to original.</li>
            <li> The product works but it takes time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  People ask me all the time if I use Latisse or what kind of mascara I use and it is Nutra Luxe Lash that has made my lashes so long.  It look about 8 weeks of use before I started seeing results but I have been using it for over a year now and still love the results.  It is well worth the price because it has lasted over a year and I use it almost daily.  I wear contacts and it has not bothered my eyes.  Also, I have green eyes and have not noticed any discoloration like similar products warn about.</li>
            <li> Work great!  But don&#x27;t over use, because of the active ingredient, causes dark circles under eyes if used excessively like I did (several times day) follow directions.  Now that the dark circles have disappered l am going to tryonce a day.  Am currently only using  twice week with with mascacra , but my lashes look great natural.  Love this product. This product works almost instantly LOVE LOVE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!!</li>
            <li> Certainly did not work for me. a big disappointment and waste of money. I noticed that some of the other comments were negative but took a chance. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, short, Asian lashes. After using it for almost about a month now, my lashes are awesome. I won&#x27;t say it is fake lash like, but I definitely notice the difference. My lashes are twice as long now! I use it every day. I hope my lashes will keep on growing longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this item that long to see results, but I will continue to use it. I&#x27;m excited to see the end results</li>
            <li> I order this item it was what people told me about I used it and it worked thank you very much. I will be ordering soon. Christmas is coming up thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and already see a difference. I don&#x27;t think my lashes are any thicker, but they are longer and stronger. I don&#x27;t seem to be loosing lashes like I was before.</li>
            <li> This product works really well! My eyelashes are longer and there are more of them. I also use it on my eyebrows and have restored over tweezed brows to perfect eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I had already used it for 6 mos, I really got good results,and wanted to buy a larger size. Also wanted to buy from the company.I&#x27;m 66,and had been sick 3 yrs,in which time my lashes were falling out.My brows were also falling out. Lashes are really long,and brows are getting thicker. Love it!</li>
            <li> Received product promptly.  Have been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed an improvement on my eyelashes.  Would purchase from this seller again. Ana R</li>
            <li> Very happy with Nutra LUXE MD.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product for two months, I saw pretty fast effects, my eyelashes were long and nice, then they started to fall off.  I&#x27;m still using this product, but my lashes are just a little longer than before to use Nutra Luxe Lash MD.  For the price... it is OK, but I would like that my lashes stay long as at the beginning.</li>
            <li> It works really great like revitalash but the problem with this product on me; It makes my eyes red and scary... There is something maybe on this product that I&#x27;m allergic to..</li>
            <li> I used this product ONCE and woke up the next morning with lashes and brows falling out. Eyelids irritated and red. I am not an allergic type. I can&#x27;t remeber ever having to stop using a make-up, moisturizer etc. I have read the other positive reviews about this product, but I would be very cautious.</li>
            <li> This product truly works! I have been using it for about six months and have had wonderful results. My lashes are thicker, longer and much darker.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have always had short lashes.  I constantly get compliments on the length of my lashes now I would buy it over and over.  Also I have two daughters who love it.  And I have clients who have noticed the difference and they are now buying.</li>
            <li> Works , but way over priced</li>
            <li> I have been using this produsct for almost 1 month and I am not sure that i can see any differance at all yet, but will continue to use it until it is gone and watch daily for any change.</li>
            <li> Gave me redness and itchiness</li>
            <li> I got my first one as a present. I was convinced it is &amp;#34;just another product to put on at night&amp;#34; and was very sceptical it will do what it promissed. But after using it for 3 weeks my eye lashes were already longer and thicker. I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;After it I had used it off I forgot about it. Few month later I noticed that my new eye lashes are not as long and strong anymore. So I ordered it now myself. About 3 weeks later I again noticed thicker and longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will stay with it now!</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to mention that I never wrote out even a negative review at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This one bombs! After I used it, my eyes were red, itchy, kind of swollen.. All the negative effects came out.&lt;br /&gt;I have used 2 different eyelash conditioners (lilash, revitalash)those were all fine.&lt;br /&gt;If you care your eyes Do not use this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: NUTRALUXE doesn&#x27;t accept the return once you use the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now. I really didn&#x27;t want to spend the money when I saw the price, but I have some really short and thin lashes. After a few weeks, I saw the length in my lashes extend and to be honest I was actually surprised. Thickness, not so much. But that price is already worth a few cm longer on my lashes!</li>
            <li> Like many women, my lashes had become very sparse as I got older.  I had been warned that it takes a while to take effect, so I was unconcered that six-eight weeks went by without any noticeable difference.  Then it seemed like overnight, I had both thicker and MUCH longer lashes than I had ever had.  This is a wonderful product and so reasonably priced.  Like other users, I have been using it for five months now and am going to order another one for when this one finally does run out.  I have also ordered their \\&quot;face lift\\&quot; product.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be patient when starting to use Nutra Luxe, it does take a while before you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> great lash lengthener...works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago, after seeing what it did for my for my 64 year old sister&#x27;s eyelashes. I actually asked her if she had lash extensions (who else can you ask such personal questions?).  She told me that her lashes had to be trimmed because they brushed against her sunglasses since she started using it!  Well, that convinced me.  If it worked on my sister who is 8 years older than I, it would have to work on me.  Shortly after I started using it, the women in my office wanted to know what was going on with my lashes. Guess what they got for Christmas that year?  Then word spread to my entire workplace floor. I went through a package of post-its writing down the information and telling them to buy it from Amazon.  A saleswoman at a high-end cosmetics counter wanted to know what I was using, (and her company actually offered something similar).  Even she wanted to get this incredible product for herself. I continue to be asked about my lashes and always share my little beauty secret. One tip - apply it after you apply your foundation (if you use foundation), but before you apply any eye makeup. Don&#x27;t apply it at bedtime, as the instructions suggest.  When you close your eyes to sleep, it can sting if it&#x27;s not dry.  I will use this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and use daily with no results.  Will continue to use until gone but I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lash growth but it has severely irritated the whites of my eyes to the point of being red &amp; blood shot.  I plan to only use on my eyebrows from now on.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. Amazing product.  Takes a few weeks to see results. Works as well as much higher priced product available at dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle of it.  I have blond hair and it makes my lashes not only longer and fuller, but also darker.  People really notice my eyes now and when I wear mascara, people look twice and compliment me.  I have been asked if I have eyelash extensions or other false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Put on the product at night after you&#x27;ve washed your face for bed.  Very simple.</li>
            <li> I lovin it. It really works. in 5 weeks my lashes are good. bunch of new. they are long. im going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months now.  I have not really noticed any results.  I will probably keep using the bottle and see if there are any results after a few months. I heard from my friends that it takes a few months to see the results.</li>
            <li> wow!!!! this works!!!</li>
            <li> Worked the first time. Then I started losing my lashes. And the second one could have been Water. It did&#x27;nt work at all</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those wanted fuller and longer lashes. this product works great. I have had great results. I used it every night for the first couple months and now just do it 3-4 times a week and my lashes are noticeably longer and fuller. I love it and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout or cause any harsh side affects. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. Works great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in August and its December now. I cant tell you how many compliments my lashes get. When i put mascara on, it looks like i have fake lashes on. Growing out my own makes them look more fabulouse then the ones you get at a salon. Im so happy I bought this product. It did sting the first couple times i used it, but now with practice im keeping it out of my eyes. I&#x27;m still using the same bottle I purchased 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite certain that the majority of these positive reviews are fake. This product left my eyes awfully bloodshot and red, the same pink eye look that has been described by others. This product is not reputable and should be banned from amazon.</li>
            <li> because friends of mine at work bought it and the result was great after a month , so i bought it to</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.  I have so many comments on my lashes.  some people don&#x27;t know why I look so great until I explain to them I have eye lashes again.</li>
            <li> This product has done exactly what it said it would.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  I tried lash extensions, which I loved, but there&#x27;s no comparison to having long lush lashes that are actually your own. A friend purchased this at the same time I did, however her eyes are very sensitive to a number of products.  This one was no exception, and caused her discomfort. However, she applied this product after using pre-soaked eyemakeup remover pads.  I followed the directions completely, and have not expereiced any problems whatsoever.  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, and I will continue buying and using this.</li>
            <li> I started using a more expensive eyelash lengthener, but got concerned about the changes to the skin color on my eyelids. After doing some research, I found this product.  It&#x27;s been great in lengthening and thickening my lashes, without the side effects.  And, it&#x27;s about 1/3 the cost of the other product! I&#x27;m sold on Nutra Luxe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now. This is a great price and provides fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that were similar to this, but after about a week I could see a real difference in my eyelashes,  I am in my sixties and my lashes are thinning.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, and after several weeks I see a huge difference in my lash length.  It doesn&#x27;t itch or burn as it did on her at first, and I have not run out yet, been using for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately it is not available in NZ and the manufacturer will not send it here either, but by having it sent to a friend and that friend sending it to me it works well, a bit of a bummer having to do this but I don&#x27;t have a choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are way better than they used to be, I did try the product on my brows but that didn&#x27;t work as in my youth I \\&quot;over plucked\\&quot; them which was the fashion then.  I use it on my lashes every second day now that I have the length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for months now and it most definitely works! I have long lush lashes! Previously I bought it from a local spa but to save a little money I decided to buy it online.  Well, though I&#x27;ve contacted amazon and never got a response...when my package arrived it looked tampered with so I&#x27;ve not used the one I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown since using this product, but I had to discontinue the use because it leaves my eyes so bloodshot red. I apply it at night and the next day, my eyes would be red the entire day so much so people would ask me if I had a long night...I want longer lashes, but not bloodshot eyes so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfid at thaïs product it is very performance.  Thé combinaition for quality versus the prince is very fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past and this product works comparable to Latisse.  Maybe not 100% but pretty close.  I would use it instead of Latisse especially based on cost</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I stop using it so I can&#x27;t provide the review if the product actually works.  My eyes were burning after using it and turns red.  I had to stop using. I guess my eyes are more senstive.  It didn&#x27;t happen when I use Latisse.</li>
            <li> I just received nutra luxe and used it for 2 days.  The product is extremely irritating to the eyes.  My eyelids were very red and my eyes were completely bloodshot.  My eyes were also very photo sensitive and hurt when exposed to light (felt actual pain in my eyes and behind them).  I had to use Visine eye drops for three days to address the soreness and redness.  I have tried other eyelash enhancers from Revitalash, Idolash etc with no such reaction to them.</li>
            <li> I hate to give this product one star since I haven&#x27;t actually used it, but I have to warn others that you might receive a counterfeit item like I did.  The bottle is different from the one in the picture and on the Nutra Luxe Lash MD website.  The bottle I received says \\&quot;nutraluxe lash\\&quot; and then the trademark sign.  All lowercase and no MD.  I decided to look on the manufacturer&#x27;s website to see if perhaps they have additional bottle styles.  Nope.  Also, the manufacturer&#x27;s website actually states that counterfeits are being sold on Amazon.com.  Yikes!  Thank goodness Amazon is refunding my $40!&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the people who have had great results from this product received the counterfeit bottle or the real bottle.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just realized that they sent me the 3mL bottle, not the 4.5mL!  They even marked the bottle as 4.5mL.  How deceptive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month.  I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my lashes.  Expected more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been using these Nutra Luxe products for several months.  After the first month I could tell a difference in my eyelashes.  They are definitely longer.  Since I lost my eyelashes due to chemo two years ago, this product has helped my lashes return to better than normal.  Friends comment on how long my lashes are.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I definitely see a difference in my brows! I have never been so pleased with a growth-accelerating product before!</li>
            <li> Product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I had hardly no side effects other than gooey stuff in my eye, like when you wake up from sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;my lashes have really grown. I have been using this product for a month now and I still have some left.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Do not use during the day your eyes will be bloodshot. Strictly a nighttime use, but using continuously the results are just amazing. People ask me all the time what I am doing to my lashes and I very nicely say &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t changed  anything!&amp;#34; Great great great! Keeping this secret for sure</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but didn&#x27;t get a chance to try as it made my eyes irritated and red for a few days. Wasn&#x27;t worth the bloodshot look...I&#x27;ll be searching for another product.</li>
            <li> I chose a 5 start because the product actually works. I must also warn you that although it is ALL NATURAL it can still be VERY irritating to the eyelid. I continue to put up with the now occasional irritation because I love having the long lashes. And I say &amp;#34;now occasional&amp;#34; because I have been using this product for almost a year now and the irritation is diminishing; that said, a year is a long time putting up with irritations, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 3 nights.  I do feel that there is too much burning in my eyes after each application.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!!!!  I use it as instructed, every night...and no joke my lashes are soooo long I actually have people commenting on them!!  They are fuller and I can now go without mascara on a &#x27;no make-up&#x27; day.  I have never had long lashes and now I do..this is pure magic...highly reccommended!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> lashes are very much improved in both length and thickness.  the product does not irritate my eyes like some others I have tried.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I ordered it for a friend of mine who has very little eyelashes. She was so happy with it she asked me to order it again. She thinks it&#x27;s a 5 star product and is very happy with it. (I personally don&#x27;t need it, YET).</li>
            <li> I recommend spending a few dollars more and actually buy a product that works, knock offs are a hit or miss. And this was a miss.  :( bummer.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected and it is working. Much cheaper than the prescription medicine. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I originally bought it because a friend had had such great success. I have always had short insignificant eye lashes but now they are lovely and long. I use far less mascara now. Very, very happy.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this product .. I been using for 3 months now my lashes are long and pretty .. Has some irritation for the fist month but gone now.. Love it</li>
            <li> Takes about 8 weeks to see dramatic results. But they come. This might be the first time something has actually worked as advertised...</li>
            <li> I began using this product at the end of January.  At first, I did have some burning and irritation after use.  I realized that if I took off my eye makeup at night and then waited a while before using the Nutra Luxe, the irritation subsided mostly.  I think the combo of eye makeup remover and the lash serum was just too much.  I am on my second bottle now and I absolutely love it!  My lashes are much longer and look almost fake.  I use it twice a day but stopped using it on my bottom lashes after a few weeks - they got long fast, and I was worried that they would get too long.  I can&#x27;t really tell if they are thicker but they are definitely longer.  My lashes on the outer corner of my eyes grew long first (noticeably longer than my other lashes) and then there was a funky period of uneven lash growth.  Some lashes would be very long and others would be my normal length.  Now they are all pretty much the same in length.  I haven&#x27;t used the product in two weeks (I was out) and they are still long and still seem to be growing well.  My co-worker has been using this a month longer than I have and her lashes look as good if not better than they did when she had eyelash extensions. I would recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I have always had alright eyelashes.  when I started getting false eyelashes from the salon every time I took them out it was ripping some of my real with them.  I was starting to look so bare it was sad.  After 1 tube of this I started to notice how long my lashes are. There back to normal but better! They are getting longer and darker and starting to curl.  I am on my second tube.  I don&#x27;t use this everyday bc I forget alot.  But I defiantly am sure I see a difference due to this stuff.  Im going to keep using it and I will buy more.  I might also try another brand only to see if I can get any more results.  I&#x27;m addicted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it but be patient.  Maybe use it everyday and see more results than I did.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and noticed my lashes and brows were not like they use to be. I was getting bald spots in my brows and what hair I did have was stiff and unruly! My lashes would go through phases of growth then fall out. I have been using Nutra Luxe for 6 weeks and I am AMAZED at the results! My husband said I need to stop using it because they are getting too long! REALLY It has made my brows silky and filled in all the bald spots. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Im not one to write reviews so ill keep it simple. Bern using this for 2 years, i get soooo many complements about my eyelashes. They are ridicoulsy long, so long alot of the time people asked me if i had them done at salong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get little red and ichy but because of the result i dont care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE, this works!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nutra Luxe Lash MD for several months now. The REAL product works like a charm. BUT don&#x27;t buy from this seller! They sell FAKE product! You will only waste your money. Product arrived without the plastic cover. After using it just for a couple of weeks, I can tell it is either fake or diluted. My lashes not only stopped growing, but also started to fall out like crazy. The seller claims that they are the official distributor, but they refused to take the product back. Looking at the email they are writing me from it is clear that they have nothing to do with the official distributor. I just wanted to warn people. As for me I will always be buying it from official website.</li>
            <li> Works so well - I have goddess eyelashes now!  I can open my eyes wide and they touch my eyebrows...no joke!  You must keep using it or your eyelashes go back to normal.  I have no discoloration in my skin where it&#x27;s applied.  But my eyes get super bloodshot so I put it on at night before bed and then when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job and I no longer have bloodshot eyes!</li>
            <li> While Nutra LUXE LASH MD does help your lashes to grow, I&#x27;ve used a much better product.  The average price gives you average results.</li>
            <li> My friend recommends this to me.  Don&#x27;t know why my eyes looks darker after applying it.  No improvement seen yet but will keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, on and off, for about a year now. It is truly amazing, it really makes your lashes grow and makes people wonder if you are using falsies. I use it every night (not morning and night) and what has worked for me is to use it every night for about two weeks and my lashes become super long, and from then on I use it only every other night. But be aware that if you stop using it, or you remember to use it like once a week, your lashes will return to your natural lenght.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive eyes so for me it is really important to apply a small amount of product and be careful not to touch the skin, just the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Also, in terms of fullness and color, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the lenght is so amazing that just a little mascara does the rest!</li>
            <li> The very first morning that I woke up after using this product the night before my eyes were so sore, bloodshot and irritated. It felt like I had sandpaper for eyelids. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this product but it can&#x27;t be good for your eyes and I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I want to see if it works, I tried false eye lashes and now I have very thin eyelashes.  I hjust recieved the item on 28 of January, so I will have to waite for my proof.</li>
            <li> I used Nutra Luxe Lash regularly for about two weeks and did notice a slight difference.  I have very short lashes and wanted something to make them fuller.  It is easy to apply with the fine, tiny brush.  When used regularly, you will see a difference, but not a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe its a good product -I don&#x27;t if it is . It irritates my eyes so much that I cant use it at all</li>
            <li> I have been using eurolash from Neiman Marcus for several years---it runs $125 for a bottle 1/2 this size. This product works just as well for less than half the price!</li>
            <li> I used to use mascara every day, but after 1 month of using this product I don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are long and strong and almost look like as if Im wearing mascara, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she has been thrilled!!!! I myself have definitely seen HUGE results! After about a few days of consistent use her lashes are for sure longer and a little thicker. These mainly lengthen the lashes, not thicken, but nonetheless it does what it is meant to do. Would definitely 100% recommend this to those looking to increase the length of their lashes naturally without using mascara or fake lashes.</li>
            <li> This product works well for increasing thickness not length  Seems like these products do one or the other. But my lashes are very thick now for sure. Took only about a month to see the difference. For the $ this is a great product. If u have thick lashes and want them longer this isn&#x27;t the one for u. Try Li Lash. More expensive but great length.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I started out using a prescription of latisse, but then decided to try something less expensive.  I was beyond happy with this product.  It works equally as well as the latisse but is half the cost.  This stuff is great.  People ask me all the time if my lashes are real.  When I tell them yes, they are so shocked and usually tell me how lucky I am.  I tell them my lashes didn&#x27;t used to look like this, and I&#x27;ve recommended this product to several women.  It&#x27;s great stuff!  Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to discovering this serum I had lash extensions which cost $75 every two weeks to re-touch as I naturally had short and thin lashes (I am Korean).  I did this for 3 years, till I started researching an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received it I used it twice a day, I&#x27;m not very patient, till I noticed a difference then switched to once a day after 3 weeks.  That was a few months ago, I&#x27;m on my third tube now and my lashes are longer than ever before.  People are amazed that my lashes are real. Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> how little I use, I had read reviews stating that if you use too much it will burn, so I made it a point to use as little as possible, but always had the same results, red and burning eyes all day, I even had to use eye drops for relief, which I am terrible with, hate to use eye drops, so it was just not worth the hassle for me, I can&#x27;t attest to how it works on eye lashes because I couldn&#x27;t keep using it, I do use it on my eye brows however and don&#x27;t see much difference, I will go back to Envyderm.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the reviews I read said it worked.  They said you would notice results within 4-6 weeks.  I noticed some lengthening of my eyelashes within 2 weeks.  By 6 weeks my eyelashes were much longer and starting to thicken also.  I used to use an eyelash curler everyday.  Now it is not necessary because my eyelashes have curl and body so that when I put my mascara on they look like I&#x27;ve curled them. This is a wonderful product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because after I turned 55, my eyebrows started to get very thin in places. I originally bought this product from a person who I get facials from.  She sold it to me for a LOT more than what I currently pay on Amazon.  It does take time for the results to show, but after a few months I started to grow eyebrows in the places that had become noticeably thin.  I will continue to use this product indefinitely because when I stop using it, my eyebrows start getting thin again.</li>
            <li> It works!  I only use it once a day and I&#x27;m getting great results.  I put it on after my shower, before makeup, every day.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months now and I still have plenty in the bottle.  It was well worth the money!  I love that it&#x27;s affordable, easy to use and effective!!</li>
            <li> I started noticing a change within 7 days of using this product.  I applied it nightly before bed. Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> For some reason, I am having an allergic response to this product when applied to eye lashes. However I am still using it on my eye brows, too early to determine results. Will keep you posted</li>
            <li> So far my eyelashes have shown length. I have not seen Darker or thicker eyelashes. I have been using this product for over 5 months now. I just add mascara to my eyelashes for a darker and thicker effect. Wi do reccomend it to anyone who has small thinning eyelashes. Ill buy again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months. My eye lashes were doing horrible. I had some missing eye lashes on one eye for some reason and no amount of mascara could help that and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with fake ones.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes have filled in and I haven&#x27;t really experienced any side effects except a little stinging, but that was it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> The item came on time, I&#x27;m seeing progress with each day I use it.  I only put on a little mascara to make my lashes dramatically stand out, and I do see a difference in the length. I will be buying another bottle!</li>
            <li> I read very good reviews about it. I sent it to my sister in Australia, but I have not receive any feedback from her. I am sure it will work well. Soon I will order one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Raquel</li>
            <li> They are switching the product.. It is not the real deal it is a fake and they send u 3 ml instead of 4.5 as stated.. For the money choose something else</li>
            <li> Great product, have used others much more expensive and this by far works as well if not better. This is my second purchase of this product. My sister &amp; daughter also use this with great results. No irritation or problems from any of us and my sister has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes and did not make my lashes grow.</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now. This it the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered it. Works in about 2-3 weeks. Sometimes it does cause redness on you eyelids, but it goes away. Doesn&#x27;t bother me. The length of my eyelashes out weighs the redness.</li>
            <li> Great product.does exactly what it sad.My lashes doubled in size and fulness without any side effects  .This is my second one .and i&#x27;ll be keep using it:-)</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as stated and I was careful to check it&#x27;s authenticity as there seemed to be some feedback about counterfeits.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and have noticed my lashes are longer and a bit thicker.  I was concerned about irritation, but I followed the directions exactly and have had no problems.  I am  pleased with the product and my shipping experience!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since April of 2013.  It is unbelievable what this product has done.  I am CONSTANTLY commented on my eyelashes.  They are so long and lush.  I am a natural blonde with darker lashes that as I have gotten older were not very long or healthy anymore.  The change took some time and in fact I was skeptical that it was even doing anything but thought I would at least use up the product.  I got the 4.5 ML and still have quite a bit left.  I use it every night and LOVE it.  I have the most beautiful long healthy almost fake looking lashes.  I highly recommend!  It is WORTH every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really does lengthen you lashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but it darkens your skin around the eyes a bit. Its not permanent but after a few uses you do notice darkened orbits.</li>
            <li> Ive heard a lot of good things havent seen results yet but i hear it takes about six weeks so i am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I like what this products does for my lashes. It helps grow longer and fuller. No side effects. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything that worked on my lashes like this.  I have people all the time comment on the lenght of my lashes</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. I have tried more expensive products that have given the exact same results. It is a great product at a very reasonable price! It did make my eyes a little dry and itchy for the first 2-3 days, but I sort of expected this. Would still definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the end of last year and I am buying it again. I have had wonderful results and stopped wearing mascara on my upper lashes. Some tips: 1. stick with it -- it takes time to see the full results 2. make sure your eye lids are clean, clean, clean before you apply the Nutra LUXE 3. plan to make it part of your regimen -- once your lashes are full, you will want to maintain them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I hope you get the same results that I did!</li>
            <li> This is my third vial of Nutra LUXE LASH MD because it works just as well as Latisse [which is 3x more expensive].&lt;br /&gt;It does not grow new lashes but really increases length and texture..., and it stimulates growth of sparse brows too.&lt;br /&gt;Applicator is sensible and less waste than drops &amp; brush brands.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that it darkened my light brown brows to dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using the product. It came well packaged in a timely manner. I have used Latisse in the past. The jury is out until about 6 weeks. I assume the product will be as advertized. Either way there will be a further review.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  My eyelashes are amazing. While it did not seem to thicken my lashes, the length of my eyelashes increased dramatically. I would (and have) recommended this highly.</li>
            <li> It gives good results, rapidly : but can sometimes hurt in the eyes :( be careful when you apply it</li>
            <li> Took about two months this to see results but I have long lashes now! They do tend to curl a bit which is not a big problem. The biggest downfall is that the skin around my eyes has become darkened, so without coverup on I look very tired. But the lashes are so long, my friend pulled on them just to see if they were real!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I had never tried any eyelash enhances. This one seems to work. My eye lashes are naturally barely visible. With this product I can tell that they are longer and I seem thicker.  No noticeable side effects. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> My lashes started falling out in separate areas.  They became very sparse.  I had to do something...  I read about this stuff and decided to try it.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using it now for over a year and my lashes are long, thick, and beautiful!  People are always telling me what pretty lashes I have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical about products that advertise such results but this product truly works!  My lashes are longer, they curl on their own and are much fuller and even. I don&#x27;t spend near as much time applying mascara trying to perfect my lashes with the wand.  Even when i&#x27;m not wearing mascara i receive compliments on my eyelashes. I will definitely be buying this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a picture before,  I noticed more lashes by week 2.&lt;br /&gt; was going to give it at least 6 weeks like it says.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> this product which I received  contains prostaglandin per the box.. this changes eyes from blue to brown does anyone else have any more info on this.. I stopped using it because of this ingredient yet it does not list it above in the description..</li>
            <li> after 4 weeks and applying twice a day I still have no growth or improvemnet:( I am dissapointed and will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good product same effect of the other expensive bran, this one is really affordable my lashes is long an full in just 3 weeks. Love it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001WAKUUC Nutra LUXE LASH MD Physican Formulated-Ophthalmologist Tested 4.5 ml]] I purchased my first product at a salon and spa in Fort Myers and loved it.  When I needed a refill, I was at home in Oklahoma so I googled and found what I needed on Amazon.  I was thrilled since there was such a savings.  The product does everything that I was told it would.  My lashes are long and curly.  WOW! There is a slight redness but it is very easy to cover.  My eye specialist does not have a problem with my using this product.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts about the product --- But it really WORKS!  I didn&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, now they are thicker and much longer.  In fact, they now are so long they brush against my glasses!</li>
            <li> Product works very well. Used to makeup my very pale eyebrows every morning, but I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore because my eyebrows are so thick and darker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item the ending of August; at first I was a little reluctant I have tried latisse in the past which didn&#x27;t WOW me as I expected it to. My lashes are medium length and by trying flash lashes cause me to lose some. When I started using this product my eyes did burn and itch some which is normal. I decided to do this review b/c it&#x27;s almost November and I have seen a dramatic change in my lashes. They are so long and full I have seen a big difference in my lashes with this product. My only concern is if I stop using it will they stay the same length or will they go back in also, I wonder how long they will grow if I keep using it. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow long natural beautiful lashes. Good Luck!!</li>
            <li> The item I received came in a pink box, like the one shown above... only there was a silver trim around the edges, and the font is slightly different. I&#x27;m sure I never would have noticed these minor differences, if it weren&#x27;t for the product name, which blatantly omits the \\&quot;MD\\&quot;. The box of the product I received read \\&quot;NUTRALUXELASH\\&quot;, all uppercase, one word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube itself is even that much shadier. It says \\&quot;nutraluxe lash\\&quot; in a large all lower-case verdana type font. Still no \\&quot;MD\\&quot;, and not in remotely the same font as you see here in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is going back, I&#x27;m not about to put anything near my EYES that is this shady....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time since my esthetician recommended it.  The results have been outstanding.  I have beautiful long and curly lashes.  Everybody asks me if I wear false eyelashes. I even put it on my eyebrows and now I have fuller eyebrows.  I put it on every night before going to bed.  I fully recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;H. Rivé</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and only after using it two times I had a brownish circle around my eyes.  I need to return the product due to this!  In my attempt to return Amazon is stating it is not refundable.  I disagree to this due to the nature of the reason to return this item.  Their reason was that the manufacturer did not allow returns on opened products.  I went to the Nurta Luxe MD official website and this is their return policy .  There seems to be a problem here!!!!  I am not happy with this situation at all!!!  any one else have this issue?  any suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return/exchange policy&lt;br /&gt;You may return the item(s) to us within 30 days of your purchase for a full refund or exchange. Items must be returned in original condition and original packaging (manufacturer&#x27;s box, plastic bags, etc) accompanied by receipt or proof of purchase. Please note that the original and return shipping and handling charges will NOT be refunded or reimbursed under any circumstances.</li>
            <li> It really works.  Takes about 2-3 weeks for lashes to grow long.&lt;br /&gt;Caused some slight itching at times around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product...it takes about 5 weeks to see the difference, and the lashes are longer and fuller. I love it.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve wanted long eyelashes. Well, when I read the reviews for this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and try it. I wasn&#x27;t even scared about the blood shot eyes because I thought that the long eyelashes would make it worth it. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now morning and night and sadly nothing has happened. No hurt eyes. No long eyelashes. Just nothing. Not sure if somethings wrong with my serum but I&#x27;m very very sad. Guess i&#x27;ll have to try something else. Hope it works better for everyone else!</li>
            <li> Works great, noticed a change in 2 weeks!  Haven&#x27;t noticed more lashes, just longer stronger lashes.  I will continue to use</li>
            <li> I have used grande lash, which is more expensive and i have received the same results from this product! Definitely will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Wow- worked better than Latisse.  I have longer, thicker and darker lashes!!  I have tried Latisse twice and did not get these results!!!  Much less money, too.</li>
            <li> I understand that it takes a while for it to work but I have been using everyday since March 22, 2013.  From the reviews I have read, it takes a few weeks to see any results but all I have experienced was itchy eyelids and redness in my eyes from time to time.  I have not noticed any growth whatsoever and I am applying a very thin layer to my upper lids.  There is something in the bottle that causes itchiness but it eventually subsides.  My plan is to use for another week or so then I will find something else.</li>
            <li> This is the best lash growth serum ever!&lt;br /&gt;In one month my eyelashes grew a lot. They are fuller and longer and beautiful. No side effects at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great -- it made my lashes noticeably longer and fuller within two weeks!  I would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I used the product every day for 3 months on my lashes and brows. My lashes are definitely longer, but not thicker (more lashes) than before. But longer&#x27;s good! I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my eyebrows, which I hoped would get fuller.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of days but had to stop because my eyelid became very sore and red.  I must be allergic to something in the formula.  I have used other lash growing products in the past and did not have this same reaction.  I decided to try Nutra Luxe because of the price.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months and my eyelashes grew very long which was great but they looked like tarantula legs.</li>
            <li> This is now the fourth or fifth eyelash serum that I have tried, and it will be my last! My eyebrows have thinned at the ends throughout the years, and my lashes are not the worse but in need of serious improvement since they have never been very long. They have gotten sparse and they don&#x27;t curl up very easy. I was very skeptical when I began using this product because after not getting very far from using the previous ones, I was just not expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed was the length and curl of my lashes...naturally...meaning before me putting on mascara! Additionally, my eyebrows are showing improvement on one side, so I am still waiting for the other side to start filling in those gaps... The next clear evidence of it&#x27;s effectiveness came ironically enough through &#x27;false&#x27; application... When it says \\&quot;use it sparingly\\&quot;, please take the advice! I used way too much and after a few weeks the bottom corners of my eyes are showing dark areas. By closer look I realized that those darker patches were indeed very fine hairs growing on the skin of the lower corners of my eyes! While I was sleeping, the excess liquid settled in those tiny pockets, and the formula initiated the hair growing process. Wow, right? I began removing the fine, unwanted hair immediately but thought how I have to share this experience with those using this product. Please don&#x27;t make my mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say something about the one or two negative reviews that I have seen on here. Most of us are real people sharing here and not fakers. If you have a bad reaction to the ingredients of the product, which is possible, it is unreasonable and unfair to give it a bad rep. Our comments here are to better understand the effectiveness claimed by many of the products being solicited. You don&#x27;t need to trash people&#x27;s positive experiences only because yours was not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to know of this product after asking my girlfriend where she was getting her lash extensions done... She wasn&#x27;t!!! Her lashes are so stunning, they almost look fake, and I am not exaggerating! She swore by Nutra Luxe and prompted me to get it! I believe I am into the fifth week of using it. Best of luck to you all trying it out, it&#x27;s worth every penny! :)ions done... She wasn&#x27;t!!! Her lashes are so stunning, they almost look fake, and I am not exaggerating! She swore by Nutra Luxe and prompted me to get it! I believe I am into the fifth week of using it. Best of luck to you all trying it out, it&#x27;s worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> J&#x27;en fais l&#x27;expérience depuis un mois et je suis très satisfaite des résultats. Mes cils sont vraiment plus longs, plus épais et avec le mascara le résultat est spectaculaire.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I had a gift certificate to a beauty website and it caught my eye.  i&#x27;ve tried other products in the past and had minimal results so i didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one.  I used as directed each night and honestly didn&#x27;t see much for about 2 months.  Then I started noticing random eyelashes were a lot longer than the rest.  I kept using it and within a month or so more, the rest of the eyelashes caught up.  This stuff actually works.  I constantly have strangers comment on my eyelashes.  I will say I did have pretty long eyelashes to start, but this has definitely helped them grow.  I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;ve increased in length about 1/8\\&quot;, which for eyelashes is pretty good.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> After several years of tattooing of my eyebrow, my right one was very thin.  I have tried other products that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription and none of them really worked.  Nutra Luxe Lash really did the job  You just need to be patient.  I am very happy with my brows.  I would recommend this to anyone that is in need of thicker brow.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I started using it and my eyelashes are so long!! They have never looked like this! I have customers and friends asking me every day if they are extensions!! My sister had extensions and mine look so much better and didn&#x27;t cost near as much money as hers did! I have had several friends order this product and I&#x27;ve ordered it for my daughter-n-laws!!</li>
            <li> When I received it, by the time I read all the terrible things that can happen if you use this product, I was too afraid to use it! I am also scared to resell it for fear I may be liable if something happens! Very scarry stuff!</li>
            <li> After I applied it each night to my lashes, I  really haven&#x27;t notice any significant improvement.  Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have always had longer than average eyelashes but two years ago I wanted to up my beauty so I started researching economically friendly eyelash enhancers (As a young professional I can&#x27;t afford latise) anyways after searching the web for a couple hours I came across nutra luxe. I researched the reviews on amazon (much like you are probably doing now) and decided it was worth a try. By about five weeks of using this product I would get asked if my lashes were real at least once every couple days. I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;how long do those last for&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; are you wearing fake eyelashes&amp;#34; more times than I can count. This product works and it works well. This does make my eye lids a little itchy and it does make them a little dark (once I stopped using my skin was normal) but I chose to endure the side effects because it offers such great results. Anyways it&#x27;s fun to change your image a little and this will help, and wort hurt your pocket either. PS I never tell anyone about this :) I&#x27;m just naturally pretty lol</li>
            <li> used one night and woke up with red rings around my eyes.......didn&#x27;t hurt ...been 3 days without using it and still have some color problem....do not buy this for sure.......WISH I COULD SENT BACK AND GET MY MONEY BACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the past I used MD Lash....bought it from HSN on a 3 pay......now they don&#x27;t sell it and really sad about that  IT WORKED no problems.....just can&#x27;t pay that much at one time.....okay QVC pick this product up!!!!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me.  My lashes began growing longer within 2 weeks and I stopped using it after that because my lashes were getting too long!  I was hoping my lashes would get thicker, but they did not.  Even though I only used this on my upper lashes, the lower lashes grew too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon after reading the reviews.  Two days after I started using it I developed the worst stye I have ever had on my left eye.  I had to go to eye doctor and take antibiotics for 10 days.  Thinking it was just a fluke, I tried it again.  Same outcome!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I tried to return to Amazon but I was past the allotted time period.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product twice and got the same reaction both times. My eyes became very red and itchy. The second time was worse than the first ... I had to take a benadryl to fall asleep. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  The first time it took nearly 5 weeks for me to notice anything and then it seemed over night I had beautiful lashes!  I did not have any negative reaction and have used the product as instructed with no problems!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used much better products, I&#x27;m sorry. I would try another product that works as appose to this one.</li>
            <li> EYES LOOKED A LITTLE BLOOD SHOT AND ALITTLE ITCHY FOR A WEEK,I WAS USING THIS TWICE A DAY FOR THE FIRST 6 WEEKS,MORN. &amp; NITE... CLEARED UP AND LASHES SEEMED TO START GROWING IN ALSO THEY ARE DARKER.THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS AND IT LASTS ALONG TIME.i WILL BUY THIS AGAIN</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of the folks who is sensitive to this product.  When I use it on top/bottom eyelashes it irritates my eyes (they are red the next day).  BUT....I use on my eyebrows instead and it&#x27;s doing wonders there.  Just wish it did not irritate my eyes so I could use on my eyelashes....</li>
            <li> I first purchased this item a few years ago, and it worked great! Within a month of time I could notice results. I used Nutra LUXE LASH MD for about 6 months until it ran out. My eyes did get a little sensitive once in awhile but nothing to horrible and I have very sensitive skin the begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item for a second time I was very disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure if the formula changed or what but this product no longer works for me.</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully before using to make sure that I used it correctly.  Well it give me the worse scare of my life, I tried it at night before going to bed, to wake up the next morning with deep blood shot eyes that I could hardly see my pupils.  And must I add that they stayed that way for {7} whole days, and Visine would not clear it up.</li>
            <li> all I have to say is OMG , I try Latisse before but this product for some reason work better on me , i&#x27;m going for round two .</li>
            <li> This is amazing I was skeptical at first but if you use it daily it works after about two months. It looks like I have eyelash extensions !! Love it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> because I&amp;#34;m try to see in two months with my eye lash, I hope Nutra Luxe Lash work!</li>
            <li> it truly works, i use it everyday since the last two month and now it is really starting to show. thank you</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and will buy it again when I&#x27;m out, but the tube seems to be lasting a long time.  I use it on my lashes and eyebrows.  It seems to work on my brows.  Not sure on my lashes, but I bought it mainly for my brows.</li>
            <li> Had results within 5 days of use...always rubbing left eye and lashes shorter then those on right which is why I purchased. Lashes completely even now and both sides longer. Does cause irritation if applied too heavily, just use as directed. Have switched to every other day now without losing results and use on eyebrows.  Much slower results on brows but hair growing in, will see if it turns into something other than fuzz.  Application site does swell that&#x27;s why no 5 stars</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyebrows were dissapearing as I am getting older.  They were always blonde but now almost looked like I had none.  I tried the Nutra Luxe Lash MD from amazon and used it only on one eyebrow to really test the benefits.  After about a month and a half I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  I asked people which eyebrow looked fuller and everyone was able to choose the eyebrow that I used the product on.  My mom and my sister ended up buying it also because they couldn&#x27;t believe the difference with my one eyebrow.  I started using it on the other eyebrow and now after some time both my eyebrows match and are both full.  Now when I use eyebrow gel on my eyebrows the gel has something to adhere to.  I am now beginning to test it on my eyelashes but so far I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Brilliant, promotes eyelash growth I would say after about a month of using. Best eyelash product i have used ever.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Within 6 weeks of daily use, I had a significant improvemt in the length and fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> This brand and product are phenomenal.  If you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; results, this is the lash&lt;br /&gt;lengthener for you.  Within 2 wks I saw longer, darker lashes.  It&#x27;s been a couple mnths of use&lt;br /&gt;now and people constantly ask if I have eyelash exetensions.  I&#x27;m using it on my eyebrows to see&lt;br /&gt;if any new hairs will pop in.  Love this stuff and so convenient to use, much easier than the leading brand.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my eyelashes grow faster than expected.  I am really happy that I choose it.  You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> This product is misleading, if you are over 60 don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I have bought alot of different products to help grow longer eyelashes and nothing works.</li>
            <li> This is insane!  My eyelashes almost look fake, they&#x27;ve gotten so long.  I have two friends that ordered it after they saw mine.  One bit of advice, Don&#x27;t give up.  I almost did after using it for a month and not seeing any results.  Then at around 6 weeks, I put mascara on and couldn&#x27;t believe the length.  If I squint, I can feel the tips of my lashes hitting my eyebrows!  Crazy good product.  I hope they never change the formula like many cosmetics do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eyelash products and this one didn&#x27;t work but it did irritate my eyes, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this product did work for me. I had so-so lashes and then I had extensions put on for some stupid reason.  I didn&#x27;t think about the fact that I would lose most of my lashes when they were removed.  Now that I am older I have noticed that I don&#x27;t have the regrowth that I used to in my younger days.  I am on my seventh week of using the product as of today&#x27;s date.  It has really added a lot to the length of my lashes, but unfortunately not a lot to the thickness of them.  I only wish that it made them half as thick as it has long.  I took before and after pictures and it did help a little with the thickness just not enough to wow me. I have also been putting the product on my brows as the instructions recommend.  I didn&#x27;t feel that I needed to because fortunately my brows are still pretty thick, or so I thought.  It has actually made a big difference in the look of my eyebrows.  They are not just fuller, they look younger.  I don&#x27;t know why.  If it&#x27;s simply that they look fuller or because they are softer. I just know that they look better.  For the price it was worth it.  I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it burning my eyes, but they are just slightly red in the morning.  Well, a little redder than normal anyway.  Other than that I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects whatsoever.  I would recommend giving it a try, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> It really works, but my eyes turn so red that looks like I smoked something, and also they get very dry inside that I have to constantly  used drops for it,so I quit using it.</li>
            <li> Works for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 months now.  No complaints.  I was using Latise before.  This is less than half the price and for me works just as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 4 weeks with great results&lt;br /&gt;but would apply this in daytime instead of nighttime to avoid reddish</li>
            <li> Lashes are now hitting my glasses! (yes, poor me!) Everyone remarks on how great they look and they usually think I have put on false lashes. I believe it took about 8 weeks to make a difference, but I stayed with the daily application and it paid off (and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune). I am delighted with Nutra Luxe Lash MD and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.</li>
            <li> I waited an extra couple of weeks to review this product to see if I might not have given it enough time.  I will continue to use it until it is finished and see if there are any results.  However, I&#x27;ve used it for a month with no appreciable results.  I was very excited because I heard great things about this product.  If using it for more time produces longer, fuller lashes, I will review this product again.</li>
            <li> How many times have we purchased a product along these lines that promises something somewhat hard to measure and it falls into that category where you cannot say for sure it does not work and you surely are not convinced it does work either.&lt;br /&gt;For me, that is this.  I feel it surpasses one other I have tried: I am not prepared to buy the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot; yet with the triple digit price tag.&lt;br /&gt;I would &#x27;err&#x27; on the side of saying this product DOES do a little bit of enhancing.  And truthfully, I am not applying it as instructed although I have been applying it daily.  Give it a shot. What the heck. Me, not sure yet if I would buy it again.  It&#x27;s far superior to the little blue one for sale out there in the tube....  : )</li>
            <li> I laughed when I saw this product at first. I thought this was just another gimmicky kind of thing. But after using it for almost 2 months now, I&#x27;m a believer. My lashes have never been longer. But if you have sensitive eyes, apply at bedtime, and apply the thin layer from the outside in. The first time I used it my eyes itched and burned for a day or two before I got used to it. But I also applied too much product and started from the inside. And you only need to dip the pin into the solution ONCE and it will be enough for both eyes. It says it on the directions, but you always think you need more than you do. It doesn&#x27;t take much. But one I started applying from the outside in, the irritation got so much better. Now I hardly notice it. Its defiantly best at night though, with your contacts out. Also, I apply a thin layer on my brows after applying it on the lashes. I think it makes the fuller. Its harder to tell with the brows. But I think they look a bit fuller. Its not an instant thing, but after a few weeks, I swear your lashes do grow.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for me.  I bought it once before, had eye surgery and stopped using it for awhile.  My eye lashes are definetely longer, even the lower ones.  Now and then I miss a day, but not on purpose.</li>
            <li> Este producto no me parece nada caro para lo extraordinario de el resultado.&lt;br /&gt;En 4 semanas se ven los resultados y como mantenimiento lo aplicas 3 veces por semana y despues 1 ves por semana.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom since she has really short stubby lashes. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and I can see that it&#x27;s getting longer and a little fuller.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product my eyes would get so red. It looked like I was slightly stoned all the time. But I powered through it and now my eyes don&#x27;t get red anymore and my eye lashes are sooo long. The only thing is I find that they fall out a lot easier than they used to. But they grow back quicker too. You just have to be super careful when you wash off your eye makeup... don&#x27;t rub your eyes too hard or your lashes will fall out. Over all, I am satisfied with this product as RapidLash stopped working for me in a month and this has continued to work for me. I am about to buy my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it really works - I used it for about 2 1/2 months before I saw the noticeable growth in my eyelashes - I have very sensitive skin and was still able to use this product - it will last you 6 months or more - the price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> Only used it for a few days. if you get it in your eyes it burns like hell .  My eyes have been red and irritated all day since i started using this product , cant really say if it makes your lashes grow .I don&#x27;t think i will keep using the product because its irritating my eyes to much .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has been long enough to say if it is going to make my eyelashes grow to the point were it is really noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it makes my lashes silkier looking.</li>
            <li> Been using this a few months now, and although progress is slow, it does seem to work as advertised. My lashes seem maybe 20-30% longer and fuller, although it also seems to have darkened the lashes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose everyone is different, but it&#x27;s worth a try if you want longer, fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> Obviously one of us is confused. I seriously hope it&#x27;s the inanimate object... It also leaves a residual sting that others said &#x27;you get used to&#x27;. I haven&#x27;t and actually wonder why I should want to?</li>
            <li> The first few days of using this product my eyes burned and were sensitive to light; however, by the third day side effects were gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties and my lashes were sparce and thin. Not even Mascara was making much of a difference. After 4 weeks of using this product my lashes and eyebrows and thicker and longer. Mascara goes on very nicely and my lashes look longer and fuller. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I started using this on 2/14/13. Its been less than 3 weeks and I already see a difference in length. The first few days my eyes we terribly irritated though, but I stuck with it and the burning passed. Im excited to see what this does over time and I will be sure to post updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/30/13 2 &amp; 1/2 months later and wow! I cant say enough about this product, other than how nice it is to finally have purchased something that works! Lashes are crazy long and I have new ones growing in as well. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/11/13 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of Nutra Luxe I purchased Rapid Lash. It had good reviews and was cheaper so i gave it a try. NOTHING. Zero results. I purchased my second bottle of Nutra Luxe. I started using it again on 11/1. It is currently just 11/11 and I already see a difference. I did have the irritated red eyes for the first 3 or 4 days but i dont care it is soooo worth it.  I love this product and will never try anything new again.</li>
            <li> I never review things but this is worth my time! I bought it in December, it did make my eyes red for a couple days. I faithfully put it on every night. In about six weeks magic happened! My eyelashes are now easily double as long as they have ever been. They touch my eyebrows when my eyes are opened wide, they are also thicker. I no longer use false lashes at all. I&#x27;m amazed every morning when I put on my make up at how long my lashes are! Buy it, apply it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I will be honest with you. I was skeptical. But my eyelash became really thin and short after using water proof mascara for a while and I thought I could give it a try. But again I was skeptical so what I did was to apply only on the left eyelid so I could see for sure if this product would work or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month or so, some of my friends asked me what happened to my right eyelash because it looked half the length of the left side. I realized that it had become rather obvious and I looked kinda funny. Since then I started applying this to both sides. Thank god the right side caught up with left side after another month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me, try the same thing for yourself..... I don&#x27;t really recommend it if you are concerned about unmatched eyelash, but you will be able to actually witness what this product does to you.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 3 months and notice no change in eyelashes; no length gained nor thicker lashes.  I will use the last container, and then try something else that was recommended by a friend; SmartLash</li>
            <li> I do think it helps make the eyebrows you have a little longer. Not necessarily fuller and does not for sure stimulate any new growth. Not sure if anything on the market will if that is what you are hoping for. Only used once on eyelash area and did notice a difference the very next day. But it irritates the eye/waters so maybe only use before bed. Overall, not a bad product for the price. Would recommend for eyelashes and if desperate like I was for minimal eyebrow help.</li>
            <li> My lashes have thinned with age and I was hoping this product would help them fill-in and grow longer. I have been using it for 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> i used this product for about two weeks, but had to give up because it irritated my eyes. I can&#x27;t say whether or not it improves your eyelashes because I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> A bottle last for about 3 months. After 3 month using it every night, my eyes lash are longer. The only problem is it makes my eyes itchy. Just order 2 more bottle. Worth it to give it a try</li>
            <li> It took a long time...like 4 months, but it was worth the wait. I used in the past different products like this and none worked. I love my eyelashes! I use it every night before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> for a small investment this product is by far the most bang for your buck. simply apply be patient, takes approximately 6 weeks, but it works. people will ask you whats your secret.</li>
            <li> Problem with this  Not with Amazon  Mfg wouldn&#x27;t help. Was not happy</li>
            <li> Everyone comments about my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the more expensive stuff! Tried Li lash and didn&#x27;t have such results! Even my hair dresser noticed!</li>
