            <li>Thank you so much for such a wonderful skincare line!</li>

            <li>It also contains peptides, retinol, matrixyl 3000, resveratrol, ceramides,  vitamins , antioxidants, and caffeine, really what more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>Had to invest in full size to give it a longer try.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering from Arginia and this product is as good as the Nu Elle cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy using several of QR Organics products and especially likes the I*Lift Eye Essence.  </li>
            <li>The creamy white gel has a nice smell, goes on smoothly with no oily residue and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I*Lift is very nourishing without being greasy!!</li>

            <li>She is happy with the product so far and will update the review once she has used this long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i can honestly say that this eye cream is the first one that i’ve seen that actually made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Light texture and fast absorbing and yet</li>
            <li>but my skin is tighter, more vibrant and clear.</li>
            <li>this is what possess me to order some different products...because I was able to try them.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for some time and just bought 3 more since ARGANIA had a bit better price than they usually have.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I am about to place my first order.</li>
            <li>The cream smells wonderful, and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>Deep down inside they also want to look good!  </li>
            <li>After a month of use now I can tell that not only I see some fine lines are gone</li>
            <li>They are less puffy , soft, and I believe after a few months the results will be even more great.</li>
            <li>Everything that I said is how I really feel about this product.  </li>
            <li>if you have skin like that, i absolutely recommend you give this stuff a shot.  </li>
            <li>You certainly receive enough to get the true feel of the products.</li>
            <li>other creams may make a difference for those who have more pronounced issues with the skin around their eyes.  </li>
            <li>I had no other choice but taking measures to continue using this amazing eye cream after receiving a sample of it with other stuff I bought.</li>
            <li>I love seeing less puffiness under my eyes!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are less prominent now than they were 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED with how easy I*Lift is to use and such a small amount is needed!!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it,and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>and I think the ingredients are powerful with multiple anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li>it seems tighter, firmer, and the teensy lines that are there normally seem to have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having very sensitive skin always presents a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, I have always had dark circles under my eyes from working long hours, and this has really helped improve them.</li>
            <li>so soft!  </li>
            <li>This is no small feat for my aging 48 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>Puffiness and dark circles disappeared right away - regardless of how much sleep I get.</li>
            <li>This is my better half&#x27;s initial observations of the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and its seems to make my eye area brighter and my fine lines softer.  </li>
            <li>but where i see this cream really making a difference is for those with skin like mine–you’re beginning to see signs of aging, and want to stop them in their tracks at the very least, and at the most reverse them.  </li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>So far it looks optimistic.</li>
            <li>This has really worked for me, big time!!</li>
            <li>Please continue giving the public what it really wants.</li>
            <li>How about coming out with a natural self tanning line ??</li>
            <li>and she likes that it has natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>i can absolutely tell a difference after using it, especially in the firmness and lack of puffiness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream is a perfect base for my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams in the past with various degree of results and reactions.  </li>
            <li>The texture is like silk and the cream is very condensed, making it worth the price for the small quantity after all.</li>
            <li>It has been a long time since I found an eye cream that really works.</li>
            <li>And the organic ingredients are a major plus...</li>
            <li>The lotion is silky and soothing and that is important to me because I have a hard time putting anything around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>i don’t have deep wrinkles–and i have very few fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and lifted at the same time.</li>
            <li>cause more wrinkles due to the skin around my eyes getting dry and extremely uncountable for me.  </li>
            <li>but there are fine lines there, and they are irritating.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i can absolutely tell a difference after using it, especially in the firmness and lack of puffiness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The cream is a perfect base for my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams in the past with various degree of results and reactions.  </li>
            <li> The texture is like silk and the cream is very condensed, making it worth the price for the small quantity after all.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I found an eye cream that really works.</li>
            <li> And the organic ingredients are a major plus...</li>

            <li> cause more wrinkles due to the skin around my eyes getting dry and extremely uncountable for me.  </li>
            <li> but there are fine lines there, and they are irritating.  </li>
            <li> i’d yet to find one that i really thought did anything of note to the delicate, 33-year-old skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> as is my grey hair.  </li>
            <li> I looked for years for an eye cream that would fight wrinkles and will not dry out the skin around my eyes with no success.  </li>
            <li> So I had shared my secrets with him and actually gave him some in a empty container I found!  </li>
            <li> if only some of the other skin creams i used worked this well!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about making this purchase but after noticing the fast &amp; obvious results, I purchased AGAIN!</li>

            <li> This eye cream works in a way which relaxes the tension in your face, and this in turn reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles around your eyes with regular use. It&#x27;s been shown to nourish and firm the skin.It stimulates collagen and reduces puffiness. I have tried other products from this brand and I found them to work well, so I tried this eye cream and I definitely notice a  difference in the look of my eyes.They are less puffy , soft, and I believe after a few months the results will be even more great. This product has tons of great natural ingredients that do wonders for your skin. It also contains peptides, retinol, matrixyl 3000, resveratrol, ceramides,  vitamins , antioxidants, and caffeine, really what more could you ask for. The cream smells wonderful, and a little goes a very long way.I was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free for my honest review but all opinions here are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; multi-peptides + Retinol + Matrixyl 3000 + Resveratrol + Ceramides + vitamins + antioxidants and caffeine, all in one.</li>
            <li> great cream with great ingredients, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed softening of fine lines around my eyes,I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman.  I looked for years for an eye cream that would fight wrinkles and will not dry out the skin around my eyes with no success.  I bought very expensive eye cream with the promise that it would improve the area around my eyes without drying the skin.  All the expensive cream did was cause more wrinkles due to the skin around my eyes getting dry and extremely uncountable for me.  I went on line and read the reviews about this cream and I took a chance.  I said to myself, what the heck, another eye cream that will go in the trash.  I am happy that I took the chance.  The area around my eyes looks and feels great.  I no longer have wrinkles around my eyes that will give my age away.  People tell me all the time that I look 25.</li>
            <li> At 56 I have horrible under eye bags. I&#x27;ve found that using this eye cream improved my fine lines and wrinkles and it worked quickly too. I*Lift is very nourishing without being greasy!! It absorbs quickly and starts firming my skin right away. I love seeing less puffiness under my eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;After you cleanse your face apply a SMALL amount of I*Lift around the eye area. All you need is a half a pump for BOTH EYES!!! Use your ring finger; that’s your weakest finger and tap your I*Lift into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The tip of I*Lift itself is also an applicator for a hands-free application, which is the method I prefer. I am THRILLED with how easy I*Lift is to use and such a small amount is needed!! You can use I*Lift both morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Argania for supplying me with iLift for the purpose of this review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this eye cream - from the packaging and the pump for mess-free application, to the refreshing smell and light texture and, most importantly, to the results that I started to see within one week. I apply this cream once daily, and my eyes have become noticeably brighter. This cream has helped with the puffiness under my eyes and has diminished my wrinkles. Excellent product for a very reasonable price! I actually look forward to applying this cream every morning!</li>
            <li> This product is the sole reason I look well rested on a daily basis! I love it. I use it once or twice a day. Puffiness and dark circles disappeared right away - regardless of how much sleep I get. I&#x27;ll never need to try another product! And the organic ingredients are a major plus...</li>
            <li> This eye cream makes my lines under eyes fade away! I have tried it for about a month and noticed the result after about a week or two. I would definitely stick with it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream with a purchase of their cellulite lotion.  My eyes feel so moisturized which is a very hard thing for me to find.  I am now purchasing the larger version.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams in the past with various degree of results and reactions.  Having very sensitive skin always presents a challenge.  This product has not caused any allergic reactions and feels very light and gentle on my skin.  But better yet, I already see my eye area being tighter and lifted.  It&#x27;s been only a week or so.  Impressed so far.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I must say I am impressed with this eye cream after trying it out for 2 weeks. It smells like 80% cucumbers mixed with 20% roses. The smell is refreshing and divine. The texture is like silk and the cream is very condensed, making it worth the price for the small quantity after all. It has moisturized and plumped up my eye area, making it 4 years younger. I apply this in the morning and at night. If I stop applying it, the medium amount of wrinkles I have comes back. All in all, I am impressed bc there is NO BETTER product, and I have tried this and that.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It leaves my eye area looking smooth and bright. I will definitely be ording this again!</li>
            <li> I love sun and enjoy sports activities outdoors. Over the years it reflected on my skin. I have received a sample of this product with another purchase and even being a relatively small sample, I could notice difference in my skin after a few days.  Had to invest in full size to give it a longer try. After a month of use now I can tell that not only I see some fine lines are gone but my skin is tighter, more vibrant and clear. So far it looks optimistic. I understand that getting rid of dark spots will not happen overnight, but I can tell that this product works and it’s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened my very first sample of this eye cream was the lovely scent of cucumbers.  The lotion is silky and soothing and that is important to me because I have a hard time putting anything around my eyes.  EVERYTHING (except this cream) makes my eye area turn red and itch.  The cream is a perfect base for my eye make-up.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and its seems to make my eye area brighter and my fine lines softer.  This is no small feat for my aging 48 year old skin.  Try it - I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, I have always had dark circles under my eyes from working long hours, and this has really helped improve them. I use it at night with the BioRadiance Botanical Cellular brightening treatment and my skin has never look younger, or been so well hydrated. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this eye cream as a sample when I purchased the Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub!  This is the best eye cream that I&#x27;ve ever used! My eyes have never looked so moisturized &amp; refreshed! And the smell is so yummy that I&#x27;m tempted to taste the cream every time I use it! LOL!  I&#x27;m sold on Skin QR Organics!</li>
            <li> Another product I am now using...very happy with the ingredients and the look around my eyes!!!&lt;br /&gt;My brother came by and said...you look really good! I smiled... So I had shared my secrets with him and actually gave him some in a empty container I found!  Who said guys could care less about their looks?! Deep down inside they also want to look good!  They may not want you to know. Getting back to my review. I absolutely luv what this product does!! Every product I have tried from this company thus far I have been very, very happy with! It&#x27;s good thing that when you order a product you think you might like, you get some great samples...this is what possess me to order some different products...because I was able to try them. Nice size sample as well. You certainly receive enough to get the true feel of the products. This has really worked for me, big time!! I thank this company for being generous...when you give it comes back to you! Please continue giving the public what it really wants. Great products with great ingredients that really work!! How about coming out with a natural self tanning line ?? A thought! :) Thank you again!!</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy using several of QR Organics products and especially likes the I*Lift Eye Essence.  She has been using it for some time and just bought 3 more since ARGANIA had a bit better price than they usually have.  As I told a person with a question sent through Amazon recently, QR products are made in the US and I have found no harmful ingredients in them.  Check out Skin QR Organics website.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the I*Lift Bio-Restorative Radiance Eye Essence by Argania Labs Skin QR Organics line.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!  I applied it to the top and underneath my eyes for a period of only 4 days and already I notice a significant difference. I used to be able to feel my crows feet wrinkles and now I cannot. I cannot feel them and I cannot see them. I look 10 years younger! This product not only gets rid of the wrinkles, it also reduces puffiness and the black color under your eyes!! It’s all organic, absorbs well into my skin. I used this in conjunction with the BioSensiya Night Time Serum. All I can say, is that it makes a huge difference. Very, very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in return for my honest review.  Everything that I said is how I really feel about this product.  If I didn&#x27;t like this product in any way, I&#x27;d let you know.  This company did not influence my opinions whatsoever.  Please read my review with confidence!</li>
            <li> I had no other choice but taking measures to continue using this amazing eye cream after receiving a sample of it with other stuff I bought. Saying that I have noticed a difference overnight is an understatement. But I did. Just apply a thin layer around your eyes twice a day and you will be amazed at how much better your eyes will look. Just try and you will see it yourself. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  This is my second time of purchasing the I*Lift Bio-Restorative Radiance Eye Essence.  I love how it moisturizes and make my eyes look and feel smooth.  It has been a long time since I found an eye cream that really works.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. It smells wonderful and I think the ingredients are powerful with multiple anti-aging properties. I have been using this product for some time now.</li>
            <li> zvezd - Very nice cream. It smells like something you would experience at the spa. Light texture and fast absorbing and yet, it keeps my eye area moist. I use it only at night and I think it works. My wrinkles are less prominent now than they were 3 weeks ago. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering from Arginia and this product is as good as the Nu Elle cellulite cream. It works instantly and all their products smell great and are made from the purest ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying!</li>
            <li> I put this on at night. It goes on really smooth. You just need a little bit and it goes a long way! It has a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell to it. Feels refreshing once you put it on.</li>
            <li> This is my better half&#x27;s initial observations of the eye cream.  The gel moisturizes her skin and reduces her lines and wrinkles and she likes that it has natural ingredients.  The creamy white gel has a nice smell, goes on smoothly with no oily residue and absorbs quickly into the skin.  She is happy with the product so far and will update the review once she has used this long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so i have a couple of eye creams.  one i got from sephora, one i got from Memebox–and then of course i have countless foil packs.  i’d yet to find one that i really thought did anything of note to the delicate, 33-year-old skin around my eyes.  i don’t have deep wrinkles–and i have very few fine lines.  but there are fine lines there, and they are irritating.  as is my grey hair.  that’s a story for another day.&lt;br /&gt;so when i got this, i honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can honestly say that this eye cream is the first one that i’ve seen that actually made a difference.  i can absolutely tell a difference after using it, especially in the firmness and lack of puffiness in my skin.  it seems tighter, firmer, and the teensy lines that are there normally seem to have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;those other creams may make a difference for those who have more pronounced issues with the skin around their eyes.  but where i see this cream really making a difference is for those with skin like mine–you’re beginning to see signs of aging, and want to stop them in their tracks at the very least, and at the most reverse them.  if you have skin like that, i absolutely recommend you give this stuff a shot.  it’s affordable and it is so, so worth it.  if only some of the other skin creams i used worked this well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for 3 weeks now and absolutely love the way that it makes my eyes feel....so soft!  I have also noticed that the fine lines under my eyes have gotten better so I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference once I have used it even longer.  This is one product that I will continue to use. Thank you so much for such a wonderful skincare line!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! The only eye cream I have tried that instantly shrinks my eyebags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/14/15 Update: I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar.  It&#x27;s still the best eye cream in reducing my eyebags in the morning.  Also, I noticed my crow&#x27;s feet have disappeared after 3 months of use! I&#x27;m in my 40s.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! I was so skeptical about making this purchase but after noticing the fast &amp; obvious results, I purchased AGAIN! I have also purchased other products from Argania, these products are awesome as well! Very courteous company and they send great samples!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Love it. This company always sends out samples and I appreciate it a lot. Testing something new is always great. Loved the sample, getting full size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for couple years now,it&#x27;s an excellent product! Leaves my skin soft and lifted at the same time.It&#x27;s very moisturizing, not greasy nor heavy. I highly recommend it,and will continue to use it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My dark circles have almost disappeared with only a few uses of this cream! I am truly in awe! The texture is light, smooth, and has a clean, fresh smell. It does not irritate my eyes as do some creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample and I am about to place my first order.</li>
