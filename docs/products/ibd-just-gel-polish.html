    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It gets the job done and my nails look great</li>
            <li>Looked great for about 24 hours and then started to peel off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks good for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>think this line is affordable for novice nail painters, who just want to paint their own nails, and not pay over $30 at the salon every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Looked for replacement for my &amp;#34;Sensational gel nail kit by Nailene&amp;#34; found this online and the price was very good and size was very generous.</li>
            <li>good review on my part, just have to buy special nail polish remover to use this product.</li>
            <li>I hope the IBD top coat I have coming is better, but I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath.</li>
            <li>The top coat and polish are okay because I&#x27;d used them many times; it&#x27;s just the basecoat.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the application process.</li>
            <li>Go for the better product.</li>
            <li>I made sure to clean my nails with alcohol</li>
            <li>The application process was fine.  </li>
            <li>but this is too cheap</li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out after the UV curing though.  </li>
            <li>- I will buy it again since it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know you needed light to set</li>
            <li>necessary for a nailaholic lol</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the IBD brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li>This is the first gel polish I&#x27;ve tried, and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>You need a super strong glue as the special glue that nail techs use to glue tips into natural nails before applying acrylic powder.</li>
            <li>The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate.</li>
            <li>It works ok, its clear, it does what it says,</li>
            <li>As soon As I finished , the Nails peeled to right off.</li>
            <li>I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than the other brand and seems just as good.  </li>
            <li>Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it first</li>
            <li>The whole nail has the polish lift off in one piece.</li>
            <li>This brand is decent but it doesn&#x27;t adhere quite like the gelish brand.</li>
            <li>I could only get it to last 2-3 days top and then color fully peels off; I didn&#x27;t even have to soak off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those gel nail addicts</li>
            <li>I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand.</li>
            <li>, they peel off within a week no matter how careful or precise I am when painting my nails.</li>
            <li>so this could be normal, but I doubt that.  </li>
            <li>The gel polish peels right off your nails, it only lasts about two days.</li>
            <li>Thr regular colors and top coat are great but for a base I would use gelish before I bought this again.</li>
            <li>I used the polish on natural nails, not artficial.</li>
            <li>decent, I definitely prefer the gelish brand.</li>
            <li>..makes everything for me at least peel off easily...</li>
            <li>I love the colored soak off gels from IBD, as long as they are worn between another brand&#x27;s base and top coats.  </li>
            <li>It still felt sticky and not dry.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price.</li>
            <li>I said that because without that special glue, IBD  gel base and top coat do not last long enough for 3days.</li>

            <li> I said that because without that special glue, IBD  gel base and top coat do not last long enough for 3days.</li>
            <li> The base coat seems to be thicker than the top coat, and from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s important to apply thin layers.</li>
            <li> Using this base and IBD color and top</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d save some money and get this for the base and IBD for the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I just took them all off and redid my nails with my Gellish base and top.  </li>
            <li> I can still use the IBD colors but not the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> I was a little thicker</li>
            <li> That was a waste of $18.00 for me.  </li>
            <li> Even an extra thin one coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few IBD Gel Polish&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have doing DIY gel nails for 2 years, this was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> And i have many of this polishes but this one is the worst one i have buy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made it past a week before the polish ships or peels, though.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used Harmony and OPI in the past.  </li>
            <li> Thought I would try something less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I suspect that if Amazon didn&#x27;t lump all the reviews together, the rating for the IBD base coat would be far lower.</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with the PH bond stuff.</li>
            <li> As I progress, I may purchase the mor expensive line of Harmony base coat to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then it peels off and is ugly.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy. :(</li>
            <li> However, every time I use IBD base, my nail polish peels off.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d try the ibd gel polish base.</li>
            <li> I never had any problems with OPI gel base</li>
            <li> This ibd base coat is junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the base coat I&#x27;ve been using doesn&#x27;t like to soak off.</li>
            <li> The polish will soak off, but the base is stubborn.</li>
            <li> The base coat does its job, but it has &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of gel in it that have to be smoothed out on the nail.  </li>
            <li> It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp</li>
            <li> However, I will never use the base coat again.</li>

            <li> It works ok, its clear, it does what it says, good review on my part, just have to buy special nail polish remover to use this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because it is cheaper than its competitor.  However, every time I use IBD base, my nail polish peels off.  The whole nail has the polish lift off in one piece. Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing gel nails for about 6 months and I thought I&#x27;d try the ibd gel polish base. I never had any problems with OPI gel base but this stuff kept peeling on me.  I tried it about 3 times and the same thing every time.  I made sure to clean my nails with alcohol and I even used Bond Aid.  That was a waste of $18.00 for me.  I&#x27;ll stick with OPI from now on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on the nails, it immediately peeled off within the next day or two. Very unhappy. :(</li>
            <li> I used this on 5 of my girlfriends nails, and the nail polish had peeled off within 1 days. I have doing DIY gel nails for 2 years, this was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This ibd base coat is junk. The gel polish peels right off your nails, it only lasts about two days. Thr regular colors and top coat are great but for a base I would use gelish before I bought this again.</li>
            <li> decent, I definitely prefer the gelish brand. This brand is decent but it doesn&#x27;t adhere quite like the gelish brand.</li>
            <li> You will get what you are going to pay for. You need a super strong glue as the special glue that nail techs use to glue tips into natural nails before applying acrylic powder. I said that because without that special glue, IBD  gel base and top coat do not last long enough for 3days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything with this product. Even an extra thin one coat.  It still felt sticky and not dry. I used the polish on natural nails, not artficial.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the base coat I&#x27;ve been using doesn&#x27;t like to soak off. The polish will soak off, but the base is stubborn. (Ms Keiko&#x27;s from china) This stuff doesn&#x27;t even stay on for one day. Regular polish lasts longer than this. I hope the IBD top coat I have coming is better, but I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath. I will not be repurchasing. I suspect that if Amazon didn&#x27;t lump all the reviews together, the rating for the IBD base coat would be far lower.</li>
            <li> i prefer gelish or sensationail...haven&#x27;t tried anything else. was trying to save money but this is too cheap..makes everything for me at least peel off easily...my nail color just popped off!</li>
            <li> Did not work well. As soon As I finished , the Nails peeled to right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks good for about 10 minutes. Then it peels off and is ugly.</li>
            <li> The base coat does its job, but it has &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of gel in it that have to be smoothed out on the nail.  I&#x27;ve never done gel nails at home before so this could be normal, but I doubt that.  It seems to smooth out after the UV curing though.  It gets the job done and my nails look great - I will buy it again since it&#x27;s such a great price.</li>
            <li> Needs to be used with LED lamp, UV lamp causes it to crack.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know you needed light to set</li>
            <li> I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don&#x27;t need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp</li>
            <li> I was initially happy with the base coat from IBD, but my second manicure peeled off within 2 days.  As did my 3rd.  I love the colored soak off gels from IBD, as long as they are worn between another brand&#x27;s base and top coats.  I would give the colors a 4 star rating (Some are a tad sheer).  However, I will never use the base coat again.</li>
            <li> For me was a waate of money it peel of the next day. And i have many of this polishes but this one is the worst one i have buy.</li>
            <li> I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had \\&quot;oily nails\\&quot;, but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I&#x27;d used them many times; it&#x27;s just the basecoat.</li>
            <li> I was a little thicker then I&#x27;d hoped it would be but it worked.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper than the other brand and seems just as good.  It arrived just in time for my manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few IBD Gel Polish&#x27;s. They&#x27;re okay, they peel off within a week no matter how careful or precise I am when painting my nails.</li>
            <li> The quality and performance of this product is comparable to its more expensive counter part. Highly recommended for those gel nail addicts</li>
            <li> necessary for a nailaholic lol</li>
            <li> This is the first gel polish I&#x27;ve tried, and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. I haven&#x27;t made it past a week before the polish ships or peels, though. I&#x27;m sure it has something to do with the application process. The base coat seems to be thicker than the top coat, and from what I&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s important to apply thin layers. As I progress, I may purchase the mor expensive line of Harmony base coat to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this line is affordable for novice nail painters, who just want to paint their own nails, and not pay over $30 at the salon every two weeks. The gel bonder is a definite must have! Not to be confused with the PH bond stuff. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the IBD brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li> I have been using the gelish system and have gotten my color to last 2 weeks.  Using this base and IBD color and top I could only get it to last 2-3 days top and then color fully peels off; I didn&#x27;t even have to soak off.  Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have used Gelish at home since last October and never had a nail peel off.  I thought I&#x27;d save some money and get this for the base and IBD for the top coat.  All of my nails kept peeling off.  I kept redoing them as a nail would fall of then finally after 3 days of that I just took them all off and redid my nails with my Gellish base and top.  I can still use the IBD colors but not the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> I have used Harmony and OPI in the past.  Thought I would try something less expensive.  I got what I paid for.  The application process was fine.  Looked great for about 24 hours and then started to peel off.  Would not buy again, not even for $1.00.  Go for the better product.</li>
            <li> Looked for replacement for my &amp;#34;Sensational gel nail kit by Nailene&amp;#34; found this online and the price was very good and size was very generous. Plan to order from this company again!</li>
