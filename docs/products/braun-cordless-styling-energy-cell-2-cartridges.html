    <ol>
            <li>The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Best thing since sliced bread !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun gas powered curling irons worked magnificently.  </li>
            <li>If Amazon refused to offer incredibly overpriced items, perhaps manufacturers would reconsider their pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used it for over 30 + years and want this item in the United States, so I can purchase it at a reasonable price like I used to!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The one thing that was good, the ease of return.</li>
            <li>My curling irons are no longer any good</li>
            <li>Braun energy curling iron makes it easy to curl your hair &amp; out the door in 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Found a better price at a San Fransico pharmacy,but would still order the energy cells from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using these curling irons for many, many years .  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful especially when we are out on the boat or in the car and cannot use a plug-in curler.</li>
            <li>How many cartridges so you get for this amount?  </li>
            <li>This is an unreal price to be able to use my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but cannot find it anymore in the United States, without paying an outlandish price for them.  </li>
            <li>The styler works well for my purposes and ordering replacement cells from Amazon was really easy.</li>
            <li>Product returned and full refund received.</li>
            <li>Received them quickly and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I bought a years worth once.  </li>
            <li>Amazon treats their customers right.</li>
            <li>This company did exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li>First the $ of the iron went from $29 to $ 300 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun  Curling Iron for about 25yrs, much easier than electric.</li>
            <li>Easier to locate and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Brain.</li>
            <li>Brauns is still selling the smaller cells for cheap.  </li>
            <li>this product cost way too much.</li>
            <li>so they have gone up so much</li>
            <li>We have been loyal customers that have been left stranded!  </li>
            <li>80% of them were fine, however 3 of them were only half filled.  </li>
            <li>If they had just told me they were not going to be available much longer, I could have stocked up a little.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;am going to have to quit using my curler and that makes me very sad, but I can&#x27;t afford to pay the outrageous cost for just 2 cells.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Misleading information - way over priced!  they do not specify that you get one package with two cartridges!  I am sorry I purchased it for an outrageous price!</li>
            <li> This is the only replacement for the energy cells for the Braun cordless styler.  The styler works well for my purposes and ordering replacement cells from Amazon was really easy.</li>
            <li> When buying this product, keep in mind that  this is fuel.  I bought a years worth once.  Once.  80% of them were fine, however 3 of them were only half filled.  One had even less than that.  As they sat in my closet waiting  for their turn,  some of them continued to Evaporate.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was ordering.  The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  This company did exactly what they said they would.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this product in stores.  I have been using a Braun  Curling Iron for about 25yrs, much easier than electric.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread !!! Braun energy curling iron makes it easy to curl your hair &amp; out the door in 10 minutes! Wohoo! Found a better price at a San Fransico pharmacy,but would still order the energy cells from Amazon. Easier to locate and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is about the only place I can find these cartridges.  Received them quickly and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Product returned and full refund received. This item was advertized as a 12 pack.which seemed reasonable, as we had purchased 2 packs at retail outlets in the past for $7-$8 each. You can imagine our shock when (1) 2 pack arrived for a total cost of $65!!</li>
            <li> This is crazy...what happened to the price for these cartridges? I have been using these curling irons for many, many years .  They are wonderful especially when we are out on the boat or in the car and cannot use a plug-in curler. I have never paid anything close to this price and I cannot believe my eyes!  How many cartridges so you get for this amount?  I am astounded and frustrated.  Cannot afford to curl my hair at this price!</li>
            <li> I also have been using the Braun curling iron for over thirty years and can&#x27;t believe they are no longer providing fuel for sale.  This is an unreal price to be able to use my curling iron.  MY HAIR WON&#x27;T CURL WITH PLUG IN CURLERS.  We have been loyal customers that have been left stranded!  Thanks a lot Brain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cordless curler for about 15 yrs.  Two years ago I bought 6 (2pk) cells for about 24.00 from Amazon. They no longer sell them and they&#x27;ve become really expensive.  What Happened????? Brauns is still selling the smaller cells for cheap.  Why not the bigger cells.  I think Brauns is ripping customers off by selling the 2 pk. cells for over $35.00. I&#x27;am going to have to quit using my curler and that makes me very sad, but I can&#x27;t afford to pay the outrageous cost for just 2 cells.  Wake up people.  Brauns is fleecing america.</li>
            <li> I have been using the braun cells for 35+ years. I use to purchase a year supply about 12 2paks, thats 24 cells for the same price that amazon is charging for 2 2paks. I am appalled, its crazy! I thought there was typo but silly me, I was wrong.  The one thing that was good, the ease of return. Amazon treats their customers right. So how to give a grade or rating, 0 on price and 5 for customer service!</li>
            <li> My wife has been searching for this item for months with no success except for a few that were overpriced. Finally they are here.</li>
            <li> If Amazon refused to offer incredibly overpriced items, perhaps manufacturers would reconsider their pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun gas powered curling irons worked magnificently.  Since the energy cartridges are now prohibitedly expensive, I&#x27;m sure I will no longer be using mine.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but cannot find it anymore in the United States, without paying an outlandish price for them.  I use my cordless curling iron all the time.  Have used it for over 30 + years and want this item in the United States, so I can purchase it at a reasonable price like I used to!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this product cost way too much. I have for years paid $5.00 for 2. I am not able to find them anymore so they have gone up so much I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was a misleading ad. I assumed at $85 dollars I was was buying a box of 10pkgs. They where $5.99 each in the store. I have returned this item.</li>
            <li> Product works well, but is extremely expensive. Has anyone tried the compatible cells? I am only using the Braun when I don&#x27;t have access to electricity.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest disappointments of my buying experiences. I have bought and used their curling irons for 25 years. First the $ of the iron went from $29 to $ 300 2 yrs. ago. Now the energy cells went from $3.50 each to&lt;br /&gt;$18.00 or higher-if you could find them. My curling irons are no longer any good and I am really mad! I have called Braun several times over the last 2 yrsand got no answer from customer service except &amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;. If they had just told me they were not going to be available much longer, I could have stocked up a little. What a joke.</li>
