    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really appreciate this supplement and I love this brand.  I do think it makes a difference in my skin and I like the turmeric in it for overall health.</li>
            <li> What a rip off Organic India!!!!! I want my money back!!!! This did not help my skin!! I could have used this money towards organic skin care!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has made my skin more alive than it has ever been. To be fair, I also have been eating a very healthy diet full of vegetables and fruits, maintaining 8 hours of sleep at the minimum, exercising, taking a multivitamin and biotin. However, these are things I have been doing for a few months and when I added this to my regimen my face changed drastically. I don&#x27;t have a single break out and my face looks so fresh. I leave the house without make up without feeling unconfident any more. Try it!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me except cause stomach ache</li>
            <li> Great smell of Basil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t share with anyone that I was taking this and was very pleased when I started receiving comments about how great my skin looked. This has been a great addition to my plan for great health!</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell an improvement in the texture of my facial skin after taking this product.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Works very well from the inside out. I was really impressed with this product.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Useful natural product! Seems to be working! I take with another neem suppliment. No side effects what so ever. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like Organic India. This formula is very good and has a lot of benefits to the brain. Try it.</li>
            <li> Great price for organic supplements</li>
            <li> after a whole bottle ,i saw difference on my skin ,especially face looks more radiant now ,and freckles became lighter slightly ,.im ordering another bottle soon,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for at least two months, and my elbows, feet, knees seem less dry/scaly, and my skin tone seems more even.  My skin over all is a little softer. Nothing dramatic, but I&#x27;ll keep taking it to see if it helps keep my skin healthier through the winter when I tend to get dry skin.</li>
            <li> I watch my skin like a hawk for changes, even very tiny ones, and there are none. Everything is the same as before. So I do not know how to review this supplement, since I don&#x27;t know what it is doing, if anything. I have been taking it religiously for a while now, but there is no evidence of its efficacy. When the bottle runs out, I will not order again.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I shared the jar. She noticed a difference within 2 weeks that her skin was glowing and less acne. It took a month for me to begin noticing my pores seemed a tiny bit smaller and skin tone was more even (less blotchiness). I ordered a 2nd jar and willing to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have at times taken all these herbs separately, but the convenience of being able to take this every morning easily has won out.  This is a powerful blend.  It works well in my body.  Take on an empty stomach with enough water for optimal results.</li>
            <li> Great for wrinkles, notice smother lines, ect.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. Natural ingredients for a very good price. It is good to use when I have some food that isn&#x27;t too good for me (like chocolate)  It helps to detox my body, nicely and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says on the bottle if you make healthy changes to your lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I know herbs and all that stuff works its way into your body and system for us to reap its benefits but this particular formula really has outdone itself. My skin is glowing, super super soft (face) and bright! So glad i came across this and will now subscribe to it monthly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week and I&#x27;m already noticing a nice change in my skin. I have rosacea and break out sometimes in those areas. My face doesn&#x27;t seem to be as blotchy after taking these and I feel like I&#x27;m glowing. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few more weeks will bring!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these and is on her second bottle. She is unsure if they have made any difference with her acne. From my perspective, if they have, it has been pretty little.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin,hair and nail herbal formulas with little result, until now. I have only been taking  this product a couple of weeks and already notice a positive difference. I will definitely order more. I love that you only need 1 capsule daily and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I started drinking this every other day, and i really love them. I started seem the changes in my skin, specially in my face where I had some acne, and some dryness because of the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. They just took so long to deliver it, but it worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to take. Not only good for skin but for stomach , intestine and regularity issues as well! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it has a noticeable effect after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use it.....it was already expired when I got it :(</li>
            <li> Saw difference in three days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my stubborn skin...nothing seems to work. I just don&#x27;t see a difference. It may not be that the product doesn&#x27;t work, maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on my skin. I also feel that things like these my take several months of use to see....</li>
            <li> Have not finished using product.  First time using.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have dry skin and within a week of using, my skin seems brighter with glow.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. Saw a significant change in the appearance of my skin, hair and nails, etc. Love it! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This helped clear up my cystic acne! Turmeric for everyone!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me :(  I was starting to get rash in my face plus my entire body was itching really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for about a week now, and I must admit that I am happy with results so far. Recently, I began researching  the benefits of consuming the herb, &#x27;Tumeric&#x27; and this is what prompted me to try Organic India Skin Renewal. Tumeric is an herb/Spice commonly used in Indian Cuisine. However, it is also a natural remedy for inflammation. Besides this, the supplement also contains a blend of other herbs, which are supposed to promote a healthier complexion. With the 90 day supply, I will continue to take this on a daily basis, to see if I reap any other health benefits. No side effects thus far.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for my skin</li>
            <li> I got all itchy after taking this.</li>
            <li> like it well buy again</li>
            <li> I am taking this supplement for about a month and did mention some positive change in skin condition. It looks more smooth and fresh. No miracle however, expectations has to be realistic. Did not mention any side effects and will definitely buy again. It seems like I feel generally better when taking this. Cleaner I should say, or fresher. It works somewhat like a body tonic for me.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has noticably improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the pills for about 2 weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if they are making my skin look better since I&#x27;ve been following a good diet and good skin care….so it may be a combination of doing all things right.  Perhaps I need to give it more time and see if there&#x27;s any other drastic change.  No side effects and the formula has all good ingredients…so guess its no harm.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll look about 5-10 years younger in another month! lol</li>
            <li> I am a mother of two small boys, 26 and I was starting to see a few smile wrinkles was very worried about them since I started taking these my wrinkles are very less noticeable. It has this great glow and the little pimples I had that seem to never pop, it has gone away! It works.</li>
