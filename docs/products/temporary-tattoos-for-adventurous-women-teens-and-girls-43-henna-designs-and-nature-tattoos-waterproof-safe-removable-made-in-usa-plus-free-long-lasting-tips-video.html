            <li>This shipment of tattoos arrived very quickly and was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>the tatts are intricately designed and the suns, butterflies, and peace-signs were a huge hit!</li>
            <li>My daughter has claimed most of them although I ordered them for me.</li>

            <li>that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t soon forget:-)</li>

            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I Love these tatoos… PJ</li>
            <li>sooo beautiful, honestly I’d consider something similar as a permanent tattoo!</li>
            <li>I even had the unintended surprise of an untanned tattoo where the original had protected the skin from the sun!</li>
            <li>Good diverse, positive images.</li>
            <li>The packaging that the products arrive in caught my interest - fun shape, easy to keep materials in and the information stickers are brightly colored and engaging.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to put on and even easier to remove!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>Directions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>All tattoos are separate so you can easily gift family and friends with them in a birthday card -</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and wear evenly and come off as promised on directions.  </li>
            <li>The makers of Yummy Yammy once again came up with a winner for all of us who believe in a FUN and HEALTHY lifestyle.</li>
            <li>so having a temporary alternative is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>she seemed to enjoy</li>
            <li>what a fun and fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>the quality exceeded my expectations and there is something that everyone of every age can enjoy.  </li>
            <li>My 14-year old daughter loved this.  </li>
            <li>I was able to hoard the really beautiful Henna patterns, the bird imagery and a few more for myself and have fun sharing the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were easy to apply and stayed good looking for several days!</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tattoos, but will probably never get another, so having these temporary ones is fun!</li>
            <li>These tattoos are SO MUCH FUN!</li>
            <li>These are so fun!  </li>
            <li>I chose the dragonfly as my first one and got many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Oh so much FUN!</li>
            <li>Fun, creative and really fun</li>
            <li>Our grandkids want to try a new one each time they come for a visit - that&#x27;s just loads of fun!!!  </li>
            <li>a large selection of colorful fantasy work and Tribal art , easy to follow directions ( and a bonus video which was fantastic ! ), and a sweet container to keep them in , to reuse after they are all gone .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Obviously the owner is very concerned about good service!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are super easy to apply and they lasted a full 5-6 days of sunscreen, fresh- and salt-water swimming (I did avoid using soap on the area.)</li>
            <li>It became a sweet integration of body art and body history.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and easy to remove--an important aspect for someone working in a rather strict professional environment like myself.</li>
            <li>I ordered a package and pulled them out at a party--ladies and even some of my guy friends were quick to choose their favorites and slap them on.</li>
            <li>found the video particularly helpful as I was committing to using so many at once .</li>
            <li>Consider this to be a real accessory like jewelry and as easy as putting on lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The tattoos look very realistic, and there is a huge assortment.  </li>
            <li>It was nice that a couple of these tattoos were larger than you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these before I went on vacation as I thought they&#x27;d be fun to play with.</li>
            <li>I like that the Henna tattoos are actual Henna colors, too, nice to get the look of Henna without the patience and care it takes to apply paste!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I’m not crazy about geckos… but my boyfriend’s kids</li>
            <li>These are so fun..  </li>
            <li>Very easy to follow directions, easy to apply and stay on longer than expected!</li>
            <li>I put a henna-type design on the top of my hand and down my index finger on a Friday night, and it looked great the following day.</li>
            <li>Beautiful &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li>You want to be sure to have clean dry skin for great adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;Sweating hard with a 30 lb.</li>
            <li>I have loved  pictures of other women who have had the ink tattoos created over their scars and have not been ready to do this myself.</li>
            <li>so I had to cancel the original order and place a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much enjoying them, and they would make fun gifts, either the whole package or individual tattoos</li>
            <li>Some are very artistic, some are silly, a very nice mix for the group.  </li>
            <li>I loved the ones my wife bought so much that I ordered a set to give as little gifts to work associates, nieces, etc.  </li>
            <li>They went on easy &amp; stayed on pretty well until they were slathered with multiple coats of bug spray and sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Easy directions are on the back of each one.</li>
            <li>And they came off easily for work the next day.</li>
            <li>I’m hoping to apply it to my boyfriend’s hand when he’s sleeping --  I often ‘blot’ my lipstick with a kiss on his hand, so I’m looking forward to his face when he realizes the smooch is not rubbing off like the normal lipstick marks he’s used to!&lt;br /&gt;Pulled them out when 3 girlfriends and I were getting ready to go out, and we all had fun decorating our bodies for the night--</li>
            <li>It lasted very well and looked like a real tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I still appreciated the array of images in the pack-</li>
            <li>I absolutely ADORE the ‘bird page’ of tattoos-</li>
            <li>favorite part of the pack is that there are a few really large ones—much larger than normal temporary tattoos—I think the peacock feather is shown in the advertising;  I’m saving it for a special occasion, I’m excited to place it somewhere</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for putting together such a rich collection of art and possibilities.</li>
            <li>They love temporary tattoos, but I don&#x27;t like the typical kiddie ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised by the VARIETY!!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much product was packed into this sample pack; something for your every mood and all natural themes.  </li>
            <li>We went to the beach for vacation, and a tried a new one each day.  </li>
            <li>A tatoo for all , young and older.</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>It was very gentle and left no trace on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you are having a girls night out for young and old - make these part of the festivities!</li>
            <li>half of the tattoos have their own paper and there are instructions on the back of every single one which is really helpful.</li>
            <li>i love temporary tattoo but there are sometimes hard to find for grownups.  </li>
            <li>Last a week, looks real.</li>
            <li>Everyone at my family reunion not only thought I had a real tatoo ~ but then agreed I should follow up with a permanent tatoo.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried one and it looked terrific.  </li>
            <li>original order (bundled with other pieces from other sellers) got lost</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always  looking forward to new and unusual additions to the  surprise balls (various small items rolled up in crepe paper balls)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality and great variation !!! I really like this item and recommend it greatly !!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Beautiful &amp; long lasting</li>
            <li> These tattoos are really great!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a girls canoe trip along with some other temporary tattoos.  There&#x27;s a very nice selection of temporary tattoos in the box.  Some are very artistic, some are silly, a very nice mix for the group.  They went on easy &amp; stayed on pretty well until they were slathered with multiple coats of bug spray and sunblock.  I think they would have lasted quite well without that.  The one that I put on my back that didn&#x27;t get the sunblock &amp; bug spray lasted for 4 days.  It was nice that a couple of these tattoos were larger than you&#x27;d expect.  The peacock feather pictured in the photos is the largest one.  It lasted very well and looked like a real tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original order (bundled with other pieces from other sellers) got lost so I had to cancel the original order and place a new one.  The owner contacted me to make sure that there was nothing wrong with the product.  Obviously the owner is very concerned about good service!  She even followed up with me after I got back from the trip to see how it went.</li>
            <li> Great choices - some color/some black and white. Very easy to follow directions, easy to apply and stay on longer than expected! The packaging that the products arrive in caught my interest - fun shape, easy to keep materials in and the information stickers are brightly colored and engaging. I did watch the video which gives good info and tips on application and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;Overall  - well done!</li>
            <li> These tattoos are great fun!  We went to the beach for vacation, and a tried a new one each day.  The package arrived quickly and in good order.  They are easy to put on and take off.  All as advertised! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always  looking forward to new and unusual additions to the  surprise balls (various small items rolled up in crepe paper balls) I make for presents for friends and these will be a welcome addition. Fun, creative and really fun designs.&lt;br /&gt;But I couldn&#x27;t help snagging a few for myself. Great idea, great designs, great product.</li>
            <li> Great collection of tattoos that all ages can enjoy. I like how the directions to apply are on the back of each one. I also like how they are all separate so you could send one in a card to your best friend, or pack them as surprises in lunch boxes. Directions are easy to follow.  Good variety of tasteful designs. My daughter has claimed most of them although I ordered them for me.</li>
            <li> Terrific tattoos for both kids AND adults. Easy directions are on the back of each one. I love the variety of designs. Our grandkids want to try a new one each time they come for a visit - that&#x27;s just loads of fun!!!  All tattoos are separate so you can easily gift family and friends with them in a birthday card - that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; they don&#x27;t soon forget:-)</li>
            <li> I instantly feel cooler!  I have always toyed with the idea but I am a commitment phobe - these let me play!  I loved the assortment I was totally surprised by the VARIETY!!  Edgy to playful to cerebral.  Love them!  I even shared with my nieces.</li>
            <li> these are great!  i love temporary tattoo but there are sometimes hard to find for grownups.  these are beautiful and pretty and i love putting them on!</li>
            <li> I ordered these before I went on vacation as I thought they&#x27;d be fun to play with. They are beautiful! There is something for every woman: luscious full-color butterflies, lizards and feathers; henna-colored swirls; and hearts, suns and moons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are super easy to apply and they lasted a full 5-6 days of sunscreen, fresh- and salt-water swimming (I did avoid using soap on the area.) I even had the unintended surprise of an untanned tattoo where the original had protected the skin from the sun! I&#x27;m very much enjoying them, and they would make fun gifts, either the whole package or individual tattoos tucked in a note card.</li>
            <li> This shipment of tattoos arrived very quickly and was nicely packaged. Very easy to use and I loved the combination and variety of designs. I have &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tattoos, but will probably never get another, so having these temporary ones is fun! Especially since I can change them as I desire.</li>
            <li> These tattoos are SO MUCH FUN! I ordered a package and pulled them out at a party--ladies and even some of my guy friends were quick to choose their favorites and slap them on. They are easy to apply and easy to remove--an important aspect for someone working in a rather strict professional environment like myself. I put a henna-type design on the top of my hand and down my index finger on a Friday night, and it looked great the following day. I scrubbed kitchen and bathroom post-party on Sunday and by that evening, was able to take the remaining color off with just a bit of soap and water. It was very gentle and left no trace on my sensitive skin. I will definitely be restocking soon!</li>
            <li> WOW ! What a great surprise : a large selection of colorful fantasy work and Tribal art , easy to follow directions ( and a bonus video which was fantastic ! ), and a sweet container to keep them in , to reuse after they are all gone .&lt;br /&gt;I played around and created a larger piece through combining a number of the pieces to cover scars I have from cancer surgery. It became a sweet integration of body art and body history. I have loved  pictures of other women who have had the ink tattoos created over their scars and have not been ready to do this myself. Having the freedom to explore ( and cry ) at my leisure opened up another pathway to experiencing the beauty in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the video particularly helpful as I was committing to using so many at once . They last a long time : a week on my back. A close friend took my lay out and did all of the wetting and peeling . You want to be sure to have clean dry skin for great adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;Sweating hard with a 30 lb. back pack began to remove them but before that they were pristine for 6 days !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for putting together such a rich collection of art and possibilities. I see them making their ways into the hearts and bodies of many of my friends as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Namaste.</li>
            <li> A tatoo for all , young and older. Great gift and party favor!! Last a week, looks real.</li>
            <li> Loved them!  There are more in the box than I realized.  So far I have tried one and it looked terrific.  Plenty more to play with!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These were great fun to share with my daughters. We all put one on and there are so many in the box they can share with their friends too.</li>
            <li> I loved the ones my wife bought so much that I ordered a set to give as little gifts to work associates, nieces, etc.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much product was packed into this sample pack; something for your every mood and all natural themes.  The makers of Yummy Yammy once again came up with a winner for all of us who believe in a FUN and HEALTHY lifestyle.</li>
            <li> These are so fun!  I&#x27;m a little bit of a ninny when it comes to getting a permanent tattoo - so having a temporary alternative is fantastic.  I love the bright colors and creative designs.  My daughter and I both applied them.  It was super easy to put on and even easier to remove!  If you are having a girls night out for young and old - make these part of the festivities! I could so see someone buying a pack of these for use at a baby or bridal shower.  And the best part...MADE IN THE USA! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Good diverse, positive images. Speaking as someone who does have a few permanent tattoos and doesn’t actually mind the “blades, blood, bimbos or bondage” aesthetic, I still appreciated the array of images in the pack- I was able to hoard the really beautiful Henna patterns, the bird imagery and a few more for myself and have fun sharing the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the pack is that there are a few really large ones—much larger than normal temporary tattoos—I think the peacock feather is shown in the advertising;  I’m saving it for a special occasion, I’m excited to place it somewhere dramatic- draped around my shoulder, maybe wrapped around my wrist like a bracelet! I absolutely ADORE the ‘bird page’ of tattoos- one is an empty birdcage, door open and the key hanging down- sooo beautiful, honestly I’d consider something similar as a permanent tattoo! I have been wearing it and glancing down at it for a source of strength: reminding myself to not allow myself to stay caged.  I like that the Henna tattoos are actual Henna colors, too, nice to get the look of Henna without the patience and care it takes to apply paste!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smooch tattoo! I’m hoping to apply it to my boyfriend’s hand when he’s sleeping --  I often ‘blot’ my lipstick with a kiss on his hand, so I’m looking forward to his face when he realizes the smooch is not rubbing off like the normal lipstick marks he’s used to!&lt;br /&gt;Pulled them out when 3 girlfriends and I were getting ready to go out, and we all had fun decorating our bodies for the night--And they came off easily for work the next day. My best friend said the fox was the sexiest fox she’d ever seen and I’d have to agree. I’m not crazy about geckos… but my boyfriend’s kids were!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About half of the tattoos have their own paper and there are instructions on the back of every single one which is really helpful., especially for gifting/sharing/group use. I didnt realize you could use them as stickers and can’t wait to try that next!</li>
            <li> My 14-year old daughter loved this.  The tattoos look very realistic, and there is a huge assortment.  I plan to try one myself!  Nice gift.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as part of stocking stuffers for my children at Christmas. They love temporary tattoos, but I don&#x27;t like the typical kiddie ones. These were the perfect solution for us- the tatts are intricately designed and the suns, butterflies, and peace-signs were a huge hit! They were easy to apply and stayed good looking for several days! We couldn&#x27;t be happier. I saw they have heart-shaped tattoos now which I will be ordering to include in my kids&#x27; valentines.</li>
            <li> present for 5th grade girl...she seemed to enjoy</li>
            <li> These tattoos are beautiful and easy to apply and remove. Everyone I showed them to wanted to try one. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> what a fun and fabulous product!  the quality exceeded my expectations and there is something that everyone of every age can enjoy.  I chose the dragonfly as my first one and got many compliments.  They are easy to apply and wear evenly and come off as promised on directions.  Consider this to be a real accessory like jewelry and as easy as putting on lipstick.  thanks for a great treat!</li>
            <li> Oh so much FUN! Everyone at my family reunion not only thought I had a real tatoo ~ but then agreed I should follow up with a permanent tatoo. But why would I? I have all these wonderful tatoos to choose from AND I can satisfy my fickle tastes! I can CHANGE my tatoos! Or be bareless if the situaition warents it. I Love these tatoos… PJ</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! These are so fun..  A great way to be playful and no pain and permanence!</li>
