            <li>I am very happy with my uv lamp.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that this lamp would be as awesome as the reviews, but after 20 minutes having one finger under the lamp</li>
            <li>Nail static!!!</li>
            <li>Was good until stopped working when I started applying the color to my nail.</li>
            <li>I treated myself to a shellac manicure using this KMASHI UV Light Nail Polish Dryer, and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li>and I want to state that in order for gel to set you must use the uv light plus a nail gel cleanser .</li>
            <li>It would take all day to do my hands and feet with this light.</li>
            <li>This is so cheap.</li>
            <li>The only thing it is any good for is a one finger touch-up when travelling.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>I have a very good one that only cost a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>Overall really handy</li>
            <li>so i used many different types of gel polish and it didn&#x27;t cure any of them.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>one finger at a time &amp; doesn&#x27;t work very well...</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but still useful</li>
            <li>I love this little guy!</li>
            <li>My nails lasted exactly the same amount of time using this dryer as they do when I go get them done.</li>
            <li>This has one pitiful little LED light inside of it.</li>
            <li>I left one nail under the light for different intervals up to ten minutes</li>
            <li>and it never dried.</li>
            <li>Small easily transportable</li>
            <li>So as of right Now, I have half of a hand done.</li>

            <li> Too small.. it takes FOREVER  to dry. .</li>
            <li> its not strong enough...take to much time for dry...</li>
            <li> gets the job done but it is one finger at a time so takes quite a while</li>
            <li> Small easily transportable</li>
            <li> This lamp did not cure my nails at all.&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was the gel i was using so i used many different types of gel polish and it didn&#x27;t cure any of them.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my uv lamp. Yes it&#x27;s small it states that in the description. I was reading some people&#x27;s comments and I want to state that in order for gel to set you must use the uv light plus a nail gel cleanser . The cleanser is what allows the gel to set</li>
            <li> Was good until stopped working when I started applying the color to my nail. So as of right Now, I have half of a hand done.</li>
            <li> one finger at a time &amp; doesn&#x27;t work very well...nails are still &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; for about an hour</li>
            <li> Turns off every 60 sec&lt;br /&gt;Very small&lt;br /&gt;Have to keep turning on..&lt;br /&gt;Nails stay wet :/</li>
            <li> Way smaller than expected</li>
            <li> This has one pitiful little LED light inside of it. It would take all day to do my hands and feet with this light. The only thing it is any good for is a one finger touch-up when travelling. I have a very good one that only cost a few dollars more.</li>

            <li> It worked one finger at time....</li>
            <li> Nail static!!! I love this little guy! My nail look Amazin &amp; half the cost of a trip to the salon!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry the nails at all.</li>
            <li> This is so cheap. It didn&#x27;t dry my daughters nail polish.. its like a toy..</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but still useful</li>
            <li> I like it. Put i didnt know it was so small...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected for $12 and some change + $5 shipping, I would of paid $8 for something this small but I like the fact that it&#x27;s portable. If I would have known I would have bought a bigger one for that price that dries all fingers at once. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, it arrived on time that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars. I hope it doesn&#x27;t take as long to try both hands. Overall really handy and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to a shellac manicure using this KMASHI UV Light Nail Polish Dryer, and it worked beautifully. My nails lasted exactly the same amount of time using this dryer as they do when I go get them done. I would recommend this to anyone.  I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t work. I must say that I didn&#x27;t expect it to considering the price. I left one nail under the light for different intervals up to ten minutes and it never dried.</li>
