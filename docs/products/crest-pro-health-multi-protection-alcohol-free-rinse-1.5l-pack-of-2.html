            <li>I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research on this product..</li>
            <li>I kept wondering why my mouth exploded with sores as I was otherwise completely healthy</li>
            <li>I am most satisfied and will use nothing else</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard otherwise, so I&#x27;m assuming he was pleased.</li>
            <li>I received this product free through BzzAgent from Crest.</li>
            <li>I received this free product as a promotion via Crest .I</li>

            <li>I got nthis product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free and leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li>leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>After switching from Listerine (used more than 20 years) to this Crest Pro-Health mouthwash because I tried a sample free for review from Crest, I&#x27;ve found that my 2x daily oral care routine is fun and enjoyable!</li>
            <li>This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine.</li>
            <li>It leaves a great after taste and doesn&#x27;t have that harsh alcohol burning flavor..</li>
            <li>Being a diabetic, I needed a mouthwash that would keep my breath fresh and not elevate my glucose level.</li>
            <li>right...</li>
            <li>It left my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>much easier on the mouth than the alcohol washes.</li>
            <li>I got this at Costco for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>However, it stained my teeth brown as many people have complained about.</li>
            <li>But I will say I was a little concerned reading the packing at first and noticed that it said that it could possible result in staining of your teeth which made me alarmed, but I have yet to see any staining of my teeth</li>

            <li> Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, especially if your like me and don&#x27;t like the burning sensation that you have when using other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Immediately stopped using it and slowly the stain started going away (after brushing intensely for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> I immediately poured the second bottle down the drain and rinsed my mouth with saltwater for three or four days and they finally started to heal.  </li>
            <li> Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine!</li>
            <li> I threw it in the trash with half of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> After getting the refund I poured the mouthwash down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!!</li>
            <li> A day later after rinsing a cap-full in my mouth, I began to notice a few stinging canker sores inside my lips  </li>
            <li> Another day went by and my mouth became completely full of big painful stinging sores up in my gums, lips and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I recently discovered the unopened second bottle of mouthwash and began using it again having completely forgotten about my bad experience with this mouthwash a year earlier.  </li>
            <li> I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> That is when I remembered my initial bad experience with this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> , it leaves this awful, weird taste in your mouth for a long time after you use it, and it made my teeth and gums extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I consider this product poison considering the painful sores caused by the chemicals in this product.  </li>
            <li> Literally the worst mouthwash I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this mouthwash.  Alcohol free and leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
            <li> I received this product free through BzzAgent from Crest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, especially if your like me and don&#x27;t like the burning sensation that you have when using other mouthwashes. I have been using it for well over a month now and can say I actually notice a change in the appearance in my teeth, they are brighter, no plaque buildup throughout the day and I have fresher breath. But I will say I was a little concerned reading the packing at first and noticed that it said that it could possible result in staining of your teeth which made me alarmed, but I have yet to see any staining of my teeth so I am very satisfied. 5/5.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...used it for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the dummies saying it &amp;#34;stained&amp;#34; their teeth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://news.crest.com/faq-item/health-rinse/does-crest-pro-health-rinse-stain-teeth-brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently ya&#x27;ll aint doin somethin right...lol</li>
            <li> Love the Product use it every day</li>
            <li> Literally the worst mouthwash I have ever used. Not only did it stain my teeth, it leaves this awful, weird taste in your mouth for a long time after you use it, and it made my teeth and gums extremely sensitive. I never complained about sensitivity in my mouth and had perfect dentist visits until I used this mouth wash. I threw it in the trash with half of the bottle left. Wish I could rate lower.</li>
            <li> I received this free product as a promotion via Crest .I love this mouth wash! It leaves a great after taste and doesn&#x27;t have that harsh alcohol burning flavor.. I&#x27;m defiantly switching over!</li>
            <li> Great product; I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> much easier on the mouth than the alcohol washes. leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Received product in good condition</li>
            <li> . I recieved my bottle from BZZAgent for free  Crest has made a great product and no alcohol ..tastes great and kids love it</li>
            <li> Product has sucralose in it which weakens your tooth enamel. Also, gives you mouth sores. Will never use any Crest product again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth! I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault. This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine. I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store? Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine! I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!! How Crest can continue to market this product is beyond me, and their PR response is a patronizing joke. &amp;#34;Dirty teeth means it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;, indeed! Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains. Shame on you, Crest/P&amp;G!</li>
            <li> After switching from Listerine (used more than 20 years) to this Crest Pro-Health mouthwash because I tried a sample free for review from Crest, I&#x27;ve found that my 2x daily oral care routine is fun and enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I should have done more research on this product.. The fine print says that it contains an ingredient that might stain teeth! I used this for about 3 days and noticed a brown stain in between my teeth.. Immediately stopped using it and slowly the stain started going away (after brushing intensely for a couple weeks). I did research and it says staining of teeth is a sign that the mouthwash is actually killing the bacteria.. So there are pros and cons to this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I got this at Costco for much cheaper. However, it stained my teeth brown as many people have complained about. Wish I had looked it up sooner. Going to return them to Costco now. Definitely would not recommend this mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Twice, this product caused stinging canker sores inside my mouth that lasted for four of five days.  I purchased this product from a different vendor and received a refund from P&amp;G after showing proof of purchase.  After getting the refund I poured the mouthwash down the toilet.  That initial canker sore experience was about a year ago.  I forgot to throw away the second bottle and put it away in a closet.  I recently discovered the unopened second bottle of mouthwash and began using it again having completely forgotten about my bad experience with this mouthwash a year earlier.  A day later after rinsing a cap-full in my mouth, I began to notice a few stinging canker sores inside my lips  I still didn&#x27;t put two and two together so I kept using the mouthwash.  Another day went by and my mouth became completely full of big painful stinging sores up in my gums, lips and cheeks.  I kept wondering why my mouth exploded with sores as I was otherwise completely healthy and I never get canker sores.  That is when I remembered my initial bad experience with this mouthwash.  I immediately poured the second bottle down the drain and rinsed my mouth with saltwater for three or four days and they finally started to heal.  I consider this product poison considering the painful sores caused by the chemicals in this product.  I notified P&amp;G they filed a report.  You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> I got nthis product for free to try and review. It left my mouth fresh and clean. I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn with use. My teenagers liked that too. The flavor was great also. I would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. Being a diabetic, I needed a mouthwash that would keep my breath fresh and not elevate my glucose level. This product was recommend tome 5 years ago by my endocrinologist. I am most satisfied and will use nothing else</li>
            <li> Gift for nephew. I haven&#x27;t heard otherwise, so I&#x27;m assuming he was pleased.</li>
