            <li>Most cologneâ€™s give me a headache</li>
            <li>Out of all the curves to choose from (and there were many)</li>
            <li>Packaging was cute too.</li>
            <li>i plan to buy two more bottles before the price goes</li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents sold in the Curve line.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>

            <li>he (and I) liked just as much.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I chose Curve Soul by Liz Claiborne, because of its Clean &amp; Freshness and it Draws Compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received several compliments from the ladies telling me how good I smell wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is really good smelling--I had never smelled it prior to purchasing but for the price of the cologne and size of bottle, i couldnt pass it up.</li>
            <li>he loved it so much he wants another.it&#x27;s the first large bottle of curve product anyone has ever seen.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with this cologne,it doesn&#x27;t resemble other Curve products,I would have returned it</li>
            <li>great price compared to the other scents i buy  done</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>this colonge got here before expected and it was just as good or not better smelling than the original curve which ive been wearing for 12yrs price was great</li>
            <li>when i was in High school all my female friends would tell me i smelled good when they would hug me........</li>
            <li>Woodsy and citrus aroma that makes you feel just right.</li>
            <li>But the price was right and makes a good everyday user after shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice clean woodsy scent without being to heavy or overpowering and lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I have seen this product increase in price here and at the stores since the first time I bought it</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive comments when using this.  </li>
            <li>The very reasonable price raised the suspicion that this may not be the genuine item but a weak imitation, but it is genuine, a great scent and lasts well.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to find such a large bottle of this cologne for such a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little musky and smells warm and manly.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like to save my expensive bottles for weekends and bar nights, so wanted something cheap that also smelled good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this scent for several years now, it is a refreshing cologne that isn&#x27;t overbearing but strong enough to last all day.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s contemporary, so it doesn&#x27;t remind me of my grandfather.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you get this bottle.</li>
            <li>BUT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH</li>
            <li>Regular Curve is better as the smell last longer on you where this Soul seems kind of weak.</li>
            <li>Product was in new condition as stated.</li>
            <li>This product is [...] bucks where i live and for getting it for [...]</li>
            <li>Now I have to look for a new cheaper cologne...</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted a new cologne</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and with absolutely no damages.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was much faster than I anticipated too, especially considering it was Christmas time when I ordered it!</li>
            <li>I have people stop me frequently to ask me what I&#x27;m weaaring</li>
            <li>My choice for the fall season can&#x27;t get no better and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and at the lowest price I could find after searching the net for several days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super picky about how my man smells (as long as he smells clean!), but I don&#x27;t like an over-powering scent, or anything that would make him smell like my father.</li>
            <li>The only positive is when my wife cuddles up even hours later</li>
            <li>I received this package within 2 days of my order, which was much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>My husband has been wearing this cologne since, well, he was old enough to wear cologne.</li>

            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne since, well, he was old enough to wear cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like its subtle but masculine scent.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d been having trouble finding it in stores, and I was concerned that he would have to find a new smell</li>
            <li> Guess I won&#x27;t need any for a long long time ....&lt;</li>
            <li> Those bottles are 3 times more expensive and half this size.</li>
            <li> Besides Curve Crush for men this is the only other Curve product I like.</li>
            <li> I guess due to the size the scent does not last all day...</li>
            <li> and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like Soul, because it&#x27;s subtle (even if he sprays too much</li>
            <li> but I also like how inexpensive it is compared to other products.</li>
            <li> and I only spary small portions</li>

            <li> There are better colognes out there.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping. Paid for regular shipping rates (not overnight or two-day) yet the product arrived in 48 hours. Product was in new condition as stated. No deceit, all facts stated on product description were true, great experience. Will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier, i have ordered this product time and time again. It has come at lightening speed to my mail box and it has take a little longer at times. Either way i do not give a rats behind on shipping. This product is [...] bucks where i live and for getting it for [...] dollars cheaper i throw a party every time i get this in the mail. Ty amazon and ty tuccini. This cologne makes every woman i come in contact with very very happy. much love and respect. thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband an he loved it so much he wants another.it&#x27;s the first large bottle of curve product anyone has ever seen.I should invest in some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments from the ladies telling me how good I smell wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne it has a nice smell and is not over powering. Will diffently make it my daily cologne to wear</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this cologne,it doesn&#x27;t resemble other Curve products,I would have returned it but when you buy cologne there is no returning.The only positive is when my wife cuddles up even hours later she says \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot; even though I can&#x27;t smell it anymore, so I got that going for me.</li>
            <li> This perfume is simply wonderful. It lasts the entire day. I use it for my sons and even when I wash ther clothes, the perfume lingers. Plus the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Besides Curve Crush for men this is the only other Curve product I like. I think it is the one cologne we purchase repeatedly. I just sent it as a gift to my brother for his birthday and I KNOW he&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li> the perfume works fine but...the price keeps dropping after I bought it.   it should not be a problem but since I am in Accounting, it means something.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this cologne and could only find it on Amazon. I bought this for my boyfriend since he was running out, and didn&#x27;t even know what brand it was since the label had been ripped off. When I finally figured out which one it was I ordered it and it came. This cologne smells like nothing I have ever smelled before. It&#x27;s a little musky and smells warm and manly. I notice it everytime my boyfriend wears it and it lasts a very long time. Too bad it is so hard to find but I also like how inexpensive it is compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Iv been looking all over for this cologne. Its smells great not to strong.....when i was in High school all my female friends would tell me i smelled good when they would hug me........i think some hugged me just so the smell would rub off on them lol.</li>
            <li> HUGE !!! I didn&#x27;t realize how big, Guess I won&#x27;t need any for a long long time ....&lt;br /&gt;Great Buy !!!</li>
            <li> I guess due to the size the scent does not last all day...when i shake the bottle it lasts longer..but ladies love it..</li>
            <li> Regular Curve is better as the smell last longer on you where this Soul seems kind of weak. But the price was right and makes a good everyday user after shaving.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and with absolutely no damages.  It was exactly what I was looking for and at the lowest price I could find after searching the net for several days.  I would highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> The very reasonable price raised the suspicion that this may not be the genuine item but a weak imitation, but it is genuine, a great scent and lasts well.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and boy did I do good! It smells fantastic and was a great deal here!</li>
            <li> My husband recieved a sample collection of Curve fragrances for men and this is his favorite.  The price on Amazon is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I get a ton of compliments from ladies when I wear this cologne. I think I found my signature scent that I&#x27;m going to stick with.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Finally ran out of the 6.8 ounces bottle. Checked amazon to repurchased the item but the price more than tripled!!! YIKES! Now I have to look for a new cheaper cologne...</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne based on reviews I read. I knew I wanted a new cologne and I wanted it cheap. I was not disappointed. This cologne has a very fresh smell to it. I really like its subtle but masculine scent. However, what impressed me most is the size of the bottle! I paid $20 for a bottle that will probably last me 2-4 years! I wear Hugo and Aqua DiGio also. Those bottles are 3 times more expensive and half this size. For what I paid for you can&#x27;t beat it and the scent will last for hours. Buy it based on price alone.</li>
            <li> Perfect I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better gift. You want be sorry for the price. The smell stays on my clothes for days and I only spary small portions</li>
            <li> this colonge got here before expected and it was just as good or not better smelling than the original curve which ive been wearing for 12yrs price was great</li>
            <li> I chose Curve Soul by Liz Claiborne, because of its Clean &amp; Freshness and it Draws Compliments. Has a great smell, great value, long-lasting, sexy, unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. I always get so many compliments because it is so entrancing yet no one knows what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rocKin&#x27;  curve soUl for 8 yrs and not planning on stopping any time soon !!  THIS product can NOT be touched!!  It Offers a pleasant and enjoyable aroma...  Instant compliments... Priced perfectly @ Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Bought Curve Soul for a Christmas gift for someone. They loved it. Very fast shipping &amp; great price. I shopped around a lot &amp; this was the best deal I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to find such a large bottle of this cologne for such a great price. Delivery was much faster than I anticipated too, especially considering it was Christmas time when I ordered it!</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the best smelling colognes i&#x27;ve ever owned. I get compliments every time i wear it. The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for several years now, it is a refreshing cologne that isn&#x27;t overbearing but strong enough to last all day.  My girlfriend loves the scent and I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive comments when using this.  Great cologne that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> SEEMED OK, I LIKED THIS SMEEL..WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? IT IS WHAT IT IS AND WHEN YOU NEED SOME THING YOU TRY FOR THE BEST PRICE BUT ALSO GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne.  He does not want to buy any other products.  He will continue buying this until he no longer is able to get the product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cologne.  My two friends and I smelled about 40 men&#x27;s colognes ranging in prices and all three liked this one the best.  Bought it for my husband and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! This is my favorite scent that my boyfriend wears. It smells so sexy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this stuff and more importantly, he loves how it smells too :)  good thing cuz i bought it for him. I have seen this product increase in price here and at the stores since the first time I bought it but I still find it reasonable and a very good buy.</li>
            <li> So glad I can still order this through Amazon. I love the way it smells on my boyfriend! Most cologneâ€™s give me a headache but this smells great on my man and he likes it too! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have this product before and suggested this to my friend as a gift.  He liked it.  I will recommend these to all of my friends. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Out of all the curves to choose from (and there were many) This was the best deal. I had never smelled this cologne before I bought it, but the reviews and price had me convinced. It smells great. It arrived quickly. I would buy from this seller again. I have no complaints. Packaging was cute too. Also I am a girl if that helps male buyers. I bought it for my man. ;)</li>
            <li> The sent is amazing i plan to buy two more bottles before the price goes up.buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it!</li>
            <li> My choice for the fall season can&#x27;t get no better and super fast delivery. Woodsy and citrus aroma that makes you feel just right.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. It smells very good and lasts all day long. Very good price too.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great very woodsy and spicy.  It is a great cologne for men and a great price. Love it</li>
            <li> What a great purchase! I received this package within 2 days of my order, which was much faster than expected. The bottle is huge (I got the 6.8 oz bottle). It should last at least 1-2 years. I needed a daily cologne that I could use for work. I like to save my expensive bottles for weekends and bar nights, so wanted something cheap that also smelled good. This is really good smelling--I had never smelled it prior to purchasing but for the price of the cologne and size of bottle, i couldnt pass it up. It reminds me of \\&quot;Jake\\&quot; from Hollister, which I had owned before and really liked. Highly recommend you get this bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne since, well, he was old enough to wear cologne. People have given him bottles of all sorts of stuff, but this is the kind that he prefers. I&#x27;m not super picky about how my man smells (as long as he smells clean!), but I don&#x27;t like an over-powering scent, or anything that would make him smell like my father. I like Soul, because it&#x27;s subtle (even if he sprays too much it&#x27;s not deadly), but it&#x27;s pleasant. And it&#x27;s contemporary, so it doesn&#x27;t remind me of my grandfather. I was very pleased to be able to find this product on Amazon. We&#x27;d been having trouble finding it in stores, and I was concerned that he would have to find a new smell he (and I) liked just as much.</li>
            <li> SMELL GREAT BUT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH</li>
            <li> i have been hooked since receiving it as a gift.  great price compared to the other scents i buy  done</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents sold in the Curve line. Nice clean woodsy scent without being to heavy or overpowering and lasts for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I have people stop me frequently to ask me what I&#x27;m weaaring So I tell them &#x27;Soul&#x27; by Curve.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It&#x27;s something that smells good, lasts for a decent amount of time on the skin and more if you spray your clothing. I get good compliments when I wear this. I&#x27;m a fan of affordable fragrances that doesn&#x27;t break the bank and this will always be one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> My dad wanted a bottle of this and I can&#x27;t complain! It smells good and it&#x27;s pretty cheap! Great choice.</li>
