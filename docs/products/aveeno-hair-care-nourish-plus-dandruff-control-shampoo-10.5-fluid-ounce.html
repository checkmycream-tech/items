            <li>Pleasant smell and gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>It is that mild yet effective.</li>
            <li>i was surprised at how great this product was.</li>
            <li>Smells good, don&#x27;t know if it really helps dandruff though.</li>
            <li>Got here fast, and good price.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo arrived very quickly and was sturdily packaged.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, helps with my husbands dry scalp issues and has a nice scent to it!  </li>
            <li>I have used many products (very high end salon products, health food store products and retail shelf products) and have thrown many away as well.  </li>
            <li>I went online to purchase this shampoo because it seems to no longer be available on store shelves.</li>
            <li>free clean and not drying like head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li>But after regular usage I could see the good results - my hair are so soft and smooth and that too without any dandruff!!</li>
            <li>I bought this at a local store to try it out, loved it, and then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It works well and quickly , too.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and delivered Faat</li>
            <li>This is the very first one that I like everything about.  </li>
            <li>I saw results/relief within the first shampooing!  </li>
            <li>The nourish is exactly that!</li>
            <li>Only dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve found to be effective.</li>
            <li>My scalp is extremely sensitive to most hair products.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the first dandruff shampoo and conditioner I have been able to use that 1) Worked for my very sensitive scalp AND</li>
            <li>I wish I looked at the label right away</li>
            <li>It gets our hair clean and rinses incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>I also feel like it could do a better job actually cleaning my hair</li>
            <li>i noticed a difference the first time i used it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product because it was suggested for for thinning hair but found that it left my hair without body.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>When I used this shampoo for the first time, I didn&#x27;t feel much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I have lost my hair color very quickly after starting to use it.  </li>
            <li>am going to order a few more bottles!</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Unlike other anti-dandruff shampoos in the market which are full of strong chemicals, this one has natural formula which is gentle on your scalp.</li>
            <li>other aveeno products way better.</li>
            <li>My hair are of dry types and they easily catch dandruff</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does a decent job with dandruff</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It seems so silly to be excited about shampoo, but when you can&#x27;t find something that you love, it becomes a quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Big difference the first time I used</li>
            <li>That site lists down the chemicals and potential hazard of most cosmetic</li>
            <li>It also leaves our hair shiny and smooth, which is not true of all Aveeno hair</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try aveeno dandruff shampoo and his hair has never looked so soft.</li>
            <li>If you want soft and shiny hair try this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>have a weird sinus problem that makes many shampoos smell like vomit (not fun having a gag reflex when you&#x27;re trying to wash your hair), but I love the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is a well known not to be used for someone that has dermatitis, and has an EWG rating of a 4 which is considered a moderate hazard, but too high in my book.</li>
            <li>have much of a strong scent, at least as far as my olfactory skills can detect,  which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>Obviously it does not take it away completely</li>
            <li>It usually feels soft and look very shiny.</li>

            <li> Obviously it does not take it away completely</li>
            <li> It usually feels soft and look very shiny.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, long dark DRY hair like myself, you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a heavy residue feeling like the older dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> i have a dry scalp and have tried various moisturizing masks to help control the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who had eczema as a child but has left him with very dry skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> Because of its conditioning ingredients, I would only recommend using a minimal amount for oily hair twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other product.</li>
            <li> In fact it keeps your skin hydrated for more than 10 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the science behind it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely had some dry scalp issues during the winter season.</li>
            <li> I get little red bumps that bleed or dry my scalp to point</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after few hours.</li>
            <li> , if you have dandruff (or not) or some other weird issue like smelling vomit and want clean, shiny hair with little fuss, this shampoo is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> Bt compared  to other dandruff shampoos it does not over dry your hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dandruff under control and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell unlike most dandruff products.</li>
            <li> I guess this works for scalp flakiness but not how I expected.</li>
            <li> It did help me with my dry scalp and dandruff!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair which is hard to find products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo about every other time I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li> One of my friend suggested me using Aveeno, she uses the other product of this</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every alternate day</li>
            <li> so I choose my shampoo very carefully.</li>
            <li> It works by sort of leaving a slimy coating on the scalp to lay down the flaky skin partials but in doing so</li>
            <li> He also has super thick hair that makes it impossible to rinse out properly.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes it leaves my hair still feeling a little bit oily.</li>
            <li> My husband has use Head and shoulders for 40 years and his hair always looked so dried out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could help his dried out hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The dry, cold weather has created a dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> but this shampoo can be used for everyday wash as well!</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using at least twice a week for a month or so, until the weather permits.  </li>
            <li> At times it seems my dandruff has even gotten worse!</li>

            <li> great shampoo good for the scalp as well as hair, recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Smells good, don&#x27;t know if it really helps dandruff though.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  My scalp and hair feel 100 times better.  I definitely recommend this shampoo</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> A really great product that has worked for me.  It also smells good and does the job as advertised. I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t work on my dandruff at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who had eczema as a child but has left him with very dry skin and scalp. This shampoo is great. He uses it twice weekly and feels his hair is much more manageable and no dandruff whatsoever. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would  like another choice than &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; since you cannot love an inanimate object. But I give it 5 stars. My dermatologist suggested I get this and it stopped the dandruff in my beard and cleared up any dermatitis on my face.  It works well and quickly , too.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> I guess this works for scalp flakiness but not how I expected. It works by sort of leaving a slimy coating on the scalp to lay down the flaky skin partials but in doing so it also sort of coats the hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dandruff under control and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell unlike most dandruff products.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to use aveeno products on my son who has dermatitis and myself and my husband who ended up with dandruff. I assumed it was a good product cause my Dr. recommended this. But to my dismay after I used it I read the ingredients and realized  it contained fragrance! Which is a well known not to be used for someone that has dermatitis, and has an EWG rating of a 4 which is considered a moderate hazard, but too high in my book. I wish I looked at the label right away cause when I bought it the ingredients were not listed at the time I ordered. Disappointing that dermatologists recommend this. A waste of money! So glad for the Environmental working group (EWG) and their efforts to reveal truth about what are in products we buy. I would have given this one no stars, but I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The best solution to dandruffs</li>
            <li> Works well for dandruff.</li>
            <li> love my hair [ok so i&#x27;m dating myself]. anyway this shampoo for dandruff is wonderful for my hair, gets rid of the flakes, makes my hair shine and manageable and smells so nice. I wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo for moisturizing your hair and scalp. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and still have dandruff so I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is.  It smells good though which is rare for dandruff shampoos.  I also feel like it could do a better job actually cleaning my hair, sometimes it leaves my hair still feeling a little bit oily.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely had some dry scalp issues during the winter season. This helped immensely without having to use harsher chemicals. I used a scalp scruber and this took out my dandruff troubles in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this product has a good rating over at EWG&#x27;s website. That site lists down the chemicals and potential hazard of most cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have much of a strong scent, at least as far as my olfactory skills can detect,  which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> Only dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve found to be effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store to try it out, loved it, and then couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except Amazon.  It seems so silly to be excited about shampoo, but when you can&#x27;t find something that you love, it becomes a quest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that I don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but my son does.  He also has super thick hair that makes it impossible to rinse out properly.  He loves it, too.  It gets our hair clean and rinses incredibly fast.  It also leaves our hair shiny and smooth, which is not true of all Aveeno hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a weird sinus problem that makes many shampoos smell like vomit (not fun having a gag reflex when you&#x27;re trying to wash your hair), but I love the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have dandruff (or not) or some other weird issue like smelling vomit and want clean, shiny hair with little fuss, this shampoo is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the shampoo but what I received was the shampoo and conditioner combination  which doesn&#x27;t work well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my husband by his dermatologist. He says it has relieved the itching. He had tried another shampoo but this one seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works s described. Shipped quickly and delivered Faat</li>
            <li> It did help me with my dry scalp and dandruff!! And i don&#x27;t need lots of conditioner after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno has become my favorite brand since I started using their moisturizing lotion for my eczema. This is the ONLY moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after few hours. In fact it keeps your skin hydrated for more than 10 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the science behind it!!</li>
            <li> i have a dry scalp and have tried various moisturizing masks to help control the dryness.  i was surprised at how great this product was. i wasn&#x27;t itching my scalp and my hair looks great!  i noticed a difference the first time i used it.  would highly recommend. am going to order a few more bottles!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because it was suggested for for thinning hair but found that it left my hair without body.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li> I like aveeno. I like how it makes my hair. It usually feels soft and look very shiny.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipment</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo about every other time I shampoo my hair.  The shampoo does a very good job of controlling dandruff and keeping your hair manageable.</li>
            <li> it is what  I was looking for.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used for dandruff.  Big difference the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo arrived very quickly and was sturdily packaged.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> This is the first dandruff shampoo and conditioner I have been able to use that 1) Worked for my very sensitive scalp AND 2) Made my hair feel and look great.  My scalp is extremely sensitive to most hair products.  Most products cause my scalp to itch to point I get little red bumps that bleed or dry my scalp to point it creates dandruff.  I have used many products (very high end salon products, health food store products and retail shelf products) and have thrown many away as well.  This is the very first one that I like everything about.  Now that I have found something that works, I am afraid they will either change the formula or stop making it.</li>
            <li> Helped with dandruff but on a different site it as reviewed as color-protective...it is not. I have lost my hair color very quickly after starting to use it.  Darned sulfates...</li>
            <li> I sure would appreciate it if Aveeno would make more of this!</li>
            <li> controls me dandruff the only shampoo that i have found that will work. nice price and no flakes</li>
            <li> Works great on hair. Pleasant smell and gentle on hair.I strongly recommend this shampoo.Makes hair shiny and soft. Very soothing to the scalp. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I just loved this shampoo! This is exactly what I was looking for. My hair are of dry types and they easily catch dandruff so I choose my shampoo very carefully. One of my friend suggested me using Aveeno, she uses the other product of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;  When I used this shampoo for the first time, I didn&#x27;t feel much of a difference. But after regular usage I could see the good results - my hair are so soft and smooth and that too without any dandruff!! I usually wash my hair every alternate day but this shampoo can be used for everyday wash as well! It is that mild yet effective. Unlike other anti-dandruff shampoos in the market which are full of strong chemicals, this one has natural formula which is gentle on your scalp. I have been using this shampoo for more than two months now.&lt;br /&gt;  I totally recommend this product and thank you Aveeno for this great shampoo! :) I am all happy happy! :)</li>
            <li> My husband has use Head and shoulders for 40 years and his hair always looked so dried out.So I decided to try aveeno dandruff shampoo and his hair has never looked so soft. I didn&#x27;t think anything could help his dried out hair. This shampoo has been amazing. If you want soft and shiny hair try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Product actually works! I love the aveeno brand.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for her allergies, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few weeks now but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement with dandruff. It&#x27;s ok, could be better.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the results.</li>
            <li> Great hair this stuff is great keeps my hair flake free clean and not drying like head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, helps with my husbands dry scalp issues and has a nice scent to it!  Would order this again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I still have dandruff along with an itchy scalp. At times it seems my dandruff has even gotten worse! The only plus is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my red hair color. But I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, long dark DRY hair like myself, you will be satisfied.  The dry, cold weather has created a dry, itchy scalp.  I saw results/relief within the first shampooing!  I would recommend using at least twice a week for a month or so, until the weather permits.  Because of its conditioning ingredients, I would only recommend using a minimal amount for oily hair twice a week.  Gives hair body too.  I am telling you-it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> meh. leaves hair kinda gunky. other aveeno products way better.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a decent job with dandruff Obviously it does not take it away completely, you have to regularly use it. Bt compared  to other dandruff shampoos it does not over dry your hair or scalp. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product would work considering its not &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34;. I used to use Selsum Blue, but that made my hair feel like straw. It also stripped my hair color. This shampoo works great (also the conditioner). I have been flake-free. It also smells nice. The nourish is exactly that! I have fine, thin hair which is hard to find products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This product is very good.</li>
            <li> By far the best dandruff shampoo ever.  I have seborheic dermatitis and this is the only product that has ever worked for me</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo twice now and I like it so far.  I woul reccomend this product for anyone with an itching scalp.</li>
            <li> I chose this shampoo because my dermatologist recommended it for my dandruff.  This shampoo lathers well &amp; has nice, clean scent.  It does not leave a heavy residue feeling like the older dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> working well and smells good, too</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. Got here fast, and good price.</li>
            <li> I went online to purchase this shampoo because it seems to no longer be available on store shelves. Its a shame since it has worked on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Does the job on dandruff...</li>
            <li> This shampoo is GREAT! My dandruff cleared within days of using it. It&#x27;s pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
