    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best value I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a LOT of aftershave balms in my lifetime and this one has been the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Anyone knows that the aftershaves that come with cologne probably aren&#x27;t the best idea, given that your face feels like you have brought a gas torch to your face afterward.</li>
            <li>Best price was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily and has a very pleasant odor to it as well.</li>
            <li>Great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>also an SPF 15 sun block which is a great added bonus on days</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal goes on thinner but feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>good on my skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>Additionally, a good product to use after using an acne cleanser, as some tend to cause over drying if used in excess.</li>
            <li>Good size container, easy to pack, and very good price.</li>
            <li>Love this aftershave!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best post shave lotion I could find.</li>
            <li>It is an effective moisturizer, smells nice, and protects your face from sun damage.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, has a very mild and pleasant smell, and has SPF 15 protection.  </li>
            <li>My go-to aftershave is easily this brand for its pleasant scent and soothing properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a mild, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth, and when it dries, you don&#x27;t even notice that it is there.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it wears off quickly though.</li>
            <li>This product is both non-irritating and not terribly greasy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re a dude and you shave (which most dudes do)</li>
            <li>then for SURE get this.</li>
            <li>I also keep some Nivea and Gillette, but that is more just to mix things up.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It will give you a healthy radiance and people will take notice.</li>
            <li>Just make sure after it clears on your skin you rub in the excess or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so awesome that I use it multiple times a day (once in morning before work</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Art Of Shaving balm (tried a sample) which I found too oily.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>all I love amazon for their correctness and speed</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be able to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face lotion.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, women dig it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great when I get razor burn, plus it has a natural smell, rather then perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells really great, doesn&#x27;t over dry or cause any irritation on burns, and leaves a nice skin glow.</li>
            <li>For the price as well, this is such a wonderful product, and is worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li>Strong SPF function, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin after shaving and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This a fine product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, great for a clean feeling post shave and all around facial moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s best used after a little alcohol post shave.</li>
            <li>All the reviews here suggested --actually, claimed-- that this product was great for that.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s basically just a light hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and I can&#x27;t wait to smell it on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, i really like it, nice scent,&lt;br</li>
            <li>available in a 3-pack:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good old lotion.  </li>
            <li>This aftershave is doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It has become my main sunscreen as well because it feels so much lighter and more comfortable than competing products.</li>
            <li>and my face is comfortable for the whole day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t worth the gas to the post office, unless you have a Prius.&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li>It actually smells nice and has helped my skin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>I use this balm every time after a clean shave and feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>As a moisturiser this works very well, wish it had a mild frangrance.</li>
            <li>As with most type of face lotions, how your skin reacts to them is a personal factor.</li>
            <li>going on 12 yrs and finally gave this Loreal Comfort Max a try and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Really love these products, especially for the $.</li>
            <li>This is the first aftershave i have fond</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had much better results with this lotion than with the similarly positioned Neutrogena face lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal is a much cheaper option than the Keihls</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal Paris aftershave balm does the trick very well.</li>
            <li>But this product has really improved my face, and I don&#x27;t break out after shaving at all.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t often wear cologne, but I doubt this would interfere with it much, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Our faces change from smooth operators to walking english muffins .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received compliments on how it really brings out a sleek, streamlined looking glow on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on skin with added advantage of sun protection</li>
            <li>She likes it better then the lotions put out by other cosmetic companys.</li>
            <li>Good old soap and water just don&#x27;t cut it no more.</li>
            <li>I used many branded after shave lotions before but this one beat all of them hands down.</li>
            <li>I have also compared this to the Jack Black aftershave balm with SPF and it is also better.  </li>
            <li>My entire face looks and feels better since I have been using this, especially the areas where I shave - smoother, less irritations, better shave.  </li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t look oily and I can comfortably go out, also it gives me a very soothing effect that I have not felt with any other products before.</li>
            <li>That gives me a little more assurance that I won&#x27;t be getting skin cancer on my bald head by standing out in the sun for 30 minutes.   </li>
            <li>The SPF 15 is great, as most people are unaware of how bad the sun is for your skin.</li>
            <li>Well in those new found crevices are opportunities for dirt, grease, smog ( I know..</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to the face afterward, and it feels as though you really are putting the moisture back into your face after shaving, just like an aftershave should.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product which i like very much, instead the seller delivered me \\&quot;anti-wrinkle &amp; firming moisturizer with uva/uvb sunscreen 1.6 OZ\\&quot; from the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li>Its light weight and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li>My regular super market stopped carrying it and CVS charges above MSRP.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find good affordable after-shave that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of your cologne and that actually does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and use and electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Before I started using this after-shave, my skin would be frequently irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li>Also a little goes a long way so its easy to cover my whole neck and face with it</li>
            <li>Clean your face thoroughly then put a little alcohol on a towel and see the dirt.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Because I was excited about the other items, I had to open and inspect this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started using an electric shaver and found I needed some post-shave treatment to put my face back to normal after the \\&quot;electric assault.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I would also like to add that I am very prone to breakouts, and shaving/aftershave has really given me lots of trouble before.</li>
            <li>It can be used as an after-shave balm or a general purpose face lotion.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy white but as it absorbs it turns clear.</li>
            <li>burn areas after a few hours of the first coat, or the next morning, to maintain the anti-irritation properties, and it works like a charm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not chemist but it looks like the ingredients of lotion with sun block as the main active ingredient.</li>

            <li> The scent is light and not over powering, not sure about staying power because its only been on the back of my hand for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> so future buyers, be careful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like alcohol-based aftershave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it&#x27;s a little stronger than a similar Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be kind of stupid to put spaghetti sauce on your face.</li>
            <li> The scent is probably the only small grievance that I have.</li>
            <li> The blue color (that&#x27;s just the container by the way, the stuff itself is white) leads you to think it&#x27;s a thin, waterish, alcoholish substance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time finding this product locally.</li>
            <li> It will not let you down.</li>
            <li> and I believe delivers at least the same performance, if not better.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive little product and</li>
            <li> little nooks and crannies invade what was once pristine flatland.</li>
            <li> No matter how little balm I use on my neck</li>
            <li> One reviewer complained its just lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells subtle so it won&#x27;t overwhelm your friends if you you cologne as well.</li>
            <li> Guys &amp; girls, give this loton a try, you wont go wrong.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it seems someone used it before.  </li>
            <li> I also was shocked to hear smog stuck to your face ) and oils to cake up.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> As with most type of face lotions, how your skin reacts to them is a personal factor. I shave my head and was looking for something that would give me additional sun protection. This product is both non-irritating and not terribly greasy. I find my skin does react well to it with no breakouts. It smells subtle so it won&#x27;t overwhelm your friends if you you cologne as well. I&#x27;m having a hard time finding this product locally. I hope this is not discontinued anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This is the only after shave lotion I have found that will not cause me to break out.  It is non-greasy, has a very mild and pleasant smell, and has SPF 15 protection.  It has become my main sunscreen as well because it feels so much lighter and more comfortable than competing products.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive little product and it works well.  I use it for a facial moisturizer as well.  Plan to keep on buying it</li>
            <li> Too bad, it seems someone used it before.  Almost no packaging inside, a simple bag? Come on, I will not but it again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a cheaper aftershave balm with sunscreen than Keihls facial moisturizer.  L&#x27;Oreal actually purchased Keihls and I figured the qualities would be close.  The L&#x27;Oreal is a much cheaper option than the Keihls and I believe delivers at least the same performance, if not better.  The scent is lighter than the Keihls.  L&#x27;Oreal goes on thinner but feels good on the skin.  I have also compared this to the Jack Black aftershave balm with SPF and it is also better.  Best value I have found.</li>
            <li> This a fine product for the price.  Strong SPF function, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin after shaving and it lasts all day. Odor is not an issue. Great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a LOT of aftershave balms in my lifetime and this one has been the best I have used. I started shaving my head several years ago now..going on 12 yrs and finally gave this Loreal Comfort Max a try and am so glad I did. It moisturizes just enough so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily and has a very pleasant odor to it as well. What sealed the deal for me was the 15 SPF included with it. That gives me a little more assurance that I won&#x27;t be getting skin cancer on my bald head by standing out in the sun for 30 minutes.   Anyway, if you&#x27;re a dude and you shave (which most dudes do) then get this!! If you&#x27;re a dude, or woman, and shave your head....then for SURE get this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just started using an electric shaver and found I needed some post-shave treatment to put my face back to normal after the \\&quot;electric assault.\\&quot;  All the reviews here suggested --actually, claimed-- that this product was great for that.  Well, maybe for some, but it&#x27;s basically just a light hand lotion.  After a shave, lotion is the last thing I want on my face.  The blue color (that&#x27;s just the container by the way, the stuff itself is white) leads you to think it&#x27;s a thin, waterish, alcoholish substance.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s good old lotion.  AKA, hand cream.</li>
            <li> I keep three kinds of aftershave in my bathroom. My go-to aftershave is easily this brand for its pleasant scent and soothing properties. I also keep some Nivea and Gillette, but that is more just to mix things up. Overall, if you are looking for comfort and cost-effectiveness, this is the way to go. It will not let you down.</li>
            <li> Anyone knows that the aftershaves that come with cologne probably aren&#x27;t the best idea, given that your face feels like you have brought a gas torch to your face afterward. It&#x27;s very hard to find good affordable after-shave that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of your cologne and that actually does what it is supposed to. The L&#x27;Oreal Paris aftershave balm does the trick very well. It is very soothing to the face afterward, and it feels as though you really are putting the moisture back into your face after shaving, just like an aftershave should. It is very smooth, and when it dries, you don&#x27;t even notice that it is there. The SPF 15 is great, as most people are unaware of how bad the sun is for your skin. The scent is probably the only small grievance that I have. The good news is that it wears off quickly though. I would also like to add that I am very prone to breakouts, and shaving/aftershave has really given me lots of trouble before. But this product has really improved my face, and I don&#x27;t break out after shaving at all. No razor bumps, burn, or breakouts. For the price as well, this is such a wonderful product, and is worth a try for anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of a gift set for my boyfriends birthday. Because I was excited about the other items, I had to open and inspect this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smells fantastic and I can&#x27;t wait to smell it on my boyfriend. The scent is light and not over powering, not sure about staying power because its only been on the back of my hand for about half an hour. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t often wear cologne, but I doubt this would interfere with it much, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;2) Its light weight and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have sensitive skin and use and electric shaver. sometimes i have to apply a second coat to razor burn areas after a few hours of the first coat, or the next morning, to maintain the anti-irritation properties, and it works like a charm</li>
            <li> As a moisturiser this works very well, wish it had a mild frangrance. Good size container, easy to pack, and very good price.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement to my skin almost immediately.  I have tried MANY EXPENSIVE men&#x27;s skin products and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s line beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this after every shave.  I shave each morning in the shower and am prone to razor irritation, bumps and ingrown hairs.  My entire face looks and feels better since I have been using this, especially the areas where I shave - smoother, less irritations, better shave.  I have also been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Expert Vita Lift Moisturizer each evening.  Really love these products, especially for the $.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It keeps my skin moisturized without feeling oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s soothing but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like alcohol-based aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s got a mild, pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, but it&#x27;s a little stronger than a similar Neutrogena product. Most importantly, women dig it.  I get compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m pasty white and the SPF shields me from the sun while still allowing me to get some color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My regular super market stopped carrying it and CVS charges above MSRP.  Thankfully, Amazon&#x27;s got my back.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, i really like it, nice scent,&lt;br /&gt;feels good on my skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best post shave lotion I could find. It goes on creamy white but as it absorbs it turns clear. I find that it&#x27;s best used after a little alcohol post shave. I know the alcohol trolls are going to scream about the apocalyptic consequences of putting alcohol on your face. But, I disagree. Here is why.&lt;br /&gt;  As we age (gracefully I hope) little nooks and crannies invade what was once pristine flatland. Our faces change from smooth operators to walking english muffins . Well in those new found crevices are opportunities for dirt, grease, smog ( I know..I also was shocked to hear smog stuck to your face ) and oils to cake up. Good old soap and water just don&#x27;t cut it no more. That&#x27;s right...I still put soap on my face. Another manscaping no-no. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;  Alcohol will pull that muck that the soap missed up. Try it. Clean your face thoroughly then put a little alcohol on a towel and see the dirt.&lt;br /&gt; Loreal Comfort Max fills that void of putting some elastic to your face after the alcohol. It will give you a healthy radiance and people will take notice. Just make sure after it clears on your skin you rub in the excess or you will look like those wax figures in California that creep everybody out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great when I get razor burn, plus it has a natural smell, rather then perfume. My last bottle was finished off by my wife, so I reordered the larger bottle. She puts it on all her shaving areas, and women have softer skin, so razor burn happens to them also. She likes it better then the lotions put out by other cosmetic companys. Guys &amp; girls, give this loton a try, you wont go wrong. Best price was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this post shave balm for four months now. It&#x27;s so awesome that I use it multiple times a day (once in morning before work and after if I go out). It smells really great, doesn&#x27;t over dry or cause any irritation on burns, and leaves a nice skin glow. I&#x27;ve received compliments on how it really brings out a sleek, streamlined looking glow on my skin. Additionally, a good product to use after using an acne cleanser, as some tend to cause over drying if used in excess. Love this product, great for a clean feeling post shave and all around facial moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is the first aftershave i have fond that A) doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol and B) has SPF. This aftershave is doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and absorbs quickly into the skin. My skin feels moisturized as soon as i put it on and if i have any irritation after shaving its also gone after applying this. Also a little goes a long way so its easy to cover my whole neck and face with it and as i stated it has a SPF15 rating so its helps protect from the sun. Love this aftershave!</li>
            <li> I like it better than the Art Of Shaving balm (tried a sample) which I found too oily.&lt;br /&gt;It also an SPF 15 sun block which is a great added bonus on days I plan to go outside.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product which i like very much, instead the seller delivered me \\&quot;anti-wrinkle &amp; firming moisturizer with uva/uvb sunscreen 1.6 OZ\\&quot; from the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;amazon send me the label to return this item and refund, but for 6$ i payed for this it doesn&#x27;t worth the gas to the post office, unless you have a Prius.&lt;br /&gt;over all I love amazon for their correctness and speed but this seller messed things up. so future buyers, be careful!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this after-shave, my skin would be frequently irritated after shaving. With use of this product and shaving once in two days, irritation is gone and I can get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also like the fact the cream does not have any smell and leaves my skin without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching forever for an After Shave that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. No matter how little balm I use on my neck I still can&#x27;t see out of my contact lenses. It&#x27;s not the fault of this product so I can&#x27;t blame it. It actually smells nice and has helped my skin but I won&#x27;t be able to keep using it. One reviewer complained its just lotion. Well dah. It&#x27;d be kind of stupid to put spaghetti sauce on your face. I&#x27;m not chemist but it looks like the ingredients of lotion with sun block as the main active ingredient. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this balm every time after a clean shave and feel very refreshed. My face doesn&#x27;t look oily and I can comfortably go out, also it gives me a very soothing effect that I have not felt with any other products before. I used many branded after shave lotions before but this one beat all of them hands down. It is gentle on skin with added advantage of sun protection so I started using it every time I go it not just while shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face lotion. It can be used as an after-shave balm or a general purpose face lotion. It is an effective moisturizer, smells nice, and protects your face from sun damage. I apply it once a day after I shave and shower and my face is comfortable for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had much better results with this lotion than with the similarly positioned Neutrogena face lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Also available in a 3-pack: [[ASIN:B0014ZR2R4 L&#x27;Oreal Men&#x27;s Expert Comfort Max Anti-Irritation After Shave Balm with SPF 15 Sunscreen,  3-Ounce Bottle  (Pack of 3)]]</li>
