            <li>I thought this was a great find... until I kept walking around wondering why I was smelling some kind of bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling and smell after using this soap!  </li>
            <li>I love this citrusy, lemony smell of this!</li>

            <li>The scent of the soap is nice and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>It sounds so nice with its paraben-free label, and benign description.</li>
            <li>This soap smells nice and looks luxury on my counter</li>
            <li>and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it&#x27;s all natural and healthy!</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find it here!</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome, clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Great fresh smell</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I have finally found a hand soap that is perfect for me in every way.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this hand soap.</li>
            <li>The smell lingers on the skin without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>While this product does have some organic components, it is most definitly NOT an all organic soap.  </li>
            <li>Although PEGs are considered safe for use topically on healthy skin, studies showed that patients suffering from severe burns were treated with PEG-based antimicrobial cream; this treatment resulted in kidney toxicity.  </li>
            <li>There are no studies that show this product is safe in humans.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many of these and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this product</li>
            <li>I am so glad that Amazon carries this soap.</li>
            <li>Love the very light scent and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, not too strong , not too weak, just perfect.</li>
            <li>I can smell that just fine, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my nose, but I don&#x27;t smell any lemongrass or clary sage.  </li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent of the lemon grass  &amp; clary sage hand soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrant, but not flowery, more of a fresh sent.  </li>
            <li>But this reminds me of really cheap knock-off cologne...</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>well worth it for me!</li>
            <li>this is environmentally friendly</li>
            <li>As someone who is very sensitive to scented products I was looking for a handsoap that smelled nice without being too perfumey and or leave lingering scent on my hands for hours after using it.  </li>
            <li>One or more in vitro tests non-mammalian cells show positive mutation results.  </li>
            <li>It is so full of non-organic stuff I wouldn&#x27;t clean my lavatory with it, never mind use it as hand soap.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate has gotten it right again!</li>
            <li>But not a bad one at all..</li>
            <li>This soap has a clean and fresh scent, lathers nicely and rinses completely off.  </li>
            <li>Leaves no residue, just a fresh scent and a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Good price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Pretty good on such price.</li>
            <li>Thanks to whomever created this soap!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands, but it doesn&#x27;t make them feel very clean either, and I like being able to tell that I just washed my hands.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, works well, simple and straight forward.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a distinct sage aroma which was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love the soft feeling after using this soap.</li>
            <li>love the clean smell, definitely something I want to keep on hand without running out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Nature&#x27;s Gate products and thought they were really good, but I&#x27;m not a fan of this soap.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products from Nature&#x27;s Gate and am always very pleased.</li>
            <li>One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at moderate doses</li>
            <li>The same study by Lanigan[9] also found that both dermal exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to EDTA in aerosolized cosmetic formulations would produce systemic effects below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies.    </li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance, gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s gate liquid hand soaps are organic and clean hands completely.  </li>
            <li>Need very little to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>One or more animal studies show reproductive effects at high doses (Journal of the American College of Toxicology 1986).  </li>
            <li>many soaps and dry my skin, but Nature&#x27;s Gate fulfills everything that I wnat and&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a large pack that we like.</li>
            <li>It gives a lot of body to my baby fine blonde hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also free of all those harmful chemicals such as SLS</li>
            <li>Hand washing is so important to overall health.</li>
            <li>Those thinking this is non-toxic will be very misled.  </li>
            <li>There are MUCH safer ALL ORGANIC soaps on the market.      </li>
            <li>But the skin feels much softer with Nature&#x27;s Gate soap.</li>
            <li>We really like this in our kitchen.</li>
            <li>Nice change from the everyday soap</li>
            <li>I prefer the lemongrass and clary sage scent because it has a clean smell and not such a perfume smell.</li>
            <li>This is a great hand soap and isn&#x27;t full of crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Not necessary for true soaps.)    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hand soap.</li>
            <li>A good purchase..Am not a great fan of the smell of this product..</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, not too strong, not to faint!</li>
            <li>they did freeze, but I live in near artic Minnesota.  </li>
            <li>The polyethylene glycol ether of the diester of natural Methylglucose and Oleic Acid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see any comments about the scent because I can&#x27;t smell anything but the chemical-like smell of unscented soap.  </li>
            <li>Also two of the 3 pumps have broke so far.</li>
            <li>Really like the fragrance - would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my hands and they feel soft after using.</li>
            <li>Definitely a NO-NO if you are keeping up with the toxins to be avoided by major natural news organizations.</li>
            <li>I feel like I only need a little bit of soap to get clean, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t mind using it, but not a wow soap.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Nothing great, but nothing terrible either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so concentrated that it will last 4 times longer than my previous hand soap!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any antibacterial soap due to the cancer causing agent Triclosan.  </li>
            <li> I have had to switch the workable pump to the other soaps as needed.</li>
            <li> that conforms generallyto the formula: where n has an average value of 20.  </li>
            <li> One small drop of this thick natural soap does the job.  </li>
            <li> The plastic tube that goes down into the bottle broke off from the bottom of the pump.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down there somewhere, and I could straighten out a hanger and dig it out I suppose, but since this came in a 3-pack, I just can&#x27;t think of a reason why I should.  </li>
            <li> star left for the press is little bit hard to use.</li>
            <li> Ordered because i have brought product elsewhere previously.</li>
            <li> A few of the bottles were delivered and the soap had leaked all down the bottle.</li>
            <li> No substitute would do (and I tried a few).</li>
            <li> Smell is actually not good but it doesnt make my hand dry</li>
            <li> Hate using somebody&#x27;s bar soap, this has a clean smell without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> also it is very very thick than the other soaps...</li>
            <li> and I mean NEVER--looked up a product like this when it disappears from stores; I just sigh and move on with my life.</li>
            <li> It has been found to be both cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic in laboratory animals.</li>
            <li> Products and formulas containing PEGs should not be used on broken or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot time with hobbies and get paint etc on my hands and this soap also cleans well on difficult stains.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Out of the 3 that I ordered, 2 of the pump dispensers were literally broken!!</li>
            <li> This soap even though listed as NATURE&#x27;s gate and ORGANIC has some terrible ingredients listed in the ingredients.</li>

            <li> Ordered because i have brought product elsewhere previously. Good price and had compliments of the wonderful scent. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> It does not have a distinct sage aroma which was what I was looking for.  Two out of the three had pumps that did not work,</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great find... until I kept walking around wondering why I was smelling some kind of bathroom cleaner. Turns out it is the way the soap smells. It made me nauseous smelling that everytime I washed my hands, so I had to get rid of it--even though I had bought a 3-pack!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh scent of the lemon grass  &amp; clary sage hand soap.  A little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this hand soap.</li>
            <li> This is the soap I have in my powder room.  It&#x27;s fragrant, but not flowery, more of a fresh sent.  Leaves no residue, just a fresh scent and a clean feeling.  Plus, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Great product and non toxic! I love it</li>
            <li> I have used other products from Nature&#x27;s Gate and am always very pleased. I won&#x27;t use any antibacterial soap due to the cancer causing agent Triclosan.  Minnesota enacted a ban effective this year on all soaps with that ingredient. None to be sold in the state.</li>
            <li> A good purchase..Am not a great fan of the smell of this product..But not a bad one at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also free of all those harmful chemicals such as SLS</li>
            <li> Hand washing is so important to overall health. Nature&#x27;s gate liquid hand soaps are organic and clean hands completely.  I prefer the lemongrass and clary sage scent because it has a clean smell and not such a perfume smell. I use this at the kitchen sink and in the bathroom.  I spend a lot time with hobbies and get paint etc on my hands and this soap also cleans well on difficult stains.</li>
            <li> This is a great hand soap and isn&#x27;t full of crazy chemicals.  It has a very nice aroma and washes off well.  Great job done here by Nature&#x27;s Gate.    Cheers</li>
            <li> This soap even though listed as NATURE&#x27;s gate and ORGANIC has some terrible ingredients listed in the ingredients. Definitely a NO-NO if you are keeping up with the toxins to be avoided by major natural news organizations. Easiest to use and trust is the Dr Bronner&#x27;s line of Castile soaps.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hand soap. The smell lingers on the skin without being overwhelming.  I feel like I only need a little bit of soap to get clean, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Trader Joe&#x27;s, but they stopped carrying it. I have never--and I mean NEVER--looked up a product like this when it disappears from stores; I just sigh and move on with my life. But in this case? No substitute would do (and I tried a few). So glad to be able to find it here! I ordered a three-pack, and now my hands smell so wonderful when I wash them anywhere in my house...my bathroom, the kids&#x27; bathroom, the kitchen...</li>
            <li> While this product does have some organic components, it is most definitly NOT an all organic soap.  Those thinking this is non-toxic will be very misled.  Run, don&#x27;t walk, from this product.  There are MUCH safer ALL ORGANIC soaps on the market.      Here are the non-organic components:    Butylene Glycol: Fragrance Ingredient; Skin-Conditioning Agent.  Human irritant to skin, eye and lungs.(Cosmetic Ingredient Review Assessments).  One or more animal studies show reproductive effects at high doses (Journal of the American College of Toxicology 1986).  One or more animal studies show sense organ effects at moderate doses (low dose studies may be unavailable for this ingredient) (Prehled Prumyslove Toxikologie; Organicke Latky,\\&quot; Marhold, J 1986).      Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate: Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Foam Booster.  According to the journal Contact Dermatitis, 10% Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate displays \\&quot;similar\\&quot; signs of irritation to 2% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.     Cocamidopropyl Betaine: Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; Surfactant - Foam Booster.  A synthetic surfactant derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine.  Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society    Decyl Glucoside: This is a foamer (i.e. it foams up when you use it.  Not necessary for true soaps.)    PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate: Surfactant - Cleansing Agent; EMULSIFYING.  The polyethylene glycol ether of the diester of natural Methylglucose and Oleic Acid. It is used in beauty products and cosmetics as a surfactant and emulsifier.  Products and formulas containing PEGs should not be used on broken or irritated skin. Although PEGs are considered safe for use topically on healthy skin, studies showed that patients suffering from severe burns were treated with PEG-based antimicrobial cream; this treatment resulted in kidney toxicity.  Essentially if you have a cut, scrape, etc on your hands this component can enter your bloodstream and is toxic to your kidneys.    Isoceteth-20: Surfactant - Emulsifying Agent; Surfactant - Solubilizing Agent.  Polyethylene glycol ether of Isocetyl Alcohol (q.v.) that conforms generallyto the formula: where n has an average value of 20.  Suspected to be an environmental toxin: Environment Canada Domestic Substance List.  There are no studies that show this product is safe in humans.  This product is toxic to aquatic animals.    Disodium EDTA: Used as a Preservative.  A cumulative, persistent, organic environmental pollutant. It has been found to be both cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic in laboratory animals. Oral exposures have been noted to cause reproductive and developmental effects.[9] The same study by Lanigan[9] also found that both dermal exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to EDTA in aerosolized cosmetic formulations would produce systemic effects below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies.    Polyquaternium-10: Antimicrobial properties.  There is incomplete data on the safety of this compound.  That alone should give you pause.    Glyceryl Undecylenate: Emulsifier; Antimicrobial, emollient and preservative enhancer derived from a combination of castor bean oil and glycerine derived from Rapeseed or Sunflower oils.    Phenoxyethanol: Fragrance Ingredient; Preservative.  Causes cancer: One or more in vitro tests non-mammalian cells show positive mutation results.  Potentially Neurotoxic.  Linked to irritation of skin, eyes and lungs.</li>
            <li> The bottle is attractive and made well. The scent of the soap is nice and not over-powering. A few of the bottles were delivered and the soap had leaked all down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Soap in a bottle is the only way for me.  Hate using somebody&#x27;s bar soap, this has a clean smell without being overpowering.  Need very little to do a good job.  Would order it again.</li>
            <li> Great liquid hand soap. Very nice plant smell. I have bought many of these and will continue to buy. Does not leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for your hands and your hair.  It gives a lot of body to my baby fine blonde hair!  I think the brand name Nature&#x27;s Gate Organics is just that - a brand name.  Do not assume that it is an organic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Nature&#x27;s Gate products and thought they were really good, but I&#x27;m not a fan of this soap.  I&#x27;m surprised to see any comments about the scent because I can&#x27;t smell anything but the chemical-like smell of unscented soap.  I can smell that just fine, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my nose, but I don&#x27;t smell any lemongrass or clary sage.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands, but it doesn&#x27;t make them feel very clean either, and I like being able to tell that I just washed my hands.  The plastic tube that goes down into the bottle broke off from the bottom of the pump.  It&#x27;s down there somewhere, and I could straighten out a hanger and dig it out I suppose, but since this came in a 3-pack, I just can&#x27;t think of a reason why I should.  Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoo?  I love it.  This stuff, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> smells great and cleans hands well.  Nice change from the everyday soap</li>
            <li> I just wish I had read Mathew Becker&#x27;s expert review (below) before buying this stuff. It sounds so nice with its paraben-free label, and benign description. But when I looked at the ingredients  I just couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. How can a company have the nerve to call this an organic product. It is so full of non-organic stuff I wouldn&#x27;t clean my lavatory with it, never mind use it as hand soap.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling and smell after using this soap!  Got it at a discount, so well worth it for me!</li>
            <li> Pretty good on such price. The smell is just right.&lt;br /&gt;One star left for the press is little bit hard to use.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my hands and they feel soft after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person that likes scented soaps. But this reminds me of really cheap knock-off cologne... Just doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;. Also two of the 3 pumps have broke so far. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> this is environmentally friendly product.&lt;br /&gt;smells good.&lt;br /&gt;gooooooooooood&lt;br /&gt;I love it love it&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for a couple of years now. Smells great! Cleans Great! I was concerned however by the fact that only one of the pump dispensers worked correctly. Out of the 3 that I ordered, 2 of the pump dispensers were literally broken!! I have had to switch the workable pump to the other soaps as needed. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap.  One small drop of this thick natural soap does the job.  Good price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the soft feeling after using this soap. The smell is great, not too strong , not too weak, just perfect. I used Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s soap before.  But the skin feels much softer with Nature&#x27;s Gate soap.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these for my house. Love the very light scent and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love this product</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance, gentle on the hands.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  The smell is awesome, clean and fresh.  Clary Sage is soothing.  Nature&#x27;s Gate has gotten it right again!</li>
            <li> Smell is actually not good but it doesnt make my hand dry and I have eczema .. also it is very very thick than the other soaps...</li>
            <li> We really like this in our kitchen. Great fresh smell and it&#x27;s a large pack that we like.</li>
            <li> This soap smells nice and looks luxury on my counter</li>
            <li> love the clean smell, definitely something I want to keep on hand without running out.</li>
            <li> As someone who is very sensitive to scented products I was looking for a handsoap that smelled nice without being too perfumey and or leave lingering scent on my hands for hours after using it.  This soap has a clean and fresh scent, lathers nicely and rinses completely off.  We wash our hands a lot at our house, and I use this in all the bathrooms as well as the kitchen.</li>
            <li> very nice product.  the bottles were in tact and not leaking.  they did freeze, but I live in near artic Minnesota.  I like the scent and it lathers nicely.  The best part is that it&#x27;s all natural and healthy!</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate organics liquid hand soap is very good for me.  My hands are so allergic&lt;br /&gt;to many soaps and dry my skin, but Nature&#x27;s Gate fulfills everything that I wnat and&lt;br /&gt;need in a hand soap.  I am very glad that I have finally found a hand soap that is perfect for me in every way. I would recommend this soap for anyone to try.  I will continue buying Nature&#x27;s Gate hand soap.  Thanks to whomever created this soap!!  I am so glad that Amazon carries this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, not too strong, not to faint! Keeps hands moist throughout the winter!&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> This hand soap is awesome!  It&#x27;s so concentrated that it will last 4 times longer than my previous hand soap!  Plus it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Really like the fragrance - would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else. Nice smell!</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and leaking.</li>
            <li> I love this citrusy, lemony smell of this!</li>
