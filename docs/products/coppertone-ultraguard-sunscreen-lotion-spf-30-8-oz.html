            <li>and I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say anything about swimming and reapplying since we haven&#x27;t used it and then gotten in the water but for just being out in the sun, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Good protection.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen works well and was a good deal.</li>
            <li>good rule of thumb</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li>Works great to protect us against the strong sun rays in the summer and not greasy - good value too</li>
            <li>It keeps me from getting burned, but allows me to get a nice tan.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the bottle too.  </li>
            <li>I love it and its all I use on my body.</li>
            <li>here for more details on carcinogenic ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and we use this several times per week at our community pool.</li>
            <li>And SPF 30 is great protection, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Coppertone was rated as one of the best sunscreens on the market and since my husband had basal cell carcinoma on his neck last year, I bought him this to help prevent a reoccurrence.  </li>
            <li>Recently went paddle boarding for almost 4 hours on a bright sunny day, and I didn&#x27;t get burned!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen managed to keep all of us sunburn free on our trip to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I loved this product last year when I bought it WITHOUT the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I was happy with this product until I was persuaded by facts presented by the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) supporting its recommendation that consumers avoid sunscreens containing retinyl palmitate, since that ingredient can actually *speed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll always love Coppertone for its classic clean scent, nothing else comes close.  </li>
            <li>Has that classic Coppertone smell we all love.</li>
            <li>I ended up being outside most of the day and my arms looked and felt fine.</li>
            <li>It is priced right and well constructed.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, it fits my skin and it can protect my skin from sunshine well.</li>
            <li>A real buy!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It goes on very creamy, not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>Very sunscreen smelling...</li>
            <li>It is very greasy.</li>
            <li>This product works great and does not smell weird.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes i will be in the water for a few hours or more.</li>
            <li>Decent sunscreen, I just personally prefer the scent and feel of Hawaiian Tropic.</li>
            <li>It smells like old lady perfume, it turns my clothes orange, and it has potentially harmful chemicals--but it does protect skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>With this summer, not allergic, but a little oil。Capacity is large enough。</li>

            <li> I was amazed because I usually burn fast.</li>
            <li> long so I just applied to my arms.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and I trust it on my children!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t look or feel dry at all like you get with some sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t that oily like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts a while (not 2 hours but definately longer then other brands).</li>
            <li> Just like all other coppertones.</li>
            <li> The good stuff, all ingredients are NOT carginogens (other version of Coppertone have carcinogens, terrible stuff),</li>
            <li> It is one of the few sunscreens that help keep her from being burned.  </li>
            <li> I know i should reapply but its hard when you&#x27;re having a killer session.</li>
            <li> So hard to find 30 not 50 spf coppertone so got this.  </li>

            <li> It works!  Buy it.  My daughter has very fair skin and is a swimmer.It is one of the few sunscreens that help keep her from being burned.  Still, slather this stuff on.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does not smell weird.  I love the shape of the bottle too.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good protection. Rubs in well, doesn&#x27;t look like white paste.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well and was a good deal. Nobody in my family has gotten a sunburn using it and it isn&#x27;t that oily like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I loved this product last year when I bought it WITHOUT the strong smell. I don&#x27;t like things with a lot of fragrance on  my face, so I don&#x27;t know why they had to add it in this year....don&#x27;t know how you can find it unscented.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I was out in the sun all day, and I used Coppertone Ultraguard Sunscreen Lotion and I did not get burned.  It works.</li>
            <li> I used it before and I like it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Decent sunscreen, I just personally prefer the scent and feel of Hawaiian Tropic. I think Amazon was out of that SPF in Hawaiian tropic at the time, so I went with Coppertone. I could definitely see this as a 5-star lotion though, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I am a surfer and sunscreen aficionado. I take my sunscreen seriously. Sometimes i will be in the water for a few hours or more. I know i should reapply but its hard when you&#x27;re having a killer session. This stuff lasts a while (not 2 hours but definately longer then other brands). Its also not too greasy. I love it and its all I use on my body.</li>
            <li> With this summer, not allergic, but a little oil。Capacity is large enough。</li>
            <li> This sunscreen managed to keep all of us sunburn free on our trip to Hawaii. We were in and out of the water constantly.</li>
            <li> It smells like old lady perfume, it turns my clothes orange, and it has potentially harmful chemicals--but it does protect skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I was happy with this product until I was persuaded by facts presented by the Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) supporting its recommendation that consumers avoid sunscreens containing retinyl palmitate, since that ingredient can actually *speed* the development of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Has that classic Coppertone smell we all love. It goes on very creamy, not sticky or greasy. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to be out long so I just applied to my arms. I ended up being outside most of the day and my arms looked and felt fine. My skin didn&#x27;t look or feel dry at all like you get with some sunscreens. This one&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> So hard to find 30 not 50 spf coppertone so got this.  Just like all other coppertones.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it fits my skin and it can protect my skin from sunshine well. I will purchase this one next time.</li>
            <li> Very sunscreen smelling... but it works.</li>
            <li> The good stuff, all ingredients are NOT carginogens (other version of Coppertone have carcinogens, terrible stuff), this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;A good rule of thumb if the ingredients have a X in the words the stay away from them. E.g Oxybenzone and Octinoxate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read here for more details on carcinogenic ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> Smells like sunscreen not good. Claims no grease. It is very greasy. But it still does the job of preventing sunburns.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and we use this several times per week at our community pool. Lasts a long time and I trust it on my children!</li>
            <li> Works great to protect us against the strong sun rays in the summer and not greasy - good value too</li>
            <li> been a fan of Coppertone for years. It keeps me from getting burned, but allows me to get a nice tan. Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and I think it&#x27;s great. Recently went paddle boarding for almost 4 hours on a bright sunny day, and I didn&#x27;t get burned! I was amazed because I usually burn fast.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job.  It is priced right and well constructed.  I would recommend heartily. A real buy!</li>
            <li> for my trip in july I will nee this</li>
            <li> Very good, but a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always love Coppertone for its classic clean scent, nothing else comes close.  And SPF 30 is great protection, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Coppertone was rated as one of the best sunscreens on the market and since my husband had basal cell carcinoma on his neck last year, I bought him this to help prevent a reoccurrence.  It does help prevent burning while he&#x27;s out in the yard all day.  I cannot say anything about swimming and reapplying since we haven&#x27;t used it and then gotten in the water but for just being out in the sun, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> too oily and smells bad</li>
