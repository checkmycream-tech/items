            <li>It is great not to have to worry about &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was so happy with my SKinVacMD:</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always taken, what I thought was good care of my skin, until I discovered this system</li>
            <li>part is, SkinVac by Vacubrasion sells wands and tips that fit on my N.B. Microdermabrasion&#x27;s silicon hose perfectly.</li>
            <li>The Blackhead Tip is a great addition to my SkinVacMD Unit that I purchased in December 2014, it makes it even more versatile.  </li>
            <li>The suction is much more beneficial and they won&#x27;t wear out!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>l love it!</li>
            <li>am thrilled that I found this.</li>
            <li>The box is nice.</li>
            <li>The skin is softer and smoother and has a nice even color.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly picky and I can say that it works and feels exactly like the treatments I&#x27;ve had done at the spa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to mention too that cleaning them is very easy.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolutely fantastic product and I am thrilled that I bought it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic.  </li>
            <li>I love having the ability to change the tip to meet my needs and yield the best results possible.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the tips that came with my unit.</li>
            <li>I really cant say how great this is since I havent used it because it comes with no directions.</li>
            <li>I am sure if you are in the field of performing mirodermabrasion you&#x27;d like it?</li>
            <li>I would be able to give a better rating.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>love this tips and works</li>
            <li>I am so glad to found this product.</li>
            <li>So glad that I found the SkinVacMD products.  </li>
            <li>It also works great for the creases around the nose and the very tip of the nose.</li>
            <li>Now I can use them on my nose,eye area and lips, and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>These smaller tips are perfect for around the nose and closer to the mouth.  </li>
            <li>My creams penetrate much more than before.</li>
            <li>I love the skin-vac products, they are just so easy to use.......:)</li>
            <li>definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>with the four forever tips I now own, I can do all areas of my face quickly.  </li>
            <li>For someone with very sensitive skin, these might be great.  </li>
            <li>I bought the microdermabrasion kit with many diamond tips and it is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>These extra tips make treating your skin much more effective, pleasant, and precise.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for an at home micro-dermabrasion system, but balked at the cheap-looking all-in-one gadgets that looked like they would break easily.</li>
            <li>The SkinVacMD is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I got a deal where a free body tip was included.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this whole skin-vac system is, I&#x27;m 52</li>
            <li>I bought a small shop vac for this use, the hose fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of targeting those areas too, without being to rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li>These tips work amazing for sensitive areas like under the eye treatment and nose area.</li>
            <li>knowing I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin that actually works.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been soooo sweet in my life.</li>
            <li>Customer service responded to my inquiry quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a brilliant product because it uses your home vac, in my case a small ShopVac, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction being an issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy now and fast.  </li>
            <li>I PERSONALLY DO NOT USE MANY OF THE SIZES!</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this will improve the look of the line between my eyebrows and the smile lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love that they are so precise at getting in the tiny areas around the nose</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t find them useful.</li>
            <li>It was good when I was able to use them, at least they did their job well for 6 months.</li>
            <li>It uses just the right amount of suction.</li>
            <li>I can leave the house right after a treatment.</li>
            <li>The inter-changeable tips are a nice weight and fit tightly on the wand.</li>
            <li>This little gem of a box that contains smaller and more gentle tips is a great addition to the Vacubrasion system.</li>
            <li>The wands will most standard tips so you could reuse tips that you have or buy others if you see them on sale.</li>
            <li>I love that the tips are made to last and that I&#x27;m not roped into buying refills of crystals, filters or pads.</li>
            <li>You can really get into the nooks and grooves along your face and it&#x27;s vital to use a more gentle tip under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I use superglue to put them back on to get more use out of it without replacing the tips so soon after purchase the machine.  </li>
            <li>My husband is noticing the change in my skin and is ready for me to start doing his face too!  </li>
            <li>I struggled with the larger tips trying to get into the nose crease and on the top of my nose where I have a lot of brown spots from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;The nose tip solved that problem.  </li>
            <li>This should pretty much round out my reviews for the SkinVac products as I think I have most of them now!  </li>
            <li>believe me, I&#x27;m not that easy to please, I&#x27;m really picky, especially when it comes to putting anything on my face.....</li>
            <li>But the diamond tip was a little big to use on my nose, although it&#x27;s great for the whole face, neck, and chest area.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>When I told him I was doing microdermabrasion, he said \\&quot;It&#x27;s working!\\&quot;  I&#x27;m now a real fan and feel a whole lot more&lt;</li>
            <li>I had the larger tips from my original set</li>
            <li>If you are a salon-junkie and go for regular treatments, buying the entire kit and smaller tips will pay for itself in most likely one visit, at the most two!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re getting the full brunt of the vacuum suction on your skin.</li>
            <li>One less supply to worry about.  :)</li>
            <li>A highly recommended product this is.</li>
            <li>I like these little suction tips, though I think I need a stronger wet/dry vac to get the most benefit from them.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t the case on all parts of my face, but those that I&#x27;ve treated more heavily with the creams showed quite a bit of peeling.</li>
            <li>It has a delicate, fine diamond tip that delivers just the right amount of suction.</li>
            <li>There are two that look exactly the same in size</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve paid less than one treatment, which is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like these little tips because they are great for the sensitve eye area and hard to get nose (blackheads).</li>
            <li>and my skin feels as soft as it has when I&#x27;ve done it at the spa.</li>
            <li>Where can you get 2  high quality tips that last forever for this price?  </li>
            <li>So, if anyone have same issue with your Microdermabrasion that needs replacement tips, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>so it was difficult to keep a good suction with the larger tips).  </li>
            <li>Not only this is &#x27;Forever&amp;#34; tips, this is professional quality and works well!  </li>
            <li>Now I can get in any small area as well as use them on my upper brow area easily.  </li>
            <li>, this has taken my home skincare regimen to whole other level...</li>
            <li>But the tip didn&#x27;t last long at all and plastic tips that connect to the wand cracked and the oval shape sand paper tips (supposedly diamond tips, but it seem like no better than fine sand paper) all came off.  </li>
            <li>This little gem really works.  </li>
            <li>I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error.</li>

            <li> This little gem really works.  </li>
            <li> I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error.</li>
            <li> but one is for sensitive skin and the other for regular.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a reason (other than the noise of the vacuum cleaner) to choose anything else over this.</li>
            <li> I used to have deep, dark undereye hallows</li>
            <li> There is enough but not so much that it is uncomfortable or worrisome.</li>
            <li> I may take a picture to post some before and afters over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having the smaller tips makes doing my face a breeze without missing any spots.  </li>

            <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product and I am thrilled that I bought it. I am a DIY person on just about everything and skincare is no exception. I have been looking at microderm machines for over a year and I was always concerned about the fact that weak suction was one of the main complaints people had. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ for something that was going to perform poorly. This is a brilliant product because it uses your home vac, in my case a small ShopVac, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction being an issue. I hadn&#x27;t realized until I saw it that the attachments are vented so it&#x27;s not as if you&#x27;re getting the full brunt of the vacuum suction on your skin. There is enough but not so much that it is uncomfortable or worrisome. It feels absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are reusable and the cord and attachments look like they&#x27;d last forever. The wands will most standard tips so you could reuse tips that you have or buy others if you see them on sale. I love that the tips are made to last and that I&#x27;m not roped into buying refills of crystals, filters or pads. The tips are great and I got a deal where a free body tip was included. There are two that look exactly the same in size but one is for sensitive skin and the other for regular. The information is listed on the side of each tip so you can tell which one you&#x27;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it today and I&#x27;ve already used it and my skin feels as soft as it has when I&#x27;ve done it at the spa. I was probably applied a little bit too much pressure because my cheeks are quite red, but that was user error. I use RetinA and other alpha hydroxy products and when I went over my forehead the amount of skin that peeled was shocking. It was just waiting to slough off and the microderm treatment accelerated the process. That wasn&#x27;t the case on all parts of my face, but those that I&#x27;ve treated more heavily with the creams showed quite a bit of peeling. I am hoping that this will improve the look of the line between my eyebrows and the smile lines around my eyes. I may take a picture to post some before and afters over the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I found this. I can&#x27;t think of a reason (other than the noise of the vacuum cleaner) to choose anything else over this. I am incredibly picky and I can say that it works and feels exactly like the treatments I&#x27;ve had done at the spa. One use and I&#x27;ve paid less than one treatment, which is just fantastic. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> hate this bits are so small and so awkward to use waste of money</li>
            <li> What an awesome addition to my skin vac products !!......I love that they are so precise at getting in the tiny areas around the nose.....I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this whole skin-vac system is, I&#x27;m 52 and I&#x27;ve always taken, what I thought was good care of my skin, until I discovered this system, this has taken my home skincare regimen to whole other level...I wish this was around years ago.... believe me, I&#x27;m not that easy to please, I&#x27;m really picky, especially when it comes to putting anything on my face..... I love the skin-vac products, they are just so easy to use.......:)</li>
            <li> Much better than the plastic.  The suction is much more beneficial and they won&#x27;t wear out!</li>
            <li> This little gem really works.  I used it all over my nose and it even got into the little creases with ease.  When I was done, I examined my nose and couldn&#x27;t believe the results!  The Blackhead Tip out performed a Biore Strip and I didn&#x27;t think anything could do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this tip on my eleven lines, above my lips and even on my crows feet.  It does a great job of targeting those areas too, without being to rough on the skin.  The Blackhead Tip is a great addition to my SkinVacMD Unit that I purchased in December 2014, it makes it even more versatile.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Blackhead Tip in exchange for my unbiased review.  Thank you Tyler for the great customer service that you provided.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> This little gem of a box that contains smaller and more gentle tips is a great addition to the Vacubrasion system. You can really get into the nooks and grooves along your face and it&#x27;s vital to use a more gentle tip under the eyes. These extra tips make treating your skin much more effective, pleasant, and precise. I love having the ability to change the tip to meet my needs and yield the best results possible. If I&#x27;m going to take the time to treat my skin I want it to effective and these tips help me take the best care of my complexion.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I ordered these.  For someone with very sensitive skin, these might be great.  I just didn&#x27;t find them useful.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the tips that came with my unit. No need for replacing them over and over as my originals.</li>
            <li> I PERSONALLY DO NOT USE MANY OF THE SIZES! JUST PURCHASE ONE BIG AND ONE SMALL. BUT ONLY MY OPINION.</li>
            <li> I recently added this tip to my skin vac collection and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It is the perfect size for around my eyes and nose. It has a delicate, fine diamond tip that delivers just the right amount of suction. I&#x27;m so glad I found this for the difficult to reach areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the difference between the two tips - they both have the same number stamp</li>
            <li> Sorry but it doesn&#x27;t last forever, it lasts up to 6 months. It was good when I was able to use them, at least they did their job well for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an extra of the VacubrasionTM. I really cant say how great this is since I havent used it because it comes with no directions. I am sure if you are in the field of performing mirodermabrasion you&#x27;d like it? I contacted amazon and the manufacturer about the directions....they dont have any...yet?? I searched and searched and could not find any videos on youtube either on how to use these specific pieces. So I give it an in between rating. If you know how to use go for it. If anyone has any links or tips I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. I would be able to give a better rating. The box is nice.</li>
            <li> Best Quality for good price and the awesome customer service! It&#x27;s hard to find the company that delivers All!  I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this tips and works WELL!  Price is awesome. Where can you get 2  high quality tips that last forever for this price?  I am so glad to found this product. And, you get the answers that you are looking for within a few hours if you send them an email.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips that I had came with when I purchase N.B. Microdermabrasion machine from TV infomercial. But the tip didn&#x27;t last long at all and plastic tips that connect to the wand cracked and the oval shape sand paper tips (supposedly diamond tips, but it seem like no better than fine sand paper) all came off.  I use superglue to put them back on to get more use out of it without replacing the tips so soon after purchase the machine.  But, when plastic housing that holds this sandpaper like tips cracked, I had no choice, but looking for replacement of the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thankful that I found SkinVac by Vacubrasion. Not only this is &#x27;Forever&amp;#34; tips, this is professional quality and works well!  Cleaning tips takes less than a few second.  Plus - this doesn&#x27;t require filter! One less supply to worry about.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is, SkinVac by Vacubrasion sells wands and tips that fit on my N.B. Microdermabrasion&#x27;s silicon hose perfectly. So, if anyone have same issue with your Microdermabrasion that needs replacement tips, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this company&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> If u buy the UltraRadiance SkinVacMD, go ahead and buy the extra tips...definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This should pretty much round out my reviews for the SkinVac products as I think I have most of them now!  I had the larger tips from my original set but it was a bit difficult to even get the smallest of them in the nose crease area and along the bridge of my nose (it&#x27;s small so it was difficult to keep a good suction with the larger tips).  These smaller tips solved that problem.  Now I can get in any small area as well as use them on my upper brow area easily.  Having the smaller tips makes doing my face a breeze without missing any spots.  Great investment for your skin.  If you are a salon-junkie and go for regular treatments, buying the entire kit and smaller tips will pay for itself in most likely one visit, at the most two!  My husband is noticing the change in my skin and is ready for me to start doing his face too!  I&#x27;d like to mention too that cleaning them is very easy.  And, if you ever deal with their customer service with questions, they are AWESOME! Great product!  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> what the customer wanted</li>
            <li> I like these little tips because they are great for the sensitve eye area and hard to get nose (blackheads).</li>
            <li> These tips are made to last.  So glad that I found the SkinVacMD products.  It is great not to have to worry about &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; that have to be replaced monthly.</li>
            <li> These tips work amazing for sensitive areas like under the eye treatment and nose area. They are the perfect size to help remove those blackheads around the nose area. l love it! thankyou</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye tip under my eyes and just below my eyebrow. I used to have deep, dark undereye hallows but now they are less noticeable. The skin is softer and smoother and has a nice even color. The tip is the perfect size.It uses just the right amount of suction. It also works great for the creases around the nose and the very tip of the nose.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my SKinVacMD: Ultra Radiance ProDeluxe Microdermabrasion.But the diamond tip was a little big to use on my nose, although it&#x27;s great for the whole face, neck, and chest area. So I got  \\&quot;Forever\\&quot; Tips for the nose,and under eyes. Now I can use them on my nose,eye area and lips, and the results are fantastic! I recommend them to everyone. My face looks like I&#x27;ve just had an expensive salon treatment, including my eye area and lips. A highly recommended product this is.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for an at home micro-dermabrasion system, but balked at the cheap-looking all-in-one gadgets that looked like they would break easily. Also, I did not want to bother with continually replacing filters and tips. The SkinVacMD is easy to use, easy to clean. The inter-changeable tips are a nice weight and fit tightly on the wand. These smaller tips are perfect for around the nose and closer to the mouth.  I experience no \\&quot;downtime\\&quot;.  I can leave the house right after a treatment. I bought a small shop vac for this use, the hose fits perfectly. Customer service responded to my inquiry quickly. Genius!</li>
            <li> I like these little suction tips, though I think I need a stronger wet/dry vac to get the most benefit from them.</li>
            <li> I struggled with the larger tips trying to get into the nose crease and on the top of my nose where I have a lot of brown spots from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;The nose tip solved that problem.  It&#x27;s easy now and fast.  Before the eye tip I avoided the eye area also but now have the perfect size tip&lt;br /&gt;and with the four forever tips I now own, I can do all areas of my face quickly.  My boyfriend commented the other day that I look really&lt;br /&gt;better than ever.  When I told him I was doing microdermabrasion, he said \\&quot;It&#x27;s working!\\&quot;  I&#x27;m now a real fan and feel a whole lot more&lt;br /&gt;confident knowing I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin that actually works.</li>
            <li> I bought the microdermabrasion kit with many diamond tips and it is just fantastic. I ve never let any review but for once i let one because it worths it. This product is a revolution !!! i have been using it for 3 weeks and my skin has never been soooo sweet in my life. My creams penetrate much more than before. I ll recommend it to everybody, try it and you will adopt it. I discovered the microdermabrasion in esthetician center 2 months ago 40 euros for it...no doubt !!!</li>
