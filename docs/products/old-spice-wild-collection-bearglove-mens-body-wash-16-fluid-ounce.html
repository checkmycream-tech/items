            <li>Loved it, packed well</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice design on the bottle</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a refreshing clean feeling, with that healthy feeling skin after using, I can&#x27;t say I experienced it with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great and overall a good product, the wild collection of scents have all been very good.</li>
            <li>I really love this body wash</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for from a body wash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this body wash.</li>
            <li>Make a better bottle</li>
            <li>It smells good; fresh and clean with some honeydew melon.  </li>
            <li>You are better off getting Hawkridge or Zanzibar if you can find them cheap.  </li>
            <li>It does smell vey nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells too strong</li>
            <li>The smell is not as strong as the original one which I found was too strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique, and pleasant and far from overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love this product, fresh smell all day.</li>
            <li>Has that cheap, water based feel that seems to slip off skin without washing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went ahead and grabbed the Bearglove, determining it was the nicest scent of the available options.</li>
            <li>Get these if you can get them cheap</li>
            <li>It seemed cheap enough and it have a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well, and manages to make you clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by that, but gave it five stars anyway, because it is an excellent product that has a genuinely pleasant, masculine smell: it&#x27;s not like patchouli, musk, or stoat in any way, but it&#x27;s pleasant and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>The advertising for Bearglove Body Wash asks &amp;#34;Can you imagine a powerful, fearsome grizzly bear who can repair military helicopters and also speak confidently about important world affairs?&amp;#34; If you answer affirmatively, then, they say &amp;#34;this is the body wash for you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to like smelling fresh and clean vs spicy and musky.</li>
            <li>While it did smell great, the scent was almost too much, to the point of overpowering, and it just made me wonder if I was rubbing some cologne on my body, or was it actually cleaning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mr, Spice QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I really like the deodarant with this scent, but the bodywash is too strongly scented</li>
            <li>Clean and crisp, my wife loves it also.</li>
            <li>As a body wash, it does the job like all Old Spice body washes do; lathers up, rinses clean away, and leaves you fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell and much biger quantity for less price</li>
            <li>I purchases this for my (8 year old) son, because he likes really strong smelling body washes</li>
            <li>Thanks for the order!</li>
            <li>I just use this body wash and Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant (NOT antiperspirant), and I have received numerous compliments on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>I just think it is too much money.</li>
            <li>Not so much in this case.  </li>
            <li>It is Very Fragrant and manly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked however, normally fading away about 2 hours</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim when it was on sale, but when I run out I like it enough to pay full</li>
            <li>I would recomend it highly</li>
            <li>That may not sound very manly, and, honestly, it isn&#x27;t in the traditional sense, but it&#x27;s still a man&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent exactly, but it is definitely manly and effective.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
            <li>Two stars because it is an actual hygiene product that will actually get you clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice products for years, but I was a stubborn user of the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; scent; I used the body wash, deodorant, and aftershave in that scent, liking the \\&quot;old school\\&quot;, retro smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I sampled everything from Old Spice&#x27;s Wild collection, as well as some others, and ended up settling on the Bearglove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of Old Spice products seem to disappear; I hope this one sticks around.</li>
            <li>It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.</li>
            <li>I do keep up with geopolitics, and I may on occasion be a powerful, fearsome grizzly bear, but that is normally due to a lack of caffeine or sleep.</li>
            <li>One day, I was shopping at my local grocery store and needed to purchase a new bottle of body wash.</li>
            <li>Your men and boys will love this, and it won&#x27;t offend your delicate female nasal passages.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Wild Collection Bearglove Men&#x27;s Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
            <li>I have been a regular user of Old Spice body washes for a few years, normally opting for the traditional (Pure Sport) scent.</li>
            <li>All the fragrances in the Wild Collection are pretty ordinary except Hawkridge Body Wash.  </li>
            <li>To me, the closest I can describe the smell as is this, hard boiled candy which has the sweet honeydew or cantaloupe</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this scent has to do with a ferocious grizzly bear, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> and I was tired of him using my lavender one.</li>

            <li> Great product, good price</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash it has a great smell,and it cleans well. I just think it is too much money. I would recomend it highly</li>

            <li> Good price and delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice products for years, but I was a stubborn user of the \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; scent; I used the body wash, deodorant, and aftershave in that scent, liking the \\&quot;old school\\&quot;, retro smell of it.  But, somewhere along the line I decided that it was time to stop smelling like someone&#x27;s Grandpa and update my scent.  I sampled everything from Old Spice&#x27;s Wild collection, as well as some others, and ended up settling on the Bearglove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this scent has to do with a ferocious grizzly bear, I&#x27;m not sure.  I don&#x27;t even know what a \\&quot;bearglove\\&quot; is.  I know; it&#x27;s just marketing, but sometimes the scent and the name seem to work together--Fiji, example.  Not so much in this case.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter.  It smells good; fresh and clean with some honeydew melon.  That may not sound very manly, and, honestly, it isn&#x27;t in the traditional sense, but it&#x27;s still a man&#x27;s scent; I wouldn&#x27;t want my girlfriend to smell this way.  As a body wash, it does the job like all Old Spice body washes do; lathers up, rinses clean away, and leaves you fresh and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t have any of the dumb bells and whistles of so many other body washes out there; you can keep your \\&quot;glacier water\\&quot; or your \\&quot;sea salt;\\&quot; that isn&#x27;t going to get me any cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the Bearglove antiperspirant and body spray, and have had compliments.  I&#x27;ve learned to like smelling fresh and clean vs spicy and musky. A lot of Old Spice products seem to disappear; I hope this one sticks around.</li>
            <li> This is my feel good body wash! Love it..</li>
            <li> Love this product, fresh smell all day. Clean and crisp, my wife loves it also. I also use the deodorant.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this body wash. I does leave my skin a little dry but overall, I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I have been a regular user of Old Spice body washes for a few years, normally opting for the traditional (Pure Sport) scent. One day, I was shopping at my local grocery store and needed to purchase a new bottle of body wash. Unfortunately, the Pure Sport was out of stock.

It&#x27;s hard to describe the scent exactly, but it is definitely manly and effective. I don&#x27;t wear cologne or anything else to &amp;#34;smell better&amp;#34; throughout the day. I just use this body wash and Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant (NOT antiperspirant), and I have received numerous compliments on how nice I smell.

            <li> Very nice smell and much biger quantity for less price</li>
            <li> Two stars because it is an actual hygiene product that will actually get you clean. Two stars because it smells like candy unicorn sweat. Bearglove taught me to smell before you order.</li>
            <li> All the fragrances in the Wild Collection are pretty ordinary except Hawkridge Body Wash.  Get these if you can get them cheap, that is around $3 per 16 fl. oz.  Unremarkable smell.  You are better off getting Hawkridge or Zanzibar if you can find them cheap.  What is the purpose of churning out one fragrance after the other if you can distinguish them clearly?</li>
            <li> Makes my girlfriend smell like a man, so it works great.</li>

            <li> Thanks for the order!</li>
            <li> This smells really good. I purchases this for my (8 year old) son, because he likes really strong smelling body washes and I was tired of him using my lavender one. It seemed cheap enough and it have a very nice smell. The smell is not as strong as the original one which I found was too strong.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Wild Collection Bearglove Men&#x27;s Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent. I like this one. It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance. It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance. It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting. It did leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated enough to write about it! It is Very Fragrant and manly.</li>
            <li> Make a better bottle Mr, Spice QUICKLY</li>
            <li> Smells great and overall a good product, the wild collection of scents have all been very good. Very good product</li>
            <li> To me, the closest I can describe the smell as is this, hard boiled candy which has the sweet honeydew or cantaloupe smell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would have liked however, normally fading away about 2 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely for people who suffer from having dry skin, which I don&#x27;t, making me feel oily and a tad bit uncomfortable initially.</li>

I do keep up with geopolitics, and I may on occasion be a powerful, fearsome grizzly bear, but that is normally due to a lack of caffeine or sleep. This body wash has not conferred on me the ability to mend military helicopters, however, despite using it daily for several weeks. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by that, but gave it five stars anyway, because it is an excellent product that has a genuinely pleasant, masculine smell: it&#x27;s not like patchouli, musk, or stoat in any way, but it&#x27;s pleasant and clean smelling. I bought this on a whim when it was on sale, but when I run out I like it enough to pay full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for male humans or grizzly bears.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling body wash on the market. Average or below.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  He likes it. That&#x27;s all that matters to me. It does smell vey nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Using this daily.  great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Loved it, packed well</li>
            <li> smells like sour apple</li>
    </ol>
