            <li>If you are a fan of pretty purple nail polish, then this color might be for you!!!</li>
            <li>Rich, nice color.</li>

            <li>What I love most about this color is how it looks beautiful on short nails.  </li>

            <li>very pretty color , had this about 4 yrs ago and was glad I found it</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish especially with a gel top overlay on top!</li>
            <li>i love this nail polish, this is really gorgeousss!!</li>
            <li>Love OPI COLOR EXACT!</li>
            <li>Fabulous color.</li>
            <li>I primarily use OPI for my nails</li>
            <li>OPI just goes on so evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is a great winter shade to be worn on short nails.</li>
            <li>And it is formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy having this color to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>The color is great, like everyone says, but I am starting to think OPI is not as resistant to chipping as it is reputed to be.  </li>
            <li>In the bottle, it looks beautiful, but on my nails it&#x27;s mostly just black.</li>
            <li>This is a great color and,  I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>This is a great color and, I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and OPI dries quick and lasts long</li>
            <li>and I hot many compliments</li>
            <li>This was a gift for our daughter and worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Well worth your money!</li>
            <li>Always put a top coat of clear OPI polish on top.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would have liked a tad bit more shimmer.</li>
            <li>It goes great with my skin tone and that hint of dark red is very sophisticated!</li>
            <li>The OPI Dark Cherry Chutney is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This eggplant color wears well, looks sophisticated, and is typical of OPI&#x27;s impeccable nail polish.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and is such a great look.</li>
            <li>Show your true colors girls.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful dark purple.</li>
            <li>You get the dark color along with the beautiful cherry undertones.</li>
            <li>just so cool.</li>
            <li>I did darker colors and this one is way cool.  </li>
            <li>Very vamp and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful dark color</li>
            <li>This has fast become my favorite color..</li>
            <li>I love this color so much i take it with me when i get a manicure and have them apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually surprisingly tasteful--not teenage goth-looking.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THE FULL SIZE.  </li>
            <li>Hit the light right and the color starts to come through.</li>
            <li>It has the purple-red effects if it hits the light just right.</li>
            <li>Love this color, so elegant and misterious, dark just love it</li>
            <li>This color is beautiful, but very very dark.</li>
            <li>In sunlight it does have a nice metallic purplish glow to it, but not as apparent as the picture.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Happy none-the less.</li>
            <li>It is a dark, lush color with a hint of cherry which looks awesome on the toes.    </li>
            <li>I only use OPI nail polish and love this color!</li>
            <li>Very smooth, professional finish.</li>
            <li>but it is a fun color.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice color, however, the picture is lighter than the actual nail polish.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a fun color for a night out on the town..</li>
            <li>I love how it looks in different light.</li>
            <li>It does shine really nicely, and only needs two coats to cover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep purple with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>But, to reach the right color you want, I would suggest doing two or three coats.</li>
            <li>The rich color of the Black Cherry Chutney polish is so sexy on my toes, specially with super strappy heels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little flat; tends to look brown when not in a bright light, which is most of the time.  </li>
            <li>One coat is really all you need to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>I love OPI&#x27;s polishes in general</li>
            <li>It is very durable and stay great looking so your efforts don&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li>the very ages in which I have been loyal to OPI.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty on a manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li>Pretty polish.  </li>
            <li>I only put on 2 coats so maybe more would have made a difference.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you OPI is great as well as long lasting.</li>
            <li>Love the red glitter shine.</li>
            <li>2 coats is more than enough.</li>
            <li>i really recomend it!</li>
            <li>Color was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, dark and exotic.</li>
            <li>I had to spend more than half an hour to clean my desk and my hand, and throw my pants.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, however, it&#x27;s just another super dark polish.</li>
            <li>Really a pretty color, received fast</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews said the colour is too dark and no shimmering, but those who do love dark dark cherry will be happy with the colour.</li>
            <li>Really nice dark color.</li>
            <li>Really beautiful, dark polish, the red really comes out in sunlight.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think it would be so dark but its still nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail polish, and my current favorite is Royal Rajah Ruby (a lovely dark reddish brown) from the same collection.</li>
            <li>The color is long lasting with high gloss and in my opinion is truly salon quality (a good nail salon).</li>
            <li>For those who love the dark vibrant colors of OPI, this color hits all the right notes.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I got it in a reasonable amount of time .</li>
            <li>When the sunlight hits it the cherry color really comes through.</li>
            <li>However I cannot give the detailed review because I used only once.</li>
            <li>It really brights my skin tone,</li>
            <li>It wears well and is really shiny.</li>
            <li>I recommend this color and the shipment is fast too.</li>
            <li>My sister really likes this one too.</li>
            <li>I really like this color from</li>
            <li>In the sun the purple cherry color really</li>
            <li>It is a very vampy color.</li>
            <li>I found it much darker and you really couldn&#x27;t see the sparkle that is there.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I GOT IT FAST.</li>
            <li>A nice polish but a little to dark the picture inst very accurate in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color, looks like a warm black and then shines red in the sun.</li>
            <li>but I trust OPI and am not disappointed with my recent purchase.  </li>
            <li>Rich, deep, lustrous shine!</li>
            <li>This is such a gorgeous deep, rich, dark, purpley-garnety color...</li>
            <li>After Dark, you don&#x27;t really see the color in most lights.</li>
            <li>Unless I&#x27;m in bright sunlight it appears solid black.</li>
            <li>This color is deep and true.</li>
            <li>but it got old and this is an exact match.  </li>
            <li>Love the brand but let down this time around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more black than cherry.  </li>
            <li>I had read that the color is more black then purple.</li>
            <li>It seems more brownish purple than black cherry.</li>
            <li>it looks more black.</li>
            <li>If you like black , you will love this color.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a reddish black.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my older sister for Christmas</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I look forward to purchasing similar items from OPI.</li>
            <li>My Whistle as the top coat that adds little sparkles and pop.</li>
            <li>I had an older color called the blackest red which was pretty much finished</li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, its a great color but nothing like the picture</li>
            <li>You seem to need a lot of light to really show the deep red color that&#x27;s shown on the website.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go-to shade.</li>
            <li>It is really super dark, even in the sunlight it seems more of a black with purply hue.</li>
            <li>If only it looked as pretty as the pic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still dark and perfect for fall- or for those of you like me who prefer dark year round.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited about the look of this nail polish buts it hard to get it just right.</li>
            <li>This is a really dark rich color.</li>
            <li>much sooner, actually,</li>
            <li>I like my nails short, just to the tips of my fingers and this color really stands out.</li>
            <li>only thing is didn&#x27;t really like was the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>looks and last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, buy</li>
            <li>The color is dark, so dark that it only looks purple in good lighting</li>
            <li>However, with the right nail polish remover, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.</li>
            <li>Only under certain light does this polish have a dark purple glowing red effect.</li>
            <li>drys quick and last long!</li>
            <li>Just as pictured, no regrets!!</li>
            <li>I nice dark dark cherry red.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, for me at least, but I find it well worth the price with how pretty it makes me feel, even if I&#x27;m just sitting in bed with only my nails done.</li>
            <li>The subtle metallic sparkle in certain lighting is mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>The color is the color of black cherries in black cherry ice cream - more purple-toned than burgundy.</li>
            <li>unless in the light it is hard to tell what color it is.</li>
            <li>The color is too dark to show that lovely shade of purple underlying the dark red.</li>
            <li>I really love it because it isn&#x27;t black, but still dark enough.</li>
            <li>I have very long natural nails and am fussy about the products I use.</li>
            <li>Two Coats seems to have too much of the black....</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;ll order 3 more bottles in case OPI decides to discontinue it.  </li>

            <li> If you are a fan of pretty purple nail polish, then this color might be for you!!!</li>
            <li> Rich, nice color.</li>
            <li> They have wonderful colors and it lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> What I love most about this color is how it looks beautiful on short nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always LOVE OPI, this color was pretty nice.</li>
            <li> loved it so much, bought it twice</li>
            <li> I love this rich color.</li>

            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Service was quick, which i love.</li>
            <li> very pretty color , had this about 4 yrs ago and was glad I found it</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish especially with a gel top overlay on top!</li>
            <li> i love this nail polish, this is really gorgeousss!!</li>
            <li> Love OPI COLOR EXACT!</li>
            <li> Fabulous color.</li>
            <li> I primarily use OPI for my nails</li>
            <li> OPI just goes on so evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is a great winter shade to be worn on short nails.</li>
            <li> And it is formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy having this color to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> The color is great, like everyone says, but I am starting to think OPI is not as resistant to chipping as it is reputed to be.  </li>
            <li> In the bottle, it looks beautiful, but on my nails it&#x27;s mostly just black.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and,  I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and, I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and OPI dries quick and lasts long</li>
            <li> and I hot many compliments</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter and worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Well worth your money!</li>
            <li> Always put a top coat of clear OPI polish on top.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would have liked a tad bit more shimmer.</li>
            <li> It goes great with my skin tone and that hint of dark red is very sophisticated!</li>
            <li> The OPI Dark Cherry Chutney is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This eggplant color wears well, looks sophisticated, and is typical of OPI&#x27;s impeccable nail polish.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and is such a great look.</li>
            <li> Show your true colors girls.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful dark purple.</li>
            <li> You get the dark color along with the beautiful cherry undertones.</li>
            <li> just so cool.</li>
            <li> I did darker colors and this one is way cool.  </li>
            <li> Very vamp and sexy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful dark color</li>
            <li> This has fast become my favorite color..</li>
            <li> I love this color so much i take it with me when i get a manicure and have them apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually surprisingly tasteful--not teenage goth-looking.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE FULL SIZE.  </li>
            <li> Hit the light right and the color starts to come through.</li>
            <li> It has the purple-red effects if it hits the light just right.</li>
            <li> Love this color, so elegant and misterious, dark just love it</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful, but very very dark.</li>
            <li> In sunlight it does have a nice metallic purplish glow to it, but not as apparent as the picture.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> But otherwise it is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Happy none-the less.</li>
            <li> It is a dark, lush color with a hint of cherry which looks awesome on the toes.    </li>
            <li> I only use OPI nail polish and love this color!</li>
            <li> Very smooth, professional finish.</li>
            <li> but it is a fun color.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice color, however, the picture is lighter than the actual nail polish.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a fun color for a night out on the town..</li>
            <li> I love how it looks in different light.</li>
            <li> It does shine really nicely, and only needs two coats to cover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a deep purple with a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> But, to reach the right color you want, I would suggest doing two or three coats.</li>
            <li> The rich color of the Black Cherry Chutney polish is so sexy on my toes, specially with super strappy heels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flat; tends to look brown when not in a bright light, which is most of the time.  </li>
            <li> One coat is really all you need to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> I love OPI&#x27;s polishes in general</li>
            <li> It is very durable and stay great looking so your efforts don&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> the very ages in which I have been loyal to OPI.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty on a manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> Pretty polish.  </li>
            <li> I only put on 2 coats so maybe more would have made a difference.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you OPI is great as well as long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love the red glitter shine.</li>
            <li> 2 coats is more than enough.</li>
            <li> i really recomend it!</li>
            <li> Color was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, dark and exotic.</li>
            <li> I had to spend more than half an hour to clean my desk and my hand, and throw my pants.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, however, it&#x27;s just another super dark polish.</li>
            <li> Really a pretty color, received fast</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews said the colour is too dark and no shimmering, but those who do love dark dark cherry will be happy with the colour.</li>
            <li> Really nice dark color.</li>
            <li> Really beautiful, dark polish, the red really comes out in sunlight.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think it would be so dark but its still nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail polish, and my current favorite is Royal Rajah Ruby (a lovely dark reddish brown) from the same collection.</li>
            <li> The color is long lasting with high gloss and in my opinion is truly salon quality (a good nail salon).</li>
            <li> For those who love the dark vibrant colors of OPI, this color hits all the right notes.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I got it in a reasonable amount of time .</li>
            <li> When the sunlight hits it the cherry color really comes through.</li>
            <li> However I cannot give the detailed review because I used only once.</li>
            <li> It really brights my skin tone,</li>
            <li> It wears well and is really shiny.</li>
            <li> I recommend this color and the shipment is fast too.</li>
            <li> My sister really likes this one too.</li>
            <li> I really like this color from</li>
            <li> In the sun the purple cherry color really</li>
            <li> It is a very vampy color.</li>
            <li> I found it much darker and you really couldn&#x27;t see the sparkle that is there.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I GOT IT FAST.</li>
            <li> A nice polish but a little to dark the picture inst very accurate in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color, looks like a warm black and then shines red in the sun.</li>
            <li> but I trust OPI and am not disappointed with my recent purchase.  </li>
            <li> Rich, deep, lustrous shine!</li>
            <li> This is such a gorgeous deep, rich, dark, purpley-garnety color...</li>
            <li> After Dark, you don&#x27;t really see the color in most lights.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m in bright sunlight it appears solid black.</li>
            <li> This color is deep and true.</li>
            <li> but it got old and this is an exact match.  </li>
            <li> Love the brand but let down this time around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more black than cherry.  </li>
            <li> I had read that the color is more black then purple.</li>
            <li> It seems more brownish purple than black cherry.</li>
            <li> it looks more black.</li>
            <li> If you like black , you will love this color.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a reddish black.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sister for Christmas</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I look forward to purchasing similar items from OPI.</li>
            <li> My Whistle as the top coat that adds little sparkles and pop.</li>
            <li> I had an older color called the blackest red which was pretty much finished</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, its a great color but nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> You seem to need a lot of light to really show the deep red color that&#x27;s shown on the website.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go-to shade.</li>
            <li> It is really super dark, even in the sunlight it seems more of a black with purply hue.</li>
            <li> If only it looked as pretty as the pic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still dark and perfect for fall- or for those of you like me who prefer dark year round.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited about the look of this nail polish buts it hard to get it just right.</li>
            <li> This is a really dark rich color.</li>
            <li> much sooner, actually,</li>
            <li> I like my nails short, just to the tips of my fingers and this color really stands out.</li>
            <li> only thing is didn&#x27;t really like was the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> looks and last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, buy</li>
            <li> The color is dark, so dark that it only looks purple in good lighting</li>
            <li> However, with the right nail polish remover, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult.</li>
            <li> Only under certain light does this polish have a dark purple glowing red effect.</li>
            <li> drys quick and last long!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured, no regrets!!</li>
            <li> I nice dark dark cherry red.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, for me at least, but I find it well worth the price with how pretty it makes me feel, even if I&#x27;m just sitting in bed with only my nails done.</li>
            <li> The subtle metallic sparkle in certain lighting is mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> The color is the color of black cherries in black cherry ice cream - more purple-toned than burgundy.</li>
            <li> unless in the light it is hard to tell what color it is.</li>
            <li> The color is too dark to show that lovely shade of purple underlying the dark red.</li>
            <li> I really love it because it isn&#x27;t black, but still dark enough.</li>
            <li> I have very long natural nails and am fussy about the products I use.</li>
            <li> Two Coats seems to have too much of the black....</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, but it hardly resembles the purple in the picture.</li>
            <li> flat</li>
            <li> These polishes also last a considerably long time if the gel overcoat is apply as finisher.</li>
            <li> This polish is a tad thin in consistency, but you still get full coverage in 2 coats.</li>
            <li> The OPI Black Cherry Chutney is as close to black as I&#x27;m willing to get.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the French Manicure for years and the only other color I would where was..</li>
            <li> it is dark, but in the sunlight it really shows off the little sparkle..</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> This seller sent polish that was old, and almost dried out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this color for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long fingers and like to keep my nails polished...</li>
            <li> Knew it would be dark was just hoping for a deep plum.</li>
            <li> The color is a deep, dark cherry, purple.</li>
            <li> Black Cherry Chutney is nearing black, and *far* darker than the image.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it was that during the week and a half it was on my nails, it seemed to get damaged easier.</li>
            <li> It had a deep purplish maroon look to it with a slight sparkle.</li>
            <li> She loves the dark deep dark bing cherry color.</li>
            <li> The color just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a waitress (also by OPI)</li>
            <li> But I expected that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t become black with multiple coats but stays a dark burgundy.</li>
            <li> Almost looks black but has a deep black cherry hint to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip like other nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The color is extremely on the BLACK side with two coats then it is the CHERRY.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this nail polish is that it is hard to get off.</li>
            <li> and I already have a dark color like this one</li>
            <li> like dark polishes</li>
            <li> I like dark colors.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for the dark color nail polish.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear dark colors on my nails.</li>
            <li> I wanted something dark..</li>
            <li> so dark</li>
            <li> If you put it on thick, you only need one coat.  </li>
            <li> I always use it with a base coat and a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> The container was nocked down and it broke.</li>
            <li> However, it appears like it was watered down or something.</li>
            <li> It looks like a dark brown/maroon almost black color.</li>
            <li> In person it looks like a brownish black.</li>
            <li> It is black with a grape-purplish hint of color.</li>
            <li> The color Black Cherry Chutney rocks.</li>
            <li> I do not like black nail polish.</li>
            <li> black cherry,</li>
            <li> Had Nicole&#x27;s Black Cat-Cha</li>
            <li> The black is chic and shiny.</li>
            <li> From a distance it looks almost black.</li>
            <li> Usually black.</li>
            <li> my quest to break out of the black mold</li>
            <li> but not a fan of Black..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost black.</li>
            <li> a little to dark ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty, but a tad disappointing when you purchase it expecting... color.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this nail polish but disappointed after putting it on.</li>
            <li> It could have come a little sooner...</li>
            <li> The color was a little darker than what it appeared online</li>
            <li> This will compliment your hands without making your nails look like little painted stubs.</li>
            <li> I got this little beauty in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for a few days now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments wearing it already.</li>
            <li> Makes a change from my usual black.</li>
            <li> I dont usually buy nail polishes on line</li>
            <li> Im not sure how to get this the way I wanted it to look</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad when your nail guy freaks when I chose a different color.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It sadly is.</li>
            <li> gives u a bad girl look that i wanted to achieve</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> Bought to match my maxi dress. OPI is my favorite brand. Fabulous color. Stays on a long time. No chips or cracks. Always put a top coat of clear OPI polish on top.</li>
            <li> loved it so much, bought it twice so I would not run out!!  Must get this!!</li>
            <li> GREAT addition to my collection</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this nail polish but disappointed after putting it on. Dont get me wrong, its a great color but nothing like the picture and I already have a dark color like this one so I wasnt impressed. The picture deff is different, its lighter and prettier than the actual color.</li>
            <li> Really a pretty color, received fast</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and I absolutely love it.  The deep burgundy color is beautiful.  It&#x27;s everything I had hoped it would be.  If you put it on thick, you only need one coat.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish especially with a gel top overlay on top! Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I only use OPI nail polish and love this color!</li>
            <li> Always an OPI fan this collection is luscious. The rich color of the Black Cherry Chutney polish is so sexy on my toes, specially with super strappy heels. I get so many complements from girls and the Guys. Show your true colors girls.....OPI!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my older sister for Christmas and she loves it.  The color is dark, so dark that it only looks purple in good lighting but it is a fun color.  It is a good quality nail polish, it goes on well, and doesn&#x27;t chip. A little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased OPI nail polish for years and never had a problem before.  This seller sent polish that was old, and almost dried out.  It went on my nail like mud.</li>
            <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color, looks like a warm black and then shines red in the sun. I took it to a nail place and had them paint my nails with it (I had acrylic nails). The only problem I had with it was that during the week and a half it was on my nails, it seemed to get damaged easier. (chips, indents, etc)</li>
            <li> This color is okay.  It&#x27;s a little flat; tends to look brown when not in a bright light, which is most of the time.  You seem to need a lot of light to really show the deep red color that&#x27;s shown on the website.  I primarily use OPI for my nails and I think there are much better options out there than this color. I do, however, like OPI nail color and have found it to be the best that I&#x27;ve used.  I always use it with a base coat and a shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color, however, the picture is lighter than the actual nail polish. In sunlight it does have a nice metallic purplish glow to it, but not as apparent as the picture. In person it looks like a brownish black. Nice color, just deceiving pictures.</li>
            <li> My fave opi color for the fall! The finish is shimmer/flat but the color pops out and matches with anything . I got it in a reasonable amount of time . The girst day I wore it and I hot many compliments</li>
            <li> Really nice dark color. OPI just goes on so evenly and smoothly. Rich, nice color.,I like this color for the winter.</li>
            <li> The color is great. It dries very fast and is such a great look. I get alot of people asking what color it is.</li>
            <li> Great color and I use this withthe Pirouette My Whistle as the top coat that adds little sparkles and pop.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I get compliments every time I wear this color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! It could have come a little sooner...much sooner, actually, but it was worth the wait. I&#x27;ve had it on for a few days now and I already know it&#x27;s one of my favorite colors. It looks exactly like it does in the picture. It&#x27;s a beautiful dark purple. I&#x27;m in love with this color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail polish, and my current favorite is Royal Rajah Ruby (a lovely dark reddish brown) from the same collection. In the bottle, it looks beautiful, but on my nails it&#x27;s mostly just black. Very similar to Lincoln Park After Dark, you don&#x27;t really see the color in most lights. Unless I&#x27;m in bright sunlight it appears solid black. But I still love it. Like all OPI polishes, it goes on smoothly and covers great. The color just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I got this shade because of the price and the color.  It is a great winter shade to be worn on short nails. I will definitely sport this shade in the winter.</li>
            <li> For those who love the dark vibrant colors of OPI, this color hits all the right notes. You get the dark color along with the beautiful cherry undertones. It looks pretty on a manicure or pedicure. When the sunlight hits it the cherry color really comes through.</li>
            <li> I have this on now and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments. I like my nails short, just to the tips of my fingers and this color really stands out.</li>
            <li> Love OPI polish. This color is deep and true. It was well packaged for safe shipping and arrived sooner than promised. I would recommend this polish, this color, and this seller.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter and worth every penny!  We loved how happy she was to get it.</li>
            <li> OPI has great nail polishes and all shades!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price... I will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Black Cherry Chutney is the best of all worlds. It is black with a grape-purplish hint of color. It sparkles and looks oh-so sexy on toes.&lt;br /&gt;This has become a favorite of mine.  I think I&#x27;ll order 3 more bottles in case OPI decides to discontinue it.  I can&#x27;t be without this color!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, great quality.</li>
            <li> Great shade for pedicures.</li>
            <li> I dont usually buy nail polishes on line but I trust OPI and am not disappointed with my recent purchase.  The color Black Cherry Chutney rocks. It is a dark, lush color with a hint of cherry which looks awesome on the toes.    I give it 10 stars!  Los Angeles Gal!</li>
            <li> So I bought this nail polish because I love the quality of OPI nail polish.  This one wasn&#x27;t any different.  The color was a little darker than what it appeared online but I didn&#x27;t mind.  It&#x27;s definitely more black than cherry.  But it&#x27;s a fun color for a night out on the town..</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous, I have tons of nail polish but this is my go to color :)</li>
            <li> I do not like black nail polish. The OPI Black Cherry Chutney is as close to black as I&#x27;m willing to get. It goes great with my skin tone and that hint of dark red is very sophisticated!</li>
            <li> very pretty color , had this about 4 yrs ago and was glad I found it</li>
            <li> Love the color. Makes a change from my usual black. Great color when the light hits it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used OPI.  I love the variety of colors.  It doesn&#x27;t chip like other nail polishes.  And it is formaldehyde free.</li>
            <li> I want to swim in it! This is such a gorgeous deep, rich, dark, purpley-garnety color...black cherry, just so cool. I wear it constantly.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this color is how it looks beautiful on short nails.  This will compliment your hands without making your nails look like little painted stubs.</li>
            <li> I had read that the color is more black then purple. It sadly is. Knew it would be dark was just hoping for a deep plum. Not even close. Love the brand but let down this time around.</li>
            <li> I love the color. The flow is very smooth. However I cannot give the detailed review because I used only once. The container was nocked down and it broke. I had to spend more than half an hour to clean my desk and my hand, and throw my pants. I think the container should be more durable.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited about the look of this nail polish buts it hard to get it just right. The color is extremely on the BLACK side with two coats then it is the CHERRY. Two Coats seems to have too much of the black....but one coat is perfect color just not enough polish...it doesn&#x27;t look right. Im not sure how to get this the way I wanted it to look</li>
            <li> I have very long fingers and like to keep my nails polished...toe nails too!  I love love love OPI nail polish.  They have wonderful colors and it lasts a long time...doesn&#x27;t chip.  I did darker colors and this one is way cool.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a rich beautiful nail polish. OPI is an excellent brand. The price was great and it arrived quickly. I will always buy OPI and I would be happy to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This polish has the good quality you expect from OPI.  The color is the color of black cherries in black cherry ice cream - more purple-toned than burgundy.</li>
            <li> Great colour, but use base coat, otherwise it can stain the nail. Doesn&#x27;t become black with multiple coats but stays a dark burgundy.</li>
            <li> Once I had a pedi in this color. love it ever since. It really brights my skin tone, that why I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Had Nicole&#x27;s Black Cat-Cha Later but it got old and this is an exact match.  Very vamp and sexy.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful, its not a runny color and only needed like 2 even coats and it looks great in the sun. Will re-order again</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL COLOR...LOVE IT!! Just as pictured, no regrets!!</li>
            <li> Getting my nails done is one of my simple pleasures in life and I enjoy having this color to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> This is a lot darker then I thought it would be but that&#x27;s ok for the fall and winter.  It&#x27;s a beautiful dark color</li>
            <li> Pretty polish.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> Despite this color being darker than the picture shown when I bought it, it&#x27;s still a beautiful color! I get lots of compliments on this nail polish.</li>
            <li> This eggplant color wears well, looks sophisticated, and is typical of OPI&#x27;s impeccable nail polish.  The color is long lasting with high gloss and in my opinion is truly salon quality (a good nail salon).</li>
            <li> Any OPI nail polish rocks</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT polish.  Very smooth, professional finish. Gorgeous color.  Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> love it. drys quick and last long!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, love it.</li>
            <li> This is a really dark rich color. I think it will be perfect for fall or winter. It wears well and is really shiny.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  My fave!  Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> bought for my wife to go along with her work attire. She loves the dark deep dark bing cherry color.</li>
            <li> Love OPI nail polish and ordered this in hopes of it still having a plum look at a glance. Its a tad bit darker than the picture but its still a beautiful black/plum color.</li>
            <li> I just loved the nail polish and loved the quality. The color is so great, very glamor, and sexy. I love to wear this nail polish it makes my nail so beautiful</li>
            <li> OPI NAIL POLISH is the &amp;#34;Cadillac&amp;#34; in color and longevity. The colors have humorous names and the colors are beautiful &amp; glide on. The black is chic and shiny. PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> It seems more brownish purple than black cherry. I only put on 2 coats so maybe more would have made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very long natural nails and am fussy about the products I use. Let me tell you OPI is great as well as long lasting. The colors are beautiful and rich, I just love OPI. It is now the only polish in my case. It is very durable and stay great looking so your efforts don&#x27;t go to waste. Try it you will love it too!</li>
            <li> Love the red glitter shine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and great coverage</li>
            <li> perfect for an important night out</li>
            <li> i love this nail polish, this is really gorgeousss!! gives u a bad girl look that i wanted to achieve</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful, but very very dark. From a distance it looks almost black. One coat is really all you need to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> This is a very deep shade of purple. In bright light or in the sun the purple shimmer can be picked up and magnified but indoors the polish tends to look almost black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like dark polishes so I kept this and it became one of my favorites but I&#x27;m still looking for a boysenberry colored nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always LOVE OPI, this color was pretty nice. I like dark colors. So if you&#x27;re looking for the dark color nail polish. I recommend this color and the shipment is fast too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. Really beautiful, dark polish, the red really comes out in sunlight.</li>
            <li> Already lots of compliments on this color this is so beautiful easily one of my favorites. My sister really likes this one too.</li>
            <li> Only under certain light does this polish have a dark purple glowing red effect. In those rare instances it&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. Most of the time, however, it&#x27;s just another super dark polish. It&#x27;s still pretty, but a tad disappointing when you purchase it expecting... color. Black Cherry Chutney is nearing black, and *far* darker than the image. It&#x27;s nice, but not what I was looking for. This polish is a tad thin in consistency, but you still get full coverage in 2 coats. No problems whatsoever with drying, streaking, or opacity.</li>
            <li> I really like this color from OPI Looks like the picture has a nice shine to it with a TOP coat and matches alot of my clothes for Fall and Winter.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything  but ,  it&#x27;s a color that leaves you speechless.  That&#x27;s all. Gorgeous!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color.  Great for Winter and has just the right amount of sheen to go from day to night.</li>
            <li> I love the look an the way it drys an that it goes good with what I ware...</li>
            <li> I tend to wear dark colors on my nails. Usually black. It&#x27;s bad when your nail guy freaks when I chose a different color.&lt;br /&gt;In my quest to break out of the black mold I chose this color. The OPI Dark Cherry Chutney is gorgeous! It&#x27;s still dark and perfect for fall- or for those of you like me who prefer dark year round. It had a deep purplish maroon look to it with a slight sparkle. I love how it looks in different light. Indoors it looks more black. Hit the light right and the color starts to come through. In the sun the purple cherry color really shines!&lt;br /&gt;This goes on smooth. 2 coats is more than enough. This is my new go-to shade. I am in love!</li>
            <li> Love OPI COLOR EXACT!</li>
            <li> Great color !!! If you like black , you will love this color.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty color, but it hardly resembles the purple in the picture. It is really super dark, even in the sunlight it seems more of a black with purply hue. It does not have the reddish undertones or metallic sparkle I thought it would have. It does shine really nicely, and only needs two coats to cover. I like it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  There is no red or sparkle at all in this once applied.  In the bottle, yes, on the nails, no.  It looks like a dark brown/maroon almost black color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and,  I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes. i recommend this.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews said the colour is too dark and no shimmering, but those who do love dark dark cherry will be happy with the colour. I really love it because it isn&#x27;t black, but still dark enough. I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It matches the description.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a nice package.&lt;br /&gt;It was packed nicely and safe.&lt;br /&gt;It came sooner them promised time.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I strongly recommend the product and the seller to every body.</li>
            <li> Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> This product is good quality and doesn&#x27;t clump up or streak. I gave it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome color! The subtle metallic sparkle in certain lighting is mesmerizing. Love it!</li>
            <li> the nail polish is really good quality, it&#x27;s the best brand aside from essie.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is didn&#x27;t really like was the color.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would be so dark but its still nice.</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter enjoyed</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color. I recieved a lot compliments</li>
            <li> I love the color. However, it appears like it was watered down or something. Takes SEVERAL coats to cover nail. However for the cost of couple bucks I would buy again...</li>
            <li> I bought this polish a while back. I am a nail polish geek, and this is the color i go back to every time. Well worth your money! BEST OPI POLISH!</li>
            <li> I saw this nail polish on Pinterest and fell in love. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere on the internet, until I came to Amazon. It was a great price and was shipped and delivered right away. I recommend this for every woman who loves a great nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great color…great packaging.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and OPI dries quick and lasts long</li>
            <li> This nail polish is perfect for fall. Love love love the color</li>
            <li> bought it to my girl friend. she just love this color. very  sexy  on a her toes.  i can recommend to any woman</li>
            <li> I love this rich color. Another great, unique color with a fun name from OPI. I want to try them all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for another color and stumbled upon this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did because the color is so  rich and beautiful looking. I love nail polish, and this has just become one of my favs!</li>
            <li> The colour is absolutely beautiful. It&#x27;s a deep purple with a nice sheen. It&#x27;s similar to \\&quot;William, Tell Me About It\\&quot; by OPI, but with a sheen rather than a matte finish. It goes with just about any style and outfit you can think of!</li>
            <li> Just saying the name makes my mouth water. Rich, deep, lustrous shine! A perfect color complement for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> u have to double the color</li>
            <li> I loved the picture online so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I love OPI&#x27;s polishes in general so I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy it sight unseen or sight only internet seen.  Anyway, I&#x27;m totally impressed.  This color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful and goes very well with my skin complexion. It&#x27;s rich, dark and exotic. Another win for OPI.</li>
            <li> The color is great, like everyone says, but I am starting to think OPI is not as resistant to chipping as it is reputed to be.  I recently tried a cheaper nail polish when in a bind and had none of the chipping issues I have had for ages ... the very ages in which I have been loyal to OPI.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Is my favorite color and&lt;br /&gt;i love it!  there&#x27;s no beter or more durable color like this!  i really recomend it!</li>
            <li> This color is so beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!  It reminds me of a convertible we had years ago.  Lots of nice memories there and this color will remind me of it more often.  Buy it.  Plus it&#x27;s Opinion, doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous polish, and I love OPI very much!  It&#x27;s a great fall color, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> a little to dark .. but  like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this color for a long time. The picture on the website makes it seem more of a purple but it&#x27;s more of a reddish black.  I had an older color called the blackest red which was pretty much finished and this was a perfect replica of that color.  I bought this along with Midnight in Moscow and I Vant to Bite Your Neck, and this ended up being my color of choice for it&#x27;s red undertones.  Very happy with this color.</li>
            <li> Love this color, so elegant and misterious, dark just love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color to wear. It sparkles nicely in the sun, and when I&#x27;m swimming in the summer weather and look at my nails polished, they&#x27;re beautiful with this on. It is pricey, for me at least, but I find it well worth the price with how pretty it makes me feel, even if I&#x27;m just sitting in bed with only my nails done. It came quickly and I look forward to purchasing similar items from OPI.</li>
            <li> The picture is nothing like the actual product.  When I received it, I thought I had received the product in error it was so different.</li>
            <li> This has fast become my favorite color..I wanted something dark..but not a fan of Black..this is perfect..it is dark, but in the sunlight it really shows off the little sparkle..I have been a fan of the French Manicure for years and the only other color I would where was..I&#x27;m really not a waitress (also by OPI)..but now I have been wearing this on my fingers and toes..</li>
            <li> Item was as described.</li>
            <li> Loved my product thank u</li>
            <li> If only it looked as pretty as the pic.  The color is too dark to show that lovely shade of purple underlying the dark red.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is actually on-point as the color in the pictures shows. I haven&#x27;t put it on my nails yet, but what I do know is the nail polish will be perfect for fall/winter...</li>
            <li> Beautiful fall and winter color</li>
            <li> Darker than what&#x27;s shown in the photo. But I expected that. It has the purple-red effects if it hits the light just right. Took two coats (but what Polish doesn&#x27;t). Happy none-the less. Great color for fall/winter</li>
            <li> This nail polish is to die for!!! The color is a deep, dark cherry, purple. It goes on pretty smoothly. It is a very vampy color. But, to reach the right color you want, I would suggest doing two or three coats. I got this little beauty in a timely fashion. The only downside to this nail polish is that it is hard to get off. However, with the right nail polish remover, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult. The color was too beautiful to pass up! If you are a fan of pretty purple nail polish, then this color might be for you!!! The seller was very helpful and a great person to purchase from! Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I love this color so much i take it with me when i get a manicure and have them apply. Service was quick, which i love. Color was exactly what i wanted. Very happy</li>
            <li> I like this color quite a bit. It&#x27;s a red so dark it&#x27;s almost black. It&#x27;s actually surprisingly tasteful--not teenage goth-looking. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I would have liked a tad bit more shimmer.</li>
            <li> Love almost every color OPI carries as they are richly saturated and there is no need to apply over and over. These polishes also last a considerably long time if the gel overcoat is apply as finisher.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and, I find that OPI always lasts better than other nail polishes. i recommend this.</li>
            <li> My favorite OPI color</li>
            <li> Beautiful color!  I love it &amp; have zero complaints!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this is a good product.  I love this color and&lt;br /&gt;it looks and last very long.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, buy</li>
            <li> A nice polish but a little to dark the picture inst very accurate in my opinion. I found it much darker and you really couldn&#x27;t see the sparkle that is there. But otherwise it is very pretty. I nice dark dark cherry red.</li>
            <li> unless in the light it is hard to tell what color it is. makes it very interesting. my daughter loved it to and right away put it on her nails. I love it</li>
            <li> THIS WAS IN THE INDIA MINI COLLECTION AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT THE FULL SIZE.  I GOT IT FAST. I WOULD BUY FROM AGAIN AND RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color. Almost looks black but has a deep black cherry hint to it. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments wearing it already. This will be one of my essential colors I keep in my color collection!</li>
