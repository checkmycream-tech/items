            <li>I am a body piercing apprentice and these needles certainly aren&#x27;t as sharp as I&#x27;m used to dealing with, but they still get the job done.</li>
            <li>I would prefer something with a little more room to push with considering the common size of this gauge and the various areas of the body/tissue thickness that can thus be pierced with this size for the short shaft it provides.</li>

            <li> but thats normal although i thought they arrived pretty earlyish for something that came late if u get what i mean.</li>
            <li> They are all packaged in individual sterilized packages, and they are extremely sharp, and the tips are longer so it makes it easier when piercing.</li>
            <li> Pretty annoyed.</li>
            <li> arrived a little later than it said it would</li>
            <li> I use a jeweler&#x27;s loupe to inspect tips for burrs which can cause unnecessary trauma or tearing damage to skin during a new piercing.</li>
            <li> Product was on time and here within date but the packaging was horrible my package was open they could of fell out other than that love it</li>
            <li> they are sharp as well!</li>
            <li> Needles seem very sharp.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and stamped into the casing was a medium black hair.</li>
            <li> Not one complaint from anyone</li>
            <li> Wrong size , sent me 16g</li>
            <li> It made piercing my industrials as painless as can be when you&#x27;re stabbing a part of your body.</li>

            <li> I do piecings so they came in handu</li>
            <li> I still have no idea why i ordered so many. They&#x27;re super awesome, they&#x27;re packaged really well and they&#x27;re exactly like piercing needles should be.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t deliver. I&#x27;ve used these needles before and they&#x27;re very good, the needles are sharp and sterile, but this time they never showed up. Pretty annoyed.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product. i love it, everything was how it should be. well packed and in order</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and stamped into the casing was a medium black hair. That isn&#x27;t sterile. Considering contacting seller about that</li>
            <li> These are just what they say they are. Needles seem very sharp. Pierced my cartilage twice using these and worked great.</li>
            <li> Your basic 14 gauge piercing needle. no flaws. these will be the needles I buy from now on. Great price, no flaws, just as described, super fast shipping. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I am a body piercing apprentice and these needles certainly aren&#x27;t as sharp as I&#x27;m used to dealing with, but they still get the job done.</li>
            <li> Good quality needles, arrived on time, simple packaging. I love it! Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> I got my package rather fast. I was really surprised actually. I don&#x27;t know why I needed a hundred needles, but who can argue with the price? They are very sharp and good quality needles. It made piercing my industrials as painless as can be when you&#x27;re stabbing a part of your body. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product was on time and here within date but the packaging was horrible my package was open they could of fell out other than that love it</li>
            <li> The needle lengths are waaaaaaaay to short for my personal tastes. I would prefer something with a little more room to push with considering the common size of this gauge and the various areas of the body/tissue thickness that can thus be pierced with this size for the short shaft it provides.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I needed.  They were the right size and seemed to go in smoothly when doing a piercing.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Not so. Great but gets the job done but he packs in the pictures arnt what they look like. But oh well there allright</li>
            <li> These are great, they work perfect :)</li>
            <li> Wrong size , sent me 16g</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to pierce and ear, they work great. Don&#x27;t use a safety pin to pierce. Made that mistake before, so I bought these and they create a nice hole.</li>
            <li> Good Quality it came with all the needles and it came pretty fast</li>
            <li> these are a great deal, and arrived in individual sterile packages, I bought them for my sons friend to pierce my ears during her apprenticeship and there were tons leftover to help her as new business came her way!</li>
            <li> GREAT  VALUE. I ordered these for my business and they are awesome!! VERY SHARP and a great price. I actually received 300 instead of 100. WILL BE BUYING AGAIN! :)</li>
            <li> Perfect. love how they&#x27;re individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son who has been doing piercings for over a year now. He told me to give these a 5-star review because they work well in the piercing procedure.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly. Be aware that these are imported, so quality may vary from one needle to the next. I use a jeweler&#x27;s loupe to inspect tips for burrs which can cause unnecessary trauma or tearing damage to skin during a new piercing. K-Y helps them glide through clean.</li>
            <li> I got the needles on time and was very pleased with the packaging. I also loved how each needle was individually packaged and sterilized. The price didn&#x27;t affect the product&#x27;s quality. I use them to do piercings all the time and absolutely love them! This is a must have for a piercist. Buy these!!! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly What I needed to poke all those holes in my head without spending to much money.</li>

            <li> These needles were amazing!! I have had so much buisness and the needles were perfect! Not one complaint from anyone</li>
            <li> They are all packaged in individual sterilized packages, and they are extremely sharp, and the tips are longer so it makes it easier when piercing. I&#x27;ve had no problems with them this far.</li>
            <li> good sharp needles did my own piercings at home allot cheaper than a parlor&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend these to any one.</li>
            <li> Sterilized and individually packaged. You can&#x27;t get any better than that. Came in a tiny box. There were rows of 10, and were so simple to open. I&#x27;ll definitely order more if I need them!</li>
            <li> These needles work great, individually wrapped and get the job done. I would recommend. This was a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This needles are awesome straight up i think the best ones you can get and the price!!! 100 needles for just 2 bucks!!! when i saw them i thought it was a joke but nah man! they work great! i used them to pierce my lips my tongue and when i piercing someone else it always gets the job done! they are sharp as well! and they got in my mail pretty fast! i think it took like three days! just WOW!!!!</li>
