            <li>Great liner however waiting for it was the only prob, it took FOREVERRRR to get here but works great!!</li>
            <li>every thing you would wont and need to create to the perfect eye i get so much complements on my eyes when i wear this product.try</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a good for nothing brush that wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply the eyeliner if you tried.  </li>
            <li>I used the product with my own brush bc</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and the brush is nice to have</li>
            <li>nice colors  </li>
            <li>I pulled off winged eye liner for the first (successful) time with this!</li>
            <li>i have an angled brush and this eye liner works great totally worth a dollar!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply though</li>
            <li>The gel smears and, believe it or not, runs very easily.</li>
            <li>like i thought, i automatically got charged and given 3, and it comes of and smears very easy, doesnt stick well.</li>
            <li>Wipes of very easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and then ordered 5 more and am considering ordering even more!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful product; I love how pretty it makes my eyes look!</li>
            <li>Best of all my children and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this is not waterproof but it does go on smoothly and is good for about an hour or two.</li>
            <li>The formula is great and as long as you have your own makeup tools, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This gel liner is very smooth, and not too cake, although it needs to be set with a shadow or else it will slide everywhere, but</li>
            <li>to clean the brush well after every use or buy a better brush.but all in all very pleased</li>
            <li>I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I tried to use the side more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it lasts me all day, I don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;re-touch it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better gel liners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for what it is.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this item, just buy some drug store eyeliner or something; I&#x27;m sure any eyeliner is better than this.</li>
            <li>It glides on nice and smooth and not smudge resistant at all.</li>
            <li>Although this product took a while to get here, I just love how it applies and makes my eyes look.</li>
            <li>i will buy two more</li>
            <li>Pay more and get something better.</li>
            <li>it work amazingly and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>glad I ordered 2</li>
            <li>but I still love the color and the product.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is top notch.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>it is very rich</li>
            <li>Thank you very much this is just the eye liner I have been looking for I will buy more good products</li>
            <li>When I received this item, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I ordered one to begin with, and loved it so much, I went and ordered 5 more.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>If you really want a good cream eyeliner buy macs eyeliner.</li>
            <li>very black.brings out the color of your eyes.very good price.have</li>
            <li>Its disapointing  though the brush is not designed well for easy application.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with supplied brush.</li>
            <li>This should have had a fine point brush to go with it</li>
            <li>It comes off really light, and it rubs off easily.</li>
            <li>and It applies smooth.</li>
            <li>It glides on so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t smear everywhere after you&#x27;ve applied</li>
            <li>The brush is horribly cheap.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price I paid :).</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>but I still like it if irs the same quality its a great buy</li>
            <li>It is really cheap but it also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>it last along time good price love</li>
            <li>The price was right and surprisingly the shipping was fast, but the quality was lacking.  </li>
            <li>i think this was a good purchase, the other reviews exaggerate, most any gel eyeliner smear when you rub on it, just dont  put it in places that will smear without touching</li>
            <li>The brush could be a bit more angled, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It has a good dark coloring, but smudges and comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is good is that it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have bought a different kind of brush for this because I really do love the eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I really loved how smooth this gel liner went on, not to mention the cute little brush that came along with it, but it&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I was scared and really nervous to buy it, but when I did I was really glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it glides on kind of clear.</li>
            <li>Not as shown in the picture, i got a completely different product, but i still loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for beginners or people who don&#x27;t use eyeliner often.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and sliky very easy to aply.</li>
            <li>the best part is, if you use it correctly, the gel will last you a couple months or longer, so I&#x27;ve got a years supply for only 6 dollars!!</li>
            <li>You get what paid for, its a nice product but after a few hours it seems oily to be honest</li>
            <li>i want to order more and more of this cant get enough</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on buying more!</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>However there is nothing cosmetic about the brush, its like the ones you get in elementary school.</li>
            <li>it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the dollar</li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth that price.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the wait,</li>
            <li>The colour is nice and dark but it does smudge easily.</li>
            <li>Seller did everything right</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li>Very nice for the small cost.</li>
            <li>The gel liner works really well, almost no smudging through out the day!</li>
            <li>First off it took 5 months to get to my house</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The quality of this item was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>overall satisfied</li>
            <li>Once I got the product, it turned out be extremely tiny in an adorable way.</li>
            <li>great deal and cheaper yet the same as drug store product, also package comes enough and great for stocking stuffers and to keep for special events like Halloween, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>If your not careful it will smear it glides on so easy with the brsh they provide you.</li>
            <li>Came way before due date and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Works great actually like it wish it was a lil bigger and came with a bigger brush but no complaints</li>
            <li>The brush not so much.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very gloopy and it cannot go even 10 minutes without smudging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really creamy.</li>
            <li>the brush it came with was really flimsy.</li>
            <li>is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li>it arrived on time not used like some of the negative feedback said it looks good and</li>
            <li>It looked dark and very precise.</li>
            <li>This product I didn&#x27;t like very much because it smudges, made my eyes itchy and doesn&#x27;t give a professional look.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping I was surprised, did smear a bit, nevertheless I like it and wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>and I love that the eye liner is something small so that I could put it in my purse.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would pay more than that though.</li>
            <li>Goes on a little dark but overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li>but it came with a very soft flat brush and this makes it very hard to make a good line.</li>
            <li>The Eyeliner was dry and did not go on black more like a dark gray the brush was cheap.</li>
            <li>the brush seems pretty crap but the actual eyeliner makeup is a pretty good quality, and its casing aint too shabby either</li>
            <li>I use this for everyday use, Face Paintings, and special effects make-up</li>
            <li>I usually use a pencil eye liner and this was a lot easier to apply and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply a thin line.</li>
            <li>IT just does NOT dry.</li>
            <li>this product really is a joke and not worth the time or energy.</li>

            <li> You get what paid for, its a nice product but after a few hours it seems oily to be honest</li>
            <li> i want to order more and more of this cant get enough</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on buying more!</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> However there is nothing cosmetic about the brush, its like the ones you get in elementary school.</li>
            <li> it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth the dollar</li>
            <li> and it is definitely worth that price.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth the wait,</li>
            <li> The colour is nice and dark but it does smudge easily.</li>
            <li> Seller did everything right</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> Very nice for the small cost.</li>
            <li> The gel liner works really well, almost no smudging through out the day!</li>
            <li> First off it took 5 months to get to my house</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> overall satisfied</li>
            <li> Once I got the product, it turned out be extremely tiny in an adorable way.</li>
            <li> great deal and cheaper yet the same as drug store product, also package comes enough and great for stocking stuffers and to keep for special events like Halloween, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If your not careful it will smear it glides on so easy with the brsh they provide you.</li>
            <li> Came way before due date and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Works great actually like it wish it was a lil bigger and came with a bigger brush but no complaints</li>
            <li> The brush not so much.</li>
            <li> The consistency is very gloopy and it cannot go even 10 minutes without smudging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really creamy.</li>
            <li> the brush it came with was really flimsy.</li>
            <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time not used like some of the negative feedback said it looks good and</li>
            <li> It looked dark and very precise.</li>
            <li> This product I didn&#x27;t like very much because it smudges, made my eyes itchy and doesn&#x27;t give a professional look.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping I was surprised, did smear a bit, nevertheless I like it and wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> and I love that the eye liner is something small so that I could put it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would pay more than that though.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little dark but overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> but it came with a very soft flat brush and this makes it very hard to make a good line.</li>
            <li> The Eyeliner was dry and did not go on black more like a dark gray the brush was cheap.</li>
            <li> the brush seems pretty crap but the actual eyeliner makeup is a pretty good quality, and its casing aint too shabby either</li>
            <li> I use this for everyday use, Face Paintings, and special effects make-up</li>
            <li> I usually use a pencil eye liner and this was a lot easier to apply and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get here, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply a thin line.</li>
            <li> IT just does NOT dry.</li>
            <li> this product really is a joke and not worth the time or energy.</li>
            <li> When I received this product I got a little square plastic container of gel eye shadow I suppose with a small cheap to apply the shadow.  </li>
            <li> Would reccomend for someone on a budget, or anyone really, no use over paying when you get the same value and quality as the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This product came a little early.</li>
            <li> The actual eyeliner was not much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Took so long to arrive</li>
            <li> I knew that this order would take a long time to arrive, so I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it.</li>
            <li> and it was smaller then expected.</li>
            <li> took kinda long for it to come in</li>
            <li> Not professional whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It glides on like gel and stays on for as long as you need it to.</li>
            <li> Its thick like I wanted it to be, and it dries really really fast.</li>
            <li> For me a liner ( no matter type, gel, felt tip, kohl, ect) should always dry and never smudge.</li>
            <li> It Does not dry at all and is just like putting black grease by your eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Really oily and crappy :/ Not worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very small, clear jar of clear gel liner, with a black lid.</li>
            <li> but i had an extra set of nail art brushes that i cut down</li>
            <li> (They were very long) and they make the nicest, finest lines!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof and didn&#x27;t even last half an hour.</li>
            <li> Seems to run a little bit after it has been on several hours.</li>
            <li> the only thing I do not like about it is that it seems a little greasy on my make up brush</li>
            <li> what is in the picture is it a tiny little thing the size of a quarter .</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this product because when I received it, it had been opened and the eyeliner was all melted and messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very opaque at all.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as it is expected to work.</li>
            <li> This little jar will go a long way.</li>
            <li> biggest down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry, I noticed after I applied it, about an hour later when my little boy have me a hug and pressed the side if his face to mine, when he pulled away there was a black smuge on his face from my eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear as bad as it may sound on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought the brush was a little bit harder</li>
            <li> it is extremely small, maybe a little bigger than a quarter.</li>
            <li> Not worth the 1$.</li>
            <li> it takes almost a month to ship so its almost not worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even dark.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for a base but not a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Its NOT waterproof and it will run down  your face if you use lotion.</li>
            <li> It gives a black line</li>
            <li> The liner is blackest black and stays well on my hooded eyes (use primer).</li>
            <li> In less of hlf an hour I looked like a raccoon, It smudge all over my face.</li>
            <li> not worth your money!</li>
            <li> This isnt what mine looks like mine cane in a little thing</li>
            <li> I cant travel with it because the brush comes seperate from the little jar</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> and i dont want the brush to be messy</li>
            <li> I give them less than one star!</li>
            <li> Mine came in a small pot, not in a tube.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most terrible eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!</li>
            <li> I usually just go over that eyeliner with a liquid to make it stay on all day.</li>
            <li> However, the pigmentation is not very good.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> They send you a really bad brush that is tiny probably the size of my pinky and the eyeliner is not at all</li>
            <li> First I noticed was how terrible the brush was,</li>
            <li> I felt like I was applying cold watered down eyeliner on my eyes;</li>
            <li> Poor quality, and has no ability to stay in place( don&#x27;t blink or sweat)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and NOT gel.</li>
            <li> This is the worse eye liner ever, melt down make me look like a panda, not even worse for the price, will use for face paint on Halloween :(((</li>
            <li> But not even 15 minutes later, the eyeliner was smudged and looked awful.</li>
            <li> the only disclaimer is that it says waterproof but it smudges really bad!!!!</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> The brush was horrible and coated in a heavy plastic.</li>
            <li> I am silly &amp; did not even realize that this was Gel!</li>
            <li> The brush was pokey and painful to use.</li>
            <li> This item was terrible it smudged, it was no better that eyeshadow and Vaseline, it lasted about five minutes and the brush fell apart after two uses!!!</li>
            <li> I hate it,</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I would hate to run out</li>
            <li> Terrible product :(  </li>
            <li> This eyeliner is terrible.</li>
            <li> Very Terrible.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is horrible!</li>
            <li> this was a horrible purchase, do NOT get it!</li>
            <li> I was disgusted and immediately threw it out!</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible but I like the eye liner.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> The brush, I agree are terrible.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s illegal too!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cosmetic is good-applicator is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best cheap eyeliner EVER.  I will order more when I run out. I love it.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect and it stays on for a bit. However there is nothing cosmetic about the brush, its like the ones you get in elementary school. No bueno</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner its a gel base. If your not careful it will smear it glides on so easy with the brsh they provide you. This product came a little early. Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> the brush seems pretty crap but the actual eyeliner makeup is a pretty good quality, and its casing aint too shabby either</li>
            <li> Mine came in a small pot, not in a tube. This has to be the most terrible eyeliner ever. IT just does NOT dry.</li>
            <li> The gel liner works really well, almost no smudging through out the day! Although i don&#x27;t like the brush it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was not water proof at all. I only bought it because I thought it was water proof but just comes off</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge, did not come with the brush like it said it was supposed to though. only downside.</li>
            <li> Works great actually like it wish it was a lil bigger and came with a bigger brush but no complaints</li>
            <li> not worth your money! its basically oil paint. Poor quality, and has no ability to stay in place( don&#x27;t blink or sweat) it reminds me of something you would find in a dollar store kiddie clown make up kit. this product really is a joke and not worth the time or energy.</li>
            <li> The Eyeliner was dry and did not go on black more like a dark gray the brush was cheap. Not worth the 1$.</li>
            <li> This product I didn&#x27;t like very much because it smudges, made my eyes itchy and doesn&#x27;t give a professional look.</li>
            <li> Like the eyeliner. Its disapointing  though the brush is not designed well for easy application. Seems to run a little bit after it has been on several hours. Worth the dollar I paid though.</li>
            <li> I am silly &amp; did not even realize that this was Gel! I thought it was powder &amp; you added water to the brush. ANYHOW, I LOVE IT! It is so nice and goes on smoothly and looks GREAT!!! The brush it came with is what you expect for the price but i had an extra set of nail art brushes that i cut down (They were very long) and they make the nicest, finest lines! Going to order more for my daughter &amp; myself! Came way before due date and was packaged nicely. Seller did everything right and i recommend them! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is junk. Seriously. Just go to the drug store and get a gel eyeliner. First off it took 5 months to get to my house and then it was not as pictured and look used. The &amp;#34;free brush &amp;#34; was the best part and it fell apart while opening.</li>
            <li> I have had this eye liner ordered since the beginning of November 2013 and never received it so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and said they could reship me another one in December and guess what? Still no eye liner! I have ask for a refund of my money and lets see if they come through with that!!!! Don&#x27;t even think about ordering from this co, I always trust what Amazon has on here but this time they have dropped the ball with this seller! I give them less than one star!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I use this for everyday use, Face Paintings, and special effects make-up and It applies smooth. I could not get over the price I paid for it. Best of all my children and I have sensitive skin and we had no allergic reactions!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very happy with this presentation, but the seller was very easy to work with, we came to an agreement that we were both happy with.</li>
            <li> I ordered one to begin with, and loved it so much, I went and ordered 5 more.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is, if you use it correctly, the gel will last you a couple months or longer, so I&#x27;ve got a years supply for only 6 dollars!!</li>
            <li> Ran all over about an hour after wearing.</li>
            <li> The price was right and surprisingly the shipping was fast, but the quality was lacking.  I tried it twice but just couldn&#x27;t use it.  The brush was pokey and painful to use. I tried to use the side more but it just didn&#x27;t function correctly.  The actual eyeliner was not much better.&lt;br /&gt;I need to remember that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The brush wasn&#x27;t great so I used my own eyeliner brush, but 1st impression of the eyeliner itself when put on (with a primer as well) was good. It looked dark and very precise. But not even 15 minutes later, the eyeliner was smudged and looked awful.</li>
            <li> This is the worse eye liner ever, melt down make me look like a panda, not even worse for the price, will use for face paint on Halloween :(((</li>
            <li> I really loved how smooth this gel liner went on, not to mention the cute little brush that came along with it, but it&#x27;s  biggest down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry, I noticed after I applied it, about an hour later when my little boy have me a hug and pressed the side if his face to mine, when he pulled away there was a black smuge on his face from my eyeliner! For me a liner ( no matter type, gel, felt tip, kohl, ect) should always dry and never smudge.</li>
            <li> Works good stays on all day with out coming off or smudging off I would buy again when I run out. This little jar will go a long way.</li>
            <li> i have an angled brush and this eye liner works great totally worth a dollar! I definitely plan on buying more!</li>
            <li> Its NOT waterproof and it will run down  your face if you use lotion. The only thing that is good is that it applies smoothly. Good Luck</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is great. The brush not so much. This should have had a fine point brush to go with it but it came with a very soft flat brush and this makes it very hard to make a good line. I have bought a different kind of brush for this because I really do love the eyeliner. It is very soft and sliky very easy to aply.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product; I love how pretty it makes my eyes look! Every girl should have this in her makeup case. I can’t wait to use it with my strip lashes! Oh! It comes with a brush.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner it is very rich the only thing I do not like about it is that it seems a little greasy on my make up brush</li>
            <li> You get what paid for, its a nice product but after a few hours it seems oily to be honest it takes almost a month to ship so its almost not worth it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it lasts me all day, I don&#x27;t even have to &#x27;re-touch it. It&#x27;s just WONDERFUL and AMAZING.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this eyeliner. I was scared and really nervous to buy it, but when I did I was really glad I did. Its thick like I wanted it to be, and it dries really really fast. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I knew it was a Gel but I thought it would eventually harden.  Not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It glides on so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t smear everywhere after you&#x27;ve applied and it&#x27;s great for on the run. The brush could be a bit more angled, but other than that, it&#x27;s great. I love it.</li>
            <li> VERY TINY AND NOT LIKE THE PICTURE BUT THATS WHAT YOU RECEIVE FOR 99CENTS. LOL BUT I LIKE IT. T.Y.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like this product because when I received it, it had been opened and the eyeliner was all melted and messy. when I opened up the package it was dripping didn&#x27;t even have a lid in the package.</li>
            <li> The colour is nice and dark but it does smudge easily. It also is a SAMPLE product so it&#x27;s very tiny. It&#x27;s about the size of a quarter. It isn&#x27;t awful but it isn&#x27;t the best. I give it three stars.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED NOT WHAT WAS SHOWN IN ADVERTISEMENT......VERY LOW QUALITY!! YOU WILL RECEIVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ITEM. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is terrible. It&#x27;s not very opaque at all. It smears all over the place, especially when you apply it to your waterline or bottom lash line. The brush that comes with it is no where dense enough to use to put eyeliner on. It is very flimsy and cheap. Also the picture is not what you get. It&#x27;s a very small, clear jar of clear gel liner, with a black lid.</li>
            <li> This was bought because it said it was waterproof... well it is NOT.  Terrible product :(  I would NEVER recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had this eyeliner for like about 4 months and it never seems to run out!!! the only disclaimer is that it says waterproof but it smudges really bad!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product!! I couldn&#x27;t believe some of the post on here about it, Mine stayed on for hours, went on easy, and looked great..</li>
            <li> Took so long to arrive I forgot I even ordered this liner. It&#x27;s tiny &amp; they changed the picture of what this eyeliner looks like. NOT WATERPROOF! That&#x27;s why I bought it &#x27;cause I wanted to try out an eyeliner that&#x27;s waterproof, this is not. Very easy to apply though but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying to your waterline. Tends to wear off within an hour. I&#x27;m not the type of person to reapply eyeliner every hour. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product unless you&#x27;re using it for Halloween. I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> Garbage. Trash.  Very Terrible. Chinese Junk.  Do not buy.  It is garbage.  It is trash.  Do not buy.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time not used like some of the negative feedback said it looks good and its a great eyeliner i got it because it was suppose to be water proof but i guess not</li>
            <li> this is not waterproof but it does go on smoothly and is good for about an hour or two. cant complain i only paid 99cents.</li>
            <li> i want to order more and more of this cant get enough</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is horrible! if you are on the fence about buying it or even considering buying it, DO NOT GET IT. it is extremely small, maybe a little bigger than a quarter. The consistency is very gloopy and it cannot go even 10 minutes without smudging. this was a horrible purchase, do NOT get it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better gel liners. The brush is horribly cheap. The gel smears and, believe it or not, runs very easily. It got all over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for what it is. It gives a black line and it&#x27;s simple to use. It&#x27;s also really creamy. However, the pigmentation is not very good. It comes off really light, and it rubs off easily. It&#x27;s not bad for beginners or people who don&#x27;t use eyeliner often.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item was exactly what I wanted and I love that the eye liner is something small so that I could put it in my purse. The time was also perfect when it arrived to me in the mail. Really Satisfied :)!!!</li>
            <li> Great liner however waiting for it was the only prob, it took FOREVERRRR to get here but works great!! sorry</li>
            <li> every thing you would wont and need to create to the perfect eye i get so much complements on my eyes when i wear this product.try this</li>
            <li> Goes on a little dark but overall happy with the product. Definitely worth it for the price I paid :).</li>
            <li> This gel liner is very smooth, and not too cake, although it needs to be set with a shadow or else it will slide everywhere, but great deal and cheaper yet the same as drug store product, also package comes enough and great for stocking stuffers and to keep for special events like Halloween, a little goes a long way. overall satisfied</li>
            <li> When I received this item, I was so excited! I tried in on immediately.  First I noticed was how terrible the brush was, it&#x27;s just a good for nothing brush that wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply the eyeliner if you tried.  The eyeliner itself is very tiny.  When I applied the eyeliner with a proper eyeliner bush, i noticed how &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; the eyeliner&#x27;s consistency felt.  I felt like I was applying cold watered down eyeliner on my eyes; gross feeling.  PLUS! It didn&#x27;t even last 2 hours before it began fading! Ugh.  Never used it again. Don&#x27;t buy this item, just buy some drug store eyeliner or something; I&#x27;m sure any eyeliner is better than this.</li>
            <li> I received this item before it&#x27;s ETA, but upon opening it, it appeared to have been USED!! There were big brush marks and gouges taken out of the product! I was disgusted and immediately threw it out! Never again will I order from this seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a dollar and decided to get two because they were only a dollar. I knew that this order would take a long time to arrive, so I wasn&#x27;t too worried about it. Once I got the product, it turned out be extremely tiny in an adorable way. I used the product with my own brush bc the brush it came with was really flimsy. It glides on nice and smooth and not smudge resistant at all. I usually just go over that eyeliner with a liquid to make it stay on all day. It doesn&#x27;t do any of the things it advertises. This product is a waste of money don&#x27;t buy it. If you really want a good cream eyeliner buy macs eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the way it was showen on here and it was smaller then expected. It did not work as good either.</li>
            <li> The packaging in the picture is non-existent, as the small-flat tub of eyeliner comes in a plastic baggie with the brush. It has a good dark coloring, but smudges and comes off very easily. You get what you pay for and the brush is nice to have</li>
            <li> Although this product took a while to get here, I just love how it applies and makes my eyes look. Very nice for the small cost.</li>
            <li> nice colors  it last along time good price love it color stay on all day i will buy two more</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t do what it suppose to do. It don&#x27;t stay on like it suppose to and it glides on kind of clear. Its not and e.l.f. product.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was on sale for $1 and it is definitely worth that price. Not sure if I would pay more than that though. The brush is terrible but I like the eye liner. I usually use a pencil eye liner and this was a lot easier to apply and went on smoothly. I pulled off winged eye liner for the first (successful) time with this! It didn&#x27;t smudge and faded at about the same rate as pencil liner.</li>
            <li> They send you a really bad brush that is tiny probably the size of my pinky and the eyeliner is not at all what is in the picture is it a tiny little thing the size of a quarter .</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected. It Does not dry at all and is just like putting black grease by your eye lashes. Plus the bruch falls apart. Pay more and get something better.</li>
            <li> it work amazingly and went on smoothly. Everyone has been asking about my make up and how i do it</li>
            <li> I ordered this and then ordered 5 more and am considering ordering even more! I love love love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Instead of getting 1 like i thought, i automatically got charged and given 3, and it comes of and smears very easy, doesnt stick well. looks good when you out it on for a couple minutes though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even dark. Just awful. It looks like you tried to wipe it off with a cloth &amp; it smudges</li>
            <li> This product was amazing! Works perfect. Although I thought I was gonna be a crappy product do that it&#x27;s only 99 cents. I was totally told off. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear as bad as it may sound on other reviews. The brush, I agree are terrible. But hey, what do you expect at this price. The formula is great and as long as you have your own makeup tools, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I hate it, it&#x27;s thin and NOT gel. It&#x27;s like grease and never dries! Total rip off. I hate it</li>
            <li> The liner is blackest black and stays well on my hooded eyes (use primer). Though it is small, it is exactly what you pay for, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works as it is expected to work. Cheap and it gets the job done. Would reccomend for someone on a budget, or anyone really, no use over paying when you get the same value and quality as the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> took kinda long for it to come in but it was well worth the wait, glad I ordered 2 cause I would hate to run out</li>
            <li> This order does not come with eyeshadow and the quality of the eyeliner isn&#x27;t very good. The brush included for the eye liner falls apart when applied to the eye.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much this is just the eye liner I have been looking for I will buy more good products</li>
            <li> When I received this product I got a little square plastic container of gel eye shadow I suppose with a small cheap to apply the shadow.  All of this was sent to me in a plastic bag- no instruction. No contact information. No information about the seller.  Not professional whatsoever.  I would not recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time! Never have had an issue with it.</li>
            <li> I never resivd my product&lt;br /&gt; Nunca lo resivi</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t include any brush don&#x27;t get this ppl&lt;br /&gt;Works ok for the price but not so great I guess I</li>
            <li> Really oily and crappy :/ Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Lo orden&amp;egrave; hace m&amp;aacute;s de 8 meses y nunca lo recib&amp;iacute;. Cero stars, dinero tirado a la basura.</li>
            <li> Hey!! This isnt what mine looks like mine cane in a little thing but I still like it if irs the same quality its a great buy</li>
            <li> Would not recommend as an eyeliner.  Wipes of very easily. Maybe good for a base but not a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This item was terrible it smudged, it was no better that eyeshadow and Vaseline, it lasted about five minutes and the brush fell apart after two uses!!! DO NOT BYE THIS PRODUCT IT IS NOT TO THE DESCRIPTION AT ALL!!!! Please don&#x27;t waist your money on it!!!!!! When I got it they also labeled it as M.A.C. So it&#x27;s illegal too!!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush to apply will work once maybe twice before hairs start fraying and making stray lines. Cosmetic is good-applicator is horrible!</li>
            <li> I received the product a week after I had made purchase. I thought the brush was a little bit harder but I still love the color and the product.</li>
            <li> i think this was a good purchase, the other reviews exaggerate, most any gel eyeliner smear when you rub on it, just dont  put it in places that will smear without touching, i recommend this item though.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is top notch. It took a little while to get here, but it was well worth the wait. It glides on like gel and stays on for as long as you need it to.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail, I just tried it, (could not use the &amp;#34;PRO- Brush that it comes with it, because it doesn&#x27;t work). In less of hlf an hour I looked like a raccoon, It smudge all over my face. It is really cheap but it also doesn&#x27;t work. Save your $2.</li>
            <li> The brush was horrible and coated in a heavy plastic. It&#x27;s not waterproof and didn&#x27;t even last half an hour.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping I was surprised, did smear a bit, nevertheless I like it and wear it all the time. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> fail&lt;br /&gt;too smudges&lt;br /&gt;hard to apply&lt;br /&gt;theres a reason is that cheap&lt;br /&gt;no my fav eye liner at all !!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. I have never used a gel product before. It is easy to apply with supplied brush. I was able to apply a thin line.</li>
            <li> Heres another item that looks good and says alot, but never made it to my mail-box. I hope someone gets their orders for all and any items they ordered since October,2013...Juanita Wilson</li>
            <li> you want la liz eyes??? well,this is for you! very black.brings out the color of your eyes.very good price.have to clean the brush well after every use or buy a better brush.but all in all very pleased</li>
            <li> It doesnt come as shown but it does last a while without reapplying. I cant travel with it because the brush comes seperate from the little jar and i dont want the brush to be messy</li>
            <li> Not as shown in the picture, i got a completely different product, but i still loved it.</li>
