    <ol>
            <li>The Fuchsia Fever is beautiful!</li>
            <li>And  this Maybelline color tattoo worked just as good!!.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>it is very good</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>It is bright but not neon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great color, but I was expecting more pink-ish than purple.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this color.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I got this eyeshadow yesterday and LOVE THE COLOR!.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>nice color</li>
            <li>and it comes in a nice glass jar too.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful it stays on for a very long time and the color shows up very nicely.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color fast service.</li>
            <li>gorgeous shade between fuchsia and purple with cool undertone.  </li>
            <li>had to have it glad</li>
            <li>If I try to layer more on top to enhance the color it starts looking cakey, not to mention most of the product is lost in the wrinkles of my fingerprint.</li>
            <li>I would by more from this line</li>
            <li>First off, the Maybeline color tattoo line is Absoultly amazing!</li>
            <li>I am expecting more colors coming soon.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but it&#x27;s more PURPLE than anything.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this particular color on my eyes yet, but I&#x27;ve swatched it on my wrist and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>My package also came extremely early, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any of the Color Tattoo line to know if this is normal of the product or not, so while I&#x27;m happy with the shipping speed and reasonable price, I would probably not purchase this exact product again.</li>
            <li>These are good cream shadows last all day for me</li>
            <li>If I try to apply it with a brush it still does not apply very opaquely, most of the product sticks in the bristles and it will roll and flake off my lid if I try to get a thicker color application.</li>
            <li>I love the Maybelline Color Tattoos, they are amazing as a base for powder eye shadows or on their own because they have great pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve never had a package arrive so quickly.</li>
            <li>Product was fresh and sealed.</li>
            <li>The product is defiantly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love love this color, and it really does last a long time!</li>
            <li>Its creamy, smooth and the colors are fairly solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked up and of course fuchsia is a very bold pink as it is.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the reviews, and the vibrant color.</li>
            <li>VIBRANT COLOR.  </li>
            <li>this is a long lasting product, I love it.  </li>
            <li>If I use my finger, it applies very sheer to my lids and most of the iridescence is lost, it ends up looking like your average cranberry eye color.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it does not have much staying power, but this is something I always struggle with in eyeshadows so that may just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And even though some reviews say it don&#x27;t last or creases, I have to say after a whole day out running errand&#x27;s this eyeshadow stayed on and looked fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a darker skinned woman its not t bright just right easy to blend and does last.</li>
            <li>but apparently they are suppose to the same didn&#x27;t look at the name just the picture and here is what I  seen... now mind you that these to are really Fuchsia Fever...</li>
            <li>I was expecting a hot pink color and instead received a purple eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Less than a week after I ordered, I think, it was there, which was exciting and kudos to the seller for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color payoff is decent and comparable to other colors of this line of eyeshadows.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was a little aprehensive buying this because it&#x27;s a limited edition color</li>

            <li> Love love this color, and it really does last a long time!</li>
            <li> had to have it glad i purchased im a darker skinned woman its not t bright just right easy to blend and does last.</li>
            <li> I order I thought different eyeshadow... but apparently they are suppose to the same didn&#x27;t look at the name just the picture and here is what I  seen... now mind you that these to are really Fuchsia Fever... so read what u are getting... lol the Purple one is not what u are getting and the pinkish colored one when u open the jar and see the color is not what u are getting either...</li>
            <li> gorgeous shade between fuchsia and purple with cool undertone.  It is bright but not neon. Product was fresh and sealed. These are good cream shadows last all day for me and I have oily lids.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! nice color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve never had a package arrive so quickly. Less than a week after I ordered, I think, it was there, which was exciting and kudos to the seller for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the actual product itself I can&#x27;t rave about. The product looks darker in the pot than any of the pictures of Fuchsia Fever I&#x27;ve looked up and of course fuchsia is a very bold pink as it is. Perhaps that just is how it looks in package. Swatched on the back of my hand it is alright, a iridescent pink. On my eyes is another story. If I use my finger, it applies very sheer to my lids and most of the iridescence is lost, it ends up looking like your average cranberry eye color. If I try to layer more on top to enhance the color it starts looking cakey, not to mention most of the product is lost in the wrinkles of my fingerprint. If I try to apply it with a brush it still does not apply very opaquely, most of the product sticks in the bristles and it will roll and flake off my lid if I try to get a thicker color application. Lastly, it does not have much staying power, but this is something I always struggle with in eyeshadows so that may just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any of the Color Tattoo line to know if this is normal of the product or not, so while I&#x27;m happy with the shipping speed and reasonable price, I would probably not purchase this exact product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is wonderful it stays on for a very long time and the color shows up very nicely. I would by more from this line it is very good</li>
            <li> I was a little aprehensive buying this because it&#x27;s a limited edition color and it was sold in stotes like 2 years ago. However the eyeshadow was sealed as if it&#x27;s brand new and wasnt dried out at all. Color payoff is decent and comparable to other colors of this line of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> First off, the Maybeline color tattoo line is Absoultly amazing! Especially if you have oily eyelids, like me, and other eyeshadow creases and doesn&#x27;t stay put. I haven&#x27;t used this particular color on my eyes yet, but I&#x27;ve swatched it on my wrist and it looks great.  My package also came extremely early, so that&#x27;s good. The product is defiantly worth the price.  I am expecting more colors coming soon.</li>
            <li> I love the Maybelline Color Tattoos, they are amazing as a base for powder eye shadows or on their own because they have great pigmentation. I have all of the regular colors &amp; now all but one of the Limited Edition colors. The Fuchsia Fever is beautiful! I can even use a liner brush and use it as an eyeliner as well. These are very similar to MAC Paint Pots at a fraction of the cost. Definitely recommend trying them!!!</li>
            <li> this is a long lasting product, I love it.  I will tell my friends about it so they can try it. it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I got this eyeshadow yesterday and LOVE THE COLOR!.  And even though some reviews say it don&#x27;t last or creases, I have to say after a whole day out running errand&#x27;s this eyeshadow stayed on and looked fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I usually always wore urban decay or Too faced and their shades are around $17.  And  this Maybelline color tattoo worked just as good!!.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was in no form or fashion, fuchsia. The consistency was extremely poor as well. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but it&#x27;s more PURPLE than anything. It&#x27;s still a great color, but I was expecting more pink-ish than purple.</li>
            <li> I have never used the color tattoo eyeshadow. I ordered this because of the reviews, and the vibrant color. It did take a while to ship, but it arrived identical to how its shown. I am very pleased with this color.</li>
            <li> The picture does not match the product I received. I was expecting a hot pink color and instead received a purple eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Its creamy, smooth and the colors are fairly solid. Nothing to spill and it comes in a nice glass jar too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color fast service.</li>
            <li> VIBRANT COLOR.  LONG WEARING.</li>
