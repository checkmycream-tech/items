            <li>I love this ver creamy texture.</li>
            <li>but I sure do like it.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, not a knock off, and a great value.</li>
            <li>If synthetic and allergen ingredients are okay with you, this is the lotion to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are more, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does sink in very quickly and the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic moisturize for any time of the day.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the cream</li>
            <li>A friend gave me some as a gift, and it is the best lotion ever,so when I ran out decided to buy the gallon bottle and just refill my small one</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh, and the moisturizer works.</li>
            <li>We love it so much that I just bought a gallon for each of us.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to use specially this winter time my skin gets so dry .</li>
            <li>Always my fav lotion and no paraben!&lt;br /&gt;parabens cause hot flashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth your  money .</li>
            <li>I am allergic to something in this cream and am now stuck with a gallon worth.</li>
            <li>Over many years I have just about every lotion you can think of to keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my soft skin</li>
            <li>I like to apply it right after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on skin, but soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Not as natural as I&#x27;d like it to be, the lotion feels a bit filmy and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this was at my sister&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I bought a smaller version of this cream that did not have pomegranate, so I thought I would be ok up sizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for getting it to me in one piece.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other products that work about as well as this one...</li>
            <li>I live in the mountains and my sister lives in the desert</li>
            <li>Buying it by the gallon is much cheaper than buying individual bottles of it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed a lot of lotion in the past but this autumn &amp; winter my skin has required more moisturizing than previously.  </li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I apply this only once in the morning because it keeps my skin hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> I have tried the expensive ones and the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Even if you have tried the other Hempz products and didn&#x27;t like them this one is different.</li>
            <li> The lotion is the&amp;#34;bomb&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just what you need for dry skin and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Hands started getting soft, no more meds.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream gave me a full body rash.</li>
            <li> Red Dye 33- contains a small amount of lead&lt;</li>
            <li> I plan on recommending this or other hempz products to friends.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong, was the pump was too short to reach the bottom......</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help, within a few min.</li>
            <li> She had a small bottle of it .</li>
            <li> Cold climate weather makes my skin very dry, this products seals in the moisture.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a spring chicken</li>
            <li> Bought this for daughter had real bad hands, even meds.</li>

            <li> Not as natural as I&#x27;d like it to be, the lotion feels a bit filmy and the smell is strong. It does sink in very quickly and the smell goes away. I&#x27;ll have it for the next year but I would probably try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Always my fav lotion and no paraben!&lt;br /&gt;parabens cause hot flashes!</li>
            <li> I have the driest skin and this body lotion is the best I&#x27;ve found ever.  Hempz Pomegranate Herbal Body Moisturizer Lotion makes life bearable without itching constantly.  The fact it smells amazing is the best bonus ever.  I love the chance to buy it in a gallon bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. A friend gave me some as a gift, and it is the best lotion ever,so when I ran out decided to buy the gallon bottle and just refill my small one, the only problem is , is that my four daughters have discovered it:( oh well just have to buy more :). Also so impressed with how fast it shipped, will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I love  love  love this lotion , that bought 2 more gallons and end up giving it one to my daughter . She told me that she is loving it too. It&#x27;s good to use specially this winter time my skin gets so dry . It&#x27;s worth your  money .</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this was at my sister&#x27;s. She had a small bottle of it . The scent is light and fresh, and the moisturizer works. I later bought a gallon and split it with my sister. We love it so much that I just bought a gallon for each of us.  I live in the mountains and my sister lives in the desert so we both need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion. Love it.  I buy it all the time in the gallon size.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic moisturize for any time of the day. Got it with no problems and will definately get it when it runs out again.Thanks for getting it to me in one piece.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong, was the pump was too short to reach the bottom......</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and will be needing more soon. The only lotion that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. Even if you have tried the other Hempz products and didn&#x27;t like them this one is different. I have tried 3 different kinds of Hempz tell I found this one.</li>
            <li> Great lotion - quickly delivery thank you</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, refreshing product. I like to apply it right after a shower or bath. So all in all I would say I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the cream an the shipments was awesome</li>
            <li> I love this ver creamy texture. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The lotion is the&amp;#34;bomb&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s just what you need for dry skin and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size bottle before buying a gallon.  I haven&#x27;t needed a lot of lotion in the past but this autumn &amp; winter my skin has required more moisturizing than previously.  This does the job, I like the fragrance and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Great product, well made....used it for over 5 years and like it a lot. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on skin, but soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I apply this only once in the morning because it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. by far this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for daughter had real bad hands, even meds. From dr. Didn&#x27;t help, within a few min. Hands started getting soft, no more meds. And everybody from work is hooked on it</li>
            <li> Love  the scent! Skin feels softer too.-Gena</li>
            <li> just as described and on time delivery</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream gave me a full body rash. I bought a smaller version of this cream that did not have pomegranate, so I thought I would be ok up sizing. I am allergic to something in this cream and am now stuck with a gallon worth.</li>
            <li> Cold climate weather makes my skin very dry, this products seals in the moisture.  the pomegranate fragrance is so pleasing, it doesnt wash away or have a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Over many years I have just about every lotion you can think of to keep my skin soft. I have tried the expensive ones and the cheap ones. Nothing worked until I discover Hempz lotion. It contains hemp oil which is the best on the planet. The pomegranate smell is so pleasant that even my husband likes it for his work worn hands. He drives semi and hooks and unhooks trailers all day in the weather. I get many compliments on my soft skin and I&#x27;m not a spring chicken, I&#x27;ll be 70 next August. I recommend it for anyone who wants to keep skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;Sue Stone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other products that work about as well as this one...but I sure do like it.</li>
            <li> Buying it by the gallon is much cheaper than buying individual bottles of it.  I simply refill my bottles as needed from the gallon jug.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, not a knock off, and a great value. By the way, it comes with a pump so there isn&#x27;t a need to buy one.</li>
            <li> If synthetic and allergen ingredients are okay with you, this is the lotion to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hempz Pomegranate Herbal Body Moisturizer contains:&lt;br /&gt;-  Hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde : a synthetic fragrance listed as a known allergen that can cause allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;- Red Dye 33- contains a small amount of lead&lt;br /&gt;- Benzyl Salicylate; a solvent on the restricted list by the International Fragrance Association.&lt;br /&gt;- Propylene Glycol: studies show people with skin issues like eczema will react to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Phenoxyethanol: The Food and Drug Administration has warned that the chemical is toxic to infants&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is shameful that a company can put the words &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; &amp;#34;100% pure&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vegan&amp;#34; on their bottles, and yet have the audacity to use ingredients such as these.</li>
            <li> I plan on recommending this or other hempz products to friends. My husband also uses this and is very satisfied with it.</li>
