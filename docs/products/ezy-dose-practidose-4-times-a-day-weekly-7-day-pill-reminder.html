            <li>This vitamin box is perfect for me because I take vitamins 4 times per day.  </li>
            <li>This is the best organizer I have had for my needs</li>

            <li>I have tried many pill organizers and this one is perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try to carry a day&#x27;s pills around with me, so the fact that these aren&#x27;t removable is, if anything, a good feature because they don&#x27;t come out of the box when you don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
            <li>Good for pills which are taken between meals since it has 4 pockets for each day.</li>
            <li>and we are good to go for the week.</li>
            <li>This is a good pill holder.  </li>

            <li>This Organizer really is nice.</li>
            <li>This item is a very good pill box, easy to load, easy to use, easy to see if you have taken or missed a dose..</li>
            <li>Over the years I think have tried every organizer ever made -- and finally I found this -- which is  perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>perfectly (even more pills could be added it is so big).</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>bought this for my sister who has MS and takes many meds.  </li>
            <li>Helps to make sure he is taking the correct pills at the correct time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my arthritic hands deep holders easy to get pills out</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good mileage for an item in this price range.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get my medications on time and to keep track of that I took them.</li>
            <li>Easy for me to fill for him and easy for him to see pills and access them.</li>
            <li>I had found at a Good Will Store (new) for a couple dollars.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size box for those of us who take lots of supplements/pills, but you have to tip the whole tray over to get out your dose</li>
            <li>I can fit all my prescription meds into a normal-size pill container, but I take a lot of supplements and they just don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They all just fit with room for the lid to slide across.</li>
            <li>I think my first one lasted over 3 years - maybe more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase more, as I like to have 3 or 4 weeks ready at a time.</li>
            <li>Great pill organizer, as easy to fill and compartments are large enough for pretty much any collection of pills/vitamins - like fish oil, niacin capsules, etc.</li>
            <li>The clear sliding access panels \\&quot;locked\\&quot; and were easy to view contents.  </li>
            <li>Well, you can fit more into these compartments than into two of almost any other.</li>
            <li>I have to take 36 pills a day and the regular pill carriers can&#x27;t hold that many pills.  </li>
            <li>The entire thing goes in the dishwasher but put the insert on the top shelf.  </li>
            <li>I love the big pill box.</li>
            <li>I am on many medications and take multiple supplements.  </li>
            <li>and I mean ALL of my pills fit nicely into the roomy slots.  </li>
            <li>It has been used multiple times in traveling as I keep the drug store copy of my renewals with the box and was easy for clearing security in flights.  </li>
            <li>It is rather large but holds all my supplements and Rx drugs.</li>
            <li>Too large..too large..too large.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are 4 slots per day as there are some pills one takes on an empty stomach.</li>
            <li>After searching for a pill minder to fit a weekly 4-times a day medication/supplement \\&quot;habit\\&quot;, I came across this one at the local Walgreens.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to bring two of the smaller carriers or bottles of pills that don&#x27;t fit into the container.  </li>
            <li>If you only stuffed the compartment with fish oil capsules, I think you&#x27;d fit 6, maybe</li>
            <li>You can open one cell at a time or to fill it you can open the whole top.  </li>
            <li>This product is large enough and handles 7 days worth of pills.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, and worth it to have all the space this tray provides.</li>
            <li>big enough so that I can easily see the pills.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps necessary for the large compartments, but it really is bulky.</li>
            <li>Each day has a transparent slider on top that you can open only as far as you want to, so for your morning stuff, you&#x27;d slide it own one notch, next dose, down further etc.  </li>
            <li>take 3 fish oil-sized capsules, a multivitamin, and many other smaller prescription and OTC pills.</li>
            <li>It is easy for her to get into - even on days when she is having trouble with her hands.  </li>
            <li>Large enough to store my medications for two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is the large packaging.</li>
            <li>Sent back was too large</li>
            <li>#34;how much will fit in each compartment?&amp;#34; but it is hard to quantify that since everyone&#x27;s pill load is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bigger then expected , but gives you extra room for more vitamins .</li>
            <li>As someone who takes a large number of pills several times daily I have become somewhat of an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; on medication organizers.  </li>
            <li>BUT... the whole big entire lid is hinged, so you need not deal with the slider -</li>
            <li>Actually I just purchased a new one because I managed to break my old one which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this pill organizer for several years and finally had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a space in my little apartment for anything that large!</li>
            <li>So very frequently pills from other days/times spill out and it screws up on my box and schedule.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pills, especially vitamin supplements have gotten larger over the years and it is very difficult to find pill holders to contain them. This product is large enough and handles 7 days worth of pills. I love that there are 4 slots per day as there are some pills one takes on an empty stomach. This gives me a way to identify these and simplify my mornings.</li>
            <li> After searching for a pill minder to fit a weekly 4-times a day medication/supplement \\&quot;habit\\&quot;, I came across this one at the local Walgreens. Pros: all, and I mean ALL of my pills fit nicely into the roomy slots.  The clear sliding access panels \\&quot;locked\\&quot; and were easy to view contents.  The Cons:  The pill tray is one unit, so no sliding just one days&#x27; pills in your pocket to take with you.  With the single long plastic panel per days&#x27; pills, if you skip a earlier dose, trying to retrieve JUST the next dose without spilling the previous one is irksome and difficult.    I wish they would make a 7 day, 4-times a day pill minder that had compartments approximately 2 x 2 inches AND also a days&#x27; worth of pills were in a removable pillminder.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size box for those of us who take lots of supplements/pills, but you have to tip the whole tray over to get out your dose (if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t dig in the slots with your fingers).  So very frequently pills from other days/times spill out and it screws up on my box and schedule.</li>
            <li> I can fit all my prescription meds into a normal-size pill container, but I take a lot of supplements and they just don&#x27;t fit. Well, you can fit more into these compartments than into two of almost any other. Three, on a lot of them. I could wish they had separate lids per compartment instead of a sliding one for every day, but that&#x27;s a minor flaw. I don&#x27;t try to carry a day&#x27;s pills around with me, so the fact that these aren&#x27;t removable is, if anything, a good feature because they don&#x27;t come out of the box when you don&#x27;t want them to. I did have to label the days of the week on the inside, since they didn&#x27;t come that way. Wasn&#x27;t hard to do, though.</li>
            <li> This vitamin box is perfect for me because I take vitamins 4 times per day.  Plenty of room in each compartment, bought a second one so I would not run out of vitamns on trips, and allows me to bring out the bottles only once every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my arthritic hands deep holders easy to get pills out</li>
            <li> Large enough to store my medications for two weeks at a time. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my son to help him organized his medication.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it</li>
            <li> As someone who takes a large number of pills several times daily I have become somewhat of an &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; on medication organizers.  Over the years I think have tried every organizer ever made -- and finally I found this -- which is  perfect for my needs.  Actually I just purchased a new one because I managed to break my old one which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of years on a daily basis.  That&#x27;s pretty good mileage for an item in this price range.  I like it for its size -- big enough so that I can easily see the pills.  Some reviewers have mentioned that they have a problem getting the pills out of the compartments (especially if they have arthritis, etc.).  I just use a small spoon to scoop the medications out.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this for years.  I have to take 36 pills a day and the regular pill carriers can&#x27;t hold that many pills.  As I travel a lot, this holds each daily times for pills perfectly (even more pills could be added it is so big). When the say oversized, they really mean it.  It fits into my travel bag and I don&#x27;t have to bring two of the smaller carriers or bottles of pills that don&#x27;t fit into the container.  I wish I would have found this container years ago.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get my medications on time and to keep track of that I took them.</li>
            <li> This is convenient to use and convenient to fill. It is rather large but holds all my supplements and Rx drugs. I have some drugs to be taken at bedtime which I was having trouble separating these from the dinner pills. Now I get my bedtime drugs as prescribed. Good for pills which are taken between meals since it has 4 pockets for each day. This is the best organizer I have had for my needs and I have tried many. Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice pill organizer.  It&#x27;s heavy  hard plastic that looks like it might break fairly easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pill organizer for several years and finally had to buy a new one.  I use it for my morning pills and do a month at a time so I don&#x27;t have to think about it every morning.  The entire thing goes in the dishwasher but put the insert on the top shelf.  I even bought my sister one of these.  I think my first one lasted over 3 years - maybe more.</li>
            <li> I ordered my husband this BIG pill box as he did not find satisfaction with any pill box he bought. I have one like it I had found at a Good Will Store (new) for a couple dollars. I love the big pill box. I offered it to him but he didn&#x27;t want it. After he had been through a number of pill boxes he started coveting my pill box (I&#x27;m not giving up my pill box). In defense I went online searching for one just like mine; we take a lot of supplements plus some medications. Now we are both happy. The compartments are roomy and I set up a week at a time. My husband takes his pills twice a day regardless so he sets his up for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Neatest pill box for seniors who need to maintain daily medications.  We refill them weekly which takes about 10 minutes and we are good to go for the week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s, like, The Beast of all pill boxes. I&#x27;m a believer in dietary supplements and am very glad to have found an organizer that fits everything I take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like anyone looking for a big pillbox, I wanted to know &amp;#34;how much will fit in each compartment?&amp;#34; but it is hard to quantify that since everyone&#x27;s pill load is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take 3 fish oil-sized capsules, a multivitamin, and many other smaller prescription and OTC pills. They all just fit with room for the lid to slide across. If you only stuffed the compartment with fish oil capsules, I think you&#x27;d fit 6, maybe 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not clear how this box worked until I got it.  Each day has a transparent slider on top that you can open only as far as you want to, so for your morning stuff, you&#x27;d slide it own one notch, next dose, down further etc.  This only sucks if you forgot your previous dose - then the slider will have to open down to the second dose and you end up dumping out TWO doses.  BUT... the whole big entire lid is hinged, so you need not deal with the slider - you just open the case and dig out what you need if you don&#x27;t want to dump out your previous unused dose. Not a big deal, and worth it to have all the space this tray provides. And since that big lid is hinged, it makes filling this thing a breeze... no more opening and closing multiple teeny lids.</li>
            <li> This is a good pill holder.  You can open one cell at a time or to fill it you can open the whole top.  It works great and holds a lot of pills.</li>
            <li> This item is a very good pill box, easy to load, easy to use, easy to see if you have taken or missed a dose..</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.  I take a lot of supplements and this holds them.  I&#x27;m going to purchase more, as I like to have 3 or 4 weeks ready at a time.</li>
            <li> Had one of these for myself but my husband needed one too. Great product; easy to fill and to dispense. As a tip, use a little spoon to scoop out the pills instead of trying to flip the whole box in case one of the little slide cases is not shut completely tight. Keeps you from having to pick up tiny pills that dispensed too soon!</li>
            <li> Too large..too large..too large.  This is not what I needed and so I returned it.  I don&#x27;t have a space in my little apartment for anything that large!</li>
            <li> Great pill organizer, as easy to fill and compartments are large enough for pretty much any collection of pills/vitamins - like fish oil, niacin capsules, etc. Only drawback is the large packaging. Perhaps necessary for the large compartments, but it really is bulky. I also tried the [[ASIN:B001AIS2OC Ezy Dose Four-a-day Weekly Maxi-pharmadose Medication Organizer]] but it was too small, and also had very bulky packaging.</li>
            <li> Sent back was too large</li>
            <li> I have tried many pill organizers and this one is perfect for my needs.  This is a repeat order as I had one before and broke it after multiple dropping (my fault due to my medical disablity)  I am on many medications and take multiple supplements.  I use mine a bit differently since I don&#x27;t need to need to take several times a day -  I fill each compartment with the same medication and label the tops.  This keeps at least a month worth of my meds handy each day and I keep my medical information at the bottom of the box in case of emergency.  It has been used multiple times in traveling as I keep the drug store copy of my renewals with the box and was easy for clearing security in flights.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> bought this for my sister who has MS and takes many meds.  It is easy for her to get into - even on days when she is having trouble with her hands.  It also keeps pills contained if she drops the box.  Sturdy construction.  Lots of space for someone who has multiple pills per day.  Helps the confused or forgetful person remember if they have or have not taken their pills.</li>
            <li> My husband has to take several pills a day and needs help knowing which and went to take them. This Organizer really is nice. Easy for me to fill for him and easy for him to see pills and access them. Helps to make sure he is taking the correct pills at the correct time.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for over 13 years and left it by the oven by mistake and melted the end of it. I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find another one like it. Very pleased I was able to!</li>
            <li> just what i needed and does the trick for my vitamins</li>
            <li> Bigger then expected , but gives you extra room for more vitamins .</li>
