            <li>My mom used this product, she truly had beautiful skin because of this product and she lived in Puerto Rico.</li>
            <li>and it has been very effective.</li>
            <li>It works good though it takes some time.</li>
            <li>Good product.thank you</li>
            <li>The results are great, although the texture of the cream could be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased w</li>
            <li>It is sooooo much more affordable than anything else out there and in my opinion, much more effective!</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery, A++++</li>
            <li>I have olive skin that scars easily, but I saw results from this product within days.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly, it is important to use it together with the night cream.  </li>
            <li>The best of similar products I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>You must continue to use the product to keep seeing the results but that is true of all of the over-the-counter products.</li>
            <li>Porcelana is a very good product, my brown spots are disappearing, albeit slowly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>is 1% higher than Porcelana&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so I started using Porcelana on my my inner thighs, underarms, elbows and any place where I had a scar more frequently.</li>
            <li>Dark spots are actually more clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried using many of the new and expensive products out there for lightening skin spots and none of them work anywhere near as well as good old Porcelana.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for anyone who wants to lighten/fade and completely wipe out any sign of a scar on your skin.</li>
            <li>For more effectiveness... Make sure your wash your face before applying it and always apply thin layers!!</li>
            <li>the key to anything you want to do in life is to be CONSISTENT...</li>
            <li>I have used other products that were more expensive but we&#x27;re not as effective as this one.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It does not have any strong smell, so that will not be disturbing.</li>

            <li> Certainly not an overnight thing.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it worked well on dark circles under my eyes, but that &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; seemed to not come back after using this Porcelana.  </li>
            <li> I have been reviewing Nadinola Fade Cream and the active ingredient</li>

            <li> My mom used this product, she truly had beautiful skin because of this product and she lived in Puerto Rico.</li>
            <li> Did not impress me at all.  Would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> Porcelana is a very good product, my brown spots are disappearing, albeit slowly. I have used other products that were more expensive but we&#x27;re not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this before. It works good though it takes some time. Certainly not an overnight thing. All and all Im happywith the product and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are actually more clear.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have any strong smell, so that will not be disturbing. For more effectiveness... Make sure your wash your face before applying it and always apply thin layers!! Use an extra uv protection.</li>
            <li> I have been trying lots of skin lightening/melasma creams and anti-aging creams and this one is a winner for my skin.  I have olive skin that scars easily, but I saw results from this product within days.  It is sooooo much more affordable than anything else out there and in my opinion, much more effective!</li>
            <li> I have tried using many of the new and expensive products out there for lightening skin spots and none of them work anywhere near as well as good old Porcelana. You must continue to use the product to keep seeing the results but that is true of all of the over-the-counter products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as a hand cream for deep cracks around my&lt;br /&gt;nails and it has been very effective.</li>
            <li> Good product.thank you</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, A++++</li>
            <li> used it for 3 months along with the night cream and don&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t see a difference. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Have tried this product for several weeks.  Does not perform as per company&#x27;s claims.  This was a waste of my  money.  Karl</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it worked well on dark circles under my eyes, but that &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; seemed to not come back after using this Porcelana.  I also used it for freckles on my face.  Now, it seems to be lightening age spots, although not working as well as I had remembered.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again but it&#x27;s just probably my age.</li>
            <li> I bought the day and night. I like this brand than the others. Its a gradual effect but it works.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad allergic reaction with this product, similar to the effects of poison ivy. If you buy this, try it in a small area of your skin first. It took 2 or 3 days for my skin to show the allergic reaction. Couldn&#x27;t tell if this product works or not because I discontinued using it after 3 days.</li>
            <li> This product helps with fading acne scars and age spots use under makeup sparingly it will clog pores the product is thick but you will see results</li>
            <li> The best of similar products I have tried so far. It works perfectly, it is important to use it together with the night cream.  The results are great, although the texture of the cream could be better.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product when I wanted to have something to deal with my acne scars after a terrible outbreak. It felt heavy on my skin... so a lil dab of this thick cream goes a long way. I finshed on jar and bought another. I started out using it on my fade once in ahile but have recently began using the 2nd jar on my body. I&#x27;m constantly on YouTube and Amazon reading up on products and customer reviews.... and I knew that I had some areas on my body which were discolored that I wanted to work on. the key to anything you want to do in life is to be CONSISTENT... so I started using Porcelana on my my inner thighs, underarms, elbows and any place where I had a scar more frequently. I&#x27;m very pleased w my underarm progressed... I have been reviewing Nadinola Fade Cream and the active ingredient is 1% higher than Porcelana&#x27;s so guess what I will be buying next? This jar goes a long way. and I recommend it for anyone who wants to lighten/fade and completely wipe out any sign of a scar on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my elbows, it seems as though it will take forever to brighten them up to match my arms! I use this product daily, over two months time I have noticed a difference.  I would reccommend this product to someone else, however again I use it on my elbows, on a different part of the body it may produce a different effect.</li>
