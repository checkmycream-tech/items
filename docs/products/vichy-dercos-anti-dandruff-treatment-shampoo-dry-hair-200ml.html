            <li>So far this worked the best.</li>
            <li>This shampoo work like magic.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but I&#x27;m just glad that it works</li>

            <li>I am sure it works for others just not me.  </li>

            <li>Great product I would recommend it for anyone who has dry hair and dandruff</li>
            <li>had tried many already - they either make you hair greasy or itchy, or you have to apply very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Vichy shampoo and the fact that was shipped so fast .</li>
            <li>The seller was extremely professional, emailed me right after I did the payment to confirm that the package will be shipped and followed up with me to make sure that I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>This product good for dry hair and within two weeks it made a huge difference on me.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I have struggled with dandruff for many years, mostly in the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I started to notice mild dandruff, so it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cure\\&quot; dandruff.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>Only it does dry your hair as all medicated shampoos, but if you use a good conditioning afterwards it is OK.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s related to my dad&#x27;s psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Vichy shampoo is the only thing that works and works fine.</li>
            <li>expensive but a very good product...</li>
            <li>it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used many different products ranging from Head and Shoulders, to Garnier, and even some salon brands, but this product is the only one that has worked out for me.</li>
            <li>I have mild scalp psoriasis and have dealt with the issue of dandruff for far too long, but since the first wash, I could immediately see results.</li>
            <li>My skin was completely coming out from my head, and it was itchy, I went so many times different doctors in different countries, but the shampoos they advised did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I tried many other anti dandruff shampoos but this is the only one which really helps me to fight my skin problems.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li>My granddaughter introduced me to this product as we both have the same problem with dry scalp - it is very helpful and not hard on the hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps dandruff at bay like no other.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks I could tell there was a major difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the \\&quot;magical secret ingredient\\</li>
            <li>, the itching also stayed, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete success, however it wasn&#x27;t a complete failure either.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why it has worked so much better for me than other shampoos, but it has done well for me.</li>
            <li>A++&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try for those having trouble with flakes!</li>

            <li> Head&amp;shoulders and all that stuff don&#x27;t even come close to this when it comes to maintenance of scalp for a long, long while.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time it removes all of my dandruff, just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> Just another product to add to the long list of things I have tried to heal my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks and its already working I have a really dry scalp and this just did it!</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The smell took a little while to get used to as it&#x27;s almost metalic and hard to describe, but I prefer it over fruity florals.</li>
            <li> Has Salycilic Acid and Pyrithione Zinc which are common in shampoos in the US.</li>

            <li> Best shampoo that I have used</li>
            <li> Really impressed with how effective this has been for me. I will be ordering it again. Has Salycilic Acid and Pyrithione Zinc which are common in shampoos in the US. I am not sure why it has worked so much better for me than other shampoos, but it has done well for me.</li>
            <li> I tried many other anti dandruff shampoos but this is the only one which really helps me to fight my skin problems. Good experience.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! One-two times used and I saw results!</li>
            <li> It worked good for me , my dandruff is gone :) #happy</li>
            <li> This product is my saviour. After many treatment solutions that continued to disappoint me, this one was able to easily prevail. I have mild scalp psoriasis and have dealt with the issue of dandruff for far too long, but since the first wash, I could immediately see results.

            <li> This shampoo is great I have used this for a long time it removes all of my dandruff, just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for 8 years now and is the best. I can&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I have struggled with dandruff for many years, mostly in the back of my head. I had read good reviews about it on another website and decided to give it a try. I used it for a couple weeks and although it did thin out my dandruff it didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely, the itching also stayed, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete success, however it wasn&#x27;t a complete failure either. I really liked how it lathered and the smell of it too, Overall it seems like a good choice of shampoo who has light dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect product and it really is a solution for the dandruff problem. This product good for dry hair and within two weeks it made a huge difference on me.</li>
            <li> I used this product when my dandruff problems went really serious. My skin was completely coming out from my head, and it was itchy, I went so many times different doctors in different countries, but the shampoos they advised did not work for me. After around one month therapy with this product, I solved my problem finally. During one month, you have to wash your hair with only this product  and you will see at the end of one month, you will solve your dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried Head and Shoulders, Neutragena T/Gel, Selsun Blue, just to name a few and nothing quite worked. Within two weeks I could tell there was a major difference. Now, about 3 months after I started using this stuff, I don&#x27;t have a problem. I went a week without using it I started to notice mild dandruff, so it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cure\\&quot; dandruff.</li>
            <li> expensive but a very good product...</li>
            <li> Product came open, without the box and tape everywhere. I have been buying this product for years and this is really not what I expected</li>
            <li> The product was recommended to me by a friend and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried many already - they either make you hair greasy or itchy, or you have to apply very often.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is fine if used once in a while. Cleans well, smells good, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Two weeks and its already working I have a really dry scalp and this just did it! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything from head and shoulders to T-Gel. So far this worked the best. If you don&#x27;t want to flake you might want to try this.</li>
            <li> Shipped from Greece but it only took four business days. Labeling in English and Greek. Distributed by the Canadian subsidiary of Roche.</li>
            <li> Had problems with itchy scalp and dandruff. Pretty sure it&#x27;s related to my dad&#x27;s psoriasis. Vichy shampoo is the only thing that works and works fine. With prolonged result (at least 1 year in my case). Used it once in a while for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the only product that actually treats my dandruff. I have used many different products ranging from Head and Shoulders, to Garnier, and even some salon brands, but this product is the only one that has worked out for me. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the \\&quot;magical secret ingredient\\&quot; but I&#x27;m just glad that it works and I&#x27;m not allergic to it or anything.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to help however it does smell nice and left my hair feeling good. Might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is only one shampoo which helped me and I strongly recommend to use if you want to get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love the Vichy shampoo and the fact that was shipped so fast . The seller was extremely professional, emailed me right after I did the payment to confirm that the package will be shipped and followed up with me to make sure that I am satisfied with the product.The shampoo is extremely good, I am using it for a couple of years now and I cannot be more satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend Parapharmacy to everybody !</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  I was so hoping it would.  Just another product to add to the long list of things I have tried to heal my scalp.  Made my scalp feel extremely tight and uncomfortable.  I am sure it works for others just not me.  The shipping and the seller were great though.</li>
            <li> Only it does dry your hair as all medicated shampoos, but if you use a good conditioning afterwards it is OK. Otherwise it does help to control my dandruff.</li>
