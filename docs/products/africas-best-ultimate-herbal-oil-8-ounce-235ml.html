            <li>I have a dry friz hair problem and since I started using this product my hair looks and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dry skin and feet.  </li>
            <li>but it really does a good job for massages.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and absorbs very quickly.     </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell to it</li>
            <li>any of these oils alone sell for a lot more, so i&#x27;m not sure how this product manages to be so affordable, but it&#x27;s great that it is!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve found that it works very well for cleansing in this manor, because it has a great blend of many different essential oils and extracts which are all very good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>It still has the same great smell and feel.</li>
            <li>i use light shampoos.</li>
            <li>Good for Natural hair and can be used on skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I have not noticed any more hair growth than normal, I still love this oil...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil is great for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent and helped my dry cuticles and hands.</li>
            <li>, the skin on my feet are so soft and nice.</li>
            <li>it seems to work especially well when I use this product in the mornings along with a good cocoa butter based moisturizer at night</li>
            <li>It adds strength to the strands, a nice layer of protection, like a bonding action to the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>castor oil, the sweet almond oil is a hair and scalp stimulator.</li>
            <li>It has a mild herbal smell to it.</li>
            <li>a strong level of elasticity and this oil does this very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients, the function and the smell!</li>
            <li>Keeps it smooth and non-frizzy without adding too much oil.     </li>
            <li>I order this product for my natural hair and it is ok.</li>
            <li>It has all the natural oils most people tend to look for without an oz of mineral oil or petrolatum involved.  </li>
            <li>it just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I disagree that it smells like baby oil, and   love the way it makes my skin so soft.   </li>
            <li>I have been dealing with dry and brittle loc&#x27;s and Africas Best Ultimate Herbal Oil has really helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li>Besides all this, the sweet herbal scent is very comforting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Avocado Oil is rich, warm and less nutty.  </li>
            <li>this company certainly has a dedicated customer in me now!</li>
            <li>i use it like hot treatement oil or for my body.</li>
            <li>I use it for hot oil treatments and for sealing moisture.</li>
            <li>It does have a &amp;#34;baby oil-esque&amp;#34; fragrance, but I think African Pride smells better.</li>
            <li>A bit oily when first applied.</li>
            <li>I recently melted some shea butter in it for more moisture.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth going on and has a light sweet smell which is hard to describe.</li>
            <li>you already know, I scooped that up real quik ;).</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m not very clear on which I like best, but this product is DEFINIETLY one of few I can call my favorite for a few reasons</li>
            <li>hair reacts very well to this product.</li>
            <li>But the real treat is for my shoulders and</li>
            <li>My barber wanted to know why I had so much hair at 62.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really thought that I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>oiling your skin and hair with healthy oils such as the ones found in this herbal oil, are like polishing up old leather shoes...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in my bath yet as it recommends for extra moisture, but I&#x27;m excited to give that a try as well.</li>
            <li>to get down to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and so do others.</li>
            <li>and it really does make my sking really soft, but it isn&#x27;t really herbal oil.</li>
            <li>Normally use after I wash or co-wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I got mine at Walmart and it was round $1.87 there. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my face for a few yrs now and many people have   </li>
            <li>I bought this oil based on another review that someone left that their keratosis pilaris started to clear up after using it, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m definitely not sorry that I did!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s light enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>product also seems to be very good for relieving regular dry patches of skin as well, as I&#x27;ve had really dry elbows my entire life and already the skin is starting to improve there as well...</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients are natural oils, that can be pronouced (big deal), and are recognizable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about three years</li>
            <li>Left my hair really shiny</li>
            <li>This oil works wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite fond of the scent as well, which is a bit like a soft baby powder smell.</li>
            <li>I found this in Walmart about 5 yrs ago and decided to try it since it   had all natural oils.</li>
            <li>Castor oil has properties which stimulates cellular action when it gets unto your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For people who uses frequent blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Virgin Olive oil (evoo) is a miracle oil.  </li>
            <li>It fades significantly after initial application and does not interfere with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li>It is not a black product, per se.</li>
            <li>my son has thick coarse strait hair and makes his hair more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for dry scalp and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Just purchased this at Dollar General for $2.35.</li>
            <li>The oil keeps my hair soft, frizz-free and my scalp dandruff-free (though regular washing helps).</li>
            <li>this oil really locks in the moisture, and it&#x27;s not greasy like other oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried natural, chemicals; I&#x27;ve switched shampoos dozens of times; I&#x27;ve gotten numerous prescription; but this is the only thing that has ever given me results!</li>

            <li> Castor oil has properties which stimulates cellular action when it gets unto your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For people who uses frequent blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Virgin Olive oil (evoo) is a miracle oil.  </li>
            <li> It fades significantly after initial application and does not interfere with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> It is not a black product, per se.</li>
            <li> my son has thick coarse strait hair and makes his hair more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for dry scalp and it worked very well.</li>

            <li> People would ask me what I use and some people would sniff my hair (for a long time).</li>

            <li> It’s not very oily either.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m also using it on my hands and knees, feet and elbows an everyday basis instead of lotion.</li>
            <li> I only stopped using it because I got tired of the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Castor oil has always been known to grow the hair but few people know why it works.  </li>

            <li> Some may not satisfied or about the smell, but the way I analyzed what&#x27;s been said, they probably applied it once (give it a try for 5-10 days) and then made comments afterwards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I order this product for my natural hair and it is ok. i use it like hot treatement oil or for my body. But i don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It has all the natural oils most people tend to look for without an oz of mineral oil or petrolatum involved.  You can use this product for several things.  I use it mostly for baths and it makes my skin feel good.  The only two things that are suspect in the item is the adding of fragrance (yet it&#x27;s the last thing on the list) and how it smells like baby powder.  Nevertheless if you are low on oils you have and don&#x27;t have the budget to get those, I would suggest picking this up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe seborrheic dermatitis for years, which is just a really bad type of dandruff. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it for anything! I&#x27;ve tried natural, chemicals; I&#x27;ve switched shampoos dozens of times; I&#x27;ve gotten numerous prescription; but this is the only thing that has ever given me results! I have such little dandruff now, that I hardly notice it at all! It&#x27;s a miracle cure!</li>
            <li> i have recently began using the &#x27;oil cleansing method&#x27; (google it!) for cleaning my face, and i was going to purchase castor seed oil (which is what is used for cleansing) when i found this product at walgreens.  this product has castor  oil listed as the 3rd ingredient.  i&#x27;ve found that it works very well for cleansing in this manor, because it has a great blend of many different essential oils and extracts which are all very good for the skin.  any of these oils alone sell for a lot more, so i&#x27;m not sure how this product manages to be so affordable, but it&#x27;s great that it is!  its a steal for such a versatile product.  i am also doing an overnight oil treatment for my hair tonight and am anxious to see the result tomorrow.  i&#x27;m not sure why oil has become such a bad thing in our culture lately, it is essential for healthy skin and hair.  if you strip it away, you basically turn into dried up old leather.  oiling your skin and hair with healthy oils such as the ones found in this herbal oil, are like polishing up old leather shoes... you will see the results instantly!    ps:  the smell is tolerable; it sort of smells like baby oil.</li>
            <li> worst service ever, i order this thing and never got it, i was charge and i havent got my money back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american and i have kinky-coily textured hair with low porosity and a tendency to be dry and frizzy. I&#x27;ve been natural for about three years and i&#x27;ve experimented with SEVERAL products, all different types and price ranges. As a result, I&#x27;m not very clear on which I like best, but this product is DEFINIETLY one of few I can call my favorite for a few reasons: the ingredients are good, the smell is plesant, and the price is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair reacts very well to this product. It has a healthy sheen, and retains moisture and length easier. I use it for hot oil treatments and for sealing moisture. And it&#x27;s light enough to use on a daily basis. I can&#x27;t say much more... I JUST LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Just purchased this at Dollar General for $2.35. Very smooth going on and has a light sweet smell which is hard to describe. Leaves my skin silky smooth and a little goes a long way. Contains 3 or 4 kinds of oil including soybean-olive and castor. Has Ginsing and Thyme. Excellent product. Great for your scalp hair and skin. Can also be used as a Bath oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil at target because I couldn&#x27;t find any jojoba oil for my hair. Little did I know it would solve one of my skin problems.     I put a little bit (palm smear amount) on my typically dry, course hair after I wash it. Keeps it smooth and non-frizzy without adding too much oil.     But the real treat is for my shoulders and back where I have keratosis pilaris. I&#x27;ve noticed the little clogged hair folicle bumps have slowly begin vanishing and the little dark spots are less noticable. This stuff seems to \\&quot;calm\\&quot; my skin down. The oil absorbs into my skin beautifully so I don&#x27;t have to worry about struggling with my hands behind my back for an even application. Its been a couple of weeks since using this stuff for that purpose and my skin is getting to be so smooth!!!    I&#x27;m also using it on my hands and knees, feet and elbows an everyday basis instead of lotion. It&#x27;s cheaper and absorbs very quickly.     Besides all this, the sweet herbal scent is very comforting. It fades significantly after initial application and does not interfere with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for dry scalp and it worked very well. But there was a surprise. Africa&#x27;s Best really boosted the effect of the Rogain I am using. My barber wanted to know why I had so much hair at 62. I told her what I was doing. now she has told every one that she sees about it. Don&#x27;t let the odd smell turn you off to it. It is really good stuff and I use it every day. It is inexpensive too. I have to get a hair cut more often now, but I don&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10/12 Good news, the newer product has a better smell to it that you almost don&#x27;t notice. So it is better than ever now. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This oil has the thickness of mineral oil and the fragrance of baby oil.   You will smell like baby oil (nice smell) during the day if you apply this oil after showering.</li>
            <li> Smells like baby oil which is a turn off for me because I would never apply baby oil to my hair.Left my hair really shiny but that&#x27;s about it.Nothing spectacular probably will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this product. It smells just wonderful, and I like how it is practically organic. No petrolatum or mineral oils in it at all. No it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;make your hair grow\\&quot; but it does help to keep it shiny and healthy in order to facilitate growth. It&#x27;s now the only oil product I will use for my hair.  It&#x27;s also very good moisturizer for the skin, too.  I put a little on my feet then put on cotton socks and in the morning, the skin on my feet are so soft and nice. So I recommend it...definitely.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and helped my dry cuticles and hands. Also used for my dry scalp, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help....</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and I have to say that the ingredients are so simple that anyone can make this oil. It has a smell like baby oil and it really does make my sking really soft, but it isn&#x27;t really herbal oil. The oonly thing herbal about it is the Ginseng. It&#x27;s alright since it just $3.</li>
            <li> I have a dry friz hair problem and since I started using this product my hair looks and feels wonderful. I like to use it after I wash and dry my hair with a towel, (Damp hair)It doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feel and it seems my hair absorb it which is great. It has a mild herbal smell to it. I use it on my children&#x27;s hair. my son has thick coarse strait hair and makes his hair more manageable and soft.  I 100% recommend it, and with the price it is a win win situation.</li>
            <li> I discovered this out of curiosity, due to the advertised properties.  I use this for scalp treatment after shaving my head as well as a body oil.  I guess this falls under the category of body wash/shampoo hybrids: an all-in-one product for multiple uses.  I like it!</li>
            <li> **I have extremely oily skin, so I can&#x27;t apply it topically. This review is for hair care only**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I have not noticed any more hair growth than normal, I still love this oil...I have thick curly African-type hair, but this oil was recommended to me by a white woman with straight medium textured hair. You can use this for all hair types and that is a bonus to me! I use this oil to moisturize my scalp and to add shine to my hair. I apply the oil from root to tip and a little goes a long way. I use the [[ASIN:B000EZU8IU Tolco Empty Applicator Bottle with Slant Tip 8 oz.]] to get down to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and so do others. People would ask me what I use and some people would sniff my hair (for a long time). It does have a &amp;#34;baby oil-esque&amp;#34; fragrance, but I think African Pride smells better. I love the natural ingredients, the function and the smell! The oil keeps my hair soft, frizz-free and my scalp dandruff-free (though regular washing helps). I will continue to buy this oil as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It arrived timely and intact.  This is the best product for dry skin and feet.  Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;Africa&amp;#34; scare you. It is not a black product, per se. Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Smells to me a bit like baby powder. Good for Natural hair and can be used on skin. A bit oily when first applied.</li>
            <li> I use to use this some time ago and decided to revisit using it. It still has the same great smell and feel.</li>
            <li> This oil works wonders for my natural hair. All of the ingredients are natural oils, that can be pronouced (big deal), and are recognizable. When I use this oil, I know that I am doing a great thing for my hair. It keeps it moisturizes longer and gives it a great texture. I tend to use it after wetting/dampening my hair. Or I will just rub it through my scalp and the ends of my hair. I will not be without this oil. Try it, you may love it too!</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t fail me! Normally use after I wash or co-wash my hair. Applying to hair while wet after  styling gel and leave in conditioner but before flat twist. Once my hair is dry it&#x27;s not frizzy I can style it does not feel crunchy. This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil based on another review that someone left that their keratosis pilaris started to clear up after using it, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m definitely not sorry that I did! While I can&#x27;t speak of how it&#x27;d work on the face, I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and already I&#x27;m seeing results on my upper arms and shoulders. The dry bumps that are usually there have already disappeared almost completely, and the redness is even starting to fade... it seems to work especially well when I use this product in the mornings along with a good cocoa butter based moisturizer at night (I prefer Queen Helene&#x27;s but any will do, I&#x27;m sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also seems to be very good for relieving regular dry patches of skin as well, as I&#x27;ve had really dry elbows my entire life and already the skin is starting to improve there as well... this oil really locks in the moisture, and it&#x27;s not greasy like other oils I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite fond of the scent as well, which is a bit like a soft baby powder smell. I really thought that I wouldn&#x27;t like the scent but it&#x27;s not overpowering at all... it just smells fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this product, I can definitely recommend it to others suffering from KP or dry skin in general. I haven&#x27;t tried it in my bath yet as it recommends for extra moisture, but I&#x27;m excited to give that a try as well. This is a steal for how well it works... this company certainly has a dedicated customer in me now!</li>
            <li> I loved this product for like the first 3 years of my locs. I only stopped using it because I got tired of the smell. (Baby Oil was great for a while, but after 3 years it got real old.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an awesome product. I still use it on DH&#x27;s hair. I got mine at Walmart and it was round $1.87 there. :)</li>
            <li> The product came on time the product was and is good for the skin because it is absorbed into the skin I also find the smell of the product refreshing it is also good for any type of skin</li>
            <li> I decided to take a youtube suggestion and get this for my locks and they are growing so fast and so beautiful, the seller of this item is very nice, and prompt in service.</li>
            <li> I was at target cruising the black hair isle like i always do, idk why i never notice this before. it was only $1.97, Whatttt.... you already know, I scooped that up real quik ;). anywhoo i got this for my hair, but when i smelled it, it smelled like baby oil. I dont have a problem with baby oil AT ALL, luv the smell been using it since i was a child, still do. But i dont want  my hair smelling like that, idk i think hair &amp; body should smell different imo. So needless to say used it for my skin, and this stuff is THEEE TRUTH!!!! i dont have any skin issues or anything, but this makes me feel Soooooo So Soooooo Soft&amp;Smooth. Im definitely adding this to my lil routine. Everybody needs a bottle of this. Try It !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this in Walmart about 5 yrs ago and decided to try it since it   had all natural oils. Plus it was a great price.    I am white and have never used it on my hair, only my skin.   I love the smell, I disagree that it smells like baby oil, and   love the way it makes my skin so soft.   I have been using it on my face for a few yrs now and many people have   been asking what i use, since I dont have any wrinkles at the age of 48.  This oil is just awesome !</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I use this as a  mositurizer for my loc&#x27;s. I have been dealing with dry and brittle loc&#x27;s and Africas Best Ultimate Herbal Oil has really helped with the dryness. I would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to grow healthy loc&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For the price; it was a good size. It was delivered on time. It does have a strong smell to it but it really does a good job for massages.</li>
            <li> I read some comments of some people who purchased this product. Yes I agree, it does makes wonders. Some may not satisfied or about the smell, but the way I analyzed what&#x27;s been said, they probably applied it once (give it a try for 5-10 days) and then made comments afterwards. For hair, I recommend applying it like 10 minutes or so then shampoo it on any shampoo you want....i use light shampoos. I noticed improvements on my scalp (seborrheic dermatitis) and hair darkens from graying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mention some ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil is rich, warm and less nutty.  It’s not very oily either.  Like olive oil it also penetrates the hair shaft and skin nicely but it adds something more.  It adds strength to the strands, a nice layer of protection, like a bonding action to the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil has always been known to grow the hair but few people know why it works.  Castor oil has properties which stimulates cellular action when it gets unto your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like castor oil, the sweet almond oil is a hair and scalp stimulator. Its very good for balding spot. It&#x27;s the #1 oil product use by massage therapist as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is great for dry and damaged hair. For people who uses frequent blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Virgin Olive oil (evoo) is a miracle oil.  Its filled with all sort of vitamins that nourish the body as well as the hair, superb penetrating qualities, a strong level of elasticity and this oil does this very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ingredient that is not present is tea tree oil. For people who suffers from dandruff...but the ingredients of this product alone will do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It works well to seal in moisture in my hair and it works well at moisturizing my skin.  I have actually started using it instead of lotion on my skin. Even better, it is cheap! I have even stopped using it on my hair.  I recently melted some shea butter in it for more moisture.  It is an all purpose personal care oil for someone on  a budget! Unlike some of the more expensive oils this does not contain Petrolatum!</li>
            <li> Great Seller the Item was as promised. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
