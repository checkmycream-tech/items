            <li>Satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean, maintain, install, adjust and wear.  </li>
            <li>nasal pillow is the most comfortable air flow device that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The pillows fit easily into my nostrils and for the most part are comfortable and stable.  </li>
            <li>so happy we were able to buy was we needed for my husbands sleep machine without going through a medical device company</li>
            <li>Fine product, works for me.</li>
            <li>They work and they were fairly cheap.  </li>
            <li>ResMed didn&#x27;t fit in my tube.  </li>
            <li>Please make sure you are ordering the right size.</li>
            <li>whats to be said it works as it should couldn&#x27;t tell any difference from the original nose piece.</li>
            <li>I find it easy to turn over with and find that it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to seal any leaks that may occur.</li>
            <li>What can one say about a nasal pillow, except that this one works about as well as one could reasonably expect, and is comfortable. .</li>
            <li>and I like it very much too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One came with my CPAP, and I found that it worked very well.</li>
            <li>this is the real thing, not an after-market copy.  </li>
            <li>(She likes it so much</li>
            <li>Now all I need is a new hose and form for the nose pillows!</li>
            <li>Over the years I have worn out several and always go back for more.</li>
            <li>The headgear stability arms cause fewer marks and indentations on one’s cheeks than a more traditional larger mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out my wife&#x27;s older nasal pillow.......</li>
            <li>So far, this is the most comfortable nasal pillow I have found including two previous models of the Swift line.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note that with some careful shopping I can purchase most of my CPAP supplies out of pocket for less than the respiratory supply company was charging me for the co-pay alone.</li>
            <li>It was a brand new replacement part in sealed package.</li>
            <li>, she ordered a new one)...</li>
            <li>However, once one learns how to adjust the rotating barrel for different sleep positions it works very well to complete the seal.  </li>
            <li>Replacement for old part.</li>
            <li>The pillows last for me, but the chamber on the humidifier breaks right on schedule in the same place every three months.  </li>
            <li>The smaller tube that connects to the pillow easily fits into the larger tube that comes with my Respironics and seems to perform as well, if not better than the TrueBlue mask that came with my Respironics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly, well packed, as described, first rate in every way, not a cheap foreign made knock off, the real thing.</li>

            <li> This product is identical to my Original Equipment and it working great.  My original was getting hard and beginning to get uncomfortable.  This was a great replacement.</li>
            <li> Does was it is supposed to. Arrived undamaged in time.</li>
            <li> I like my Resmed cpap and it&#x27;s various components.  They work well.  But I vote with one reviewer who wonders why the company cannot manufacture parts that last longer.  The pillows last for me, but the chamber on the humidifier breaks right on schedule in the same place every three months.  I set my watch by it.  I read they voted their board of directors a big raise a couple of years ago....well, call me a skeptic...but....</li>
            <li> Been using these for years with my Swift Lite head gear. Excellent quality and comfort.</li>
            <li> ResMed didn&#x27;t fit in my tube.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this is the real thing, not an after-market copy.  I still don&#x27;t know why the company &amp;#34;can&#x27;t&amp;#34; manufacture them so that they will last longer than one month, though.  Please make sure you are ordering the right size.</li>
            <li> Replacement for old part.</li>
            <li> This is a hard review to write as who wants to wear a CPAP?  I have to wear one so here are my thoughts about the ResMed Swift LT for Her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nasal pillow is the most comfortable air flow device that I have tried.  The full mask was uncomfortable and cumbersome for me.  It gave me claustrophobia.  I could not get used to it.  There is no forehead support on the Swift LT mask.  The headgear stability arms cause fewer marks and indentations on one’s cheeks than a more traditional larger mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to learn how to position the nasal pillow it so that it seals properly. However, once one learns how to adjust the rotating barrel for different sleep positions it works very well to complete the seal.  This is the quietest system that I have found.  I can wear the headgear over or under my hair.  An oxygen link can also be attached to the CPAP.</li>
            <li> I have worn this type of pillow for years.  They have a good fit and very comfortable to wear. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out my wife&#x27;s older nasal pillow.......(She likes it so much, she ordered a new one)...and I like it very much too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean, maintain, install, adjust and wear.  Although I&#x27;ve only been on my CPAP for several months now, I like this design and it&#x27;s compatiblilty with my Respironics outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pillows fit easily into my nostrils and for the most part are comfortable and stable.  I find it easy to turn over with and find that it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to seal any leaks that may occur. The smaller tube that connects to the pillow easily fits into the larger tube that comes with my Respironics and seems to perform as well, if not better than the TrueBlue mask that came with my Respironics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this nasal pillow to any one currently using a CPAP or anticipating getting one.  A perscription is usually needed, and Medicare will pay 80% of the cost.</li>
            <li> so happy we were able to buy was we needed for my husbands sleep machine without going through a medical device company</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, well packed, as described, first rate in every way, not a cheap foreign made knock off, the real thing.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well in the nose and hard to keep on. Hard to connect to Head gear  &amp; uncomfortable .</li>
            <li> Fine product, works for me.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed.  This was not the Stay away.nose pillow I ordered, and when I asked for a return I was told.......nothing for two weeks then No.  The package was not opened.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble figuring out sizing, and they were stellar at helping me. Great people, and a great product!</li>
            <li> It is what I ordered and works as intended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy just the size you need, one at a time. So far, this is the most comfortable nasal pillow I have found including two previous models of the Swift line.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note that with some careful shopping I can purchase most of my CPAP supplies out of pocket for less than the respiratory supply company was charging me for the co-pay alone. No wonder insurance is so expensive!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that is very comfortable.  Size does matter though.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thank you</li>
