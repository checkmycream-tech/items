            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Nothing ever worked so great.</li>
            <li>Despite the mirror issue, it&#x27;s a great powder for a good price, and I recommend this compact powder.</li>
            <li>Stay products, so it is truly beloved.  </li>
            <li>But this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice even skin tone without looking like makeup.</li>
            <li>This has good pigment, is finer-grained than most compact powders, and is a fantastic pressed powder for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin tone varies from very light in the winter months to a medium tan in the summer (depending on sun exposure).</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is my go to powder.  </li>
            <li>The texture, feel and wear of this powder is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love these compacts because it stays put for hours with no touchups needed and that&#x27;s without foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this pressed powder -</li>
            <li>Best product I have tried in a long time...</li>
            <li>There is no perfumey smell, which is important to me as I am sensitve to many scents.</li>
            <li>The powder is fine.  </li>
            <li>You can control the coverage depending on how much you apply, but it wears nicely all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does not get cakey.</li>
            <li>gives a smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that the newer compacts (seems like this change started in 2011, IF my memory serves me well) -no</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that looks more natural or provides better coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to L&#x27;oreal true match foundation, but I still use this powder, and it matches well with l&#x27;oreal.  </li>
            <li>16 hour promise on the package is nearly true.</li>
            <li>This was a mistake as it was quickly changed but they honored my order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good powder which can last 8h a day,but I was informed that this powder has a high quantity contained plumbum which makes me hesitated by using it.</li>
            <li>Amazing price spent $5.50 for 2.</li>
            <li>And something that would stay on and not rub off on first contact.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the color range could be better.</li>
            <li>: If you have very oily skin, it can cake on the top of powder (simple fix&#x3D; buy extra applicators or clean existing one)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a matte nose!  </li>
            <li>The only light weight foundation I can use always has some sort of moisturizer in it</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t stay and gets an intense shine before that.</li>
            <li>It does apply smooth and gives my face a soft, natural look.</li>
            <li>If you use a fluff brush to apply it, the coverage is light to medium.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll have to use this right after using my facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always looking for new makeup, so</li>
            <li>Received was the new style with 1/2 of a mirror.  </li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the new style.</li>
            <li>First, you open it &amp; have to flip the powder up to get to the pouf.  </li>
            <li>you only want to look in the mirror, you have to open it &amp; flip up the powder, but the pouf flips up on top of the mirror, too, so you have to put it back before using the mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>helps prevent shine better than other more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used, and lasts pretty well throughout my longer days, (although I do blot my face with a tissue as needed and touch up a bit with a brush once or twice during the day/evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>no cakey \\&quot;old lady powder\\</li>
            <li>As far as the powder goes, no problem, just what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This does not cause my naturally sensitive combination/oily skin to break out or get irritated.</li>
            <li>Pictured was the old style case with a full round mirror.  </li>
            <li>: shine free at least 11 hours&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t like it but i don&#x27;t hate it that much. It&#x27;s a bit cakey on my face and the powder is kinda heavy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I always have great luck with Revlon products.  This was no exception.  It is a wonderful product and all of my friends use Revlon&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Color Stay products, so it is truly beloved.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a matte nose!  Amazon&lt;br /&gt;will see that your nose doesn&#x27;t shine for too long!</li>
            <li> My pale daughter wears it daily. It gives a nice even skin tone without looking like makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. I am very fair with combination skin. You can control the coverage depending on how much you apply, but it wears nicely all day and I don&#x27;t need to reapply often. It&#x27;s light and does not get cakey.</li>
            <li> I was looking for another makeup something to go over my face. Something that matched my neck.&lt;br /&gt; I.E. after applying makeup, then wearing a low cut shirt my face would always be darker after my makeup, so I actually had to work my neck and chest to blend in.&lt;br /&gt;Then I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make my face look fake. And something that would stay on and not rub off on first contact. My husband hates me leaning against him when I&#x27;m wearing my makeup because it rubs off on his white shirts.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on reviews. It does apply smooth and gives my face a soft, natural look. And does make my face match my neck. Then I ran a white cloth against my skin and nothing came of. However, you have got to have nearly a perfect face for this. After applying it showed all my dead skin when no other makeup has. So I&#x27;ll have to use this right after using my facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;One star off for the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is my go to powder.  Finding it for a great price on Amazon is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good powder which can last 8h a day,but I was informed that this powder has a high quantity contained plumbum which makes me hesitated by using it.</li>
            <li> The texture, feel and wear of this powder is my favorite. I have been using it for the last 7 years. I haven&#x27;t found anything that looks more natural or provides better coverage.</li>
            <li> Amazing price spent $5.50 for 2. This was a mistake as it was quickly changed but they honored my order.  I love these compacts because it stays put for hours with no touchups needed and that&#x27;s without foundation.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin. I am allergic to creme to powder foundation. Frustrating because all makeup I have to get has to be light weight. The only light weight foundation I can use always has some sort of moisturizer in it so it doesn&#x27;t stay and gets an intense shine before that. This product makes it stay and reduces the shine. Best product I have tried in a long time... and I&#x27;m always looking for new makeup, so I have tried a ton. Nothing ever worked so great. Beyond satisfied!!!!!</li>
            <li> keep it in my purse for touchups</li>
            <li> The item was used and unsanitary. I was deeply shocked! It is totally fraud! I need an explanation for it.</li>
            <li> Love this pressed powder - it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It absorbs oil and mattifies without being cakey. It totally camouflages my pores and stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this in color medium deep to go with my colorstay liquid foundation (colors toast and caramel).  I&#x27;ve since switched to L&#x27;oreal true match foundation, but I still use this powder, and it matches well with l&#x27;oreal.  I try not to waste money on makeup.  So even though the stores will let you return and exchange, I had already used this powder quite a few times before switching to L&#x27;oreal.  Since this powder works with my current foundation, I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I run out.  I doubt I will repurchase though. I will probably just start buying the loreal powder that is meant to go with their foundation.  But this is a good choice.  It lasts a really long time and it sits well on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t look caked on.  The only drawback is the color range could be better.</li>
            <li> Reasons: powder that kept the oil and sweat away during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 16 hour promise on the package is nearly true. It stayed at least 11 hours, but I do have oily skin, so on normal skin, it&#x27;s possible that the 16 hours works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: shine free at least 11 hours&lt;br /&gt;  gives a smooth, poreless look!&lt;br /&gt;  no cakey \\&quot;old lady powder\\&quot; look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you have very oily skin, it can cake on the top of powder (simple fix&#x3D; buy extra applicators or clean existing one)</li>
            <li> As far as the powder goes, no problem, just what I ordered.  But the case it came in is not as pictured.  Pictured was the old style case with a full round mirror.  Received was the new style with 1/2 of a mirror.  I am not a fan of the new style.</li>
            <li> Hate it waste of money makes my face Acy</li>
            <li> Best drug store powder!</li>
            <li> Very good pressed powder.  Not at all dusty or flaky.  Never cracked.</li>
            <li> The powder is fine.  It keeps me non-shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is miserable.  First, you open it &amp; have to flip the powder up to get to the pouf.  Then you have to flip it back down to get some powder.  Then you have to flip it back up to get to the mirror.  Repeat two previous steps until you are done.  Then return pouf &amp; close.  It takes probably 4 times longer to actually apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only want to look in the mirror, you have to open it &amp; flip up the powder, but the pouf flips up on top of the mirror, too, so you have to put it back before using the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;m being petty, but this container is ridiculous.  Do they even test their product before selling it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon ColorStay Pressed Powder with SoftFlex for quite some time now. This does not cause my naturally sensitive combination/oily skin to break out or get irritated. There is no perfumey smell, which is important to me as I am sensitve to many scents. The coverage is medium to heavy-medium, depending on how you apply it. If you use a fluff brush to apply it, the coverage is light to medium. However, if you press it in with the included (flat) puff, your coverage is going to be heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone varies from very light in the winter months to a medium tan in the summer (depending on sun exposure). I have used several shades of this over the years, and have never experienced any orangey/unnatural tones with this product. This has good pigment, is finer-grained than most compact powders, and is a fantastic pressed powder for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears well, is matte, helps prevent shine better than other more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used, and lasts pretty well throughout my longer days, (although I do blot my face with a tissue as needed and touch up a bit with a brush once or twice during the day/evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that the newer compacts (seems like this change started in 2011, IF my memory serves me well) -no longer have the full mirror, just a small sliver of a mirror inside the cover, which is virtually useless. For that reason, I&#x27;m taking a star off an otherwise 5 star product for the price point. Despite the mirror issue, it&#x27;s a great powder for a good price, and I recommend this compact powder.</li>
