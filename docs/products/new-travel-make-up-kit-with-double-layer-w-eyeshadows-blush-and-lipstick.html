            <li> I really like this little kit.</li>
            <li> i really like how its small and got everything in it.</li>
            <li> The black eye pencil is very hard and doesn&#x27;t mark on the skin easily.</li>
            <li> I received this product after a long wait.</li>
            <li> Not too pink or red.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the new travel make up kit.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> The mascara in the kit is dry and it is like a used product.</li>
            <li> was dry as a bone</li>
            <li> Now the bad, the mascara was dry when i got it and the lipstick smelled like very strong crayons.</li>
            <li> but, they didn&#x27;t package it right and half of the containers were broken and makeup everywhere...</li>
            <li> I have this nifty, thrifty little gadget in my purse for emergencies only!</li>
            <li> So it smells a little, big deal.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the refund after i returned but this is a bad experience for me.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out and it&#x27;s a wholleeeee lot smaller than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li> only problem is the eyeliner and mascara were so dried up i can not use them.</li>
            <li> I put \\&quot;Lancome gift purchase\\&quot; in the search and, hidden among all the actual Lancome products, was this little gem.</li>
            <li> and the mascara is an empty tube!</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered this based in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers expect Shiseido for pennies.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money,</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all</li>
            <li> This is not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I salvaged it down to just two that I can&#x27;t give as gifts.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow flakes down your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara was dry and the lipstick smelled old, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t bad especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Price is too less to gift to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you remember the little All-in-One make up kit in ZOOLANDER?  </li>
            <li> When the case was closed, it was not aligned properly &amp; looked like it was almost twisted.</li>
            <li> However, the mascara was completetly dried out and the lipstick was stale and had that musty smell of old make-up.</li>
            <li> Mascara was totally dried out.</li>
            <li> Mascara was dried up.</li>
            <li> Luckily only one blush was broken.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried out and the brush was stuck in the bottle.    </li>
            <li> However, the wand on the mascara arrived broken (the brush was left stuck inside the tube)</li>
            <li> This time, the mascara arrived completely dried up.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed the mascara is dried and the brush is stuck inside....</li>
            <li> The opening screw of the product is missing</li>
            <li> The mascara came all dried out.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them</li>
            <li> To state it plainly...</li>
            <li> The bottles were not full and there was no brush!  </li>
            <li> Not pleased and it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> One of them broke the hinge and it is so small its not repairable.  </li>
            <li> The mascara was dried up and the pencil had been used!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I would re-order.</li>
            <li> so I am not able to close the box at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one small container to save space.</li>
            <li> The mascara was completely dried out &amp; the brush was almost broken in half.</li>

            <li> To state it plainly... This product is not worth the shipping cost. Makeup shades are not as depicted. Mascara was totally dried out. I would not recommend this item</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, And that&#x27;s pretty sad to say since it&#x27;s kinda cheap. The mascara was dried out and it&#x27;s a wholleeeee lot smaller than you&#x27;d imagine. Not pleased and it was a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> A cute set but it arrived in terrible condition. The box looked like it had been opened and everything was covered in a layer of red powder.   Lets just say I am not terribly impressed.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! For the price, it was perfect.  I ordered 4 and gave one to each of my girls for christmas.  One of them broke the hinge and it is so small its not repairable.  The plastic broke but super glue will only keep it shut. The other three are holding up great and being carted around in backpacks to and from school.  Nice small compact size for purse/backpack.</li>
            <li> I bought this has a stocking stuffer &amp; boy am I glad I checked it all out before giving it away! I would have been so embarassed to give this to some one! The mascara was completely dried out &amp; the brush was almost broken in half. The applicators for the eye shadow looked like they were cut from a dishwashing sponge. When the case was closed, it was not aligned properly &amp; looked like it was almost twisted. Would never recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> Ok, well the good stuff first the eye shadows were nice and the blush too. Now the bad, the mascara was dry when i got it and the lipstick smelled like very strong crayons. I was planning on having it in my purse but after i had to through away the two things i bought it for i decided to let my daughter have it for play time.</li>
            <li> NEW Travel Make up kit with Double layer W/ eyeshadows, blush  Arrived with blush broken and all over the compact. The mascara was dried up and the pencil had been used!  Wahta waste of my money and its not even worth shipping back. I wish they woyuld credit me back my money!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the new travel make up kit. The mascara in the kit is dry and it is like a used product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Xmas gift,but after it arrived,I decided to just check it out. The colors are beautiful,but the mascara was totally dried out,the liner had no cap,which in my opinion,is unsanitary,and the lipstick was twisted up into the top of the tube and was squashed horribly. Very disapointed. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This makeup set is wonderful. Convenient and it didn&#x27;t come broken!! It&#x27;s perfect, especially as a gift.  I would definitely buy more. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product was not what my wife was expecting, she is very disapointed.   I would not recommend this product for anyone.   Poor quality.</li>
            <li> When my package arrived and i opened it, the makeup kit was in pieces and the makeup smelled old. Horrible!</li>
            <li> although I wish to get a better quality and cheaper price make up,I disappoint to me, even it made in china.when I get one, it has been broken,</li>
            <li> Yup, just like everyone said. Mascara was dried up. But everything else seemed about right for the price. Not too disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the idea.  The eye color does not offer quite enough variety as they are all too similar.  It really takes some playing with it to get the application to show up too.  Mostly use the blush which is really good.  Tis a great size though and does contain good emergency use.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and It has been the cutest set Ive ever had, will buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I know it is cheap but the quality is very poor, powder all spreaded and a mess. But I did not recommend it, it is possible to find better ones in drugstores.</li>
            <li> The case is nice and compact but the makeup is old... The liner is completely unusable And the lipstick smells old like it&#x27;s been sitting out for awhile</li>
            <li> Despite bad reviews I ordered this needing something small.  The mascara was dry and the lipstick smelled old, but otherwise it wasn&#x27;t bad especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, so when I saw this I had to have it!  Pros: Eyeshadows are pretty, lipstick is pretty, eyeliner is black and about 1 1/2 inches. Blush is also pretty. Comes with a blush brush, shadow applicator and mirror. Fits in purse or pocket just fine!    Cons: The manufacturer does a crappy job of shipping the product safely. I knew as soon as I got my package that either the eyeshadow would be broken or the blushes. Luckily only one blush was broken. I wasn&#x27;t about to fuss and send the item back, considering I only paid $7.95. The mascara was dried out and the brush was stuck in the bottle.    I have this nifty, thrifty little gadget in my purse for emergencies only! I do not recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> The package came broken with powder everywhere. The packaging and product have a mildew odor. I threw it in the trash. It is awful.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to carry to and from gym and our for a fast pickup. Love it. Great to use and throw in your purse. For a quick pickup.</li>
            <li> The compact case is perfect for traveling. Though I was disappointed with the mascara because it was all dried up and broken.</li>
            <li> I stopped carrying my unorganized makeup bag and replaced it with this kit! It has everything I need for touch ups. All I need now is this kit and my foundation, and I have everything I need to makeup my whole face. The colors are very neutral, and work for many skin tones and coloring. I admit, the small brushes aren&#x27;t that good, but they do the job on the go. The kit is nice and sturdy and was shipped to me fast and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a wonderful all-inclusive makeup kit for my purse.  I especially liked that it had a mascara with it.  However, the wand on the mascara arrived broken (the brush was left stuck inside the tube) I liked the kit otherwise.  The eyeshadows were very nice colors (all neutral with some shimmer and some matte.) The lipstick was a nice neutral pinky/brown.  The blushes pull out from the bottom and looked fine, and the included eye pencil was tiny but seemed usable.  So I sent the kit back and reordered.  This time, the mascara arrived completely dried up.  I was very disappointed, since this was the main reason I ordered this kit. I returned it as well and have given up on this item.</li>
            <li> The makeup is decent... but, they didn&#x27;t package it right and half of the containers were broken and makeup everywhere... I salvaged it down to just two that I can&#x27;t give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Nice little travel kit and it lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> The price of this product meets my expectations and the eye shadows wear well.  Not sure if I would re-order.</li>
            <li> This product is very old; smells like it&#x27;s very old and on the first use the applicator crumbled.  The lipstick also was hard, bad smell and I have to recommend never buying this product.</li>
            <li> Love the size of this for travel. It&#x27;s about the size of 2 decks of cards stacked onto one another. However, the mascara was completetly dried out and the lipstick was stale and had that musty smell of old make-up. The colors are great for those with warm tones and all of the shadows and blush arrived without cracks. I&#x27;ll probably replace the lipstick and mascara with my own and use for travel.</li>
            <li> I am not beauty expert. I&#x27;ll write what I saw. Its cheap in price but the product inside is not that cheap looking.... I had ordered 5 and I have noticed the mascara is dried and the brush is stuck inside.... Its not for my use, so I am worried a little about the reaction when I gift it to my friends and relatives :-) At least it does not cost me a fortune.</li>
            <li> All the stuff that i bought to them was broken. Someone can help me to talk with them abou what we could do about this?</li>
            <li> Terrible! Not worth it at all and the mascara is an empty tube! I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Everything rolled into one. Fits in my purse or weekend bag. Love it!!! Now, I just want one with a red lipstick.</li>
            <li> I received this product after a long wait. The mascara was dried up the lipstick was an ugly color the make up seemed old and not properly stored. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea and nice product except the mascara was defective.  The bottles were not full and there was no brush!  Please send me 4 new mascaras and I will love this product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The opening screw of the product is missing so I am not able to close the box at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no time to return this and going to dump that at home.</li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t even get to use this product as it arrived very broken and unusable. I was looking forward to giving it a try but no luck.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have ordered this based in other reviews.  The mascara came all dried out. The lipstick was damaged.  The only product that is out is the eyeshadow. Disappointing because I was going to give it as a gift.  It was cheaper and it would cost me more to return it.</li>
            <li> i really like how its small and got everything in it. only problem is the eyeliner and mascara were so dried up i can not use them. i love the other stuff though and for the price i paid, i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was my second order in Amazon and it was very much disappointing that the product reached in such a worst situation where the lipsticks are broken, the whole box is covered with a black powder(I think they are the eye shade colors that lost their own due to being very old)etc.I would recommend Amazon not to sell this product at all. I was able to get the refund after i returned but this is a bad experience for me.</li>
            <li> This kit is nice and small, and has everything needed for travel, including powder, blush, eyeshadow and lipstick, plus brushes&lt;br /&gt;in one small container to save space.</li>
            <li> The shadows are kind of muddy and the blush is really easy to break the mascara was dry as a bone the lip stick was ok nice concept wish it were executed better</li>
            <li> Price is too less to gift to anyone. Its worth for its price. I bought it along with other makeup items for my relatives and friends and they just loved it having.</li>
            <li> For once, I didn&#x27;t read the reviews. Why? Because I was obviously suffering from brain-disconnect! I put \\&quot;Lancome gift purchase\\&quot; in the search and, hidden among all the actual Lancome products, was this little gem. So I did not read that it was NOT a Lancome product - I thought only that it was being shipped by whoever it is that is selling it and did not read the description thoroughly, nor did I bother to read or even look at the reviews because, after all, it was a Lancome product. Right? WRONG!!! Shame on Amazon for listing it in the Lancome products and double shame on me for being so careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going back to see why I got this product and why it didn&#x27;t say Lancome anywhere, I saw what I had overlooked reading the whole product description and then I read the reviews...If anyone buys this product they are as stupid than I! And a caution to others who, like me, have come to trust and make assumptions about Amazon - while they aren&#x27;t responsible, I&#x27;d suggest they protect their name by filtering out crap products and deceptive sellers - implied or otherwise. Thank goodness this is a $6+ wake-up reminder and didn&#x27;t cost more.</li>
            <li> this is the best travel makeup kit to put in your purse...it is small and compact and the colors are great and everything I wanted. Will buy more for Christmas stockings.</li>
            <li> sometimes in wake late no time to put on my makeup before work, by having this inn my handbag really help. I like to wear neutral color and thats exactly what it has for me with its own mascara and all. I don&#x27;t have to take my  whole makeup case with me and leave in the car I can just have that with me all time</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed when this arrived because it is alot smaller than I expected. But the makeup is of good quality and it arrived undamaged and when promised.</li>
            <li> This is not worth a penny. Tried it once it was old and ugly. The eye shadow flakes down your face.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara was old had to throw it away before using it.&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick was dry and smelt funny.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to give to my sister  but when I get the item I was so disappointed because it seems like USED already. The make up kit is broke since they don&#x27;t put a bubble cellophane on it, the blush on was scattered.. shipment was okay since it got here before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> I really like this little kit. It&#x27;s compact and fun. There&#x27;s not much make up in it, but its good for touch ups.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m Mrs.Rob Rodon btw) I&#x27;ve seen many of these little travel kits and the colors are usually hideous and the case cheaply made. This one is the best I&#x27;ve seen, especially for the price. The case is sturdy and compact and SO tiny... about the size of a deck of cards! The lipstick is a matte crème deep mauve color. Not too pink or red. The shadows are neutral shades browns, grays and white. I had to  give it 4 stars because the mascara and the eye pencil are not so great. The mascara is very sticky and thick..difficult to even get the brush out of the tube. The black eye pencil is very hard and doesn&#x27;t mark on the skin easily. It would be ok for eyebrows though. In the end, I&#x27;m ordering two more in case these are discontinued.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you remember the little All-in-One make up kit in ZOOLANDER?  It was like a Swiss Army Knife?  No?  Oh.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve combed the freaking planet for one and this is only like 7 bucks.  I actually really liked the lipstick, it stains your lips for hours.  So it smells a little, big deal.  The other reviewers expect Shiseido for pennies.  I bought a few of them so when I used it and my sister said, \\&quot;Oh my god, how cool, it&#x27;s like ZOOLANDER\\&quot; I could save her the hassle of stealing it from me.</li>
