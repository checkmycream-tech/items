            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Works well, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>good news</li>
            <li>Good product, but any shampoo that is purple  grabs my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes all the colors blend nicely.</li>
            <li>By far this is the best purple shampoo out there!</li>
            <li>Works great, took all the yellow out and the price is good.</li>
            <li>I love this products ....</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And  </li>
            <li>However, in comparison to Pravana (which I have also given a written review on and purchased here on Amazon), my Number #1 choice is still Pravana; but, I am glad I tried L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I wanted it to go to natural gray - this shampoo gives my hair a beautiful silver look.  </li>
            <li>Most of these shampoos smell like dog shampoo or cheap dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Just nice bright white.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very good, works well, dries hair out a bit, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>a lil bit pricey for the smaller bottle but works great...</li>
            <li>This is a great product just do not expect it to remove your yellow tones or turn your hair platinum.</li>
            <li>Great for blond hair to keep away the yellow.</li>
            <li>So far the color is good</li>
            <li>I have some time, using this shampoo because is excellent  for gray hair, is very easy to get it by this via and is very hard to get by another way.</li>
            <li>specially if you want to take all the brass, orangy out of your hair.....</li>
            <li>and that is probably a good idea for new users until one determines how much the hair absorbs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and the smell isn&#x27;t the best ( in my opinion )</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;M WORTH IT</li>
            <li>But, some additional, specific instructions for use would be nice anyway.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a scent right out of the bottle, but when you rinse your hair, the smell is GONE.</li>
            <li>great shampoo if you have blonde or white hair.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too and left my hair feeling soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise fine on natural silver-white hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I am actually here making another purchase because I am almost out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Imported from France, which accounts for a higher price.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of yellow tints in my hair after bleaching and it sure did help that</li>
            <li>I generally am satisfied with most of my Amazon purchases, but writing a review often seems excessive.</li>
            <li>Hairdresser told me to use this shampoo to avid getting my hair orange.</li>
            <li>Left a good shine on the hair, but only use it once a week because it could give your hair a purple color.</li>
            <li>I have used two or three others first and didn&#x27;t get any results so this one really surprised me!!  </li>
            <li>Good or bad, it is amazing how hair can affect  well-being.</li>
            <li>thanks ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li>It really make  you hair lighter....</li>
            <li>There really are no instructions, just allergy warnings and ingredients.</li>
            <li>It really does take out the brassiness.</li>
            <li>It was really runny and the botle had no seal.</li>
            <li>Just lovely soft white hair.</li>
            <li>I have thrown so many bottles of the other stuff away just because of the smell.</li>
            <li>Deep clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>So that means she really spoke highly of this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer stated that this is the ideal product to transition from bleached blonde to natural grey and it has done exactly that for me.  </li>
            <li>Jermack does the same job at much lower and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, not worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is probably because this is a professional shampoo, and the assumption is that the user is a professional hairstylist who knows what they are doing.</li>
            <li>she used this and it fixed it to the point where she wasn&#x27;t freakin out and lets admit it</li>
            <li>I have natural brown hair, but got some highlights in it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the complete cure.</li>
            <li>However, a little goes a long way, very generous suds, but easily rinseable.</li>
            <li>But its very colorful, I only keep it in wet hair for 2 min.</li>
            <li>(main objective was to eradicate pesky yellowing).</li>
            <li>Not afraid of aging but yellow white hair is gross.</li>
            <li>my hair length was blonde and the new growth</li>
            <li>My natural white hair is brighter since I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It takes a few days of toning and conditioning to get pure white hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It takes a few days of toning and conditioning to get pure white hair.</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s expected but leaves a very blue aftertone.</li>
            <li> It is shockingly purple out of the bottle, but I followed the advice of many who suggested mixing it half/half with shampoo rather than use it full strength</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoos for toning down the brassiness or yellow to my bleached blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Does stain the hands slight blue but washes off.</li>
            <li> slight tinge of silver remains following thorough rinsing.</li>
            <li> However, as white locks are difficult to colour uniformly, it took two washes (spaced by a few days) using a shampoo brush to massage then brush thru hair, to achieve full &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; of tint.</li>
            <li> I have blended platinum highlights with natural grey on a base of light ash brown hair.</li>
            <li> half dull grey - it calmed down the blonde ends and gave life to the new gray coming in.</li>
            <li> And over a few years have tried name brand &amp; obscure products for white hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe too harsh for daily use?</li>
            <li> Which makes me believe that the shampoo I&#x27;ve got is not really Loreal.</li>
            <li> and I have some tips for other users.&lt;br</li>
            <li> read some previous reviews</li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> After a few weeks after bleaching and using a toner, I will start to use a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo on and off to give my hair a silvery highlighted look.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair with highlights and in the past the highlights became orange.</li>
            <li> I am shocked and delighted that it removed nearly all that awful brassiness from my silver/white hair.</li>
            <li> Transitioning from colored hair to silver was hard to manage the brassiness.</li>
            <li> an ever so slight tint, a faint lilac hue (not minding this at all).</li>
            <li> Not the creepy blue/white hair look.  </li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars: IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL DISGUSTING like the other grey/silver shampoos.</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great! although i do have to leave it on for 3 hours for it to work.</li>
            <li> best shampoo I have ever had for hair that has been highlighted or colored</li>
            <li> Works great, took all the yellow out and the price is good. Left a good shine on the hair, but only use it once a week because it could give your hair a purple color.</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> I have some time, using this shampoo because is excellent  for gray hair, is very easy to get it by this via and is very hard to get by another way.</li>
            <li> And over a few years have tried name brand &amp; obscure products for white hair. They have included; shampoos, conditioners and rinses. Some did not work at all (main objective was to eradicate pesky yellowing). Some did a so-so job. NONE met my expectations. Until I came across L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s contender in an Amazon search of products. FINALLY! Got RID of the yellow and imparted (pun unintended!) an ever so slight tint, a faint lilac hue (not minding this at all). However, as white locks are difficult to colour uniformly, it took two washes (spaced by a few days) using a shampoo brush to massage then brush thru hair, to achieve full &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; of tint. My search is O-V-E-R-! I&#x27;m hopeful, after reading this, yours will be too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxy Lilac-Sans-Yellow Gal, Because I&#x27;M WORTH IT</li>
            <li> Very nice but prolonged use makes my scalp itch.  Maybe too harsh for daily use?</li>
            <li> this will make your hair feel like straw, and it will make it smell like something from your grandmother&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li> I love this products .... It really make  you hair lighter.... a lil bit pricey for the smaller bottle but works great...I would recommend this product.... specially if you want to take all the brass, orangy out of your hair.....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am actually here making another purchase because I am almost out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some previous reviews and I have some tips for other users.&lt;br /&gt;1. Use only once or twice a week at the most!&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a regular shampoo AFTER you&#x27;ve washed the purple shampoo out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has awesome results.</li>
            <li> Very good, works well, dries hair out a bit, but that&#x27;s expected. I like the way it removes the yellow tint.</li>
            <li> I have blended platinum highlights with natural grey on a base of light ash brown hair. This shampoo makes all the colors blend nicely. But here&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars: IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL DISGUSTING like the other grey/silver shampoos. I have thrown so many bottles of the other stuff away just because of the smell. Most of these shampoos smell like dog shampoo or cheap dandruff shampoo. This one by L&#x27;Oreal is great. Yes, there is a scent right out of the bottle, but when you rinse your hair, the smell is GONE. The only improvement I&#x27;d like to see is larger print on the bottle for the instructions for use. There really are no instructions, just allergy warnings and ingredients. I know that these toning shampoos are generally left on for 2 or 3 minutes before rinsing, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions (that I could see). This is probably because this is a professional shampoo, and the assumption is that the user is a professional hairstylist who knows what they are doing. But, some additional, specific instructions for use would be nice anyway. Great product though; will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Deep clean feeling.  Also, brightens silver-white hair.</li>
            <li> Imported from France, which accounts for a higher price. However, a little goes a long way, very generous suds, but easily rinseable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have been trying to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; after decades of highlighting my once naturally blonde hair. This shampoo has added shine and glow to the mouse gray and white.  Brighter hair, brighter me. Good or bad, it is amazing how hair can affect  well-being.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, not worth the price. Jermack does the same job at much lower and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It actually leaves my silvery hair glossy, as I did just has a salon gloss treatment. I shampoo in the shower and leave it sit on my hair for a while before I rinse it out. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl when a color stylist BUTCHERED her hair and turned it red! she used this and it fixed it to the point where she wasn&#x27;t freakin out and lets admit it ladies you freak out!!! So that means she really spoke highly of this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way ordered it at 10 pm on a Monday and expressed delivered it to my girlfriends door for $3.99 and it arrived at 1pm the next day!!! Thank you Amazon for making me look like a Hero with this great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flowers and Candy Bahhh!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product just do not expect it to remove your yellow tones or turn your hair platinum. No shampoo can do that no matter what they say. It will brighten your blonde!</li>
            <li> I have natural brown hair, but got some highlights in it. My hair was constantly looking orange (yuck), so a hair stylist recommended me to use this once a week. I found that once a week is not enough, so I use it 2-3 times a week. Make sure you leave it on your hair for about 5 minutes before rinsing. My hair looks blondish after the wash (yei!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Does what&#x27;s expected but leaves a very blue aftertone. It&#x27;s very thick and the smell isn&#x27;t the best ( in my opinion ) It&#x27;s not terrible but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. Transitioning from colored hair to silver was hard to manage the brassiness. This shampoo is the complete cure. Does stain the hands slight blue but washes off. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works well, pleasant fragrance.  Only downside - I have white hair, slight tinge of silver remains following thorough rinsing.</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer stated that this is the ideal product to transition from bleached blonde to natural grey and it has done exactly that for me.  Half my hair length was blonde and the new growth half dull grey - it calmed down the blonde ends and gave life to the new gray coming in. It is shockingly purple out of the bottle, but I followed the advice of many who suggested mixing it half/half with shampoo rather than use it full strength and that is probably a good idea for new users until one determines how much the hair absorbs.  I didn&#x27;t have stained hands or stained sink as some have. Another excellent product from L&#x27;oreal!</li>
            <li> Great for blond hair to keep away the yellow. But its very colorful, I only keep it in wet hair for 2 min. It looks great after.</li>
            <li> Not afraid of aging but yellow white hair is gross. I love this shampoo. Not the creepy blue/white hair look.  Just lovely soft white hair.</li>
            <li> Very expensive but it works! Happy with it!</li>
            <li> By far this is the best purple shampoo out there! I have used two or three others first and didn&#x27;t get any results so this one really surprised me!!  It smells pretty good too and left my hair feeling soft and conditioned.  I had a lot of yellow tints in my hair after bleaching and it sure did help that and it also made my hair shiny!</li>
            <li> I generally am satisfied with most of my Amazon purchases, but writing a review often seems excessive. But this.....This Product gets one. I got it yesterday and used it last night. I am shocked and delighted that it removed nearly all that awful brassiness from my silver/white hair. I Love It. Simple dimple.</li>
            <li> this shampoo enhances the beauty of blonde hair. My locks are beautiful, platinum. I use once a week and my hair is shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product smells and looks just like the nexxus silverfox shampoo that was discontinued. I will purchase this product again and I recommend it. I just bleached my hair again and it still had some yellow tones. It takes a few days of toning and conditioning to get pure white hair.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t assume this one is compatible with  L&#x27;Oreal silver hair color (dye) (Redken EQ line is owned by them) - it&#x27;s not. Should not have used the two together: created a &#x27;bronze&#x27; metal look. good news it&#x27;s only shampoo! should wash out after several times.&lt;br /&gt; Otherwise fine on natural silver-white hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent ! I louve it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just what i nedeed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I Will buy more in the future!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And  my hair stay beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> It really does take out the brassiness. I use it about once a week or so, just to refresh. I&#x27;ve post-forty hair, and this doesn&#x27;t wreck the texture, either.</li>
            <li> Very nice. My natural white hair is brighter since I started using this shampoo. I use it every 4th wash, so I don&#x27;t get any blue tint in my hair at all. Just nice bright white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoos for toning down the brassiness or yellow to my bleached blonde hair. After a few weeks after bleaching and using a toner, I will start to use a &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo on and off to give my hair a silvery highlighted look. However, in comparison to Pravana (which I have also given a written review on and purchased here on Amazon), my Number #1 choice is still Pravana; but, I am glad I tried L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Hairdresser told me to use this shampoo to avid getting my hair orange. I have dark hair with highlights and in the past the highlights became orange. So far the color is good</li>
            <li> great shampoo if you have blonde or white hair. Keeps hair from turning yellow..Love it</li>
            <li> Good product, but any shampoo that is purple  grabs my hair. any leaves the purple after math</li>
            <li> Seems to take out the yellow without leaving purple tinge.</li>
            <li> I was have problems with my hair having a yellowish and orange look to it.  I wanted it to go to natural gray - this shampoo gives my hair a beautiful silver look.  I am very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like Loreal products. It was really runny and the botle had no seal. Which makes me believe that the shampoo I&#x27;ve got is not really Loreal.</li>
